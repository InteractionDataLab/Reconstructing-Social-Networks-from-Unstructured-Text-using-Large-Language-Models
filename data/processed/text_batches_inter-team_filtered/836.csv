Ethics
The international competition iGEM gathers each year together more and more teams (110 teams for the 2009 session) added to 18 Europeans programs, 70 industries, 10000 laboratories in the world which have all the same common objective: the construction of living systems, following the assembly principle of functional modules.
The emergence and the fast development of this discipline require reflection, to put a regulation system in place ready in the next 5 to 10 years for safe practices.
Thus at the occasion of the iGEM concourse, we realized this debate to think about ethic stake linked to synthetic biology.

We localized contraceptive production because we were informed that drugstores and hospitals are far away for women in rural areas. We will use discreet packaging for our product because several women are worried about being seen using birth control in stigmatized areas. We are also researching ways to get our product to market in several countries by collaborating with Family Planning 2020 and Population Council. Given that our yeast needs a food source, we collaborated with the ITESG research team and engineered our yeast to survive off upcycled dairy waste. Through our conversations, we determined that women even in rural areas have high accessibility to milk-producing animals, which makes our milk-surviving yeast plausible for most areas worldwide.
The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who made this project possible, especially those described above. Thank you to every individual who participated in our human practices research by answering our questionnaire as well as those who allowed our team members to interview them on such personal matters. Without you, this project wouldn't be what it is today. Thank you!"

For two of our recombinases, we asked Piro Siuti (for PhiC31) and Jérome Bonnet (for Tp901.1) to send us their samples. Information on the parts they sent is available here.
PhiC31
PhiC31 is preceded by a riboregulator whose detailed function is described here .
Description
Isolated from the bacteriophage PhiC31, the PhiC31 integrase (frequently also written as: ΦC31 integrase) encodes a serine-type recombinase that mediates the sequence-specific recombination between two different attachment sites, called attB and attP, which share a 3 bp central region, where the crossover occurs (Thorpe et al., 2000). Because the two sites recognized by the PhiC31 integrase differ and the recombination event leads to two different sites (attR and attL), PhiC31 based switch is unidirectional and definitive, except if the required excisionase factor is present. Recombination occurs irrespective of whether the substrate is supercoiled or linear, and does not require anything more than the integrase and attB, attP sites . ("

On Tuesday, the grids were imaged on the electron microscope. The film has not yet been developed, but the preliminary results were not what we were expecting in that we saw no giant phage in either sample. We will post images of the actual electron micrographs when they have been developed and scanned.

Today we received our kit containing E. coli B, T1, T2, and T3. We streaked out some of the E. coli B on an LB plate in preparation to grow it in a flask and archive it in the freezer.
Today we wanted to see if we can transfer our current experiment from using E. coli W3110 as the host to E. coli B as the host. We set up multiple experiments.
1. We spot tested the following phage samples on W3110 and B: T1, T2, T3, T4Do stock, T4 mutated stock, T4-UV one-plaque plate harvest, T4-UV-mutated one-plaque plate harvest.
2. We did a dilution series on the T1 stock to see how concentrated it is. We will need to know the PFUs in order to grow a successful liquid culture and mass produce it for our large phage amplification procedure.
3. We also infected two samples of E. coli B, each with 10 uL of 10^-6 T4Do to observe plaque formation.
We archived two cryo-tubes of E. coli B by mixing 600 uL each of overnight E. coli B and 40% gly"
XMU-China,2011,Team:XMU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html,", 5 members of iGEM Team XMU-China took part in the 2011 iGEM China Meetup at USTC, Hefei. Our team member Xin Wu made a presentation of our project this year and talked about ideas relating to biosafety and team management. This meetup was such a success that we made many friends and helped each other in projects.
HELP ANOTHER iGEM TEAM
On August 30, the iGEM team of Wageningen sent us an email for help. They had developed a software tool for optimizing cloning strategies and we helped them testing their software tool by offering them the data of our new Biobrick part BBa_K658001 and the number of its cloning rounds. They soon wrote back to us saying that the prediction of their software tool met the result of our real cloning rounds quite well.
Meanwhile, we have got kindly help from iGEM Team USTC-China, iGEM Team WHU-China and iGEM Team Tsinghua, especially from Zhen Wang, the former iGEM Team member of USTC-software.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence.
Adjusting an in vitro transcription to its optimal conditions is usually connected to big efforts. The efficiency and the final RNA yield of each transcription depend on the applied buffer conditions, polymerase as well as DNA template. In our project several RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription. However, we could not achieve high efficiency for some constructs such as the “substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme”. To show the general applicability of our Spinach/Malachite green system to optimize transcription conditions in the shortest time possible, we tested different buffers systems first (Fig. 10). Especially buffers are known to have a huge influence on the activity of the polymerase which can probably improve the transcription of the DNA template “substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme”.
For the buffer screen we applied six different buffer systems: Three transcription buffers pH 8.1 with different spermidine concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 10 mM, Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.1, HEPES buffer pH 7.5 (similar to the renaturing buffer) and a buffer including BSA pH 8.1. All buffers were analyzed using the same conditions as described in previous assays. As DNA template we applied the Malachite Green Aptamer with T7 promotor. Using our fluorescent read out system we can determine different transcription efficiencies. In presence of the HEPES buffer no increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence signal was monitored (Fig. 10A). Furthermore the signal of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 stays also at the same level as the blank. The BSA buffer and the Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 10B) show a decrease of Spinach2 fluorescence and an increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer signal. The transcription buffer (1 mM and 10 mM) shows the highest slope of Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence and the fastest decrease of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 fluorescence (Fig. 10C). Thus we can detect huge differences in the transcription by applying our Spinach/Malachite Green set up. In addition we tested DNA template “substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme”, which was difficult to transcribe (Fig. 11).
Fig.11. Monitoring of the ATP consumption and RNA synthesis of difficult transcription templates.

Using our fluorescent tool box we can demonstrate again that substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme causes problems during transcription. We can identify a slight decrease of Spinach fluorescence and increase in the Malachite Green signal.

But since it’s non coding it’s naturally more unstable. o Normally stem loops will be sufficient to keep the ends safe. o The stem loops that will dock the PUFs need to be oriented correctly. They need to be pointing together, not apart. Can make scaffolds in parallel and test them, but should start by using folding software. There is RNA software that can predict hairpin structures, but not loops. And they only give predictions. Look at mfold. It’s on a web server. It doesn’t give one structure, it gives several and ranks them by free energies.  Also consider introducing PUF binding sites in the middle of the gene. o Look into strains without RNA endonucleases. - Find a 2 step color changing process to use as the cascade o Could look into pigmented e. coli, but really should look at the Slovenia project (even though they used zinc fingers instead of PUF and zinc fingers are much bigger). - Still work on PHAT, it’s our ‘future’ application. - If we get all that done, then put the PHAT project on the RNA scaffold. - Finish characterizing the Washington biofuel project. Future questions - Does PUF work in E. coli? It’s expressed but does it bind? - What 2 enzyme system will we use? Does it work in E. Coli without PUF? Does it work when tethered to PUF? (Hopefully will be color change). - Have other iGEM teams done mRNA scaffolding? How is the old work division changing? - PUF proof of concept: We can make it simpler, and just do as much as necessary. Don’t worry about making the whole repression system. Just do with YFP for yes or no. Angela and Isiah will continue with the proof of concept. - Uros, Asha, Anthony, and Adi will begin working on the RNA scaffolding. - PHAT group: Will take yeast biobricks and put them in E. Coli. Everyone’s Homework: - Read up on iGEM 2010 Slovenia - Pamela Silver Paper about RNA scaffolds. (is from Harvard) - By next Friday, have constructs done. THE NEW WORKING PLAN - Biobrick PUF o YFP proof of concept. The control for this has the same number of base"

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," and talk about how such an achievement was attained. It all started with the chemical synthesis of DNA fragments of 1078 base pairs. These cassettes each had overlaps of 80 base pairs, which allowed them to be recombined in yeast. 10 of these cassettes were recombined into 10kb cassettes of DNA, which were then recombined again into 100kb pieces that could be used to create the final synthetic genome of mycroplasma myocides which is 1.08 million basepairs long. Venter and his team also included what are called “watermarks” in the genome which are sequences that allow us to differentiate this synthetic genome, from the naturally occurring genome. But what’d they do next with the genome?
Dev: Well, M. mycoide genomes were transplanted into restriction-minus  Mycoplasma capricolum recipient cells. These cells, containing only the synthetic genome that they had created, were able to self-replicate.
Alex: This Sounds like great news! Craig Venter and his team has proven that we are able to create life, Imagine the possibilities. We could potentially create organisms which we have never before observed.
Dev: Well I for one think “We're all doomed! Doooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeddd!!!”
Alex: Wow Really? Why?
Dev: To be honest I don’t really think we’re all doomed, but that is a comment taken from a story in the guardian in which many of the reader’s voice concerns about synthetic life, and show that there is a lot of fear taken from news of this achievement. Another commenter, posting under the name CruyffTurn had a concern when he read that the synthetic organism had included watermarks so that we can keep track of it. He said: “So, what you really mean if the organism somehow manages to escape in to the environment, subsequently mutating in to some evil virulent pathogen, killing billions, we can be safe in the knowledge that we will know where it came from. Amazing piece of scientific work though.”
Alex: Well do you think that there’s a possibility that this synthetic mycroplasma myocide will mutate into a some sort of superbug that will kill billions?
Dev: I’m actually not that concerned. What people need to understand is that the bug that Craig Venter synthesized is essentially the same as a bug that came to us naturally, through Darwinian evolution. The DNA is fully synthetic, but the sequence itself is natural, and so is the cell in which they inserted the genome so that it"

Establishing Our Market
A significant market opportunity for a biosensor exists within the regulatory framework established by the Canadian government.  Spot checks are required routinely to ensure areas of the lakes and rivers in Alberta are not being affected by the waste effluent from the oil extraction process. To reach this market, we have developed a technology which provides distinct advantages compared to competitive technologies and have partnered with key industry players.
Our marketing segment of our project has been broken down into two key areas.  A Marketing Analysis to determine the size of the market opportunity that is available and a Marketing Plan to demonstrate our approach to market by engaging our end-users and developing our technology.
Marketing Analysis
Industry Description and Outlook
Figure 1: Overview of the oil extraction process.
The oil and gas market is vast; today's operations in the Alberta Oil Sands produce 1.5 million barrels per day, which is expected to double by 2020. In North America, this market’s growth and increased oil production volumes has led to large increases in the amount of contaminated water that is produced and stored by these operations. During the oil sands extraction processes, water is often used to separate out the oil from the sand. During this process, the water becomes contaminated with fine silts alongside many highly toxic chemicals, making it unsafe to return to the environment. The potential toxicity"

Isolating promoter-less BBa_J33206 in plasmid pSB1A2
The next item on the team's agenda was to digest the BBa_J33206 in plasmid pSB1A2 DNA to such an extent that the original promoter is removed - this is to allow the team to later ligate the cadA promoter region into the BioBrick. This digest would then be run on gel with the backbone fragment excised and eventually cleaned up.
The digest itself involved 10ul of BBa_J33206 (in plasmid pSB1A2) DNA being cut with enzymes ' and '. The total volume of the mixture was 40ul:
10ul of BBa_J33206 DNA
2ul of '
2ul of '
4 ul of Buffer solution
12ul of sterile distilled water
1 hour was given for the digest to take place under 37C incubation in the water bath. After this period was over the 40ul of digest solution was then placed in 0.8% agarose gel and run for only 20 minutes under 60 volts - this is to ensure that the band doesn't run too far.
When we took the gel to the dark room, the gel was exposed to UV light - this made the backbone fragment glow enabling us to cut it out correctly. The gel slice was then placed in an Eppendorf tube for gel extraction tomorrow.
Results
The image above immediately shows the digests have been successful this time - clear bands are present. When the plasmid is linearised twice (once by EcoRI and once by PstI) it can be seen that the bands produced are larger than the size anticipated for the linearised plasmids - the expected size is 3035bp and the band lies just below the 4361bp band produced by the HindIII ladder. This seems to be an erroneous result.
However when both EcoRI and PstI are applied to the DNA the small fragment seems to be a lot shorter than the expected size - the team expects a 936bp fragment whereas the fragment produced rather resembles the 564bp fragment of the HindIII ladder. This is also erroneous!
The reason for the DNA looking like this will be investigated further.

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?
We, the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2015 hereby invite you to our discussion regarding the topic, if and how synthetic biology should influence modern health and life in general.
We have made it our goal to inform society about the possibilities that synthetic biology has to offer for modern medicine. In order to give a stage for the questions this might raise, we organised a discussion about the topic 'Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?' (german: 'Synthetische Biologie - Bausteine für ein gesundes Leben?'). We invited multiple representatives of different fields of todays society to discuss about that. Amongst them are doctors, politicians, scientists, philosophers ... and YOU! .
In windows below you can on the one hand watch a life stream of our discussion - translated into english in realtime and contribute to our discussion by asking questions via Twitter. In order to do so, you just need to tweet your questions with the hashtag '#askigemheidelberg' and they will show up for us. As members of the team will be moderating the evening, we'll try to forward your questions to our speakers, so you can have them answered. In case we won't be able to answer your questions live, we'll answer them later on via text.
Life Stream of the Discussion
For the wiki freeze we had to remove the player for the stream as it was using Flash and our Twitter life feed as it loads data from an external source.

Figure 21. Comparison of In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity         In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and  K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to in data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the more substrate nucleotides it converts to product nucleotides. Because product and reference nucleotides can both be incorporated into the DNA, lower methylation scores are assigned. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing method and standard sized reactions kinetic measurements (Figure 21) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the in kinetic measurement data perfectly. Except for the mutant R509K, the activity of the each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove that CAT-Seq approach enables to screening the activity of million of enzyme variant sequences and accurately assigns the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.
Ribosome binding site activity sequencing
The constructed Ribosome Binding site library (BBa_B0030, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0034, BBa_K2621038 with a downstream CAT-Seq esterase gene BBa_K2621000) was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was extracted and sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different RBS were filtered and extracted.. The activity collected data was normalized to BBa_B0034 data and is shown in Fig. 22.
Figure 22. Comparison of in bulk and CAT-Seq measured ribosome binding site relative strength.        The catalytic activity of esterase gene, regulated by a library of ribosome binding sites was measured using cell free expression system in bulk or CAT-Seq approach and compared side by side. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.

    Bielefeld-CeBiTec team in iGEM 2014 attempted to construct a metabolic pathway to produce isobutanol in E. coli. We improved upon the project with new isobutanol production module which contains different genes and optimized promoters and RBS. And our metabolic pathway of isobutanol production is constructed in non-model organism Zymomonas mobilis. We intend to construct isobutanol production modules which are not only suitable in Zymomonas mobilis, but also compatible in other microorganisms.

Inspirational Documentary
In order to inspire younger students and pass on our own knowledge and experience on synthetic and biology, we participated in an educational documentary dealing with biomimetics. The documentary dealt with how fascinating nature is and how many great abilities that can be adopted into new applications. Our focus in the documentary was on how nature builds things with identical building blocks - no matter what is build - and how we can apply this concept in building synthetic nature from for example biobricks. We outlined a couple of inspiring examples from previous iGEM projects to illustrate this. i.a. E. glowli from Cambridge 2010 team, where bioluminescence from fireflies have been adopted into E. coli .
The production is organised by the Danish production company Alpha film. The documentary is going to be used in the Danish high school educations throughout many years and has been a great financial investment. Thus, our presentation of synthetic biology will be available to high school students for several years to come. We are very excited about benefitting from a communication media in this way, since a scientific documentary is a different way of teaching students. Other participants in the documentary is a wide range of professors and scientist from DTU.
The documentary is currently in the editing phase, but Alpha film expect it to be published during December 2014, see preview .
ESOF 2014
In the summer of 2014 Copenhagen, as something very exceptional, hosted the Euroscience Open Forum 2014 (ESOF) , which is a huge initiative to raise awareness of science in the public.
An important element of ESOF 2014 was the public outreach programme Science in the City, which took place from June 21 until June 26 2014 in Carlsberg City District, Copenhagen. We participated in Science in the City with a stand to talk with high school students about iGEM and synthetic biology. We chose to use the electric circuits metaphor to illustrate the great potential within synthetic biology. The ESOF event mainly attracted students with an interest within science, and it was therefore a great forum to reach our target group. Many students did not have any knowledge of synthetic biology, but left with excited interest.
Life Science and Beyond Conference
Even though it extends beyond our target group we participated in a student conference at DTU planned to make both bachelor and master students aware of different ways to expand and specialise ones studies to exceed the ordinary study programme.
We created a poster about iGEM and synthetic biology,"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

There the assessment is discussed and we mostly draw a list of questions to the company which they have to answer.             After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken.
But a lot of decisions are made in the EU. I just talked about the national procedure,             that's when a company decides to make an application in only one member state, like for melatonin supplementation.             But for example, Circadin, as a product that is registered in all member states of the European Union, has a centralized procedure.             It means that an application is made in all member states at the same time and an assessment is done by one member state.             They draw out a report which is being discussed on a European level in a specific meeting at the EMA [European Medicines Agency].             A company also has the option to make the applications only in a few member states,             then one member state will make reports which are circulated to the other member states and are asked what they think of the assessments.
Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate,             so they don't interfere. But if the MEB authorized a medicine, could the EMA object to it?
Leon Bongers: Normally the EMA or another member state is not even aware of such a decision.             We issue marketing authorizations to a company. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers             that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Then the member state has the opportunity to refer a commission in Europe,             the CHMP, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.             The CHMP advises the European Commission which can take the final decision on whether a medicinal product can be used for a certain indication.
Katrin: Could you say something about the risks of taking melatonin as a supplement without a physician's advice,             or are there also benefits?
Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example,             the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation.             And I think when you take melatonin in the wrong way or in a wrong time it can also influence your own circadian rhythm. In that way, it can be harmful.
Taking melatonin for a sleep problem might deprive yourself of an effective treatment that a physician could be able to give to you.             Soft measures for"

For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however, is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.
Figure 5: False-positive probability of crRNAs on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Hamburg
iGEM Hamburg is another team whose project’s goal is the fight against antimicrobial resistance, on their case, by developing novel antibiotic compounds capable of dealing with multiresistant bacteria.
It all started with a series of preliminary conversations prompted by the common goal of our projects and the presence of a former student from Hamburg in our team. During the poster presentation held at our European Meet-up, both of our teams had the chance to get to know each other better and become more familiar with the science to our projects. Ideas ranging from stabilizing the siderophores in Hamburg’s antibiotic with our TDPs, to detecting a carbapenem-resistant strain with our device and eliminating it with Hamburg’s antibiotic turned into proposals.
Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned could be carried out due to time constraints and the prerequisite of our projects being in a stage as advanced as to enable the collaborations. Many thanks to iGEM Hamburg for traveling all the way from Hamburg to our European Meet-up to share"

Background
The need for biocontainment
Synthetic biology has the potential for a variety of applications outside the lab. For example, many biosensor and bioremediation systems developed using synthetic biology entail the release of genetically modified organisms into an outdoor environment.
The potential impact of synthetic organisms on the natural environment is difficult to predict. However, as demonstrated by the devastating impact of invasive species on ecosystems around the world today, the introduction of new organisms into the environment poses significant risks. Thus, the development of reliable means of biocontainment will be essential for synthetic biology to be considered safe for routine use.
Conventional genetic safeguards for biocontainment
Many of the biocontainment systems being developed today are genetic safeguards that work by conditionally expressing a gene that leads to the host cell's death (Moe-Behrens et al. 2013). Such systems are called ""kill switch"" systems.
The problem with kill switches
At first glance, the use of kill switches seems to be a simple and effective solution to the problem of biocontainment. However, when considered from an evolutionary perspective, kill switches may not be as effective in practice as they are conceptually. There are two related issues with kill switches: mutation and selection
Mutation
Unfortunately organisms aren't as well behaved as machines. You may have a kill switch set up to contain your synthetic organisms, but chances are, there are going to be some cells that have mutations that break your kill switch. There has been evidence that in many implementations of kill switch systems, a small (but not insignificant) proportion of individuals in a population are able to survive the activation of the kill switch due to spontaneous mutations that render the kill switch ineffective (Knudsen and Karlstrom, 1991). These cells are not going to get killed when you turn on the toxic gene, so they could escape and have negative consequences.
Selection
The other problem with kill-switches is that they actually encourage mutations that inactivate kill switches. Since kill-switches kill off cells that have working kill switches, they impose selective pressure on population to evolve resistance to the kill switch. You're essentially saying to the cells: ""mutate or die"", and the cells that end up mutating are going to be the ones that eventually dominate the population.
A new approach: Plasmid loss genetic safeguard system

Submitted Parts
Fig 1. Our submitted BioBricks consist of three parts: the Degron, the Gal4-VP16 Transcriptional activator, and Gal4-Degron-VP16 complex.
Degron ( BBa_K1408000 )
The Degron is an unstable protein domain that, when fused to a protein, acts as a source of instability. The presence of the Degron leads to degradation of the protein by the cell via ubiquitination. The Degron was obtained from Ben Jester, from the Fields Lab (UW Genome Sciences). This is a new part we are submitting to the registry.
Gal4-VP16 Transcriptional Activator ( BBa_K1408001 )
This part consists of our Gal4-VP16 fusion protein, which is a transcriptional activator. Gal4 protein binds to a Gal1 promoter, while VP16 recruits transcription machinery, promoting transcription to anything under the Gal1 promoter. The two must be co-localized to work as a transcriptional activator.
This transcrptional activator has been previously submitted to the registry ( BBa_K1179014 submitted by the iGEM 2013 MIT team ). However, the part was incomplete compared to ours due to the presence of an illegal restriction site that cut the VP16 gene, rendering it useless. Also, this part had no user data related to it. In order to make the complete part available, together with experimental data related to the part, we decided to ""re-submit"" this part to the registry.
Gal4-Degron-VP16 ( BBa_K1408002 )
This part is a combination of our previous two parts submitted to the registry. By utilizing this system, the relative stabilities of proteins can be compared. A sequence for a protein inserted between the Degron and VP16 will produce a fusion protein which acts as a transcriptional activator for anything under a Gal1 promoter. If the protein inserted is unstable it will be degraded by the cell and"

He offered to contact us to speak with Erica Weinstein Teixeira, she was a student of him, she set up a laboratory and it’s a good bee pathologist. He also offered to contact us with more researchers in his lab in case we needed to.
Detailed Description
P.hD. David de Jong is a professor of genetics and entomology at the University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine (specialist in pathology, biology, and management of Africanised honey bees); he is also technical Editor of an online scientific journal: Genetics and Molecular Research (GMR).
Our team leader, human practices leader, and our ethics, legal and mathematical model representatives were present in this 40-minute call to approach issues regarding their respective divisions. David the Jong is a researcher that has written in many papers we had previously found and read on bees; we thank MVZ Ernesto Tanús for contacting us with him. First off, he was curious if we were planning to test our peptides on the bee larvae or in the colony, so far, the idea was to test them against a bacterium within a culture in the lab, we were working on the time to see if we could test them in vivo on the larvae but we were not quite sure yet. He said that was a good first step and recommend us to emphasize that on our plan.
He was curious whether we know if it is feasible for beekeepers to eventually use our product, if it could be a costly production or if we have an idea of how much these peptides were going to cost in a final presentation. We mentioned him experimental procedures were still missing to solve these issues, like determining how much a bacterium can produce within a particular time and with given resources to give a better approximation of the cost.
He mentioned using AMPs in food for bees was newly and thinks it's feasible for us to test in culture and then determine which combination of AMPs works best to inhibit the bacteria. Before our phone call, we sent him our detailed project description to which he recommended us to add more details on our justification as well as mention the importance of honey, money
involved in its exportation and beekeeping in Mexico. He said we should also emphasize the impact of this diseases on the whole colony and beekeeping, “the larvae are interesting, but not so important concerning the application"".

In the Open Source spirit of iGEM, we will try to make our ideas, the progress of our work and our results as open as possible. This requires honesty about which parts of our project succeeded, which ones yielded ambiguous results and which ideas had to be abandoned. We believe that such transparency will make our project more useful for future iGEM teams and researchers.
Although iGEM takes the form of a competition, all our work is ultimately a collaboration to create a registry that will act as a firm foundation supporting the scientists and engineers of the future.
Therefore, we would love to collaborate with other current iGEM teams working on related projects. If you think parts of our work could be useful to you, please get in contact and we will see how we can help. Conversely, if you have any resources or knowledge that you believe could help us, please let us know!

The seminar started with a marvelous introduction given by Patrick Fischbach. Afterwards, we took advantage of the situation and presented each team’s project, followed by breathtaking discussions facing the difficulties and odds of optogenetic in their project. Introducing the practical handling with optogenetics, Tim Blomeier, who is an advisor of our team, gave a talk about working with optogenetics. With that we imparted all necessary aspects one has to consider when working with optogenetics. Nevertheless nothing is more helpful than practical experience - to attain that, we showed the attendants our laboratory, as well as our hardware and the dark room for optogenetic experiments.      At the end of the day we had a nice barbecue. This comfortable situation offers the possibility for lot of interesting discussions regarding optogenetic, our projects and iGEM itself.
Mentoring iGEM Team Stuttgart
The iGEM team of the University of Stuttgart is the first ever at their university. As we are only the second iGEM team of the Heinrich- Heine- University, Duesseldorf, and joined forces with the University of Cologne, which is completely new to iGEM as well, we still remember how hard it can be to meet the iGEM requirements. We found out that they built their team and contacted them to find out how they were getting started on iGEM. After a few friendly mails we decided to schedule a Skype meeting where we talked about many different kinds of topics. We stayed in touch and helped them as much as we could. Furthermore we invited them to the Synbio Day we organized, not only to get another team on board for our mission, but also to finally meet them in person.
As we also knew that they couldn’t afford to come to Boston with their whole team and we had one redundant registration space due to the absence of one of our members, we decided to give this space to Team Stuttgart . We are very happy that iGEM Stuttgart gladly accepted our offer and we cannot wait to see them again at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Human Practice collaboration with Valencia UPV
iGEM is not just about working in the lab but also about informing the public and discussing their worries. Therefore we participated in the Human Practice collaboration of Valencia UPV .

For our second yeast transformation attempt, we accidentally used less plasmid DNA; we obtained no growth. For our third attempt, we made sure to use the sufficient amount of plasmid DNA and to eliminate the outgrowth step, which was not necessary for leucine-marker selection. This yielded a successful transformation.

Over the weekend our final Y. lipolytica plating showed a large amount of growth, indicating that our old stock was indeed competent. Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by the end of the week. Nanodrop analysis gave the following concentrations of PCR products in the table below.
We also began out first Gibson Assembly experiments with our amplified inserts and linearized plasmid backbone. After this, we used PCR to confirm the presence of our pOPPY_GFP plasmids by using two of our Sanger sequencing primers and running the generated amplicons against a ladder on a 1.5% agarose gel. We also attempted a series of transformations of E. coli using our 5 Gibson Assembly products.
We also sent off our first samples for Sanger sequencing at the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ford Brown 2015 . We used their protocols in the make of PHB and some of their BioBricks. We had trouble with following 2015 UCLA's protocols for producing spider silk. At first we believed we had falsified their method – we certainly believed that we could not corroborate their hypotheses. In the end of the project we found that the things that had gone wrong was not really related to their protocols, but the components we had used in the work. The enzyme we used were of a different type than the one used by 2015 UCLA and our streptavidin beads had run past its expiration date.
This is a great example of there not being a final falsification – there was clearly something wrong with our auxiliary hypotheses. The auxiliary hypotheses were also the first place we started looking when the results did not arrive as planned – so having an overview of them helped us find that the mistakes perhaps were with them and not UCLA's protocols . We also found a mistake in our preliminary purification of PHB. The hypochlorite we used at the first had been stored wrong and the purification became visibly better when we used a different hypochlorite.
Scientific reproduction
Besides using UCLA's protocols , we also tested their BioBricks. We also tested existing BioBricks in the production of PHB. More information on the BioBricks can be found here. Testing existing BioBricks helps other iGEM teams in the coming years, because they will know that the BioBricks have been tested.
Unfortunately, we ran into problems when we tried their protocols for assembly of the silk genes. To do this the restriction sites are a crucial part of the silk gene sequences because they can overlap each other creating desired gene sequences. The genes were designed so that digesting with one enzyme would result in overhangs which would be able ligate.  We tried to follow their protocol on digestion several times, however we did not succeed before we tried to digest for a longer time and at a different temperature. We found out that the enzymes we used were slightly different from the one UCLA used and this was the reason why we were not able to make a successful digestion at first.
According to their wiki, and the uploaded parts ( K1763009 & K1763423 ) in Parts Registry, the genes named MaSp1 AB- and MaSp2 AB core sequence should contain two restriction sites for the enzyme BsaI, but we found, through SnapGene, that the sequences only contained a single restriction site at 108bp. The two genes could not be applied for Iterative Capped Assembly"

If a particle's position go beyond the range of parameter, we will set the parameter on that dimension to the boundary condition and let the sign of velocity on that dimension change meanwhile in order to simulate reflection.
Performance of PSO
In contrast with simulated annealing, another method we used to optimize parameters, PSO performs much better both on the efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, PSO is good at dealing with very large parameters because it is a global optimization algorithm.

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)
A general objective in our modeling process is an exploration of the high-dimensional input variable space as thoroughly as possible for its impact on observable system behavior, often with either optimization in mind or simply for achieving a better understanding of the phenomena involved. Since the system input->output behavior is typically a nonlinear relationship, simple logic suggests that the number of runs could grow exponentially with the number of input variables. However, an emerging family of high dimensional model representation concepts and techniques capable of dealing with such input->output problems in a practical fashion. RS-HDMR is a global sensitivity analysis technique that can decompose the high-dimensional, nonlinear contributions of each parameter to the network properties(represented by their total sensitivity) into a hierarchy of low-dimensional terms. Calculations by RS-HDMR require only the ODE model, an estimate of the initial conditions and an estimate of the dynamic range to explore for each parameter.
Introduction to GSA
What's GSA?
Why GSA?
Theoretical Foundations of GSA
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior. As the impact of the multiple input variables on the output can be independent and cooperative, it is natural to express the model output <math>f(x)</math"

Figure 13
Figure 14: MazEF system
Programmed cell death (PCD) is an active process that results in cell suicide and is an essential mechanism in multicellular organisms. Generally, PCD is required for the elimination of superfluous or potentially harmful cells. In E.coli, there are several toxin-antitoxin systems, including mazEF, chpBIK, relBE, yefM, yoeB. The mazEF is one of the well-studied systems. MazEF system is a toxin-antitoxin system. MazF, which has RNA cleavage ability, is a kind of toxin. MazE, on the other hand, is the antidote of MazF. In the nature, many bacteria will sacrifice themselves and leave nutrition to the left when facing threats from dangerous environment, such as heat, lack of food and so on.
As we all know, the more E.coli, the more biological heat would release. The excessive heat is not good for cells growth. What’s more, the overhigh density of cell is an obstacle for E.coli to produce Secondary metabolites like antibiotics. So we use the PCD device to control the density of cell.
The CI expressed in oscillation device will activate PCD device. Once CI is expressed, the expression of MazE will be inhibited. No more hexamer will be formed, and MazF will show its power and the density of cell will decrease. When the density is too low to activate the system, then there will be no CI. After that, the MazE will be expressed again, and then it becomes a circle (Figure 15).
Figure 15: The program cell death system
In order to test whether this device is work, we use the T7 promoter to control the expression of CI. If the cell density decrease when CI is expressed with induction of T7 promoter, this device is successful (Figure 16).

We acquired similar trend of those curves except one, the ethanol content, which dropped from around 70 hours. Considering the difference between monosaccharide and disaccharide, we suppose that the accumulation of the glucose when making use of cellubiose might be the reason lying beneath. Therefore, we detect the glucose content of the medium after that to validate our assumption.
Figure 1.14 The glucose concentration  change in 140h for recombinant EBY100(CDT-1-GH-1)  and WT EBY100
Figure 1.15 The ethanol concentration  change in 140h for recombinant EBY100(CDT-1-GH-1)  and WT EBY100
The result shows that glucose content in the medium reach a peak at about 40 hours and then decrease rapidly, which is consist with our expectation that the glucose in yeast was transformed gradually into acetic acid. Ethanol might then participate in further metabolic procedure with acetic acid thus was turned into ethyl acetate when glucose accumulates to a particular concentration.
Despite that, we can tell from the distinct difference between cellubiose-consuming strain and negative control that our approach of using yeast to transform Enteromorpha residue into ethanol finally worked!
We successfully confirmed in lab through simulation that our idea has been turn into real-world practice!

MINI-GRE
Circuit construction
To explore the feasibility of MINI-GRE(genetic regulatory elements) by combination of promoters and terminators as we mentioned above, we designed four promoter-terminator pairs, and constructed four different report circuits for them (fig. A)
For circuit 1, we pair promoter CYC1 with terminator CYC1, which are among the most commonly used native promoters and terminators and also have a relative medium strength in yeast.[4] For circuit 2, promoter CYC1 is paired with terminator MINI. The MINIp-CYC1t and MINIp-MINIt, respectively, serves as the chosen pair for circuit 3 and 4.
For convenience, we named the“CYC1p-yECitrine-CYC1t-mStrawberry-CYC1t”as“CC”,“CYC1p-yECitrine-MINIt-mStrawberry-CYC1t”as“CM”,“MINIp-yECitrine-CYC1t-mStrawberry-CYC1t”"

Fig.x
As can be seen the ΔΔCP values of the mRNA of the eMA and scAvidin constructs are with a 1,2 x  106 fold increase for scAvidin and 1.5 x 103 fold increase for eMA, significantly higher than those of the BAP construct. The analysis of the different primer pairs in the two regions of the BAP construct also showed similar values and thus confirms the reliability of the measurement. A difference in CP value is tantamount to relative mRNA differences between cells.
Together with the result that the integration of the constuct into the genome was successful we can conclude that our first assumption, that the missing RFP signal in cells, which were transfected with the BAP construct, is caused by a reduced mRNA stability, is correct.
High resolution imaging using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
As we wanted to obtain high resolution images from the transgenic cells transfected with our modular membrane proteins we contacted one of the experts on electron microscopy in Munich and luckily Prof. em. Dr. Wanner (LMU Munich) agreed to support our project by contributing scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging. Even better suitable for our purpose Prof. Wanner has developed a method in which he can correlate the fluorescence signal of a sample with the high resolution images obtained in SEM. As this kind of sample preparation, sample processing and imaging takes a while, we had to start 2 weeks before wiki freeze and at that point we did not have enough stably integrated T-REx 2cells, yet. Thus we used transient transfected, semi-stable MEXi HEK 293T cells that were pulled down with magnetic beads in order to increase the number of transgenic cells in the preparation and to show the specific binding of the beads to the cells. For this immunoprecipitation we incubated scAvidin-receptor and eMA-receptor cells with biotinylated magnetic beads and on the other side cells transfected with the BAP-receptor together with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. After the immunoprecipitation the cells were washed twice with PBS and it was visible that the portion of transgenic (red fluorescent) cells was largely increased after this procedure.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

2nd BIO.NRW (PhD) Student Convention
The BayArena, © yansfotos.de, BIO.NRW
The iGEM Team Bielefeld was honored with an invitation to the 2nd BIO.NRW (PhD) Student Convention at the BayArena in Leverkusen . The congress gives lifesience (PhD) students the opportunity to meet representatives of industry and academia, get information for career entry as well as improve their soft skills in workshops. Apart from the opportunity to participate in the convention, the role of the iGEM Team Bielefeld was to give a project presentation about iGEM as an example for remarkable scientific dedication during academic studies. The VIP-lounge in the stadium of the national league soccer team Bayer Leverkusen served as the venue for the two day congress.
The Audience, © yansfotos.de, BIO.NRW
The first day began with interesting talks about the perspectives, possibilities and opportunities in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries given by company representatives. One of the highlights was the key note speech “No Limits” by Joey Kelly , a former well known musician and now extreme athlete. The diverting talk showed how you can accomplish your goals with motivation, commitment and persistence. The supporting program featured a stadium tour, dinner and a relaxed evening on the grandstand.
For the 110 participants the second day started with workshops moderated by professionals coaches. The topics were for example improvement of soft skills or project presentation. Furthermore some of our team members took part in a workshop for communicating biotechnology, which has a special relevance for the public relations in our iGEM project. The workshops were all moderated by professionals

Today I transformed and plated our remaining plasmid switches (getting our final parts and constructs into the Registry accepted psB1C3 vector).   I also prepared competent cells containing the I0500-I13504 plasmid in the psB1C3  vector.  These cells were then used to transform malESSDel and malE31SSDel expression constructs from the Betton labs so that we can see if malE31SSDel and malESSDel work the way that we expect them to.  I also transformed the Lethbridge team's construct into these cells in order to assay cytoplasmic protein msfolding.  I also ran gels of my PCRs from yesterday in order to confirm that my construction of I0500-B0034 with the part that we got from Lethbridge was successful as well as to confirm that we were able to get ibpAB into the psBA1C3 vector.
Himika
Today I read the previous inductions of MalE and MalE31 in DegP competent cells. I did 15 different inductions. But after interpreting the results, it seemed like the data is not correct. Therefore I will repeat the experiment. I set up overnight cultures of MalE and MalE31 in DegP cells in order to repeat the experiment.

Luba Prout
BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Luba recently completed a BSc in Chemical and Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. As part of her undergraduate degree, she undertook an experimental research project on directed evolution of XNA ligases and in parallel she also focused on the use of bioinformatics for enzyme engineering. Previously, Luba volunteered and was an intern at a biomedical chemistry lab, gaining experience in organic synthesis and analytical techniques. Her passion for science, synthetic biology and academic scholarship sparked the initiation of the first Birkbeck iGEM team.
Luba’s first degree was in law, yet her strong interest in science has led her to Birkbeck to study for a second degree, whilst taking up a support role at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development / Birkbeck BabyLab. After the spell with BBKiGEM, Luba will start a PhD on the BBSRC LiDO programme at University"

Figure 7. A group photo of Ms Lee, our advisor Prof. Ouyang and our team members.
During our discussion, we reached an agreement. Unlike most universities, high schools in Beijing, or even all over China, are lacking financial support, whether private or public. Thus, we concluded that participation in iGEM HS Division in China would be better if it was government-aided. Therefore we decided to write a report together with Ms. Lee Xuemei to apply for a specific funding for Beijing high school students to participate in the iGEM competition. The report contains surveys of iGEM competition these years, aptitudes and abilities of high school students in Beijing, and a comparison between students in China and the United States; the survey also addresses the importance of exposing ethic issues regarding Synthetic Biology to citizens, such as biosafety and bio-justice. It has been submitted to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education and is waiting for approval.
Guiding High School Students Towards
Future iGEM Contests
After our lectures, we decided to guide students from The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University to participate in the coming iGEM high school competition in 2013. On August 28th, several of our team members again went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University and had a talk with Ms. Shen Jinghong, the Associate Principal of the school, and two other teachers who were interested in iGEM. We also took many photos recording the scene of discussion.
Figure 8. On August 28th, our several team members once again went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University and had a talk with Ms Shen Jinghong, the Associate Principal of the school. (She is on the left)
Due to our excellent job in propagating the concept of iGEM HS division one and a half months beforehand, these students are now extremely motivated to take part in the iGEM competition, fulfilling their utmost potential. We discussed in detail regarding the total number of students participating, the work schedule, and what we are able to do to support them. They were thankful for our efforts and began to consider subsequent issues.

When working together in a large group, particularly on such a large project, it is simply impossible for anyone to maintain an overview over the entire project in real time. That is why it is important to keep protocols of every part of the project, to document every experiment that is performed. This allows each team member to backtrack and to resolve any issues with (or mistakes made in) previous experiments. Countless digestions and hundreds of PCR reaction were done, and the explicit protocols established which setups were effective, and which were not. Our iGEM-team has kept protocols since the dawn of the project, and they have proven to be an invaluable resource, which saved us quite a bit of time. To ensure the consistency of execution, each experiment was done by following one of our Standard Operating Procedures, which can be found under ""SOPs"".

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The project is centered around P. pastoris as an expression system. This species of yeast is regarded as non-pathogenic, ranked in biosafety level 1. The E. coli strains utilized in various laboratory protocols are also ranked as such, and thus the organisms being handled do not represent a direct hazard against researchers or the environment. Even so, the proper precautions are implemented, using standard aseptic practices in the laboratory and specific waste containers for disposed materials. Those organisms conferred with antibiotic resistance for selection of transformants are also stored separately and properly decontaminated by autoclaving. Researchers’ physical integrity is looked after by following standard protective guidelines in the laboratory, including the availability of proper equipment placement to avoid accidents and wearing protective gear at all times. All biological products and processes utilized in the project shouldn’t raise any biosafety concerns.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The parts to be entered this year in the registry by our team pose no safety issues regarding their target gene products. Because of the antibiotic resistance used as a selection marker, proper precautions were implemented. The pUC57 and pPink-HC vectors used in E. coli include the ampicillin resistance gene, which is of standard use in molecular cloning methodologies. The pPICZ A used in E. coli and P. pastoris includes the Zeocin resistance gene, an antibiotic developed for its use in research.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is no local review board in Monterrey specifically devoted to ensuring a correct application of proper biosafety guidelines in laboratories. As a general consideration, the Regulation of the General Health Law on the Provision of Medical Investigation (Reglamento de la Ley General de Salud en Materia de Investigación para la Salud) includes precise technical criteria related to the application of standard procedures, as well as recommendations on ethical principles and safety norms for the handling of substances potentially harmful to humans. This set of norms also establishes certain principles for the regulation of genetically modified organisms, more specifically to those carried out in laboratory spaces.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made"

He said “your new data also have an issue: some of your devices have lower raw fluorescence readings at the hour 6 than at hour 0, even though they grew. Additionally, while within the range, some cells show similar fluorescence to the highest concentration of Fluorescein tested.” On the other hand, our efforts were recognized. He said “however, given the time remaining, your current works and effort on the InterLab would be sufficient for the medal criteria (Bronze criteria #4)”! We also did a reflection on our own experimental results this time and figured out several possibilities: 1) The impurities in the bacterial solution has resulted in the low fluorescence values; 2) The bacterial load during inoculating was too small, resulting in insufficient concentration of bacteria; 3) Possible operational errors due to unskilled experimental techniques, etc. Unfortunately, time is limited on our hands now because our summer vacation is about to end and we have a lot of other experiments that are yet to be done. So, we have to put these possibilities on hold so that we can rule out one by one when we have the time in the future.
With these ups and downs, we have gained a deeper understanding of Interlab and iGEM, as well as the sentence ""measurement is fundamental toeverything we do"". After all, every iGEMer is a seeker of the ultimate and only in this pursuit of the ultimate spirit can we make the iGEM more and more amazing!

BBa_K1033929 – aeBlue
The aeBlue protein is a blue chromoprotein extracted from the basal disk of a beadlet anemone Actinia equine. It was first extracted and characterized by Shkrob et al. 2005 under the name aeCP597 and codon optimised for E. coli by Bioneer Corp. The protein has an absorption maximum at 597nm and a deep blue colour visible to the naked eye. The protein aeBlue has significant sequence homologies with proteins in the GFP family. The coding sequence for this protein was originally submitted to the registry as BBa_K1033916 by the 2012 Uppsala iGEM team.
Design Stage
In order to implement these three chromoprotein variants into the Sensynova platform, designs were made by replacing the sfGFP in the original reporter module with the parts detailed above that were ordered from the iGEM parts registry.
Figure 1: SBOL Visual Detailing Reporter Variants
Using Benchling, virtual digestions of the three chromoproteins and ligations to the part K2205013, the connector 2 receiver module detailed above, were carried out resulting in the three plasmid maps detailed below; parts K2205016, K2205017 and K220518.
Figure 2, 3, and 4: Parts BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205017 and BBa_K2205018 in PSB1C3 (Click for larger images)
Implementation
The chromoproteins aeBlue (BBa_K1033929), amajLime (BBa_K1033915) and spisPink (BBa_K1033925) parts were requested from the iGEM parts registry. Upon arrival, parts were transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colonies were picked and overnight cultures were prepared for miniprepping . Minipreps were digested with XbaI and PstI for BioBrick assembly. The part K2205013 contained in pSB1C3, was digested using SpeI and PstI to allow for the insertion of the chromoproteins directly after the RhI controlled promoter (pRhI) that would trigger transcription of colour proteins in the presence of connector 2 of the Sensynova platform. Stared colonies picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct.

Safety Considerations for the Device
Structure of the Patch
The circular design of the packet containing media and B. subtilis spores encourages equal distribution of liquid pressure around the circumference to prevent the patch from breaking open at the seams. The packets are made of a flexible polyethylene material, which is advantageous for distributing external forces against the patch, such as accidental bumping or squishing. This distribution of pressure prevents the material from rupturing due to accumulated forces along seams or corners.
The fact that our patch is non-invasive and only present in the external part of the body promotes safety better than an implant.
Choosing Patch Materials
All materials used in the patch are chemically and biologically compatible, which decreases the risk of an immune response in the user.
The backing layer of the patch is made up of a strong, flexible, and gas-permeable material. This allows users to move with ease and saves them the worry of the patch tearing apart. This layer also prevents bacteria from escaping.
The size controlling membrane is made up of polymers that prevent bacteria from flowing through the patch, but allow our peptide to pass. The bacteria will not come into contact with the skin, which protects the user from the possibility of infection or immune responses.
The adhesive chosen  to affix the patch to the skin has high oxygen/gas permeability, causes low pain upon removal from sensitive skin, and promotes diffusivity of the drug. The adhesive has been tested by Dow Corning (the company that supplied us the adhesive), and it was found to cause no significant effects on test animals.
The release liner is peeled from the adhesive layer and disposed of when the patch is applied to the skin.
Considering Human Use
Advantages of a Patch
Using a patch is preferable to many other drug delivery systems. A patch gives the user the freedom to continue a course of medications even with an upset stomach, as the drug will not need to go through the digestive system. It is less invasive than an implant or injection, and delivers the therapeutic agent continuously, meaning the dosage is always above the threshold required for a therapeutic effect, and the user does not need to worry about taking their medication at the same time each day.
Possible Problems with the Patch
Accidental breakage of the patch while attached to skin may cause infections if the area is not disinfected properly. The risk is increased"

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#NoteNPH_-_-_TEXT.html,".
The insert and backbone were then ligated using T4 DNA ligase and these parts were used to transform competent E. coli cells.
The cells were then plated on CAM LB agar plates for 20μl and 200μl and were left to grow overnight at 37°C.
For EF Part 1 and 2:
This G-block was brought in as 2 parts because it was too large to synthesize in one part. Both parts had to be inserted into the same backbone.
The 3A assembly method was conducted for this; got as far as the ligation step. The parts were stored for later.
Initially came in to finish performing 3A assembly for the genes HYDEF part 1 and HYDEF part 2. However, when we checked the plates from the previous week, no colonies were present were on the plates.
Because of this we re-performed restriction enzyme digest, however we increased the amount of backbone as we realized we previously had equivalent backbone to insert.
Week 3
(15th - 21st August)
Using the ligated products containing EF part 1 and 2 from the previous week, transformation was performed and the cells were plated.
Growth was only observed in the plates for Fe and D1 (each plate had one colony).
Colony PCR was carried out in order to check if the cells had taken up the correct ligated backbone and insert. This was done by resuspending the colonies in LB CAM stock - half of the liquid was used for PCR and the other half more stock was added and incubated at 37°C to allow the cells to grow.
Restriction digests (using EcoRI) was performed on our ligated parts and a gel was ran to check if the biobricks had been successfully inserted into the plasmid backbone.
Colony PCR products (Fe and D1) and ligated parts digested EcoRI (G, D1, EF and Fe) were run on a gel. From the gel we observed that only Fe had a band at about the right size. We suspected that our ligation step may have been the issue, and realized that our first ligation mix did not have enough insert in the mix.
Fig 1.The gel contains E/P double digested plasmids of Hyd1 and 2 unique Fe gene transformants that are E/P double digested.
After some calculations to find the most suitable insert: backbone ratio, new ligation mixes were made containing 16μl of insert (compared to the 4μl used in the previous reactions).

Regulation
What is it?
Without the approval or clearance by the regulatory agencies, even the most innovative and important breakthrough medical technologies will never reach a patient. Because of the critically important role that the regulatory issues play in the success of a technology, understanding the regulatory landscape is essential, as well as keeping a close relation with the regulatory agencies.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Project Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," genetic modification project, there are many safety considerations to keep in mind. We were interested in the legal safety aspect of our project idea. To learn more about this, we invited Dr. Hans Schrubar, a Commissioner for Biosafety in Bavaria and his colleague Isabel Müller to discuss the safety aspects of our project. They both are responsible for environmental protection and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the district of Oberbayern (“upper Bavaria”), where Munich is located.
First, we explained our project in a small presentation, with a focus on the genotype of our spores, our plans to stop germination, and possible applications inside of and outside of the lab.  In German and European law, there is a differentiation between the (controlled) release of GMOs (e.g. for an experiment) and the placement of GMOs on the market (available to the public). To be realistic, we inquired only about the release of our spores into the environment.
The Commissioner explained that in general, it is not allowed to release GMOs without permission from the ZKBS ( Zentrale Kommission für biologische Sicherheit ; “Central Committee for Biological Safety”). For lab strains such as the Bacillus subtilis strain W168 with which we work, it is easy to get permission for release, because they are unable to survive in normal environments ( §13 Gentechnik Sicherheitsverordung ; §13 “Genetic engineering safety ordinance”). W168 is auxotroph for tryptophan due to a deletion of trpC2 ( Burkholder, Giles (1947) ). We are modifying the W168 strain with “safe plasmids” that integrate into the genome, and genetic elements that are seen as safe, according to the Commissioner. This means that our final strain which will contain a germination stop and spore crust fusion proteins will belong to the class of safe lab strains. The knocking-out of germination genes and the adding of the suicide switch only add double and triple safety layers.
We learned from the Commissioner that at the moment, although there are attempts to develop regulations for the area of synthetic biology, there are as of now no specific laws for synthetic biology. Our spores can be seen as vehicles for DNA and are not GMOs according to the Gentechnik Sicherheitsverordnung (“Genetic engineering safety ordinance”). This ordinance states that GMOs are 1) living organisms and 2) able to transfer their genetic material (actively, e.g. by proliferation). Our SporoBeads do not meet these criteria, because they"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

Antibody production
The current production methods of antibodies involve the use of laboratory animals, by exploiting their immune system's ability to generate antibodies. The current technique, the hybridoma technology, is the most widely used method for producing monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Antibodies are produced by B-lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system Adaptive ImmunityThe part of the immune system that is mediated by lymphocytes and activated by foreign molecules. The difference from this system and the innate system is the ability to develop memory and react at repeated exposure to the same sepcific microbe.. Antibodies are highly specific proteins that remain surface-bound on the B-lymphocyte until it recognizes a foreign molecule like bacterial or viral proteins, generally termed an antigen. An antibody will recognize and bind a specific region of the antigen, called an epitope. Reference: Lubert Stryer JMB, John L. Tymoczko. The Immune System.  Biochemistry. 7 ed: W. H. Freeman and Company; 2012. The antibody will be changed from a surface-bound receptor molecule to a soluble and"

Unfortunately, the synthetic construct did not reach us in time before wiki freeze. W did however manage to confirm the correct functioning of regular Venus protein (although not quantitatively), codon optimised for E. coli (K1093032)
Codon-optimised Venus
We created superfolder BFP, CFP and YFP with the intention of creating a “BiFC Toolbox” for synthetic biology. BiFC (Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation) is a method used to validate and visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells. Fragments of fluorescent proteins are fused to proteins that we study and if they interact, functional fluorescent protein is formed and a fluorescent signal is emitted.  Superfolder proteins are perfect for BiFC system due to their improved stability and relatively fast folding kinetics.
We truncated sfGFP, sfCFP, sfBFP and sfYFP by PCR using specific primers. N-terminal fragment is long (645 bp) and specific to each protein. C-terminal fragment is very short (54 bp) and comes from sfGFP, but we suspect that it would also work well with other fluorescent proteins as well. C-terminus is designed in two variants: m6 and m12 (differing in sensitivity to specificity ratio). Moreover, we attempted to produce BiFC fragments from GFP (E0040), mCherry (J06504) and mOrange (E2050).
We successfully amplificated N-sfBFP, N-sfYFP, N-sfCFP, N-mCherry, C-mCherry and cloned them into pSB1C3 plasmid. We sent those parts to Parts Registry. C-m6 and C-m12 fragments, in part due to their small size, proved to be difficult to clone. Thus, we didn’t manage to submit the DNA samples before the deadline.
To verify the functionality of our BiFC fragments, we decided to use b-Fos and b-Jun proteins, which interact with each other. We planned to fuse b-Jun with N-terminal fragment and b-Fos with C-terminal one. Furthermore, we intended to use b-Fos without leucine zipper (in this form it is not able to interact with b-Jun) as a negative control. For measurements we lysed bacteria expressing either b-Fos and b-Jun fused with part of a fluorescent protein and mixed the lysates. This way we will create not only a wide range of BiFC proteins of different parameters, but also provide systematic and standardized information"

Autonomous cell reporter system for non-invasive real-time blood diagnosis
People around the world are growing awareness to their health condition. To monitor the health condition, a wide range of biomarkers-- special substances in the bloodstream representing the physiological and pathological states-- has been used in clinical   diagnoses1. Blood test is one of the most common way for detecting biomarkers but it suffers from several inevitable drawbacks such as invasiveness, time-consuming procedure, demand for medical staff service, non real-time tracking and so on. These   disadvantages may discourage people from the periodic medical checkup. Indeed, according to a survey (of 1862 samples) pulled by our team, nearly half of the participants took blood test less than once a five-year frequency (Fig. 1), which is impractical   for early detection and early treatment of diseases. In terms of non-invasive real-time health monitoring, great varieties of wearable devices and smartwatches, working as personal daily fitness trackers, have been developed. The global market of wearable   medical devices is estimated to reach $35 billion USD soon. However, most of the current devices are only capable of measuring heart rate, steps taken, calories, quality of sleep and a few other personal metrics. These limited diagnosis information   provided by current devices cannot precisely represent the physiological states relating to many diseases. To address this long-standing worldwide issue, we aim to develop a new tool, a non-invasive or minimally-invasive real-time tracking system for   the level of specific biomarkers in bloodstream.
To achieve the goal, our team proposed Biowatcher, comprising of a bioluminescence-detecting watch (Biowatch) and most importantly engineered reporter cells that enable detection and autonomous report of the level of almost all kinds of biomarkers in   bloodstream. The sensing parts of the reporter cells are powered by nanobodies, the single-domain antibody that can be engineered to detect different biomarkers2. Binding of biomarkers on nanobodies triggers our synthetic gene circuits and in turn induces   autonomous bioluminescent system3 as a readout for wearable devices to detect. Our real-time bioluminescence-detecting watch, Biowatch, will track the level of risk factors by measuring the bioluminescence intensity and record the data as numbers and   graphs."

The use of yeast would also be environment-friendly and acceptable for ethical issues for the reason that the technologies and knowledge about handling yeast have been widely accepted and developed. During the execution of our project, we strictly obeyed the principles and instructions of doing experiments and implemented our design to make sure that we keep everything in order and safe.
We have improved the functions of existing standard BioBrick Parts, entered the information about them in the Registry, created new registry pages for the improved parts and submitted these parts to the iGEM Parts Registry. We constructed and improved standard BioBrick Parts about quorum sensing systems and modified the systems in prokaryotic microorganisms for usage in S. cerevisiae (Yeast). We modified the transcription activator, LuxR (BBa_C0062), by adding nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and Herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain in N-terminus of LuxR, and ligated the sequence of this modified LuxR to downstream of TEF promoter, which is the constitutive promoter in yeast (BBa_K1024000). We also modified the transcriptional regulated promoter in quorum sensing system, Plux promoter (BBa_R0062), by adding cyc100 mini promoter downstream of the Plux promoter (BBa_K1024001).

Interview with Professor Rotimi: Clinical Microbiologist
Generating a deeper understanding of critical world health issues related to SMITe
Professor Vincent O Rotimi, MD, PhD, FRCPath, is a university professor of clinical microbiology at the Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University. He is also a longstanding consultant and Head of the Clinical Microbiology Unit at Kuwait’s largest laboratory in Mubarak Kabeer hospital, and an active researcher who has published numerous papers on microbiology, antibiotic resistance, anaerobic bacteriology, hospital infections and various diseases.
The purpose of the interview was to discuss critical topics regarding antibiotic resistance in Kuwait, how these risks have been realized in hospitalized patients treated, for example, in the intensive care unit, and to discuss the microbiology of chronic diabetic wounds.
The interview concluded with a discussion about how our product SMITe could find its place as a potential therapeutic solution to excessive antibiotic prescriptions for chronic wounds and the adaptations is might require.
Following the interview we reflected on the topics covered and formulated a list of questions we now needed to address in order to make our concept acceptable and useful. This is viewable in our Integrated Human Practices page.
Many thanks to Professor Rotimi for his participation. (Pictured with iGEM team member Betty, below).
*Question: I would like to start by asking a few questions regarding antibiotic and multidrug resistance (MDR) in the local area. This is to give us a brief understanding of antibiotics and the increasing risks of MDR caused by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
Answer: Good morning Bethel. First of all let me define what an antibiotic is. Antibiotics are naturally occurring or semi-synthetic chemical substances that inhibit the growth of bacteria and are used extensively in medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. However, they are not a panacea for every bacterial infection. They are beneficial and in many cases life-saving. Despite these desirable effects, they can unfortunately produce dangerous toxic side-effects. The risk of developing resistance is another serious downside of these wonderful chemical compounds. Methods by which bacteria become resistant to antimicrobial agents include, 1) an alteration in permeability of bacterial cell wall to the"

Introduction
We help USTC Wet Team identify the kinetic parameters in pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP device. The completion of this model are a result of collaboration. With the permission from both teams, we share the source code of this description page together
pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP
Parts:
Reactions and ODE
A Simplified Model
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP. In this system,we assumed the concentration of the LuxR was constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S2-4), (Recation S2-5) and (Recation S2-6) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
From above equations, we can the change of PoPS respond to the AHLin.
For this system, the value of parameter d, 0.00847, could be estimated based on the measurement of the OD. For instance, when the concentration of AHLout was zero, the value of d was 0.00368 per minute. The values of 4.8E-3 per sec for rmG, 1.8E-3 per sec for a and 0.4 per sec for pG were got from the experiment conducted by Barry Canton and Anna Labno in 2004, click here to the details.
Identification Results
With the help of USTC Wet Team , we succeeded to estimate the values of k3, rAHLin, C1, C2, C3 and C4. The simulation results as follows.
Parameters
k3=0.8; rAHL=0.001; C1=1.5*10^(-10); C2=1*10^(10); C3=8*10^(-7); C4=5.8*10^(11)

Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.
Education & Public engagement
A.  Education
    Based on our idea “Science for all”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
B.  Communication with related Companies
    Eager to know market demands and trading policies, as well as solving problems encountered during the experiments, we went to visit several biopharmaceutical companies. In the process of communication with the company's R&D personnel, we first introduced our project and raised our questions, and then they provided us with some suggestions. In short, by communicating with corporates, we have gained a lot and what we learned played an important guiding role in the follow-up experiments.

To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.  In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.   The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

＜A meet-up with a member of University of Manchester＞
On September 10th, we met up with a team member of Manchester team. We mainly discussed differences of GMM legislations between Japan and Europe. We realized that both Japan and Europe have strict legislations of GMOs, but Europe has stricter obligations for companies to label products containing GMOs. We also talked about Japan’s interesting labeling, which many company spontaneously write ‘This product is NOT genetically modified food’ on the package. We also exchanged our information and opinions on the projects and also differences of the environment around the teams and the managements of the teams.

Using previously developed mechanisms, this project will develop a new system capable of detecting a desired analyte, the system will report the concentration of such analyte at a given time lapse with the possibility of setting an instant concentration reading at will. Since most of the mechanisms used are based in detecting arabinose, this project will use arabinose as the measured analyte to avoid unnecessary difficulties.
Our project is a biosensor for arabinose build in an E. coli chassis, it will measure the concentration levels of arabinose by reporting two different fluorescent proteins, GFP for a low concentration level and CFP for a high concentration level.
Based on the work of the Tokyo-NokoGen (2009) project, Chiba University (2010) , UNAM-Genomics México (2010) , British Columbia (2009) , Cambridge (2010) and ITESM campus Monterrey (2010) we fused two ideas: creating a sensor that will measure the concentration level at out command and it will be reset-able. This will allow us to obtain a concentration reading of arabinose whenever we want it, improving the current lock-and-key mechanism. It will also include a master switch mechanism that works with a biological photosensor included in our design. Exposing our bacterial culture to green light will activate this mechanism, switching the biosensor on.
The aim of this project is to design three bimolecular mechanisms that will enable the organism to 1) Detect the presence of a desired analyte (arabinose) and give a color response accordingly to its concentration. 2) Determine the concentration at regular time intervals 3) Respond to a non-chemical signal to give an immediate reading of the concentration.
The results will be obtained by reading the amount of light with a flux-cytometer. This way we will not only obtain a concentration range but a precise concentration reading.
In the future this biosensor will work as a chassis to detect"
BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners. Besides, the red fluorescence intensity increasing rate of fructose group was higher than sucrose group’s, which means that the sweetness of fructose is higher than sucrose’s. This result also conforms to the result measured through people tastes.
In order to confirm this result, we repeated this experiment three times.  The all results showed the similar tendency. These results demonstrate that the system can work as our expectation.
Though the fluorescence intensity is still at a low level, the distinction between each group can be observed obviously. The reason may be that natural signal pathway in yeast can’t adapt well with the human sweet taste receptor. The improvements of this work are continuing. (Fig. 16)
Fig. 16 The schematic diagram of Gα mutation
Summary
1. We had the optimized codon and synthesized human receptor gene T1R2,T1R3 successfully by using OE-PCR.
2.The heterologous receptor was expressed and located on the cell membrane successfully in yeast, which has been confirmed by immunofluorescence.
3.Our system can sense sucrose, fructose as our expectation.

Fig. 17 The red fluorescence intensity of different sweeteners
To confirm whether our yeast can respond to different sweeteners, we selected fructose, sucrose and glycyrrhizic acid as sweetener candidates. The result showed that the red fluorescence intensity sucrose induced was the lowest among these three sweeteners and it was the highest induced by glycyrrhizic acid. It suggested that our engineered yeast system could respond to different sweeteners indeed. More importantly, we found that the fluorescence intensity is positively correlated with sweetness.
Fig. 18 The red fluorescence intensity of different concentrations of glycyrrhizic acid
We also found that fluorescence intensity induced by 1 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid and 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid was greatly increased than the control group. This result showed that when the concentration of the glycyrrhizic acid reached 1 g/L the fluorescence intensity was higher than 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid, which meant that 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid might exceed the detection limit of the system. The result also indicates if sweetness is beyond the detection limit, the result may not be accurate. Just like that, beyond a certain limit, the taste of sweet and the concentration of sweeteners are not positively correlated"
