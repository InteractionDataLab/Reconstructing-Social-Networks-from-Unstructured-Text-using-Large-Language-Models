TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.
Figure 11: False-positive probability of crRNAs on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method, but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Conclusions
We employed a recently proposed kinetic model to assess the reliability of our crRNAs in the Cas13a-mediated detection system. In general, we find the predicted false positive probability (given a positive output) to be low (as low as 1 in billion). Moreover, the simulation unveiled a design flaw in crRNA 5 that prevented us from wasting time on testing it in the lab. Subsequently, we simulated the off-target activity of all our crRNAs on the genomes of relevant organisms: Escherichia coli BL21, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus). As expected, the false positive probability increases for the presence of larger genome sequences being present. We repeated the simulations for parameter that correspond to a higher mismatch tolerance and observed that this resulted in false positive probabilities exceeding 90%. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions. In order to do so, we re-evaluate the model’s assumptions and find that if we incorporate our sample preparation protocol, amplifying and in vitro transcribing the gene, the probability of false positives is reduced accordingly. In addition, we propose a method that allows calculation of the required amplification factor α for achieving a desired reliability in the output.

Comparing these rates reveals that the asRNA construct one reduces the toxin production rate by 79.8% and construct two reduces the toxin production rate by 85.3%.
Cytotoxicity of C. difficile supernatants.The graph shows supernatant cytotoxicity over a period of 120 hours. There is considerably less toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 than by wild type C. difficile.
Rate of toxin production.C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2 exhibit a significantly slower rate of toxin production than wild type C. difficile. Here we see an 80% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 1 and an 85% reduction in the rate of toxin production by C. difficile containing asRNA construct 2.
Conclusion
Our project aimed to show that C. difficile toxin production could be reduced with genetic constructs which could then be incorporated into a phage which targets strains of C. difficile.
The first step toward this end was to characterise a recently discovered phage in terms of its infectivity parameters. Phage phiSBRC was demonstrated to infect the C. difficile SBRC 078 strain effectively with the plaque/burst size assay showing that 33 phage particles are released per C. difficile cell. This result was used as a parameter in our modelling work. Another important parameter needed for the model was the growth rate of C. difficile wild type compared with the C. difficile lysogen in which the phiSBRC phage has integrated into the C. difficile genome. The respective growth rates were calculated by tracking the growth of each culture. It was concluded that there was little difference in the growth rate between C. difficile and the lysogen.
Having demonstrated that phiSBRC would be a suitable phage for infecting toxic C. difficile we next wanted to design a genetic construct which would be capable of suppressing toxin production. The two approaches we considered for this were dCas9 and asRNA. Both of these approaches required the use of strong, constitutive promoters. For this reason the next step for us was to characterise a range of promoters for strength in C. difficile. Whilst achieving this goal we also decided it would be beneficial to attempt to improve the characterisation of existing registry parts by measuring their expression in a novel organism. C. difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic organism with"
IONIS_Paris,2015,Team:IONIS Paris#Project#Optogenetics_-_-_TEXT.html," two (or more) different parts.        Often used to study protein-protein interactions, the protein can not perform its function until the parts are put back together.        For instance, YFP, the yellow-fluorescent protein that we are willing to produce in our engineered bacteria, will only express fluorescence when its two parts will be reunited.
Why did we choose a split-protein?
In normal condition, the production of a protein in response to a stimulus can easily reach several hours due to the many steps required for the protein synthesis.       By using split-proteins, we are taking advantage of the absence of fluorescence when the two parts are apart.        Indeed, the two parts of our split-YFP, when remaining separated, can be produced without being effective.        Therefore, the overall process is far less time-consuming.        However, to implement a light control on the fluorescence activation, a genetic construction gathering the VVD photoreceptor and our split-YFP has to be engineered.
Biomolecular fluorescence complementation
The new alternative approach for the visualization of  protein interactiosn has been developed; the biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) techniques based on the complementation between fragments of fluorescent proteins;  fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) brought together by the association of two interaction partners fused to the fragments.      They noticed that the spectral characteristics of BiFC of YFP were virtually identical to those of intact YFP.(Chang-Deng Hu, 2003)
VVD - Split YFP in our Bioconsole
The initiation of our Bioconsole consists of making visible our bacteria for the player.       In this way, the idea is to induce bacteria fluorescence through light signals.      For this, we have added to each part of the YFP-split the VVD homodimer, so we have a system triggering by light inducing fluorescence ( BBa_K1616001 and BBa_K1616002 ).

Kill switch
What is a kill switch?
A kill switch is a genetically-encoded suicide trigger.       This trigger can be a change in the environment which will make the organism’s life depend on it.        In our project, the change will be the presence or not of light.       That is very interesting as we could create a game over in our Bio Console, once we trigger the bacteria’s death through light.       Moreover, our team is  really concerned about BioSafety.        It is important for us to avoid any possibility of escaping from our microfluidic chip.       The Kill switch would allow"

Why cadmium?
The BacMan project is focused mainly on sequestering the heavy metal cadmium from contaminated soils, however with the many other heavy metals known to contaminate agricultural land, such as Mercury or Arsenic, it is necessary for us to justify our decision.
Exposure
Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metals to which the environment can be exposed.  Smoking is a major source of cadmium exposure to humans, however the main source of contamination to food is the usage of cadmium containing fertilisers and sewage sludge on agricultural land used for crops and vegetables (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
The level of human exposure is dependent on factors such as dietary habits, and contamination of agricultural land. Exposure is significantly higher in China and Japan than in Europe and the US due to the high intake of rice grown on soil contaminated by local polluting industries (Nordberg et al. 2007)  As well as food, water from rivers and wells can also be seriously contaminated. Cadmium is present in most foods however is particularly concentrated in molluscs, crabs and other shellfish, as well as tubular plants and root vegetables; cadmium is also concentrated in offal products such as kidney and liver.
As well as humans, cadmium exposure has implications for other species, with recent studies revealing cadmium exposure has serious effects on embryonic development of grazing animals (Nandi et al. 2009).
Nephrotoxicity
In humans cadmium is nephrotoxic"

They also received information on OSHA and the right to know hazards in the workplace.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?'
Due to the relative simplicity of the biological systems in our project and the benign nature of the fluorescent proteins they produce, we likely do not require any more advanced tools or methods for ensuring biosecurity.  Future work, however, will likely not be so simple - circuits will likely become very complex, and the roles they are supposed to perform will become increasingly important.  If our project had involved making large circuits for biomedical implants or bioremediation, we would have needed more effective tools for circuit analysis, to ensure robustness and to identify chances for failure.  As described by Schmidt (2009), other engineering disciplines have tools, like Event Tree Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis, for exactly this purpose, and perhaps iGEM could require teams to work through some version of them.  This would ensure that team members are engaged in thinking about biosafety, and would likely contribute to their understanding of the circuits they are building as well.

Laws and Regulations
Since our project is based around a probiotic GM yeast that is engineered to combat colorectal cancer there are inevatibly laws which regulate this sort of drug. In this section we aim to give an overview of some of the administrations and agencies that deal with the regulations of GM pharmaceuticals. We also want to highlight some of the interactions we have had with these agencies.
Regulations of GM Drugs
The swedish laws are governed by the general EU-regulations. This means that proper information about any GMO trials performed in sweden must be reported to the EU and fulfill their general criteria. However the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) is the national authority responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sale of drugs and other medicinal products. Their task is to ensure that both the individual patient and healthcare professionals have access to safe and effective medicinal products and that these are used in a rational and cost-effective manner. Even though the MPA has the final say in whether or not a clinical trial is approved there are some other agencies of interest when it comes to the regulation of pharmaceuticals in Sweden.
There is an institution called “Gentekniknämnden” or “the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board”, founded in 1994, that is meant to serve as a connection between researchers and politicians in regards to decision making related to GMO. The board has a consulting role and its goal is to make sure that gene editing techniques are used in a responsible and sustainable way. The board also releases statements about clinical trials related to GMO and is tasked with “spreading information about the advancements in genetic engineering”. The board is made up of two representative people from each of the major swedish political parties (there are currently eight parties in the government) seven experts within ethics and biotechnology and two legal practitioners.

Another institution that deals with these topics is the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics (SMER). It works as an advisory board to the Swedish government and parliament on ethical issues raised by technological and scientific advances in the biomedicine area. They also consist of representatives from all the eight major political"

In-lab produced maltodextrin
Maltodextrins are linear polymers of D-glucose linked by α1-4 glycosidic bonds ranging from degree of polymerization (DP) 2 to 20. They are metabolizable by E. coli but can’t diffuse innately through bacterial membranes if their DP is higher than 3. These two properties were of paramount importance in the first step of our selection process. Indeed, maltodextrins, as the sole carbon source in minimal medium, were only accessible by mutants expressing an ˝open˝ porin phenotype. We particularly focused on obtaining maltodextrins of DP 5, ˝maltopentaose˝ because it best combined selectivity and rapid cell growth in comparison to other oligomers (Marciano et al., 1999 ; Spagnuolo et al., 2010).
Figure 1 : Growth differences exhibited by E. coli expressing wt PIV porin and PIVS324G leaky porin, on different maltodextrins after 36h of incubation at 37°C  (Marciano et al. 1999)
Nonetheless, we quickly faced a determining obstacle: industrial maltopentaose is extremely expensive, easily reaching 1500€/g, and large amounts of it were required. It was inconceivable to allow our whole budget to buy a simple substrate, so we looked for a way to produce it by ourselves. We managed to achieve this by precipitating corn syrup (kindly given by our sponsor Cargill) in ethanol. Another scientific paper (Balto et al., 2015) helped us to establish an efficient purification protocol
Corn syrup contains D-glucose and maltodextrins from DP 2 to more than 9. Our objective here was to remove glucose, maltose and triose, which can diffuse through bacterial membranes, and ideally, fractions of DP higher than 6 that are unable to pass through our porin. This way, we could use the corn syrup fraction of DP 4 to 6, which is assumed to be close enough to industrial hexamaltose composition to achieve our selection goal.
In a few words, we proceeded by"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is an enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. It is quite an essential protein for all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage i.e. only RNA viruses.With a positive sense single-stranded RNA as its genome, Hepatitis C virus is such a virus. The corresponding RdRP is the nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) of the HCV polyprotein. NS5B could not direct RNA synthesis without an RdRP-specific/RNApromoter, which contains a stable secondary structure and a single-stranded sequence that contained at least one 3’cytidylate.This polymerase and its corresponding RNA promoters have actually been used by Warwick in the 2014 iGEM competition.

Cancer Gene Therapy
Gene therapy is the transfer of defined genetic material to specific target cells of a patient for the ultimate purpose of preventing or altering a particular disease state. Since cancer is mediated by somatic aberration in the host genome, it is not difficult to explain the enthusiasm about gene therapy among cancer researchers. It is anticipated that gene therapy will play an important role in future cancer therapy as part of a multimodality treatment, in combination with, or following other forms of cancer therapy. In this year’s iGEM competition, we focus on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the sixth most common cancer and ranks third in cancer-related deaths. Although we have treatments such as transplantation, surgical resection and local ablation for early HCC, problems lie in the lack of donor, postoperative recurrence, etc.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design1_-_-_TEXT.html," secret of the operant behavior and deeply influenced American education at that time. Skinner divided the behaviors into two types: respondent behavior which induced by some known stimulus like Pavlov's dog, and operant behavior caused by a subject itself like Skinner's pigeon. In our life, most behaviors or reflects are operant behaviors and operant reflects, so it’s very important to study the mechanism of Skinner box. It is a shell chamber that is large enough to easily accommodate the animal. (Commonly used model animals include rodents—usually lab rats-pigeons, and primates). An operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal. [12] [13]
There are several manipulandums in the box, which can automatically detect the occurrence of a behavioral response or action. Typical operands for primates and rats are response levers; if the animal presses the lever, the opposite end moves and closes a switch that is monitored by a computer or other programmed devices. When the lever is pressed, food, water, or some other type of reinforcements (a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus.) might be dispensed. In some instances, the floor of the chamber may be electrified. The rats learn to press the lever through several training periods because of awards or punishments. [14]
In our project, we train the transgenic C. elegans and control their behaviors by lights. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference or aversion to specific wavelengths, and the corresponding lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. Those reflects or behaviors are all operant behaviors and operant reflects which can be helpful for a more deep studies concerning nerves and behaviors.
What is Optogenetics?
Optogenetics is a method which uses lights to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, which have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin. Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows us to attain a quick shift between positive and negative reinforcement(a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior). Employing lights as the input signals instead of chemical signals, optogenetics is leading a methods revolution across all fields of science and engineering(""Method of the year"",2010, Nature Methods)"

How BactiFeed Works
Bacteriocins modified to target specific bacteria
From Farm to Fork...
Food security within the agricultural environment is what we are targeting, in particular focusing on bacterial infections within livestock and drug resistance. Food security begins right at the beginning of the production line: at the farm. The industrialisation of animal production was made possible by the availability of antibiotics for livestock and poultry. The livestock must be kept healthy in order to reach food security standards, not only is this important to the agricultural environment but it also means a healthy economy for the farming industry. Antibiotics are currently used in feed to protect livestock from infections as well as to generally boost their growth, however drug resistance is causing large problems and the more antimicrobials are abused the worse the situation gets.
Figure 1. Misuse of antibiotics in livestock can have many downstream effects, including the increased potential of the emergence of resistant human pathogens. Fig from (1)
Discovery of new antibiotics is at an all-time low; it has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotics was last introduced. Only 3 of the 41 antibiotics in development have the potential to act against the majority of the most resistant bacteria.
Our mission is to use synthetic biology in order to solve this problem and to create an array of novel toxins by modularising the architecture of bacteriocins.
Figure 2. Timeline showing the date of discovery of antibiotics and the date of resistance. (2)
We will be focussing on a specific set of bacteriocins known as colicins. Colicins are bacteriocins produced by E. coli and are proteins produced and secreted by bacteria in order to eliminate closely related competitor strains. We aim to generate novel toxins by alternating the cytotoxic domains with different warheads. This gives us the ability to design selective toxic domains targeting only pathogenic strains. This approach has a great advantage over antibiotics, which are often rather non-selective. The livestock produce can now pass the food security standards without impacting global antimicrobial resistance and land safely on the consumer’s fork.

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).

Since we know the concentration at b, namely the MBEC concentration cMBEC we can plug this in in order to obtain a relation that describes the concentration of lysostaphin throughout the entire radius (eq. 13).
A direct relation for the source of lysostaphin Sc can be found, as shown in equation 14. From this relation we can find a value for the production of lysostaphin in mg/m3s. This is not yet the production rate of one single E. coli bacteria. For this we will also be needing the number of cells that were seeded in the experiment.
To determine the number of E. coli bacteria present on the plate, we first need to assume that the E. coli do not proliferate during the experiment, and that the optical density that was measured before applying the cell medium is a proper indication of the amount of cells that are present. Since this might not be the case, we will keep this in mind in later steps of determining the production rate of lysostaphin. For the number of cells at the beginning of the experiment (Nc_init) we can write down equation 15, where the optical density (OD) is multiplied by 3.7E8 (2) in order to the amount of cells in mg-3. The applied cell medium (VP) is used in µl. Because the E. coli will also divide during the plating we will assume that the number of E. coli cells (Ne) will rise to a saturated state at an OD 600 of 8, relates to 0.75E10 cells/ml (3) and that this amount is representable during the entire experiment.
Now there are two ways to determine the production rate of lysostaphin for a single cell. The first one is to use equation 14 and 15 resulting in equation 16, which look rather straightforward, but probably result in low numbers than expected. This is logical because of the low diffusion rate and the fact that we assumed to concentration shape to be constant (steady state situation). In practise both of these assumptions are likely to be wrong due to two reasons. Firstly, after applying a drop of cell medium it is likely that some convection took place and had spread more lysostaphin than you would expect from only diffusion processes. The second one is that this experiment was done overnight (16 hours). For a diffusion constant of 0.78E-10 m2/s (4) and a spatial scale of  centimetres this is too little time for a"

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).

Let’s learn science! Creating a STEM manual
We believe the best way for kids to learn is through hands-on practice. Unfortunately, basic education in Mexico is focused on traditional lectures, where kids are expected to memorize information. In the case of science, elementary school kids rarely get to experiment. We want to change this! This year, alongside iGEM teams from Guadalajara and Chihuahua, we created an experiment manual that mexican schools can incorporate to their class schedules. The experiments cover topics from biology, chemistry and physics, and were created in a way that allows the kid to easily do it at school or home, without laboratory equipment and minimal risks. Each experiment includes critical thinking questions, which should be made by the instructor or parent. Each team of the collaboration visited three schools to try the experiments and ask questions to students and teachers. These were the results we gathered from the experience. Overall, they indicate that our proposal was well-received by the students and professors and has a high chance of being implemented. We also asked local Secretary of Education M. Juan Jaffet Millán Márquez to review our proposal, in the hopes that he’ll add it to the current school curriculum.
POLLS Results
Figure 1. Results obtained from surveys, with a sample of 250 students from three different schools, grades 1 through 6 in the States of México, Chihuahua, and Guadalajara.
From the feedback given to us by the professors, we saw that, if they were to implement the experiment manual, they would do an experimental activity once a week, with a duration of 30 minutes, and they would like the activities to be linked directly to the topics they’ve discussed in class.

Nanjing-China
Lambert iGEM created a lab emoji in collaboration with Team Nanjing. The teams hoped to increase accessibility of science to the community. It was an activity that allowed Lambert iGEM to consider the fun of science rather than always focusing on its serious effects. This mindset set allowed a more relaxed, inviting lab environment and an overall better iGEM experience. Team Nanjing also used our app Color Q, testing and proving its functionality. They gave us great feedback on versatility and accessibility, changes that we took to heart. Here are their results:
Team Nanjing-China shares their results.
Westminster UK
Due to limited resources, the Lambert iGEM team understands the significance of conservation and frugality in the lab. In fact, frugal science remains a foundation of our project. In collaboration with Westminster UK iGEM, the team developed a protocol to recycle spin columns without an autoclave, promoting an easy method of increased conservation in the lab.
Recyling Spin Columns
Store unclean spin columns in 1M HCl solution for 4 hours or overnight (No damage if stored for longer).
Fill each column with 1 ml sterile distilled H2O.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge tubes or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 2-4, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Fill with 1 ml of QBT buffer to rebalance charges.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 6-8, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Data shows that recycled spin columns yield similar results to new spin columns in minipreps.

This event was an amazing thing to do, and we hope it will help to create an “iGEM-supportive” state of mind in our school ! We also hope to have motivated some students to create their own iGEM team next year, so that the iGEM IONIS team can last over time and become bigger and bigger !
iGEM IDF Meetup
The iGEM IDF (Île-de-France) Meetup was a collaboration between iGEM IONIS, iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Evry. It was originally intended to be hosted in La Paillasse, the lab where the iGEM IONIS team is working, and ended up being in the Pasteur campus.
The iGEM IONIS team was in charge of designing the event’s logo, and its members were helping out teams as staff.
6 teams were participating to this meetup, and spent a whole day of fun, with some conferences and project presentations, more in-depth than what has been done during the European Experience. The presentations were also assessed by some professionals and experts with different backgrounds (biology, engineering, design…), who were asking questions and investigating what the teams have been doing over their projects. Their detailed feed-back and reactions were very helpful and allowed us to see the different possible point of views about our projects !
Two conferences were also organized during the afternoon, and presented by two law students in the iGEM Pasteur team. They gave us an introduction of Intellectual Property, and how to manage it into the frame of Open Science. These were really helpful and helped us to have a better understanding of what the iGEM competition was about.
After the conferences all the teams gathered outside to eat, drink and play together during a collaborative picnic. This event was the opportunity to talk with iGEMers from Paris and to exchange tips and advices for the future.
This event, 1 month after the European Experience, was the perfect opportunity to hang out with our fellow iGEMers from all around Ile-de-France, and discover how every team was made, how they were working, and to share a few tips around a good drink ! We had a fantastic day, and everyone was happy in the end. We later met these teams again, (see Festival du Vivant), and it was always some great moments that we spent together !
The smaller amount of people that were at this meetup allowed us to share more with them, and not only did we met fellow iGEMers, but we could also make friends with"
Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#build#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate, fuelled by sunlight. For E. Coli , on the contrary, you needs to grow sugar crops, harvest them, and extract the glucose as a carbon source to grow. Taking the whole process into consideration, cyanobacteria will yield more fumarate per CO 2 . Exploring other options such as these could provide an efficient and possibly cost-effective way to produce the fumarate that would lower methane emissions in cattle.
Conclusions
From this pleasant collaboration, we can conclude that adding fumarate to cattle feed remains a promising strategy to reduce methane emissions, although some hurdles have yet to be taken. Some studies report conflicting results about the effect of the addition of fumarate to cattle feed on methane production. Thereby, the absence of oxygen in cattle rumen opposes challenges for the growth of photoautotrophic organisms and oxidative growth of heterotrophic organisms.
On top of that, the exact yields of the strains developed by iGEM team Amsterdam and the proposed E. Coli mutant in this paper have yet to be defined. Nevertheless, as shown by the UNL iGEM team, methane emissions pose an enormous problem to our world, that need interdisciplinary teams to come up with out of the box-solutions such as these.

Besides, the whole PKS chain includes a Loading Domain on the N-terminus and a TE Domain (thioesterase) on the C-terminus.
From the previous description, we know that each polypeptide chain (DEBS) has two Modules, and each Module includes several domains, which have similar structure and function.
A module contains but not limits to three domains: KS, AT, ACP (please click here to get more information about domain). Each a module can catalyze an extension and the cyclization of a carbon chain [4].
Design:
According to the design of our project PPS, we cannot make sure that we will make each domain as a standard part accurately. Maybe we will make the mistake that the function of some domains lose as we cut some necessary base pairs which we do not know. Therefore, we need to express the whole DEBS in E.coli functionally [5].
We choose PCR amplification to obtain the target gene segments. Base on the data of eryA we get from NCBI (the whole length of eryA is nearly 33kb), we have to use three different plasmids pSB1C3, pSB1A3 and pSB3K3 to carry eryAⅠ(11kb), eryAⅡ(11kb), eryAⅢ(9kb) as the carrying capacity of plasmid is limited.
Later, we will introduce all the three rebuilt plasmids into the host E.coli BAP1 and induce the functional expression of DEBS. If our design is OK, we will get the same product comparing with the experiment group, which uses combined standard domains to synthesize 6dEB.
Operation:
First of all, we find the sequence of eryA gene from NCBI and complete the genome extraction of S.erythraea which will be used as the PCR template.
It seems that we will meet the challenge of PCR amplification for the GC-enriched (≥70%) and large DNA fragment (nearly 11kb).
The first time, we design the primer pairs commonly with RFC 10. Primer STAR [2] & GenSTAR are chosen as the DNA polymerase while 3% DMSO is added to decrease the annealing temperature.
However, we failed on the first try as we only got the 2kb fragment.
We tried again immediately by changing the PCR enzyme and conditions.
We made the length of primer pairs longer to lower the high GC content of eryA. In addition to this, we done explore experiments about different"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Reversion_-_-_TEXT.html," and the calculated difference (blue). The reversion frequency of EP Pol in       JS200 was determined after 0 h and 24 h by plating (red). For calculating the mutation rate via equation one the difference       in mutation frequency was determined (blue). The error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Another observation is the huge variability in the reversion frequency at the starting point. This variability is much lower for     the mutation rate after 24 h. This shows that mutations, which occur early into a mutagenic process, take an overproportional part     of the whole culture. Therefore, exact determination of the mutation rate is only possible by measuring the mutation accumulation     (f2-f1) and not the absolute mutation count (Pope et al. 2008). Using the results from Figure 3 for f2-    f1 = (9.47±2.28)×10-5 and Figure 2 for N0h = 0.1 OD600 and N24h =     2.44 OD600 and a plasmid copy number of 10 (Camps et al. 2003) in equation 2 this cumulates to a mutation rate of
This measures mutation rate is three orders of magnitude over the basal mutation rate of E. coli mutation rate (Lee et al. 2012).     It strongly differs from the rate described by Camps of 8.1×10-4 per bp which converts to 4.8×10-5 per bp     per generation under the assumption that Camps cultivation process involves ~16 generations.
Furthermore, Camps uses a completely different approach in quantifiying the mutagenesis rate by starting from one measurement of the     reversion frequency f and using the plasmid copynumber (10) and reversion sites (7) and conversion between codon and base (3)     (Camps et al. 2003). His equitation looks like
When using this formula we obtain a mutation rate of 1.11×10-5 per bp, which is 72-fold lower than the one calculated by Camps.     In our opinion, the method of mutant accumulation is a more reliable method to discern mutation rate. Especially our experiment     where we used three independent cultures is a very descriptive example for this. Although the total reversion frequency at the start     as well as at our end point differs strongly between the cultures, the change in reversion frequency between both measured time points     is surprisingly low.

We have looked into several different MRI reporters and consulted professor Markus Rudin , an expert in molecular imaging from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at ETH Zurich. We considered reporters based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) [5] , iron-based and enzyme-based reporters. [3] After consultation with professor Rudin and careful consideration, we chose to work with a ferritin-like bacterial protein, bacterioferritin. Features of bacterioferritin that influenced our choice include: [6]
superior sensitivity,
the lack of a need to supply an exogenous substrate for contrast generation since iron is endogenously available and
the fact that it can be easily overexpressed in E. coli. [7]
In general, ferritins are iron storage proteins found in different species. Through ferroxidase, they convert iron from its toxic, ferrous state (Fe2+) into a non-toxic, ferric state (Fe3+). When present in its ferric state, iron acts as a paramagnetic agent and causes a shortening of the transversal relaxation (T2) in MRI. Depending on the concentration of iron, this can lead to a visible change in contrast. [8]

Technical Implementation Plan
In order to realize our first generation product, there are several key steps that need to be taken on the research and development front. As such, we have created a detailed Implementation plan describing these necessary milestones. A condensed version can be seen below. Here we list the major technical milestones that need to be completed. These points are listed in order of priority with the earliest described experiments being most critical in evaluating the commercial potential of our technology. As such, the order represents the relative risk of each experiment, with the most high-risk experiments first, where failure to achieve good results could significantly impact the time and cost estimates for the research and development.
Final characterization of our first generation sensing organism.
Transferring our electrochemical system into P. fluorescens.
Transitioning our first product into the final prototyping stages.
Further screening for future generation products.
Further multiplexing of our electrochemical system.
Responding to Technological Change
The current technology has been carefully designed in order to easily facilitate the production of next generation products. FREDsense’s unique sensing platform is easily adaptable to monitor a plethora of different compounds of interest using different engineered bacterial strains. Second generation products are being developed including detector products specific to unique classes of chemicals including naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons. As these are specific compounds of interest for many oil sands-related processes, detectors capable of monitoring them with specificity are sought-after. These detectors will make use of FREDsense’s novel generation one sensing platform coupled with newly developed bacterial strains. Being able to directly build upon the existing platform will help ensure FREDsense’s new products can be designed quickly and efficiently so as to have a quicker entry to market than generation one products.
With the introduction of more specific and diverse sensors, this will lead the way for multiple-output detector systems. These will include detectors that can monitor multiple different classes of compounds such as combinations of naphthenic acids, hydrocarbons and  general toxins simultaneously. As many locations would require monitoring of a variety of compounds of interest at one sampling time, these second generation sensors will allow one water sample to be taken in order to monitor that sample for several toxins. This will allow for quicker sample extraction and faster results. Again, these products will make use of the generation one electrochemical sensing platform with new engineered bacterial strains.
As with generation one, all later generation products will  include integrated controls as well as the speed and reliability of the generation one sensing platform.  The modular design of FREDsense’s technology will allow the company to adapt quickly and"

Calculation
Obtain the spacing of 5CB molecules
The forces between two molecules are covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metal bonds, hydrogen bonds and                         Van der Waals force. Because no other forces are present, the main force is Van der Waals force.                         The point at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as two molecules near one                         another is called the van der Waals contact distance. Van der Waals force includes electrostatic                         force, dispersion force and induction force.
Fig.7 van der Waals potential energy
We can use a simplified formula: the Lennard-Jones potential[1].
$$E=\frac{A}{r^{12}}-\frac{B}{r^6}$$
where \(A=4\epsilon\sigma^{12}\), \(B=4\epsilon\sigma^6\).
However, there is no sigma Lennard-Jones parameters (Angstrom) epsilon Lennard-Jones parameters                         (kcal/mol) about 5CB, so we calculate the van der Waals contact distance(\(r_0\)) by statistical                         mechanics[2].
In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function \(g(r)\) in a system of particles                         (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from                         a reference particle.
Fig.8 The sketch map of radial distribution function
The radial distribution function:
$$\rho g(r)4\pi r^2=dN$$
where \(\rho\) is the density of 5CB, \(N\) is the total number of 5CB molecules. Integrate the                         above formula:
$$\int_0^\infty \rho g(r)4\pi r^2 \mathrm{d}r=\int_0^N\mathrm{d}N=N$$
$$g(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\rho 4\pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^N \Delta N(r\to r+\delta r)}{N\times                         T}$$
Where \(N\) is the number of molecules and \(T\) is the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).

We will extract genomic DNA of the screened-out CHO-K1 cell, performing polymerase chain reaction with the mutation primer and sending the PCR product for sequencing. Through alignment of the mutated TRPC5 with normal one, we could clearly see which base site has been mutated. Combing with the TRPC5 structure we’ve known, we may explain why the specific site mutation could induce channel’s greater sensitivity to mechanical force. Then we could specify the mutation region every time, repeating then huge-library mutation and high-throughout screening procedure, thus realizing directed evolution.
Ideally, we would like to screen out then mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to mechanical force. As for the audiogenetics, we hope to screen out cells which are able to response to specific sound frequency, achieving precise and orthogonal audio regulation.

I like Derek Muller of Veratasium. He’s good, he’s really really friendly. I like V Sauce but he kind of has that freakiness to him. Because he’s kind of quirky which works really well, but I think we also want to show more relaxed people in science. Dianna Cowen, Physics girl, she’s cool, fun loving, and chill. What I love about Scishow is they’ve grown now over the past 5 years and they hire people so can see the faces of scientists. A women covered in tattoos, just regular people talking science. So that another thing we need, more young and diverse people. All the people right now save Neil deGrasse Tyson, are white. And I’m visibly white too and I recognize that. Yeah, we need to mix it up! Kind of a silly questions right at the end. Dalhousie iGEM is starting an Instagram soon and I was wondering if you had any tips? That’s not a silly question! I have so many tips. Probably the most important is to clearly define your goal and your motivation for doing it. I know this is cliché but figure out what that is and it will help develop your brand. If you don’t have good motivation, Instagram is so much work. Every picture takes so much effort, so much work. That if you’re not well motivated, if you don’t know why your doing it, you’ll give up. I have a friend who was so amazing, growing faster than I was and it just became too much work. I think because her motivations were a bit different, not bad, but she just realized it wasn’t worth it. But my motivation was important to me. Even if its keeping me up at night, making me look bad in front of my peers, its worth it. And I think that’s the important thing.  Strategically, I think it’s important to read articles on Instagram algorithm. Time of day when you post matters. Normally around 12pm is the best time to post. The matters because how quickly you get likes determines how well your post will do. You always want to be the top post on a tag, and you can get there even if you’re a small channel. I think I’ve been top post over accounts that have 100s of 1000s of followers because I got my likes really quickly or something. Don’t be discouraged if your small starting out. With that said, use"

Sea vs Barckish Water
What we choose as raw material in water industry is as important as in food industry. The basic cost, design, engineering, equipment procurement, and construction spending on intakes and outfalls, are estimated to total 5 to 7 percent of capital costs for desalination plants (GWI, 2006a). On this page, we will explain how we consider the trend in the desalination resource water, and how our project is related.

Including source water salinity, water example salinity and some salinity standard.
Zander et al, 2008
How to define the salinity? Desalination industry typically use total dissolved solids (TDS) as one of the measure standards. It is a measure of all the substances, whether inorganic or organic, molecular, ionized or micro-granular, that are small enough not to filter by a filter with 2 mm pores（Zander et al, 2008）.
This measure is not only use in desalination industry but also study of water quality in fresh water system. From definition, TDS cannot point out the actual pollutant, yet it is able to indicate the presence of a wide array of contaminants and serve as the primary check of water quality.
TDS is only a measure, thus, the next question will be how it corresponds to other salinity related protocols, sensory index and so on. The desalination industry also use conductivity as basic measure, too. TDS and conductivity can convert in two equation: 1.4μS/cm=1ppm or 2μS/cm=1ppm（Zander et al, 2008）. As Figure 6.2.0, we list the salinity division of different desalination feedwater. Also, we add salinity data  of few water samples and the TDS standard for usable water to get a bigger view of how TDS is applied.

The biggest problems are biosecurity and biosafety.
According to the WHO (2004), biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. Since the 9/11 event the funding for work on biodefense has dramatically increased in the US. The US Government Civilian Biodefense Funding, between ﬁscal year 2001 and 2008 cost US tax payers more than 39 billion $. And here comes a line chart of a website which is related to the bio-safety. We can easily find that populaces are focusing on this area more and more, which should, and already caused our attention.
What’s more, economy is also a big problem of synthetic biology. According to the same organization, biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion orientational release of pathogens and toxins. Nowadays, entrepreneurs are facing the threat of theft, and thus, we also focused on this problem.
Biosafety
Have you ever played Plague Inc.? If the answer is “yes”, you sure have experienced the horror of a organisms destroying our whole world. As we all know, industrial bacterial can secrete several chemicals that has considerable significance for us. However, they are also easily stolen by thieves. What’s more, the pathogenic of bacteria can’t be depressed at this time. The threat of bio-weapon cannot be ignored
In 2003, CIA has made a report in development of bioweapons. They assessed that “Industrial biological products might be horrible than any disease that we already known”. In 2006, DSAC (Defense Science Advisory Council) also started a survey of military opportunities and challenges in this area [2].
For example, many bioterrorism incidents have occurred in the whole world wide. Such as the anthrax mail attack which is occurred after 9/11.It was said that these anthrax strains were from a laboratory. Which means it’s necessary for us to develop some method to contain microorganisms inside the lab.
What’s more, to limit the emission of synthetic microorganisms to the environment, we also need a method to prevent it. There is no reason to believe that full biosynthesis of currently semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin or cocaine, or fully synthetic amphetamine-type stimulants will not be possible and economically attractive using the toolkit of synthetic biology in the near future.
Recent years, it is reported that a new form of biology is rising: “biohackery” [3]. Biohackery allows everyone operation the"

In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour of the tourist centre of the city and ended up having dinner with a picnic in the Parc Guell. A viewpoint that has views of the entire city at night.
During the morning of the last day, to close the meet up, we were able to attend to some enriching expert talks. They offered us their views on synthetic biology and they explained the works in which they are immersed today.
Back to Meet up Index
Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Another reason is that it also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these, although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfil so much the function of practising to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts, do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context, we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to manoeuvre in their organization to attend

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html," detail with 1nm spaced emission scans.
The scans would be made using a TECAN florescence measuring machine. This machine is capable of measuring fluorescence across a 96 well plate, enabling multiple measurements of each iLOV growth culture. The pitfall of the machine's high through put design is that measurements of fluorescence are made by both exciting the protein and detecting emitted photons along the same axis (i.e. directly above the well). This results in photons emitted from the machine reflecting back from the bottom of the well and interfering in emission measurements. As such the TECAN cannot measure emissions from the protein that are closer than about 30nm from excitation wavelengths.
Figure 1: The TECAN microplate reader.
E. coli Top10 cells, with and without the iLOV expression plasmid (Part BBa_K660004 ) were grown overnight in liquid broth. 10 \ul of the overnight culture was added to 190 \ul of minimal media into each well of the 96 well plate. Minimal media removes the autofluorescence observed using Lysogeny Broth (LB).
The cultures where grown at 37$^o$C with constant shaking at 800rpm until they reached an optical density (OD) above 0.5 at 600nm. The Broad range emission scans at excitation intervals of 5nm from 350nm to and emission was measured from 400nm to 700nm in 5nm intervals. To reduce potential photo-bleaching the number of emission reads for each measurement was limited to five and the wells used for each measurements where alternated. Due to reflection from the excitation photons a portion of the measurements must be discounted where the excitation wavelength came within around 30nm of the emission measurement wavelength.
Fluorescence from each well was divided by the OD specific to that well to standardise fluorescence to cell density. The relative fluorescence of the control cells (Top10) was then subtracted from those cells expressing iLOV.
The second set of finer spaced emission scans, were carried out around peak identified . These scans were taken at 1nm excitation and emission intervals between points defined by the prior part of this experiment.
To minimise the risk of photo-bleaching  the iLOV protein only three wells where used for each set of measurements and these were alternated over the course of the experiment. For the finer spaced measurements six well were used to improve the accuracy of the result.

Surveys
Usually, bacterial contamination cannot be recognized with naked eyes and many people may eat unsafe yogurt by mistake. We checked the current detecting methods and found that traditional methods contain many cumbersome steps and cannot be used in daily life. So shall we find an easy and handy approach to detect pathogenic bacteria in yogurt? From April 15th to 20th, 2015, we did an online survey among 640 individuals to identify whether our idea was worthy to proceed.
Our survey contained questions about the common sense regarding yogurt and yogurt spoilage. We intentionally distributed our e-questionnaire among people of different ages and backgrounds. The results for questions that have greatly impacted our project are shown below.
According to the result, yogurt is a common food and good for human health. Most people eat yogurt frequently. So it means a lot to reduce the adverse affect caused by spoiled yogurt.
More than half of the people would determine the yogurt quality by the expiration date which appears to be unreliable when yogurt is stored improperly. The appearance of spoiled yogurt may be indistinguishable from the eatable ones. So there are still hidden risks with food safety.
Yogurt is generally safe for eating within the expiration date if it is stored in cold; otherwise it may spoil prior to that date. We have searched the Internet and have found varieties of news about yogurt spoilage within shelf-life. This appeared to be a frequently happening phenomenon, but many people are not aware of it. 
More than three quarters of people would eat yogurt with very close expiration dates. Moreover, according to our statistical data, 80% would still eat the yogurt just before its expiration, although they realized that yogurt may spoil before the expiration date. 
The results of our investigation convinced us that developing a handy and reliable yogurt detecting approach, or “yogurt guarder” named by us, is indeed necessary. This survey do have a great impact on the initiation of our project, since the feedback informed us an urgent need of this detecting method and gave us faith to continue our project. We  hope that our ideas can also inspire other teams with similar purposes in the future.

Yogurt is popular to millions of people all over the world. It can benefit people mainly due to the ""live"" bacteria that are good for intestinal health. In order to maintain the nutritive components and original taste, raw milk should be treated by pasteurization during yogurt production to kill most pathogens.

Team Shuttle Vector:
Surprisingly, why the PCR for the fragment his4 promoter does not raise the theoretical fragment with X33 as template, we check the DNA sequence we used for primer design. For design the primer taox1-phis4-f and taox1-phis4-r we used the DNA sequence from the BioBrick BBa_K563000 . But this part was designed on DNA from Sacharomyces cereviceae. So we thought that we can not use this DNA sequence in Pichia pastoris. Our concerns were that the promoter site could not be detected by the transcriptional regulatory machinery. We tried to identified the promoter region upstream the his4 gene on the plasmid pPIC9K from Invitrogen. Some blasts later, we saw that the his4 ORF from this plasmid is virtually the same as the CDS in NCBI . Therefore, to create primers we used the DNA sequence from the plasmid pPIC9K and used the genomic DNA from the wild type P. pastoris X-33 or PCR amplification. Thus the primers t"

Fungal Co-cultures to Study Immunoreactions
    The immune system employs many different types of mechanisms of defence against fungal infections that range from innate immunity to adaptive mechanisms that are induced during time of infection and disease. Fungal species are a source of many bioactive metabolites and have a high chemo-diversity, with almost 42% of molecular bioactive products, where many are used as antifungals or antibiotics, being generated by fungal species. Specific strategies encompassing inducing pathways that are controlled by silent genes need to be utilized to study at production of bioactive metabolites. Co-culturing fungi involves cell-to-cell interaction that help promote these mechanisms and pathways. This method allows for inter-microbial competition and communication that enables the triggering of these unique pathways and thereby production of metabolites through the activation of certain silent genes. This application is useful for drug discovery and informs researchers on how to manipulate immune response to tackle fungal infections. Antifungal compounds found through inducing these mechanisms could inform therapeutic solutions to current health problems and diseases involving pathogens.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the sfGFP output part of the Sensynova platform design with three different output chromoprotein variants; BBa_K1033929 (aeBlue), BBa_K1033925 (spisPink) and BBa_K1033915 (amajLime).
Background Information
All three selected chromoproteins were made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Uppsala 2013 team. They were chosen as variants to the sfGFP present in the Sensynova platform as they exhibit of strong colour readily observed in both LB cultures and in agar plates when expressed. All three proteins have significant sequence homologies with proteins in the GFP family.
BBa_K1033915 – amajLime
The amajLime protein is a yellow-green chromoprotein extracted from the coral Anemonia majano. It was first extracted and characterized by Matz et al. under the name amFP486 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9U6Y6.1 GI: 56749103 GenBank: AF168421.1) and codon optimized for E coli by Genscript. The protein has an absorption maximum at 458 nm giving it a yellow-green colour visible to the naked eye.
BBa_K1033925 – spisPink
The spisPink protein is a pink chromoprotein extracted from the coral Stylophora pistillata. It was first extracted and characterized by Alieva et al. under the name spisCP (GenBank: ABB17971.1) and codon optimized for E. coli by Genscript. The protein has an absorption maximum at 560 nm giving it a pink colour visible to the naked eye. The strong colour is readily observed in both LB or on agar plates after less than 24 hours of incubation.

Mtd (BPP-1 bacteriophage)
This part codes for the Major Tropism Determinant (Mtd) protein responsible for selective protein binding by the BPP-1 bacteriophage. In its native form, it has moderate affinity to the pertactin proteins expressed on the surface of Bordetella, the phage's natural host. The mtd gene has 22 specific nucleotides in its sequence that can be mutagenized to change the binding properties without adversely affecting the folding and stability of the protein. Mutations to these nucleotides give the Mtd protein the potential to bind to a very large range of target proteins. The mutagenic sites are highlighted below in red:
Mutagenic Sites on mtd gene.
In the natural phage system, libraries of mtd are created by the BPP-1 bacteriophage's Diversity Generating Retroelement. For in vitro library generation, synthetic methods such as PCR using variable oligonucleotides can be used.

Design
For cloning and evaluation, the adhesion project was divided into its two main components ‘surface display’ and ‘pathogen binding’. BioBricks were generated for the pathogen-specific peptides as well as for the parts necessary for surface display.
Surface Display
Constructs for non-covalent and covalent surface display were cloned similar to those described by Chen et. al., 2008 [1], and Liew et. al., 2012 [6], respectively.
As depicted in figure 1A, cell-wall binding domains (CWB) of LytC or LytE ( BBa_K1351006 or BBa_K1351007 ) should be translationally fused to a protein of interest for non-covalent anchoring of the latter to the cell wall. These CWB domains also included the native signal peptide (SP) of the respective proteins to direct export via the Sec pathway. For covalent anchoring, signal peptide ( BBa_K1351008 ) and cell wall anchoring domain (CWAD, BBa_K1351010 ) of the sortase substrate YhcR and a 57 amino acid linker ( BBa_K1351009 ) were assembled with the protein of interest as depicted in figure 1B to generate a YhcR-like fusion.
To evaluate the functionality of the constructs, the latter should be cloned into the replicative B. subtilis vector pBS0K under the control of the inducible promoter Pspac. Two different proteins should be for successful display: First, a superfolder GFP variant (sfGFP) was used for fluorescence microscopy to check if the constructs locate to the cell wall as shown in figure 2. This variant of GFP had been shown previously to fold in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria [10] and could thus be expected to be fuctional also in the extracellular environment, in contrast to normal GFP that does not fold under reducing conditions. As controls for the sfGFP constructs, only the signal peptides without the respective cell wall binding or anchoring domains were fused to sfGFP, which should lead to secretion of the fusion into the growth medium.
Secondly, fusions to alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) should be used to detect surface accessibility of the presented protein, as PhoA is only active when exported out of the cytoplasm [11]. Agar plates containing the PhoA substrate XP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate) indicate enzyme activity by turning"
Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," enters the chicken stomach. In order to release the synthetic colicin our cells would lyse in response to bile salts allowing the colicins to reach their target bacteria.
This project addressed the problem of antibiotic over use in livestock by replacing antibiotics with genetically modified bacteria. To protect from further drug resistant bacterial strains, we have designed colicins which lack their cytotoxic domains and have been replaced with a multiple cloning site allowing for easy interchanging of toxins at the cytotoxic domain. In order to combat the lack of selectivity of current treatment for bacterial infections (antibiotics) the toxic warheads that may be added to the colicins have the advantage of being more specific towards strains of bacterial species. Another great benefit of this is that the natural biome within the chicken’s gastro-intestinal tract is not damaged as much as it would be by non-selective broad range antibiotics, which often wipe out healthy as well as pathogenic bacteria.
Now that we have discussed the product’s affect within the chicken and its natural gut flora, how will BactiFeed affect the environment around it? By introducing our lysis cassette we aim to prevent any live bacteria being released into the environment. This is also helpful for public perception because one of the fears associated with genetically modified organisms is their release into the environment, which, by lysing the cells, would be circumvented. To ensure that there is no genetic material, resulting from lysis, which could be taken up by other bacteria, we aimed to add a nuclease to the device. This would destroy any genetic material such as left over fragments of immunity proteins, which, if they were taken up by a pathogen would result in faster rates of resistance. The colicins are predicted to be degraded, within the chicken’s digestive system, before they are excreted.

Flow Layer
Material: Polycarbonate
The Flow layer of a microfluidic is the layer that liquid(s) flow through. Etchings on this layer, known as primitives, are used to manipulate and alter fluid flow. For more information regarding primitives refer to the Primitive Table .
How can Microfluidics Apply to Synthetic Biology?
Microfluidic chips can be designed to perform various procedures used in synthetic biology. There are many advantages to integrating microfluidic devices into a synthetic biology laboratory. For example, these devices utilize microliter volumes of liquid which decreases reagent waste, allows for more trials to be performed with the same volume of reagents and lowers costs as reduced reagent volumes can be effectively utilized. Furthermore, complete protocols can be transferred onto a single chip and automated. Due to their microliter handling abilities, multiplexed systems can also be run on a single compact chip. As a result, researchers can save significant amounts of time spent on performing protocols in the lab and simply run a single chip instead. Using our fabrication system, researchers can also rapidly produce microfluidic devices at low cost to easily integrate into their lab environment.

Keep in mind that whatever material you’re using to fabricate the plates to                     check the melting temperature. Our acrylic would withstand up to 40C, so after cooling in the oven,                     we allowed the solution to cool even longer - but not to the point of the agar hardening !!!
Staying safe and fashionable with gloves, while heating up agar medium in the microwave.
Oops not enough agar! = A topological agar accident
Considerations
When pouring the agar, only pour up to halfway to the top. It is easy to accidentally get some agar on the the edges and tops of the dividers of the sections. Try to wipe this off, as microbes will                     grow on these edges (unless you are interested in how microbes from different bodily sites interact                     with each other).
Culturing organisms on the Microbiome Records
First plating attempt (October 2nd)
Four bodily sites were sampled: the mouth, the armpit, the belly button, and between the big toe                     and                     second toe. A sterile cotton tip was dipped in DI water prior to swabbing the bodily site. For                     the                     large sections of petri dish (such as the 12” concentric design), multiple swabs were made to the                     same bodily site to cover the entire area of the dish. Both the concentric design and the                     consecutive design dishes were plated with the same corresponding bodily site for comparison. We                     wanted to know if the distribution of microbes mattered in its growth and therefore sound.
Make sure to dip the cotton swab in DI water before swabbing your body!

A first step toward using this domain would be attempting to replace the coiled-coil in Yoshizumi et al.'s device with the coiled-coil domains making up the heterotrimer; bricks BBa_K2027044 , BBa_K2027037 , and BBa_K2027038 represent these constructs. Observing under what conditions, if any, specificity is maintained in the presence of a weaker homotrimerization domain (the bacterial collagen) could give some indication of the utility of these domains in organizing proteins. Collagen-like triple helices generally have melting temperatures below 40 °C, so the coiled-coil domains have a clear thermodynamic advantage and at least one has been shown to nucleate trimerization of an unfolded bacterial collagen trimer, but the kinetics of initial formation of trimers was not studied and in fact could not have been studied in the setting of the first construct. Instead, the bacterial collagen domain was unfolded while leaving the coiled-coil trimers intact;12 it remains possible that at room temperature, interaction of bacterial collagen domains dominates the trimerization process. The relative stability of the heterotrimer will allow for formation of the desired heterotrimeric construct at an elevated temperature regardless of room temperature kinetics, but it would be interesting to study the kinetics nonetheless. Still, all constructs so far are short, blunt-ended fibers incapable of assembling into a matrix. However, the modular nature of this assembly suggests the possibility of large-scale cross-linking in a way peptide tesselation models might have more difficulty supporting.
Cross-linking is essential for proper functioning of collagen in a structural context; covalent linkages ensure not just thermal but also mechanical stability of quaternary protein associations. Bacterial collagen offers no help here; human collagen is replete with intra- and inter-strand cross-links but they depend on precise positioning and the action of multiple mammalian enzymes.6 Fortunately, a simple protein fiber cross-linking module has already had its efficacy demonstrated: exons 21 and 23 from human tropoelastin have been shown to cross-link coacervated elastin-like monomers in the presence of a lysine-oxidizing agent.14 The single relavant enzyme is not even necessary; as is shown in the PQQ aptamer purification project, it might soon be enough to purchase a cof"

Figure 4: ALK-AMC incubated with different concentrations of Naja nigricollis venom.
We repeated the experiment with two different substrate concentrations, along with three different venom concentrations, similar results were obtained. The bigger substrate concentration produced much higher fluorescence intensity as seen in figures 5-7. You can find the raw data here .
Figure 5: ALK-AMC incubated with two different substrate concentrations. The venom concentration was 100 μg/ml.
Figure 6: ALK-AMC incubated with two different substrate concentrations. The venom concentration was 10 μg/ml.
Figure 7: ALK-AMC incubated with two different substrate concentrations. The venom concentration was 1 μg/ml.
In conclusion we were able to detect a significant difference from the Bitis species and the Naja nigricollis.
Peptide substrate screening
In order to find more suitable substrates, we conducted screening experiments using JPT Peptide Technologies’ Protease Substrate Sets. They consisted of 360 oligopeptides with cleavage sites described in scientific literature, flanked by a fluorescent molecule (EDANS) and a quencher (DABCYL). Fluorescence is obtained when the fluorescent molecule is released from the complex due to cleavage by proteases.
The plates with the peptides were incubated with the three different venoms. Background fluorescence was deducted from the measurements. A great number of wells exhibited different fluorescence patterns, showing that some peptides had different specificities depending on the venom. The highest cleavage activity was observed when incubating with the venom of Bitis arietans. As expected, no peptide showed unique specificity for the venom of Naja nigricollis as seen in figure 8. From these peptides, the most significant ones that can be used for distinguishing between the three venoms were selected and submitted as parts. The plots with fluorescence intensity when incubating the three different venoms of the submitted peptides is shown below.
Figure 8: Substrates with sequence DEMDEKSE (well J12) and LDEDEEDL (well D20), incubated with the three different venoms.
As seen in figure 9, this peptide is not cleaved by any of the three venoms, and can be consequently used as a negative control.

4.10.4 Preparation of NGM plates
4.10.4.1 Equipment and Reagents
• NaCl
• Agar
• Peptone
• 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol (Do not autoclave!)
• 1 M KPO4 buffer pH 6.0 (108.3 g KH2PO4, 35.6 g K2HPO4, H2O to 1 litre)
• 1M MgSO4
• Petri plates
• Peristaltic pump
4.10.4.2 Methods
(1) Mix 3 g NaCl, 17 g agar, and 2.5 g peptone in a 2 litre Erlenmeyer flask. Add 975 ml H2O. Cover mouth of flask with aluminium foil. Autoclave for 50 min;
(2) Cool flask in 55°C water bath for 15 min;
(3) Add 1 ml 1 M CaCl2, 1 ml 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4         and 25 ml 1 M KPO4 buffer.Swirl to mix well;
(4) Using sterile procedures, dispense the NGM solution into petri plates using a peristaltic pump. Fill plates 2/3 full of agar;
(5) Leave plates at room temperature for 2-3 days before use to allow for detection of contaminants, and to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Plates stored in an air-tight container at room temperature will be usable for several weeks.
4.10.4.3 Seeding NGM plates
Using sterile technique, apply approximately 0.05 ml of E. coli OP50 liquid culture to small or medium NGM plates or 0.1 ml to large NGM plates using a pipet. If desired, the drop can be spread using the pipet tip or a glass rod. Spreading will create a larger lawn, which can aid in visualizing the worms. Take care not to spread the lawn all the way to the edges of the plate; keep the lawn in the center. The worms tend to spend most of the time in the bacteria. If the lawn extends to the edges of the plate the worms may crawl up the sides of the plate, dry out and die."

We exchanged the Triple SpyTag-SUP monomer for Triple SpyTag-LBP or Triple SpyTag-CBP, and tried using the same strategy to adsorb lead and cadmium. The results were remarkable, clearly demonstrating that the Uranium Reaper strategy has much potential to be expanded to other heavy metals. (Learn more)
 
 
Even though the efficiency of the Uranium Reaper system may be somewhat lower than current methods, it could certainly be optimized through further development work. Importantly, Uranium Reaper is much better in other aspects. In the future, we plan to optimize the entire Uranium Reaper strategy in order to enhance the adsorption efficiency.

What do you think the field of electrical engineering brings to syn-bio?
""I don't think the field of electrical engineering really brings anything to the field of syn-bio. iGEM tries to create this analogy between EE and syn-bio by having these ""genetic circuits"". This ""genetic circuit"" analogy is a great tool for explaining to non-bio people what is happening and it makes for a great buzzword to get funding.....but thats really it. Granted, one could make the argument that iGEM has mimicked various electrical components like nand gates or not gates and such. But that's just bioengineers copying EE. That isn't to say that engineering in general doesn't help biology. The great thing about iGEM is that it puts engineers and biologists in the same room and makes them work together. This way the engineering approach ""break a system down to its core components, look at each component individually, put components back together so that they meet the requirements"" is combined with biology. Engineers are great at taking an idea and building it so that it can withstand the harsh standards of life. Basically what I'm saying is EE specifically doesn't bring anything to syn-bio, but engineering in general allows people to analyze syn bio problems by thinking outside the box.""

As an EE, I can go to a website like www.digikey.com look up a part and read the datasheet on the part to see if it meets my needs. If it does I buy it, if it doesn't I keep looking. Having a standard system is very important for two reasons. First, it gives everyone a common language and a set of tools to work with, which makes it so much easier to get things done. More importantly it lowers the barriers to entry, making it possible for more people to help in advancing the field. This is why iGEM emphasizes characterization so much. Having a giant standardized repository of stand alone parts that are well characterize will allow the field of syn bio to develop very quickly.""

After 5 hours induction at 37 ̊C, the expression level of recombinant CecropinXJ was detected through SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. In the result of SDS-PAGE (Fig.3), an obvious band at the size of 25 kDa compared with control was observed, which was as expected. The result of western blot analysis provided subsequent confirmation of expression (Fig.4).
Fig. 3  Expression of pET32a-cecropinXJ fusion protein analyzed by SDS‑PAGE.
However, since the western blot analysis was used on the whole cell proteins, some non-specific bindings were also obtained. Nonetheless we can still make a clear determination through the comparison between the induced cell and the control based on the high quantity of the expression product. Besides, in the lane of the pET32a factor without CecropinXJ gene, we also obtained a clear expression band at the size of about 20kDa, which is the protein product of the 5-tag system encoded by pET32a expression system itself. In addition, the purification of recombinant protein by Ni-NTA was performed under the assistance of TMMU_China.
Fig.4 Western Blotting result of cecropinXJ expression
According to the results, we can see that the E.coli recombinant expression system is a good way to produce AMPs because of its easy culture, fast growth and larger quantities than those purified from their natural sources. What’s more, this system costs less money compared with chemical synthesis.
Besides, another two vectors which express cecropinXJ continuously downstream of two different constitutive promoters, J23105(Fig. 5A) and J23106(Fig. 5B) were also constructed.

JAMS booth @ Museum
The Joint Academic Microbiology Seminars (JAMS) collective were given the chance to host a booth at the Australian Museum Science Expo during Science Week. We were invited to share the responsibility of manning the booth over the two-week period. Every day, some of our team members got to interact with students from all years of schooling as they wandered around the stations inside the museum. Over 6000 students passed through the expo, making it a very busy two weeks of outreach! The activities we ran we similar to those we did at Science in the Swamp, and again this gave us the chance to reach even more people about our project.
Experience It! Conference
Claudia was invited to be the MC at the Engineers Australia Women in Engineering Division’s Experience It! Conference. Over the course of the day, over 150 female students in their penultimate year of high school attended engineering workshops, listened to inspirational speakers, and discussed challenges faced by women in the field of engineering. As the MC, Claudia was able to offer insights into her experiences as well, and of course took the opportunity to share her experiences in iGEM! Many girls approached her afterwards to further discuss synthetic biology and the details of our project, providing another example of the extensive outreach work successfully undertaken by the USYD iGEM team this season.
Investig8 Uni
Investig8 Uni was an event held on campus to introduce early high school students to prospective higher education opportunities and the pathways available to them. Each student chose from a range of Faculty-based hands-on workshops, and the iGEM team was fortunate enough to run the Science workshop. This workshop introduced the students to a range of microorganisms, from commensals to pathogens and even critters found in local pond water.
The students used compound microscopes to view prepared slides of gram-stained bacteria, could interact with agar plates to show how we culture these organisms, and viewed larger eukaryotic organisms via dissecting microscopes and other instruments. We also introduced them to concepts of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, which generated great interest. Overall the day was really fun and the students learnt a lot – hopefully they’ll be back in a few years!

User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to "

Our data lead to the conclusion that in a cell-based system it is possible to detect chromium. In contrast to our expectations with higher chromium concentrations we got lower fluorescence levels. These observations needed further investigation. Additionally the bar chart showed that the chromium sensor needs a long time to get different fluorescence levels at different chromium concentrations in in vivo experiments. The bar chart showed significant differences between the chromium concentrations after 650 minutes.
in vitro
For the characterization of the chromium sensor with CFPS we used parts differing from that we used in vivo characterization. For the in vitro characterization we used a cell extract produced from cells which contain the plasmid ( BBa_K1758310 ). The plasmid contains the gene chrB under the control of a constitutive promoter, so that the cell extract is enriched with repressor molecules. In addition to that we added plasmid-DNA of the chromium specific promoter chrP with 5’UTR-sfGFP under the control of T7-promoter ( BBa_K1758314 (figure 6))to the cell extract. The T7-promoter is needed to get a better fluorescence expression.
Figure 5: To produce the cell extract for in vitro characterization a construct ( BBa_K1758310 ) with chromium repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter and strong RBS (BBa_K608002)  is needed.
T7-chrP-UTR-sfGFP BBa_K1758314 used forin vitro characterization.
Figure 7: Influence of different chromium concentrations on our crude cell extract. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Chromium’s influence on the cell extract as shown in figure 7 is minimal for low concentrations. Higher chromium concentrations have a measurable impact on the viability of the cell extract, which is visible at concentrations of 120 µg/L and obvious at concentrations of 240 µg/L chromium.
Figure 8: Chromium specific cell extract made from E. coli cells which already expressed the repressor before cell extract production. Induction with different chromium concentrations. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
The decrease of fluorescence for higher chromium concentrations in chromium specific cell extract is shown in figure 8. An increase of fluorescence at higher chromium concentrations would have been expected resulting out of the induction of the chromium sensor.   A factor which should be considered is the influence of high chromium concentrations to the cell extract. The test for influence of chromium on the specific cell extract, illustrated in figure 7 showed that the influence of chromium at low concentrations is not"

Materials
A pretreated silicon wafer that has been cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dehydrated at 200oC for 10-20 minutes.
Hot plate – make sure it is set to 65oC (80C for VWR hot plates)
Aluminum foil tray, wafer tweezers, 2 Pyrex bowls and 2 lids
Coating
Carefully center your wafer on the spinner chuck.  It may be difficult to tell if it’s properly positioned due to the white splatter guard.
Pour approximately 5ml of SU-8(50) into a small plastic beaker. Pour as much as possible (~ 4ml) carefully in the CENTER of the wafer so as not to entrap air.
Place the lid on the Spinner.  Check the display to see if Program 001 is selected.  Press the green Start button on the left of the spinner.  The green light should turn on.
Program 1 yields a coating thickness of 100 mm:
Spread Cycle:  500rpm at 100rpm/sec for 5s
Spin Cycle:  1200rpm at 300rpm/sec for 30 s.
When the green light turns off, remove the spinner lid.  Carefully lift your wafer off the chuck with your tweezers.
Soft Bake
Place it on the 65oC hot plate for 10 mins. After 10 mins increase the temp to 95oC (105C for VWR hot plates) with the wafer still on the hotplate and leave at this temp for 30 minutes.

Andreas: Found some information on using Lactobacilli as our cloning organism for the project. The Edinburgh 2007 iGEM team used a Lactobacillus strain (probably acidophilus?) for their yoghurt project. They created a vector which they successfully used in both Lactobacillus and E. coli. The vector is available as BBa_I742103 and the project link is attached below: https://2007.igem.org/Edinburgh/Yoghurt/Design#Gene_Expression_In_Lactobacillus I also found out that many Lactobacilli have pretty short generation times (down to 25 minutes), so that shouldn’t be a problem either.
Andreas: They have now released the contents of the DNA kit plates which will be sent out to the teams. BBa_I742103 is not included in these kits, which means we will have to order it separately. It might be a good idea to check whether there are any other BioBricks we need that are not included in the kits, so that we can order them from the BioBrick foundation. Such parts might be antibiotic resistance cassettes, for example, if we need to use any specific antibiotics when working with Lactobacillus. Here’s a link to the DNA kits of the 2010 competition:
