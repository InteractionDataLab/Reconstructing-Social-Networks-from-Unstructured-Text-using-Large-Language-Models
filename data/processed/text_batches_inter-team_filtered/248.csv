UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Game_-_-_TEXT.html,", you have to work with Escherichia coli: the model bacteria. It also is the bacteria that work best with the chosen biobricks.
System of recollection
After the decision of how to kill the spirochetes is taken, then another problem comes to attention. It is against every biosafety rule in the world to set free a recombinant bacteria into the environment. So, all the modified E. coli needs to go back to the pretri dishes they came from. In order to do this, partregistry.org has yet again the answer.
Magnetosome
Formation of a magnetosome.
There are different ways of attracting bacteria, like chemotaxis and quorum sensing. However, the fastest of them is magnetosomes (9) . Magnetosomes are prokaryotic organelle-like invaginations of the cell membrane that contains a specific set of proteins that are able to direct the synthesis of a nanometer-sized magnetite crystal. The genetic information needed for this is contained in a well conserved region known as the magnetosome island, and is present in magnetotactic bacteria (10)
In Research, the biobrick that contains the proteins needed to generate a magnetosome [link al biobrick] is given inside the plasmid pGA1C3, ready to use, by the father of Synthetic Biology, Tom Knight. This is our way of honouring him.
pGA1C3 is a high copy plasmid with high Gibson Assembly efficiency, which has Chloramphenicol resistance. The promoter used is T7, constitutive in order to facilitate the recovering of the bacteria. The terminator is Tnos again, and the ribosome binding site is maintained too.
Recovering the bacteria
A giant magnet from the physics department is used to recover the modified bacteria that contains the magnetosome, which is attracted by electromagnetic force. The termites that contains the bacteria are attracted by the magnet too.

Tec-Monterrey_EKAM,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"thesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and ligation reactions, but multiple reactions convey an additional expense on reactants, mostly enzymes. Because a desired sequence exchange could be done by a single digestion and ligation, the modular strategy also promises a reduction on costs in this area. Even further, oligonucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the project’s cost. This is when the In-Fusion tool comes in handy, as it makes it possible, through flanking site recombination, to construct precise DNA molecules by joining several fragments. This allows for the synthesis of separate sequences to be ordered and then these fragments to be used in a single reaction that will end up with the final desired construct, with the modular design strategy implemented.
Having the option to easily manipulate different sections of the genetic construct makes it possible to debug a genetically engineered system by switching the involved components and using trial and error, so malfunctioning parts can be edited. This property also makes it easier to characterize certain parts by enabling the use of different expression assemblies. A module can be constituted by a switchable promoter or reporter gene, for example, offering the opportunity to reuse systems that have been proved useful to study new single parts.
Software Tool
As a tool for the implementation of this construct design strategy, a software application was developed to aid in the appropriate consideration and placing of restriction sites in the master molecule, enabling a simultaneous consideration of the multiple factors affecting the efficiency of the final design. Enzyme compatibility, including digestion reaction conditions and cohesive end affinity, as well as their availability and other characteristics, are taken into account as the user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so a future manipulation of the fragment can be carried out with as little enzyme as possible.
Implementation on a Platform for Terpenoid Production
The modular design strategy obviously poses a greater advantage to systems aimed at manufacturing related products, such as families of biomolecules, related to each other by common metabolic pathways of production. One such family of biomolecules is terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, which are a kind of hydrocarbon made up of five-carbon isoprene units, arranged and modified in such a way that all of them share common physical and chemical characteristics and yet also exhibit a wide range of biological properties.

UQ-Australia,2009,Team:UQ-Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," grew optimally at lower temperatures. Image A shows the optical density of the bacteria population over their growth period. After an initial lag phase of 4 hours there were considerable differences in the absorbance readings. Absorbance readings or optical density can be directly correlated to the total population of bacteria. When bacteria grow and populate the sample the media will become more dense with bacteria. Thus you can compare the density to a blank sample. Distinct difference in the growth rate were evident. For our project we aim to change the maximum density reached and thus the total growth of the bacterial population. Growth measurement needs to be taken in the stationary phase as to get an accurate representation of bacteria that are dying as well as dividing and growing.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," To allow for cloning this vector we withdraw our genes from PSB1C3- DAMP-Pexigan and PSB1C3-TEV protease gene plasmids with using BamHI and XhoI digestion enzymes. We did ligation within using pET45-b vector that digested with the same enzymes. Following ligation, the resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 competent bacteria which have T7 RNA Polymerase that we know.
We did colony PCR in order to check the accuracy of cloning with using T7 promoter forward and T7 terminator reverse primers. If the clonning resulted negative expecting band would be 360 bp. On the other hand if we succesfully clonned these parts, for DAMP-Pex. Expected band would be 699 bp, for TEV Protease it would be 1041 bp.
After colony PCR consequences we have put the positive resulted clonnings 16 hours liquid culture  after that we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep plasmid izolation method. We make cutcheck to our attained plasmid DNAs for put a second control step. Our restriction enzymes those we used are BamHI and XhoI.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After we clonned to pET45-b succesfully we showed our aim proteins production via western blotting with using His-tag which lacate in N-terminal of these proteins.
RESULT FOR DAMP-Pexiganan
RESULT FOR TEV Protease
PColA- DAMP-PEXIGANAN CLONNIG:
We demonstrated that DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease proteins synthesing succesfully within clonning to pET45-b plasmid. We thought that we should insert both two genes(DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease) at the same time to same bacteria to show TEV Protease breaking linker chain (to releasing active free pexiganan) that is between DAMP and Pexiganan. We have seen with the same origin in two plasmids can not be found in a bacterium simultaneously due to origin incompatibility process. For this reason, we decided to clonning one of these two gene sequences into pet45-b plasmid which have ColE origin and one of the gene sequence clonning into pColA plasmid which have ColA origin which also we designed it.
Before that we achieved to clonning both of two gene sequences into pET45-b vector. Therefore, clonning only one of these genes would be enough for us."

About/FAQ
Who are we?
We are the first University of St Andrews team to enter the iGEM Competition.
We stem from a range of scientific disciplines and our team consists of:
9 undergraduates
2 postgraduates
3 members of staff
The University of St Andrews – Scotland’s First University
St Andrews, founded in 1413 is the oldest university in Scotland and the third oldest in the English-speaking world.
The University of St Andrews is named as one of the top 5 universities in the UK in the Guardian 2011 league table in the Times 2010 league table, achieving the highest ever rank of a Scottish university.

What is the iGEM Competition about?
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is the premiere Synthetic Biology competition organized by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), it is aimed at undergraduates from leading institutions across the globe.
The competition began in 2003 with just 5 teams, by 2009 there were 112 teams and for 2010, 180 teams are predicted to take part.
How does it work?
“Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells.”
“Participants will all specify, design, build, and test simple biological systems made from standard, interchangeable biological parts.”

Figure 1: ONB-tyrosine cleavage reaction
Figure 2: DMNB-serine cleavage reaction
Nitrosobenzene
Nitrosobenzene reacts in the human blood circulation with hemoglobin and minimizes its ability of O2 uptake.[ 9 ] Acute and chronic toxicity data are unavailable.
Other protection groups
To avoid the risks of the nitrosobenzyl derivatives there are a lot of different photo protection groups, which could be used instead of the ONB and DMNB.[ 10 ]
Comparative toxicological risk assessment
In absence of solid toxicity data predominantly for the cleavage products of the photo protection group of the enzyme it is difficult to impossible to conclude on the comparative risk assessment.
Assuming that both boric acid and the photo cleavage degradation product have similar toxicities the project approach has a clear advantage because of the much lower concentration in the product. While there are 16 mmol boric acid per kg laundry detergent the concentration of the photocaged amino acid is only 3,6 nmoles per kg. For every photocaged molecule of amino acid one molecule of protection group exits.
The common liquid laundry detergent contains 0.5 - 1% (w/w) of boric acid and 0.00005 - 0.0001% (w/w) active protease. [ 11 ]

Kano model results conclusions
Kano model is an strong tool to include feedback in your project
Kano model rank needs by customer/user satisfaction
Kano model prevents wasting money and time implementing unnecessary needs
Kano model allows you to combine public engagement and integrated practices
Kano model allows you to explain why something was designed or not
Expert feedback
A very good way to enrich the project through feedback is to do so by consulting experts in the field of study as has been done previously in iGEM. Their opinion is really relevant because of the reputation that precedes them, and that adds value to the product/project.
That is why we have decided to contact renowned artists and sciencists from the world of bioart and biotecnology to present them our project and seek advice. Next section describes who we have reached out and how their opinions have changed Printeria.
María Peñil & Mehmet Berkmen

María Peñil Cobo is a Spanish mixed media artist born in San Vicente de la Barquera. She studied fine arts and has a master in art education. To do her masterpieces she works with natural media like bacteria.
Dr. Mehmet Berkmen is a Turkish-born international microbiologist. Nowadays he is a Senior sciencist at NEB working on genetically engineering bacteria to produce proteins.
As you can see above María Peñil and Mehmet Berkmen are coworkers in NEB Biolabs Boston. Together, they are dedicated to making bioart with bacteria grown in agar, which fascinated us.  They are what printeria represents, art and science connected, so we wanted to contact them and expose our project as well as ask for advice. The results of the interview can be seen in this document:

To construct a universal part, we referred to the 2013 project of Freiburg iGEM team and added a BbsI restriction site to the sequence of crRNA by which any required target sequence can be inserted. sgRNA is the recombination of crRNA and tracrRNA. In reference of other articles, the sequence of sgRNA is shown as below:

The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and the Settlement of Space
Videos
Introduction
Summary
Dr. William Marshall is a research fellow in the Small Spacecraft Office at NASA Ames Research Center, and a Science and Security Fellow at the Space Policy Institute of George Washington University. In particular, his interests are in mission planning, spacecraft testing for a variety of microsatellite missions, and the global security implications of space strategy.
(0:05) Why should humanity expand into space?
Dr. Marshall states that the fundamental motive for space expansion is risk mitigation and survival. He outlines a difference between a threat to civilization and a threat to existence.
(1:23) How sound is the ""survival"" argument for space exploration?
Dr. Marshall believes that an argument based on species self-preservation is, in a sense, an extension of our tribal instincts. We urges us to explore the purely rational reasons for why humanity should survive and outlines two potential arguments: that life is rare, and that our existence is intrinsically valuable for our ability to grasp and understand the universe.
(3:15) Where in space do you think we should go?
Dr. Marshall argues that the Moon, not Mars, is the most logical destination for space expansion.
(4:44) What is an ethical argument against going to Mars?
Dr. Marshall outlines why the danger of contamination and disrupting a Martian ecosystem would be of cosmic significance.

Results of the Pre-experiments of the September 2 WET LAB
In these results it was not obtained any kind of fluorescence. We discarded everything used on it and reviewed possible causes of error: It’s possible that other things have grown, but they must be resistant to the chloramphenicol as the bacteria too.
Human Practices
We introduced the theoretical framework of the modeling, we put the hyperlinks whose contain the information of the biobricks.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Timeline_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 team decided to do something similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction capable of detecting different amounts of a certain substance. We call these new types of sensors, “intelligent biosensors”, because they have the ability to react in different ways depending on their surroundings.
With our project we hope to continue with the previous efforts of other iGEM teams, and at the same time propose a new type of genetic circuit for achieving these functions. In the process we plan to develop BioBricks for two new families of phage activators as well as different BioBrick constructons that can make our system easy to adapt, so that the creation of these “intelligent biosensors” becomes just a matter of choosing the substance of interest and choosing the different reporters.

Collaboration
Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together"

Safety and public acceptance
Besides designing in a relevant for the field, the acceptance of our detection method was considered. We aimed to design a detection method that could be broadly implemented to detect resistance on the spot. The public should be comfortable to use our method. Our idea was based on detection with GMOs with a kill-switch on a paper-chip. However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe as possible to make the public comfortable when using our detection method.

Summary
Relevance
Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt gave insights on the political agenda concerning antibiotic resistance. This way, we were able to make an overview of the most important European and Dutch institutes and agencies. Besides new vaccines and new prevention strategies to tackle the infectious diseases, and besides the need for new antibiotics and new therapeutics, the increased use (including overuse and misuse) of the available antibiotics (ref. The Netherlands Center for One Health (NCOH)) should be stopped. The detection method could be used as frontline diagnostics and could be the key for new treatment strategies.

Wellesley HCI iGEM 2013
Methodology
The User-centered design process.
OVERVIEW
We applied a user-centered design process (UCD) to create an intuitive and useful software tool. What distinguishes UCD from other approaches is that user input is elicited throughout all stages of the design process. Through ethnographies, we obtain valuable information about users’ behaviors and practices that allow us to create software that is more intuitive and useful. User input allows us to enhance the users’ intuitions instead of forcing them to adapt their behavior to our software. Each iteration of our design involves consultation with the opinions of our users to better address concerns and issues with our software. The user-centered design process we followed this year can be divided into four different steps: analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation. Following, we describe the key activities we employed in each stage.
DESIGN PROCESS
Analysis
In this phase of our project, we observed groups of users who could potentially use our software. Making sure our software was effective and practical, required us to understand users’ needs and the features they would like to see based on their current methodologies. Our analysis aimed to envision scenarios in which our software would be useful for our potential users and to create a test scenario after a basic version of our product was complete. Observed user testers included: the MIT iGEM team , the BU iGEM team , introductory biology and neuroscience Wellesley College students, and the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program high school participants.
The lab engages in wet lab
practices
We consulted with Natalie Kuldell, founder of BioBuilder , to understand the lab practices of synthetic biologists. Our team also participated in a first-hand experience in which we were able to perform an experiment to better familiarize ourselves with wet-lab environment techniques. We especially took note of the gestures we were using throughout the experiment. The experience was also crucial to understand biological safety protocol.
Before designing our software, we looked at existing applications for the MS Surface and"

Pectinase from Aspergillus Niger, which was used in the pectin assay as a positive control, was purchased by Sigma
The experiments with liquid nitrogen and trypsin as well as the primer design strategy were especially supported by the supervisors. No antibiotics were handled by team members.
Methods
We have used various different methods for our experiments. Here is an overview of the methods we have used.
Pollen
For our experiments with pollen, we have used two methods. The first method was using trypsin. Trypsin is an enzyme mostly found in the digestive system of many animals and can hydrolyze proteins. We have used it here in the hope that the trypsin would hydrolyze the proteins in the pollen´s outer wall and therefore making the pollen break. The Ribolyser consists of many little balls of ceramics and is used to homogenize biological samples. It works simple: you put a sample into the ribolyser and shake it well, in the best case with a mechanical shaker. By shaking it, the little ceramic balls fly around in the container and by crashing into the sample, a lot of damage can be done to your biological sample. A negative side effect of using the ribolyser is that a lot of heat is produced when the balls fly around. We used the ribolyser to break the pollens wall with both heat and the mechanical damage done. Another way we tried to break open the wall of a pollen was by using liquid nitrogen. When you put liquid nitrogen onto cells, they break because all liquids touching that extremely cold substance freeze and eventually break. We enhanced this process by using a mortar.
PCR
When we extracted the DNA from the leaves, we used a mortar, water, and some ethanol to gap"
OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Supplementary_-_-_TEXT.html," mRNA levels for pBRplac and pSpot42 samples(experimental control). Values reflect the average and standard deviation from three independent experiments. Positive and negative values reflect induction and repression, respectively. We have investigated all those genes in E.coli genome. According to the value of repression rate and corresponding error magnitude, we have chosen three of them, nanC, srlA, ytfJ to check our designs. SrlA is our first choice due to its highest repression rate. The second choice is ytfJ because its relatively higher repression rate and lower error magnitude. However, we could not find out the transcription start site(TSS) of ytfJ, the only one we didn’t operate PCR from its corresponding TSS. We chose nanC for its 47-fold repression when experimented in LacZ-fusion assays.
FigPredicted Base-Pairing Interactions between the Single-Stranded Regions of Spot 42 and Target mRNAs[1]
(A) Secondary structure of Spot 42, reported previously[2]. The three single-stranded regions(highlighted in gray). Three consecutive nucleotides (white) in each single-stranded region were mutated to disrupt predicted base-pairing interactions with target mRNAs (I–III).It speculates that spot42 may pair with different targets through three seed regions and their mechanisms may be different as well.
(B) Northern blot analysis of NM525 Dspf::kanR (GSO433) cells transformed with pBRplac, pSpot42, or pSpot42 variants I–III. Cells were grown in LB to an OD600 of 0.3, treated with 1mMIPTG, and incubated for 0 min or 30 min. 5S RNA served as a loading control.  It provided that spot42I-III, introduced with different bases mutation, won’t lead to altered degradation rate.
(C) Genes identified by microarray analysis and base-pairing interactions with Spot 42 predicted by the folding algorithm NUPACK. Mutations introduced into pSpot42 and the lacZ translational fusions are designated. The bar below each target gene designates the predicted location of base pairing with Spot 42. The number above each promoter, indicated as a dark arrow, specifies the number of nucleotides between a transcriptional start site and the start codon of the first gene in the operon.[1]  Figure C suggests that the locations of complementary pairing site in transcripts of many spot42 targets are quite different.

Date: Oct 19, 2008  Status report by: Tejas  Part no.: BBa_K110017 -> BBa_K110023  Part Description: yESapphire , mCherry, venusYFP, and Citrine
Work on YFP has progressed, though the biobrick system is giving diffiulty in obtaining a useful  construct. Moreover, the YFP sequence may not fully match the expected sequence. However,  fluoroescent proteins (yeast optimized) sent us as STABS from MIT are showing promise, and may be  ready for some use by the Jamboree date if all goes well. Work will continue on venus YFP and  mCherry (though mCherry unfortunately contains a restriction site). Sapphire must be started over  sue to technical difficulties getting a clone.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Members_-_-_TEXT.html," you don‘t know how to cheer up Justas, invite him to a battle of laser tag or airsoft. Due to                      his tactical efficiency not only in those battles, he is more than suitable for being the                      leader of our team. He’s a perfect example of how one should make a career in science - from                      filling plates with LB Agar last year to becoming a mastermind of the project this time. Don‘t                      be screwed up – his heart can turn from feather to stone in minutes and nobody will pass into                      silence or stay without assignments. On the contrary, there are 4 words and 14 letters that                      everyone desires to hear from Justas: „Food’s on SynBio“. We are also thinking about running a                      questionnaire during the Giant Jamboree whether he should shave his beard or not...

This girl just loves animals (zver in particular), but the best pet she has ever had must be a                      giant goat moth, named Hellboy. You may think she wouldn’t hurt a living being, but she has                      enough courage to open fire at Justas’ face during airsoft. However, most of the time you may                      find her by the computer making our illustrations that were inspired by countless hours of                      microfluidic experiments.

With regard to autonomous weapon systems, researchers are already talking about the third revolution in military technology after the invention of gunpowder and the development of the atomic bomb. In 2017, several researchers and CEOs of AI corporations signed an open letter in which they warned of an arms race with autonomous weapons. Others pointed out that now that this technology was introduced one has to assure not to fall behind other states: this is the logic of the arms race. Researchers are now facing a dilemma: If they refrained from research whose results could possibly be misused, the scientific progress in medicine and technology would be done for. On the other hand, researchers are due to their expertise responsible for weighing up the risks and the opportunities of their work: “Scientists have the duty to minimize the risks of dual use in their work” says the Robert Koch Institute. To support researchers in fulfilling their duty, the German Ethics Council, the German Research Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina published recommendations in 2014 on how to deal with dual use risks. Their research institutions, the experts emphasize, should support the researchers.""

""At iGEM we take the risk that others might misuse our work and resources to cause deliberate harm very seriously. We have robust programs designed to ensure that we help enable local people to address local challenges both safely and securely. Leading technical bodies, such as the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, have suggested that almost all modern biotechnology could be used for both good and for harm. Over the years, we have had fantastic examples of teams engaging with these issues and finding practical ways to better understand and address such concerns. We are proud to enable and champion that engagement. This is another example of how our communities are engineering solutions to real-world challenges.
iGEM believes that we all share a responsibility to maximise how biological engineering can make our lives better whilst minimising any potential for harm. That is why iGEM teams are asked to think about and manage any risks from their projects - both during the competition and should their project ever be fully realised. We understand the important role that instructors, advisors, and PIs can play - both in ensuring the work is safe and secure but also in building a culture"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"egrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

iGEM Team of
CCU_Taiwan
We have had a meaningful collaboration with CCU_Taiwan iGEM team in interlab study. When CCU_Taiwan worked on interlab, they were not able to transform the plasmids for Interlab from iGEM kits into thier competent cells E. coli DH5α. This caused their interlab study to be stuck right at the beginning. (For more detail about the problem CCU_Taiwan iGEM faced, click here .)
They started to ask for help from other iGEM teams and we decided to give them a hand. We had several online meetings to help them troubleshoot their interlab study. We even read their labnotes and discussed together. However, due to the proximity of the deadline for interlab data submission, we think that it would be a good idea to make a backup plan for them. Therefore, we gave them E. coli into which we had successfully transformed with plasmids for interlab. We have also gotten  through our interlab study in advance to make sure that we have the right concepts and methods to help them out.
With our help and with their perseverance, CCU_Taiwan eventually finished their interlab study and their result was accepted by the iGEM Headquarters on August 24.
iGEM Team of
TAS Taipei
As we have always done, NYMU iGEM cooperated with TAS iGEM team in various aspects this year. We have closely cooperated in conducting interlab study. Some TAS members attended our weekly meetings, joined our discussion on our projects, gave advice on our deliverables, and troubleshoot our experiment failures. On the approach of DNA submission deadline, they also help us by simultaneously cloning and checking our mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) and ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) into a pSB1C3 backbone.

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", because even this time my attempt of construction of K731600 miserably failed. I cannot stand this part anymore.
But I did not give up, and on Wednesday I started again from the beginning: it is a personal challenge, I will make that construct by the end of the summer. This time I made every possible screening during the cloning, and when it was time for screening on Sunday…. The gel after the digestion was illegible, maybe the agarose had some problems and the samples did not run as usual; so I had to digest again and wait until Monday and use a new type of agarose for screening. What’s wrong with this construct??
In the meantime I did some tests to verify and quantify the good working of my gene CysDes, that produced H2S starting from cysteine. I tried the tests suggested by Keasling in his work (the methylene blue test) and a test suggested by the iGEM Yale team 2010 (the BCS test). I obtained good results. However I will have to repeat the test: the plate from which my coltures came from was a bit old, and the gene did not work at the maximum of the possibilities. For this reason I will repeat both the tests next week.
Test suggested by Yale:
In this test you add CuSO4 in the colture medium. If your bacteria produce H2S the Cu binds to sulphide and precipitate forming covellite; you can measure how much Cu is remained in the solution adding BCS (bathocuproinedisulfonic acid), which immediately reacts with Cu and turns orange. Then you record your results measuring the absorbance of your samples at 483nm: less the Cu in the solution more your bacteria worked and produce H2S. In parallel you can measure the OD of your cultures and see how it changes in relation at the production of H2S.
In my case I obtained a partial positive result: how I was expecting in the not induced culture there was no change in the concentration of Cu, meaning that H2S was not being produced; in the induced culture it is clear a decrease of the concentration of Cu between 3 and 4 hours, and it is positive. Actually the decrease maybe should be clearer throughout the whole time of incubation, and for this reason the next week I will try again the same experiment with a fresh culture of bacteria.
Test suggested by Keasling:
In this test you verify the production of H2S observing the turn of color of your solution upon addition of N,M-dimethyl-p-phenilend"

Communication with schoolmates
Since it is the first time for us to participate in iGEM, we shared our excitements and plans with our schoolmates and the faculty of Life Science College. We made a presentation and carefully introduced iGEM and some wonderful previous iGEM projects. People are deeply attracted by the beauty of synthetic biology and the fantastic ideas of some iGEM projects. We had energetic discussion and obtained a lot of valuable suggestions and inspirations.
Meetup with high school students
On July 13th 2014, Heilongjiang Province Summer Camp of Science for High School Students was held in our university. 79 high school students from different area of Heilongjiang province participated in this Camp. Taking advantages of this opportunity, we gave a lecture “Synthetic biology and iGEM” and had a spirited discussion with those senior high school students. Some of these children showed great interests in the iGEM competition. Encouraged by our team members, the children decided to found their own team and try to learn more about synthetic biology. They would very much like to join in the iGEM in the near future.
Interaction with other iGEMers
We attended the conference held by National Chiao Tung University August 3-7 2014 and  communicated with iGEM teams from Tsinghua University, Fudan University ect. to share our experiences and thoughts. We discussed key points of wiki design, presentation preparation and poster making. We did get a lot of valuable suggestions from these experienced iGEM teams!
Participation in ""Biological Big Bytes"" Workshop
The workshop on Biological Big Bytes (B3) is a satellite meeting of the traditional annual international workshop on “Crops, Chips and Computers” (C3), aiming to teach best practice in the application of state-of-the-art information technology and computational techniques to big data research in life sciences.  This workshop is held in Harbin Institute of Technology. In the “iGEM Meetup” section, we shared our project idea and current progress with teams of Northeast Forestry University and Harbin Institute of Technology. We got great suggestions from Professor DengChang Xu and Professor Ming Chen.

The protein wbnK has strict selectivity for Gal-β-(1->3)-GalNAc and acceptor specificity assays have shown that a change of glycosidic bond from 1->3 to 1->4 or from the β to the α configuration both lead to poor substrates for wbnK. wbnK is involved in the formation of both the O86 O-antigen and human blood group B antigen tetrasaccharide. It's close relatives include: wbwK from Escherichia coli O86:B7, wbgL from Escherichia coli O126, wbgN from Escherichia coli O55:H7 and wbgN from Escherichia coli O55:H6.
This gene was synthesised by reverse translating the amino acid sequence by codon-optimisation (Accession number: AY670704).

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#MAGE_-_-_TEXT.html," amount versus transformation rate 
 
Figure 7. Shows the transformation frequency of oligo length.
 
Figure 8 Shows transformation frequency of with extra mismatches from 1-6.
 
The Figure 8 above shows the transformation frequency for mismatch insertion. This results does not correlate with the assumption that the lower the amount of mismatches the higher the transformation rate. Here the opposite is shown. This can be do to the high uncertainty in using streptomycin resistance. because of this the frequency pr. mismatch was not calculated.
 
The three figures shown above varies greatly. It is possible that the cells were not optimally electro competent. These experiment need to be redone to define if the experimental setup is incorrect or if some other variation is in play.
 
Selection of the colonies was difficult because of possible background from spontaneous mutants that became visible after 2 days and the risk of adding too much cell mass onto the plate when colony picking, this could be mistaken as a growing colony.
 
The results will need to be validated preferably using another screening method, since false positives seems to be an issue when using streptomycin as selection marker. It could be suggested to use a GFP with a inserted stop codon in the genome. The MAGE protocol could then be optimized for making knockins, this could be screened by using flow cytometry.
 
Conclusion
The experiments indicate that 5bp mismatches with a length of 80nt and using 5uM of oligo would optimize the MAGE method in Bacillus. The data is of pure quality and nothing certain can be concluded from this experiment. 
 
Multiple Bacillus MAGE cycles
 
Background
A great strength of the  MAGE method is that it can be iterated until the amount of cells with the wanted change is high [7]. We wanted to test if this also is the case in B. subtilis. Our experiments suggest that the this might be the case.
Experimental design
We hypothesized that if the MAGE protocol was repeated multiple times, the amount of transformants would rise. This was tested by running four cycles of the MAGE protocol. The progress could be followed by plating a dilution of the sample on streptomycin plates after every round and calculating the start value of the culture from the OD600 measurements. It was necessary to colony pick onto streptomycin plates, which gave usable results.
Achievements
Identified that colony picking is a insufficient method to quantifying MAGE frequency.
Showed that the knockout of mutS has a significant effect on the transformation frequency

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Synthetic Peptides_-_-_TEXT.html," forms an iso-peptide-bond with a corresponding lysine residue in the SpyCatcher.
The invariable region is designed for immobilization and detection of the peptides. It is located at the C-terminus of the variable region and consists of aminocaproic acid (ε-AHX or Ahx), lysine and cysteine. The &epsilion;-amino group of the lysine is coupled to a carboxyfluorescein to enable an easy way to detect the peptide. Detection of desired proteins by fluorescence labeling is in this way achievable with low effort. The ε-AHX functions as an place holder between the variable region and the fluorescein to ensure that the reactivity is not influenced due to steric hinderance. The cysteine at the c-terminus is usable for immobilization with commercial available SulfoLink-Resins or other thio-reactive matrices. The sequence of the invariable part is therefore AhxK*C, for K* as the labelled lysine.
In essence, the following sequences result from these considerations:
Synthetic Intein:
GVFVHNGA- AhxK*C
Synthetic SpyTag:
AHIVMVDAYKPTK- AhxK*C
This is the structure of our synthetic intein.
 
This is the structure of our synthetic SpyTag.
Peptides were obtained by solid-phase synthesis using the Fmoc strategy.
Cleavable TentaGel® R RAM beads from Rapp Polymers was used for synthesis. Deprotection of the Fmoc-protected amino group on the surface of the TentaGel®-Resin occurred twice with 1 % piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min. Cysteine was activated with 1.2 equivalents of HBTU and added twice in 5-fold excess. The product was washed 5 times in DMF and 2 times in dichloromethane (DCM). Deprotection of the Fmoc-protected amino group of the coupled cysteine was performed like the deprotection of the TentaGel®-Resin. HBTU (1.2 eq.) activated lysine (Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH) was coupled twice in 3-fold excess, with the second coupling taking place overnight. The 4-methyltrityl (Mtt) protection group of the washed product was removed by usage of 1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM and flow-through"

We ran a PCR of pC13AI with primers 45/52 and 48/51. We ran the PCR products on a 1% gel and found bands at 1.5kb and 1.2kb for lox1 and 1.5kb and 1kb for lox2. There may be something wrong with the pC13AI plasmid. We also ran a 1 step PCR of lox1 and lox2 with a 59C annealing temperature. We submitted pC13J for sequencing with Primer 31. We also ligated the constructs from Tue--in short, crtB + crtI, crtI + PtrpC. We ran a PCR with Q5 polymerase for inserts in pC13M, pC13J and pAK13CR and ran a gel for them--pC13J was good, pC13M had a faint band but nothing for pAK13CR. We took photos of the plates for the experiment on G. lucidum’s growth in the presence of antibiotics, to capture the differences in appearance in addition to colony size.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Medal fulfillments_-_-_TEXT.html," team we participated in a workshop on ethics hosted by the UNIK_Copenhagen iGEM’14 team. This led to an essay dealing with the several questions on ethics within our project.
What ethical issues should be considered regarding our project and synthetic biology in general?
How can these issues be approached?
Furthermore we have been dealing with laboratory safety since we find that essential for a good project. We have chosen to make a checklist on how to maintain good laboratory safety. This is targeted towards our defined Policy and Practices target group (Danish elite high school students) since they do not yet have well developed laboratory safety routines.
Gold Medal Requirements
3 of the 4 Gold medal criteria have been achieved
Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique.
Today promoter activity is measured with the use of GFP which entail several complications, including bleaching effect and uncertainty associated with measuring on protein level. The method developed through our project exterminate these issues by using the spinach RNA-aptamer expressed from the promoter of choice. This allows measurement performed at RNA level thereby eliminating several uncertainties faced when using GFP. With our experimental work and our developed PoPS calculator we have enabled a new way of measuring promoter activity on RNA-level with the use of Spinach.
Increase the ease of accessibility and portability of methods to other laboratories of a new measurement technique of your choosing.
We have transformed Spinach2.1 into the standard iGEM backbone so it easily can be placed behind any optional promoter. Thereby making a easy, fast and standardized protocol to measure promoter strength on RNA level. With our calculator we have developed a fast and easy way to convert fluorescence signal into a absolute PoPS value for promoter activity.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution.
One of our first achievements was hosting a BioBrick Workshop in May for the other two Danish iGEM teams SDU-Denmark and UNIK Copenhagen. We shared our knowledge within USER cloning and arranged a programme covering three days of workshops with relevant presentations and lab introduction. Thereby helping other teams by giving them some skills, knowledge and techniques useful when developing a great iGEM project. It also served as a good way to start up the projects with the great opportunity for idea development and knowledge exchange among the teams.

Dr. Gerlinde Metz
Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.

Our team member Pernille spent an afternoon giving a presentation on cell factories and synthetic biology to 30 highschool students. She says: ""Synthetic biology is all about being creative and use your imagination to design bio-solutions that can impact the world. For that exact reason, it is neccesary to discuss which ethical values tat should drive research"". The highschool students had lots of questions and opinion for the discussion about ethics.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#BA2_-_-_TEXT.html," the fluorescent signal and improve the sensitivity. To solve this problem and make sure that our own-designed circuit works well, we need to test the effect of the strong promoter, cyclic amplifier and dual fluorescence system respectively. The verified experiments are as follows.
2.1 Strong Promoter
  To confirm that the strong constitutive promoter can induce plux promoter, we designed the biobrick BBa_K2305004 . The purpose of this biobrick is to produce as much green fluorescence as possible by inducing the induced promoter plux, to ensure a stronger expression in E.coli.
 We added a strong promoter on the basis of the previous part BBa_J37032 . Parts from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119 are a family of constitutive promoter parts isolated from a small combinatorial library. With the addition of the strong constitutive promoter upstream the plux, we hope the plux promoter can be induced and therefore express more GFP. As the figure shows, in the first eight hours the OD600 value grew well, and the new part reached a higher GFP expression in E.coli than the previous part. Importantly, the new part has amplified the expression of GFP for more than 10 times. So we can say that with the existence of the strong constitutive promoter, the expression of GFP has been amplified. So it’s effective for us to put plux promoter upstream the route, in other to amplify the detecting signal.
Figure5: The OD600 of BBa_J37032 and BBa_K2305004.
Figure6: The part with strong promoter has about 10 times larger GFP fluorescence than the part without the strong promoter.
2.2 Cyclic Amplifier
  The luxI downstream the induced promoter plux will be encoded to produce LuxI, which can combine with LuxR to promote plux. It can be used to form a positive feedback, so that the input signal can be further amplified.
  In order to verify the effect of the cyclic amplifier on the fluorescent signal, we designed two gene circuits. Without luxI, BBa_K2305005 cannot produce LuxI, so it can not constitute a cyclic amplifier. But BBa_K2305016 can do it, then we compare these two gene circuits to verify the cyclic amplifier.
  The results of the validation show that the GFP fluorescence of BBa_K2305005 did not change over time. The fluorescence intensity of BBa_K2305016 remarkably increased over time, and the growth rate has increased after seventh hours later. Therefore, it can be shown that the expression of GFP protein,"
ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices#Cooperate#Senergene#second_-_-_TEXT.html," many benefits a new technology could bring to someone determines how much support it will get from someone. Currently, developing GMOs and synthetic biology in China contradicts the benefits of those who guide public opinion, and the benefits of GMOs and synthetic biology couldn’t offset its potential side effect in people’s mind. To alter the situation, the government and research institution should rebuild the credibility and promote GMOs continually. Meanwhile, corresponding technology must be ready for future application.

Achievements
We implemented a different insecticide than originally planned based on biosafety and biosecurity concerns raised in an expert discussion.
Our communication in wiki, registry, personal, and on social media is driven by advice on biosecurity from experts.
We integrated the S.H.I.E.L.D. hardware elements such as the self-healing hydrogel and the NDR-70 sealing rings based on interviews with mosquito researchers.
We decided where to place the S.H.I.E.L.D. based on advice by international experts.
We focussed on the application of the S.H.I.E.L.D. against other insect related threats.
Our project deals with the issue of fighting malaria-transmitting vectors, for example Anopheles gambiae. With the S.H.I.E.L.D. we have developed a novel malaria prevention method which contains engineered bacteria to lure and kill mosquitoes. We are aware that working with GMOs and keeping them in a device in the field implies a lot of different aspects to think about. Therefore, we talked to both national and international experts working in malaria research and biosafety. With the help of their expertise we were able to further improve design and safety of our project enabling it to fulfil its purpose of safely and sustainably combating malaria.
Integrated Human Practices
Before starting with the practical implementation in the lab we met biosafety expert Dr. Mirko Himmel. A biochemist by training, he currently works at the Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker-Centre for Science and Peace Research, where he specializes in biological arms control and biosecurity matters. He introduced us to the problem of Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). After his presentation we discussed safety- and security-relevant aspects of our project. One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. Published data indicated a low toxicity to mammals, which outside the field of bioinsecticide research can be interpreted as very toxic in realistic doses.
Since the toxin might prove to be harmful to humans and other mammals we decided to use an alternative insecticide which was known to be exclusively toxic to insects, BjaIT,"

1.OUR HP With TEAM HFUT iGEM
In this section of collaboration, we helped the Team HFUT test their software Biodesigner Coral, an online software that can help users search for particular part of iGEM and construct their own part, the relationship among genes, compounds, or parts, and offer the detailed information of a plenty of genes. We discussed about the software according to the using experience of our team. We tried to use this software to build a part we use this year and search for some genes we often use. We gave them some suggestions online. Here are the screenshot pictures of the online chatting records. (We use the common social network QQ to communicate, Haoran Ding represented our team and Xinyu Chen reprensented Team HFUT)
Ding: What is more, Your database may be incomplete, for I searched for the part BBa_E1010 used in one of our device, but I did not get the result even if I directly type the part number. Ding: (screenshot, to show the lack of result when search for a particular part)
Ding: And there is a BBa_E1011, but it is codon optimized mRFP-1 gene in yeast. Ding: But I do not need this optimization.

The design of our limiter incorporates multiple transcription factors, each binding specifically to certain promoters, often in combination with others.  To achieve this precise orchestration of our control elements, we employ a synthetic system of transcription factors, each binding to distinct operator sites which can be combined to provide an enormous variety of transcriptional control.

The Power of Standardized Modularity
To make the engineering of biology easier, synthetic biologists devote considerable attention towards the standardization of parts and of practice.  The inspiration for such a focus stems from similar concepts in engineering, which depends upon well-characterized components for the design of complex systems with predictable and reliable behavior.  As such, the iGEM competition makes use of the Biobrick standard, an idempotent approach to cloning recombinant DNA.  The Biobrick standard constitutes a conserved sequence of four restriction enzyme cut sites that envelop a genetic part, whether it be a coding gene, a promoter, or some other functional piece of DNA.  According to the process of Standard Assembly, one can then ligate two such parts together after following a formulaic scheme of restriction digest reactions.  The end result is a linking of two two genetic parts bounded by the same four restriction sites in a reproducible fashion.  Such a system facilitates the pairing of two parts, allowing for the creation of endless combinations while constructing a device.
As a slight deviation from this system, our synthetic transcription factors were designed according to the Biofusion standard, which was developed by the Silver lab at Harvard University.  Biofusion parts have an identical arrangement of restriction digest sites relative to the part, with one exception.
Intrinsic to the Biobrick standard is the placement of a single nucleotide between the part and each of its adjacent restriction sites, namely XbaI and SpeI.  The nucleotides are intended to act as spacers to protect the part from enzyme cleavage.  When two Biobrick parts are ligated together according to the Standard Assembly,"

Many moons ago, my crew and I were ordered by high command to hunt and capture a mythical creature named """"Rishabh"""", though they say his true name of power remains lost to the eons. For decades, we studied his patterns, learned his ways. Rishabh, despite an eternity of wisdom, had devolved into a creature of habit, frequenting a small nearby establishment named """"Taco Bell"""". The creature also displayed a certain affinity towards """"rap"""" music, though our research team had yet to deciphering its meaning. When the time had come, our scouts tracked his last known location to Ithaca,  where he had blended into the student populace; more specifically, the Cornell iGEM team. Tracking down Rishabh's lair was mere child's play; our crew commanded the best hunters in the known quadrant. And so we infiltrated and laid in wait, hoping to find the perfect moment to strike.
But so was he.
In my hubris, I underestimated the might of the ancient powers, at the cost of my crew's lives. One by one, we were slaughtered. I am the sole survivor. Even now, I am being hunted.

Ritvik Sarkar
What is the Ritvik? I'm glad you asked. Ritvik used to be our team's secret secret nonlethal weapon, until a series of not completely unrelated explosions and earthquakes alerted national media to its existence. Ritvik is the original prototype for our project, with its 20 micron filter hair outperforming all competition. We are still struggling to develop a successor that has even half the ability to make wet things into dry things. Capable of building models to ensure our team's success as well as other smaller ventures such as hostile takeover of midwestern states, Ritvik is an essential component of our team. Without its capabilities as a replacement pump system, we would be incapable of surmounting the one foot of head that stalls our team's inevitable victory.

⇒ An 8-lane PCR is being tested on J04500 using Phusion mix and 5prime Master Mix. The PCR will test for reproduciblity and ultimately hope to determine the best methods of PCR, as the last series of (fragmented) PCRs have proved to be extremely inconsistent. The following mixtures were used:
5Prime MM
∴ 40µL 5Prime master mix
∴ 35µL diH2O
∴ 10µL VF2 (diluted to 1µM)
∴ 10µL VR (diluted to 1µM)
Phusion MM (home-grown from NEB website protocol)
∴ 20µL HF Buffer (5x)
∴ 2µL dNTP solution
∴ 5µL VF2 (stock)
∴ 5µL VR (stock)
∴ 1µL Phusion polymerase
⇒ An gel was run with these components to assay PCR reliability:
Frustratingly, all bands appear to be at normal locations. Reasoning for previous PCR failures are unknown; possible errors include bad stock (which was changed for this assay) or pipetting errors generating unpredictable product. Admittedly, A different template stock was used for this assay then previous weekend experiments, which may be a component of the problem.
Phusion polymerase obviously is far more powerful than the 5Prime master mix; at the same time, it must be noted it costs almost 5 times as much. Little remains of the stock in the freezer, so, due to cost restraints, using the 5Prime master mix is our best bet unless you actually plan to mass-produce a part for the purposes of cloning it.

Bridging the Gap
Bridging the Gap is a collection of interviews and blog posts investigating the transfer of knowledge, employees, and intellectual property between industry and academia. Bridging this gap between academia and industry is fundamental to the success of manufacturing products based in research. There is also a gap in knowledge between the public and scientists regarding G.M.O.s, which has led to complex - and sometimes overly cautious - legislation.
In particular, our team was very interested in how intellectual property comes into play when companies utilize or commercialize research. We spoke to Dr. Andrea Haight, a polymer chemist with over 15 years of experience in small business, and found that protected research is frequently not used by companies to prevent violation of patents. Our team also spent a large amount of time trying to navigate patent law and deciding whether or not we would patent our process. This included consideration of the alternatives: proprietary information and open source technologies. Rod Tompkins from CSU's technology transfer office was fundamental in helping us make our decision to file a provisional patent. We also investigated the policy surrounding agricultural G.M.O.s to better understand how our project would be seen by the law.
Our extended thoughts on these subjects have been compiled into article-style blog posts which we hope give the general public and other scientists a new perspective on science law, intellectual property, and industry.

iGEM - INTERNATIONAL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MACHINES
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) is a competition  organized by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA,  since 2004 and has become one of the largest international competitions in the  field of science. This year 128 teams of undergraduate students compete against  each other, and for the second time ESBS-Strasbourg team is joining this  competition.
Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of  different approaches, methodologies and disciplines. We can define the synthetic  biology as the design and (re)construction of new biological  functions and systems not found in nature.
Similar to the construction of a car,  Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions.  These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can  be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains  more than 13,000 gene building blocks , due to the continuous development of  new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed  projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the  “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.

We constructed the standard part with the acid-induced promoter J10071. The plasmid is pSB1C3.
Week7 (Apr 27 -May 3)
We constructed all of acid production genes to the pSB1C3, as standard parts.
We did the second cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG.
Week8 (May 4 -May 10)
We looked around many articles and decided to use P-atp2 and P-asr as pH-induced promoters. At the same time, we extracted the genome of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 strain.
We did the second cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG.
Week9 (May 11 -May 17)
We obtained the sequence of P-atp2 and P-asr by articles. We tried to constructed P-atp2 to pSB1C3, but there is an EcoRI site exists in P-atp2. So we chose another vector pXMJ19 to construct it.
We did the third cell culture to test the function of glsA, but again, we didn’t get the expected results. We have improved our experimental method, but there are still a lot of difficulties. It’s hard to realize the synchronous culture between the two strain because the different activities of preserved bacteria.
Week10 (May 18 -May 24)
We got P-atp2(Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032) and P-asr(Escherichia coli K12) through PCR. And linked them to pXMJ19 and pSB1C3 respectively. Then transformed them into BMTOP10.
Week11 (May 25 -May 31)
We used LacZ alpha as a report gene and we verified the strength of two promoters under the different pH environment. The result is success.

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html," expose the difference between the effect of photo-bleaching on iLOV and GFP, the two previous experiments were repeated for the E. coli containing a GFP sequence. The emission of GFP at a 449 nm excitation wavelength is higher than that of native Top 10 cells allowing for the measurement of photo-bleaching despite not using the peak excitation wavelength for GFP.
Results, Analysis and discussion
Excitation and Emission Scanning
The fluorescence from the iLOV protein is found using equation 1,
\begin{equation} \operatorname{F} =  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N} \frac{f_i}{O_i} - \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j}^{M} \frac{g_j}{O_j}.     (1) \end{equation}
The fluorescence from each of the wells is divided by the OD in that well ($O_{i/j}$). The average fluorescence per OD of the Top 10 cells ($g_j$) is then subtracted from the average fluorescence per OD of the Top 10 cells with iLOV expressing sequences ($f_i$). This leaves only the fluorescence due to the iLOV protein.
Figure 2 shows the emission topography of the iLOV protein in E.coli. It is clear that there is one large peak of emission centered around an excitation wavelength of 440nm which causes the iLOV protein to emit at around 500nm. The plane of zero fluorescence at the top left of figure 2 is caused by reflection from the excitation photons.
Figure 2: The florescence response of the protein iLOV to a range of excitation wavelengths. The peak response occurred at an excitation wavelength of 440nm and emission measurement at 500nm. Emission measurements are taken at 5nm intervals whilst excitation wavelengths are spaced at 5nm intervals
Following from this result the area between 420nm and 480nm excitation wavelengths were chosen to be scanned at a higher resolution. The emitted fluorescence would be measured at 2nm intervals between 460nm and 550nm for excitation wavelengths spaced 1nm apart.
Figure 3 shows the result of the higher resolution scan. It can immediately be seen that there is some artificial effect at work. The striation of the results is most probably caused by photo-bleaching, where the exciting photons have changed the conformation of the protein. The altered state of the protein may have a higher or lower rate of reemission of the excitation"

Another restriction with this system is finding compatible chemical pathways between our prions and the strain of interest. If there is little compatibility, even with the prion with the best match, we would be forced to catalyze the process with an additional set of reactions.

Ethanol Fermentation Pathway using Aggregation
General Concept
One application of our project is that it could help speed up fermentation processes in the production of ethanol. To create ethanol, we start off with complex sugars and yeast; the yeast then breaks the complex sugars down into glucose, and eventually into ethanol and carbon dioxide (Lin et. al, 2005).
With the help of our project, we could use aggregation to speed up the fermentation pathway. To do this, however, we use monomeric enzymes, as it has not yet been proven that we can form homodimers in the prion state. Most of the enzymes in the fermentation pathway for glucose are not monomeric. Instead of using glucose as a starting sugar, we can use mannose. The first two enzymes in mannose’s fermentation pathway are monomeric. We could therefore test whether we can apply our project idea to mannose’s fermentation pathway to help speed up its process.
Benefits
If we can find a way to speed up the fermentation process to create ethanol, it will have an enormous impact on the alcohol industry. Beer and wine, for example, will be created at a much faster pace; this will have a dramatic impact on many stakeholders, such as beer and wine producers, alcoholic beverage vendors, and consumers of alcohol.
Application
This would be used to speed up the production of ethanol, and in turn, of alcoholic beverages.
Restrictions
Mannose’s fermentation process is already slower than glucose’s; will our project speed it up to be even faster than glucose’s on its own. For example, glucose can be 70-80% fermented in 20-30 days, while mannose is only 30-50% percent fermented in the same amount of time (Peterson et. al, 1920).

Interview with the public
The team members conducted a social survey. We found that many people are too busy to go to the                         hospital for regular medical examinations. People pay less attention to the health of the                         kidneys. We want to change this situation by using our portable urine testing equipment.                         According to the practical data, we have found that more than 80% of respondents are willing to                         use our products. Considering about the binding time of antigen and antibody and the                         corresponding time of liquid crystal, the acceptable waiting time for respondents is about 40                         minutes. We will shorten the waiting time under the condition of ensuring the accuracy of                         measurement in the subsequent experiments.
This interview and sample survey enriched our project background data. We analyzed and processed                         the data obtained from the survey and found that our project does have certain market demand.                         This also laid the foundation for our subsequent optimization of experimental conditions.

Interviews with doctors
In August 2018, the team members went to Linyi City People's Hospital of Shandong Province to                         interview Dr. Liu Haijun, a specialist in nephrology. We knew that early diagnosis and treatment                         are extremely important in delaying the development of kidney disease. Only when the patient has                         obvious symptoms will he go to the hospital for an examination. But they may already have                         entered the dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).
Blood test is the most common diagnosis method of the hospital currently. It takes ¥48 to test                         the blood β2-microglobulin. However, Dr.Liu said that if a portable urine test method can be                         developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood drawing, but also greatly improve the                         awareness of diabetes patients and the rate of early visits.
In this interview we exchanged ideas with doctors, and we have learned that from a clinical                         perspective, our project is more suitable for use at home. It can greatly arouse the awareness                         of early patients, which can indirectly improve the diagnosis rate and provide the best time for                         treatment.

The PCR buffer mix
Jess analysing the gel after DNA electrophoresis using GelDoc
PCR was carried out with both the ara primers on Bacillus genomic DNA, and the sspb primers on E.coli genomic DNA prepared yesterday. We expected to see a ~170bp band for the ara regulatory sequence, and a ~570bp band for the sspb coding sequence. The Metal team were also doing PCR work today so we made our solutions as a whole to save time and resources. Overall there were 10 reactions.
We did our two PCRs as well as negative controls that contained everything other than the genomic DNA.
Firstly the primers had to be rehydrated and put into Phil's primer database. The primers are rehydrated in PCR water. the volume of this is 5X the 'Amount Of Oligo' (nM) which can be found on the IDT datasheet for every oligo sent to us.
To put them into the primer database, the name must be entered, as well as the sequence, number of bp and company used. (Ask Chris to log onto the database.) The primer number can be written on the blue cap.
After rehydration 10ul of primer can be aliquoted into separate eppendorfs from the original tube sent. This means that the original tube probably won't have to be reopened again, and can be put into storage in the primer box in the -20 freezer. The 10ul aliquots can then be diluted again to 1:10, by adding 90ul PCR water. After use the primer aliquots can be put into a separate box in the -20 also (iGEM Diluted primers 1:10).
As there were 10 reactions overall we made up 180ul of buffer mix (sufficient for 10 reactions +2 as the protocol suggests)
Added:
60ul dNTPs
60ul buffer
60ul DMSO
These can be found in the 'stock solutions' box in the -20 freezer.
We then diluted the taq Polymerase sufficient for our 10 reactions at 1 Unit per reaction. The taq stock is 5U/ul, therefore we used 3ul (enough for 15 reactions)of stock solution and 12ul PCR water.
We entered all of our volumes of our solutions on a PCR Experiment sheet. The volume of water can be calculated by making the final volume up to 50ul.
We labelled 4 PCR eppendorfs and added"

Furthermore, iGEM Team TU Darmstadt was working with this tRNA and the OMeY-synthetase. Our Team is using the tRNA in this project to incorporate the canonical amino acid tyrosine with Y-RS in response to an amber stop codon as well as an ONBY with an ONBY-RS in E. coli. Furthermore, DMNBS synthetase variants undergo screening for incorporation efficiency and fidelity, which are done by using this BioBrick. These variants are proven to work with the tRNA and are all listed in the section Parts Collection . Incorporation of ncAA: The tRNA contains an amber anticodon for incorporating the ncAA in response to a recoded amber termination codon. It has been used previously in an amberless E. coli strain C321.∆A.expb as well as in BL21 DE3 gold. When working with a recoded amber codon in BL21 DE3, the tRNA is competing with the release factor1 at the amber stop codon. As amber stop codons add up to only about 7% of total stop codos, amber suppression still works appropriately. An application of the tRNA is either the incorporation of the ncAA into a protein or usage with a reporter plasmid (for example pFRY ) for probing ncAA tRNA/synthetase pair variants regarding efficiency and fidelity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA:
Figure 1:  pACYC derived plasmid with tRNA and a cognate synthetase
Most synthetases are used with low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator (fig. 1). Elements of orthogonality:

In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview. Firstly, we obtained more knowledge about the background of producing hydrogen, and thus, we have a much clearer concept of the current hydrogen-producing situation in China. Secondly, we knew more detailed advantages and disadvantages about hydrogen production catalyzed by nanomaterials. No doubt we received precious encouragements for our project.

Conferences
 
1. CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee)
 
On 2nd-4th September, our team was invited by Sun Yat-sen University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee). The summit was a rehearsal of the Giant Jamboree in September. All the 26 teams invited to the summit were asked to give presentations about their project. The audience can ask questions about them. Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China. We also brought our posters with us and discussed our projects with teams all around China.
 
During CCiC, our posters and presentations were very popular among all of the teams. Some of the iGEM teams that had great interests in our project came up with lots of suggestions and advice, which were of great help to improve our project. We owe great thanks to Mr. Haoqian Zhang, who gave us important suggestions about how to present our project in a logical order. He said that our photosynthetic system could be applied to other model organisms as long as we change the cell surface display protein, which is very inspiring.
 
The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology. The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.

Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

JUDGING FORM
On this page you will find sections detailing the results we got on our journey for creating the BioBricks we submitted to the registry this year.
Not shown are the many attempts necessary, and the failed creation of other BioBricks. For example, we were unsuccessful in creating BioBricks K2268005 and K2268006, but our failure (together with other data) suggests that the uninduced levels of MazF expression was simply too high and too great a threat to cell vitality.
PCR to Generate Fragments for Gibson Assembly
Fragments obtained from IDT to construct our plasmid designs were not suitable for Gibson Assembly. Therefore, we ordered primers and performed PCR to generate fragments with homology to each other and/or the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. These fragments were resolved on an agarose gel (shown on the right).
The first lane contains our molecular weight marker: Lambda DNA digested with EcoRI and PstI. the first small yellow box shows amplification of a single fragment containing all the genes for construct K2268006 (MazF and cI repressor). The second yellow box shows the various fragments (representing LacZ-alpha, cI repressor, or MazF-ssrA with appropriate homologies) that were subsequently used in Gibson Assembly (after purification, of course!).
Colony PCR to Verify Clone is Correct
For construct K2268004, the Gibson Assembly was apparently successful, and multiple clones were obtained. The Gibson control reaction and transformation control also worked. These clones were amplified using the standard iGEM sequencing primers, VF2 and VR, which have homology to the pSB1C3 backbone.
The first lane contains a successful colony PCR, giving a band that corresponds in size to the genes of construct K2268004 (compare with similar band from previous section). The second band is our molecular weight marker, Lambda DNA digested with EcoRI and PstI (prepared in-house"

Panel A describes the split-GFP system, where separate subunits of a split-GFP protein are expressed separately from the lacI and tetR regulated promoters. If both subunits are present they reassociate into a functional fluorescent protein. In Panel B, each module expresses a subunit of the T7 RNA polymerase, which in the presence of both subunits reassociate into a functional enzyme that drives transcription from a T7 promoter. This representation of the T7 RNAP AND-gate output drives GFP expression.
Methods
Standard molecular biology techniques.
During this work, a standardised set for routine laboratory techniques were used such as restriction digest, gel electrophoresis, preparation of chemically competent E. coli, transformation of chemically competent E. coli, ligation reactions, oligonucleotide annealing, and PCR. These can be found on our protocols page . All ligation reactions described herein were transformed into NEB5α commercial chemically competent E. coli cells, plated on L-agar containing the required antibiotics, and grown at 37°C overnight.
Table 1: E. coli strains utilised during this subproject, their genotypes, and specific roles.
PCR design
Split T7 RNA polymerase: PCR primers were designed to split T7 RNAP into two separate BioBrick compatible parts designed according to Shis and Bennett (2013) [4] . In their work, the 880 amino acid protein was split into 179 aa N-terminal, and a 701 aa C-terminal fragments. Forward and reverse primers to generate these two fragments were designed using Primer3 [5] , aiming for primer annealing temperatures of roughly 60°C, and are shown in Table 2.

Colours denote features: blue text = flanking DNA; yellow highlight = Biobrick prefix (F) or suffix (R); green highlight = B0032 ribosome binding site; orange text = Biobrick scar sequence; red highlight = new stop codon(s); purple = new start codon; unformatted text = annealing section of primer.
Primer design included the insertion of the weak strength ribosome binding site (RBS) B0032 upstream of the start codon of"

Collaboration
HUST-China
This year HUST-China’s project is related to Shewanella, which we used in 2017, so they contacted with us for some help. We provide WT Shewanella, plasmid pYYDT, and E.coli wm3040 with them, and we also shared some experimental experience and gave some suggestions to them.
Peking
This year we got in touch with team Peking from Peking University during the 5th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer community) and discussed about our projects. After that we kept in close touch, exchanging ideas about project and modelling, which we’ve learnt a lot from each other.
USTC-Software
This year we helped USTC-Software to test their “Biotech” and provided them with some useful advice.
Fudan
Team members from team Fudan came to USTC and we had an amusing meet-up. We communicated about our projects and provided advice with each other.
Nanjing-China
We came to Nanjing University to meet with members from team Nanjing-China. During the meet-up we had shared a lot about our project and some experience with each other.
XJTU-China & JLU-China & BNU-China
This year, we and members from team XJTU-China, Jilin-China and BNU-China gathered together in a conference held by University of Science and Technology of China and had a short meet-up. We communicated about projects, interlab measurement, problems we met in experiments and so on. We all got some support from each other.
Conference
The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community
This year, we participated into a great party hosted by ShanghaiTech University——Conference of China iGEMer community (also known as CCiC). During this conference, amazing presentations were performed to show out every team’s creative project. In addition, during the panel session, members from each team came up to the stage to share their experience in this iGEM competition, either the happiest one or the most"
