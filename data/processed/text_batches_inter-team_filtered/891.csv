Introduction
‘Hello World!’ are the first words a programmer prints when learning a new programming language. Analogously, our team decided to do a ‘Hello World’ project in order to familiarize ourselves with lab techniques that we used later on to construct plasmids. Specifically we were performing PCR with uracil-containing primers, purifying PCR products and ligating them by means of USER cloning [1].
Since we are working with many periplasmic proteins, we wanted to try to target proteins to the periplasm. To do this, we used periplasmic signal peptides from the TAT and Sec pathways, and with a translational fusion of the signal peptide to GFP, we expressed GFP in the periplasm. Simultaneously, we expressed RFP in the cytoplasm as a background color, inspired by Skoog, Karl, et al. [2].
Methods
Construction
The overal goal was to test the twin arginine pathway (TAT) and whether this signal peptide could transport GFP SF into the periplasm. The reason why we choose to use GFP superfolder (SF) was that this variant has been shown to fold faster than the E. coli transport system is at translocation, [3]. This assures that the GFP will form its fluorophore before translocation to the more reductive periplasmic space. Thus it will not be inactivated by the inhibition of fluorophore formation as seen in other oxidative compartments like the ER [4].
Construction of the plasmids was done with USER-cloning and assembly of 3 fragments. The starting point was a plasmid construct with RFP and GFP SF respectively. The RFP and GFP SF were amplified"

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

Step 01: After starting the program this screen is displayed. It has of three views: Construct, Verify and Synthesize. The later two can only be entered if a valid logic network has been constructed.
Step 02: Add a new gate via double clicking.
Step 03: Add two more gates in the same way.
Step 04: You can change the type of the logic gates via the combo box
Step 05: Change the type to: Input, Not, Output.
Step 06: Clicking inside the area of a gate selects it (indicated by the blue color). You can select as many logical gates as you like. To deselect, click on the empty space between the gates. Once a gate is selected you can delete it by pressing the DEL or BACKSPACE key.
Step 07: To connect two gates select both. Note that the connections has a direction (which will be indicated by an arrow), thus you have to select the gate in the correct order: first, select the box from which the connection starts and then select the box where the connection ends (The arrow points from the box that generates an output transmitter molecule, to the target box that will be activated by this output transmitter). You can only connect gates pairwise.
Step 08: Two gates have been connected.
Step 09: Connected the whole network.
Step 10: Press the ""Set input ..."" button on the input to select a promoter that controls the input.
Step 11: Choose one of the exemplary chosen BioBricks and press set.
Step 12: Press the ""Set output ..."" button on the output to select an output.
Step 13: You can chose a BioBrick or enter a custom made sequence (DNA with or without RBS, RNA).
Step 14: The logic network has been constructed. Press on the Button ""2. Verify your network"" to leave the construction view. If you have made mistakes during the construction process, an error message will be displayed.
Step 15: Check your network.
Step 16: By selecting or deselecting the checkbox on the inputs one can study the flow of logical value through the network.
Step 17: Press ""Synthesize"" and the logic network gets turned into DNA. The resulting DNA can get represented in four different views depending on the level of detail you wish to see.

Wet Lab Works:
The laboratory that we used belongs to Prof. Mahinur Akkaya, who is also our instructor. We are very glad for her great support to our team and for the all stuff that she presented us and we present our happiness here.  The PCR machine (we call it “umut”(in English ,hope)) and the water bath we got from  Assoc. Prof. Cagdas Son. Furthermore, Assoc. Prof. Yesim Aydin Son helped us very much in our bioinformatic issues. Thanks to all!
We used the experience and some materials from last year's METU iGEM team. Furthermore, the most of the protocols that we used in wet lab were provided to us by Taylan Beyaztas, our wet lab advisor, we are very grateful to him for his great support. Also, we thank to our other wet lab advisor Çaglar Özketen for his help. Some parts that we finished are retrieved from Baskent Medical IGEM team. Also we used the Kill switch part from Berkeley`s system.
The whole wet lab works were done by undergraduate students, from freshmen to senior students, from lab cleaning up to transformations or gel extraction. We always prepared our own gels, or plates from zero. We should be thankful to all students who have worked hard there... Berke, Seda ,Alisan, Burak, Selin, Kübra, Özge, Oguz, Emre, Ekin, Gözde and Özgün.
Berke was the mastermind behind igem metu 2012. Without him, we would not have come together to form our new friendships and we would never have gotten the chance to get this much fun and experience.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Ozonation as a satisfactory solution. Additionally, Jesper Olsson’s statement “With PAC, the pharmaceuticals are not eliminated, they end up in the sludge’’ spotlighted another flaw of Ozonation (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). When the conversation ended up on Activated Carbon the investigators voiced that: “The biggest concern is the production of PAC if we are going to implement both technologies, which is a very energy consuming process. With GAC, a technique similar to the one the drinking water plants use to take away organic pesticides, the cost is much higher’’ (Study visit J Olsson, E Kusoffsky 15 Aug 2018).
Taking into account all the relevant data and information we managed to collect about the existing solutions, we considered useful to create a landscape map in order to synthesize an overview of the field.
Figure 3. Landscape of the existing solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in WWTPs.
From the first sight of the landscape map in Figure 3, it is apparent that there is a great need for a new solution that will meet the capabilities of Activated Carbon for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In addition, the solution would need to be energy efficient without creating unknown by-products with unknown ecotoxic effects and it would not need to be coupled with another solution in order to sustain low costs.
In support to this conclusion comes the statement from Stefan Berg, SYVAB’s process engineer at Himmelfjärds WWTP during our skype meeting: “Ozonation can be good, but not enough if you have tough restrictions. Although it is very common to have Ozonation followed by PAC or GAC, I would prefer one technique and not a combination’’ (Skype call S Berg 29 Aug 2018).
Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that WWTPs are indeed examining their available options for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater and are susceptible to implement a solution that covers their unmet needs.
Our Solution - Biotic Blue
The bead...
In order to limit the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment we developed Biotic Blue, an enzymatic solution exploiting synthetic biology - based techniques. Diving into the molecular level, Biotic Blue comprises of a mutant oxidoreductase, the laccase enzyme from the polypore mushroom Trametes versicolor, immobilized on magnetic beads. In more detail, our mutant laccase, approximately 55 kDa in size and improved for degrading SMX, differs from the wild-type laccase by three amino acids. The bulky,"

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burk"

The human gut houses a diverse collection of microorganisms, with important implications for the health and welfare of the host. They aimed to engineer a member of this microbial community to provide innovative medical treatments. Our work focuses on four main areas: (1) pathogen defense either by expression of pathogen-specific bacteriophage or by targeted bursts of reactive oxygen species; (2) prevention of birth defects by folate over-expression and delivery; (3) treatment of lactose intolerance by cleaving lactose to allow absorption in the large intestine; and (4) regulation of these three treatment functions to produce renewable subpopulations specialized for each function.

In order to help guard against infections of the gut, we wish to engineer a strain of E. coli capable of killing bacterial pathogens. White bloodcells are able to do this, but they do migrate to large intestinal lumen where pathogens can reside. Since E-coli is adapted to this environment, it is a good candidate . Acylhomoserine lactones(AHL) are small communication molecules between bacteria. AHL is able to diffuse across membrane. This communication system contains two main components LuxI, an AHL producer and LuxR  an AHL dependent transcriptional activator. Engenired E.Coli strain is able to detect AHL from pathogens. This pathogen detection activates pyruvate oxidase which uses pyruvate to produce hydrogen perioxide, to kill the pathogens. An E.Coli catalase was used to protect the cell from cells killing, so they first were able to accumulate hydrogen perioxide before oxidative burst otherwise perioxide production would lead killing of the cell only. LuxR activates several gene including LuxI. Here they used LuxR in a sensing mechanism.  When LuxR binds AHL its will overexpress"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Maker Movement.
The movement of makers. The maker movement.
To exemplify the power of the Maker Movement and its capabilities, we printed a 3D model of the Fort Pitt bridge, one of the iconic bridges of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and used it to house luminescent Luciferase. We designed our model using SolidWorks and Meshmixer, making sure to keep the parts saved as separate pieces. We used an Assembly file (.SLDASM) to compile the different parts and see what the final bridge would look like. Seen below is the SolidWorks rendering of our completed 3D model:
After we had a complete model, we had to order the filament that our bridge would be made of. We chose PLA for all parts of it, using three different colors; Honeycomb Drone Yellow, Honeycomb Drone Black, and Taulman 3D t-glase. The roads were made of black, the iGEM lettering of t-glase, and the rest made of yellow filament. Once we had our filament, we were ready to start printing, which we did at the Techshop (techshop.ws) using a Printrbot. Before printing the final pieces we had to refine the settings for maximum stability and detail. We created a few prototypes in order to test these settings, which are seen below.
Finally, after we had the settings adjusted correctly, we got to printing out the pieces. This proved to be a fairly easy process, although we ran into problems along the way like the machines getting jammed and the prints stopping halfway through, meaning that a complete restart was necessary. Seen below are various photos and videos taken during the printing process. Although we had to change some settings depending on the intricacy of the current part, most were around 20-25% Infill, 0.2mm layer height, 0.8mm outer shell, print speed 20, flow 100. I also included a raft support on the particularly detail oriented parts like the roof and the iGEM lettering in order to get better adhesion in the first few layers.
Once we had all of our printed pieces, we sanded them in order to get smooth edges on the parts. We then assembled them with superglue (Except for the reservoir that sits"

--------------------------------
Make glycerol stocks of yeast cells in test media before making measurements.
Discovered as of 5 pm no growth on any of the yeast transformation plates. Will most likely have to do these transformations again.  This will require preparing the necessary DNA for linearizations.
The following minipreps are needed:

pRS304*
pRS305
pRS306
Innoculated 20 mL cultures with the #1 glycerol stock in all cases.
For the E. coli ligations, observed at least one colony on each plate!  Success! Also observed the beginning of contamination on several of the plates.  Chose colonies that were removed from this contamination for use in innoculating cultures.  Also decided to replate all of them due to this contamination.
The following successful ligations were grown in culture (20 mL) and on plates:
A3 -CNTerm
C3 - K266
D3 - K259
E3 - K323
F3 - K329

When it comes to POCT products specially, they will have to firstly recognized by JCAHO and CAP, and finally authorize and certificate by JCAHO, CMS and CAP. [3]
In terms of the usage of POCT products, owing to the fact that there is not much barrier, the superintendence is therefore the key to optimizing POCT and enlarging its range of application.

Working on synthetic biology in a lab is amazing, but sharing our enthusiasm can be even more wonderful. For the science education, we worked with people from all walks of life including teenagers, citizens, freshmen and XMU students.
Xiamen Science and Technology Museum
This year our team XMU-China came to Xiamen Science and Technology Museum to advocate the synthetic biology and our project. The whole project about 3 parts, game, Poster and Wish Wall. First, the game part, children play the roles of antibody and antigen respectively, they battled to be the winner by RPS. After the game they all left a deep impression of the general method that our body fight with cancer. Second，Poster，we had some talkative teammates to take charge of this part, so many student from high school and primary school were attracted ,they crowded in front of the poster and listened to our announcers absorbedly. Finally, the Wish Wall part, after our diverse introductions about the synthetic biology, they had learn a lot about it, and some of them even inspire to give their contributions to synthetic biology, and want to attend the innovative, fantastic competition —— iGEM. It's also a cheerful Day for our team to propagate the synthetic biology to so many children.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," an sgRNA is limited in terms of size to about 20-25 base pairs and since there were no PAM sites near our 9 base pair region of interest, we had to improvise. We ended up making a synonymous site directed mutation within the GFP gene in order to artificially introduce a PAM site on the bottom strand. This allowed for the design of an sgRNA capable of interacting with our region of interest.
GFP targeting. GFP was targeted for Cas9 cleavage. A silent point mutation was introduced into a wild type GFP at the 183rd base pair. This mutation created a PAM sequence recognizable by Cas9. An sgRNA was designed and introduced to complement a 20 base pair segment downstream of the PAM site.
Upon constructing all of the genetic components of our project, we set about testing our system's functionality. We first transformed DH5α cells with our Cas9/sgRNA plasmid. Expression of these elements was under the control of a tetracycline promoter and the plasmid backbone was pSB1C3. The plasmid also constitutively expressed TetR, thereby allowing for the regulation of Cas9/sgRNA expression. The part number for this Cas9/sgRNA/TetR plasmid is BBa_K2477014. These cells containing the Cas9/sgRNA expression cassette were made into chemically competent cells.
The XL1-Red strain of E. Coli was used to generate GFP mutants. BBa_K2477003 (GFP  (with artificial PAM site) plasmids in pSB3K3 were transformed into XL1-Red cells and cultured overnight. Part of the culture was subjected to a plasmid prep, yielding a library of mutant GFP plasmids. The rest of the culture was subcultured overnight, and the subsequent culture underwent plasmid prep, yielding another library of mutant GFP plasmids. These plasmid libraries are dubbed “Mutant GFP P1” and “Mutant GFP P2” for 1 or 2 days of passage in the XL1-red mutator strain. Alternative methods of generating mutants such as error prone PCR could have been used, but we elected to use a mutator strain due to the availability of materials and the simplicity of its use.
The resulting plasmid libraries were transformed into the Cas9 competent cells. Alongside the GFP mutant library, we also transformed our Cas9/sgRNA competent cells with a plasmid constitutively expressing non-mutagenized GFP containing a PAM site (BBa_K"

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Indigo_-_-_TEXT.html," colonies were taken with an inoculation loop and inoculated on LB plates for growth.
Microbial Identification by rRNA Sequencing
To identify bacterial species, 16S sequences were amplified from isolated colonies by PCR. These samples were sequenced via Sanger sequencing (GATC Biotech), and identified through BLAST alignment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The full protocol can be found here .
Fungi were identified through 18S rRNA sequencing. For each candidate species, one colony from an LB plate was inoculated on Sabouraud media and left to grow for 3 days. Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit and a modified protocol, and was then used for 18S rRNA PCR (protocol can be found here ).
Quantification of Indigo Consumption
Indigo plates : we used minimal M9 media and added indigo dissolved in DMSO, until blue color was visible in the plates. Candidate strains were then inoculated on M9-indigo plates and left to grow at 30°C.
Liquid M9 with indigo : 700µL of indigo in DMSO at 50mM was first added to 500mL Minimal M9 media. We put 5mL M9-indigo in 50 mL Falcon tubes, then put 20µL 50mM indigo in DMSO to have a deep blue color. Colonies from LB plates were used for inoculation. Tubes were left in a shaking incubator at 30°C for one week. Indigo Consumption was quantified using absorbance. Indigo strongest absorbance was determined at 680nm. Measurements were made every 24 hours for each strains for 6 days: 500µL media from previous 50mL falcon tubes were collected, vortexed, and 200µL were used in 96 well-plates. Absorbance was also measured at 450nm, for which indigo has a weak absorbance, to measure absorbance of cells and other things that can interfere with the absorbance at 680nm. Absorbance measurements were performed using a TECAN plate reader.
Stained cotton : small pieces of cotton were stained with around 100µL 50mM indigo dissolved in DMSO (sometimes more indigo was needed to completely stain the cotton). The cotton was washed at high temperatures, then sterilized with an ethanol wash. These pieces are then placed on M9 plates and liquid culture to assess indigo consumption on cotton.

Result
For characterisation we created the constructs yenbox_WT-B0034-GFP ( BBa_K1381008 ) and yenbox_J23113-B0034-GFP ( BBa_K1381009 ), where the yenbox fused with a promoter was coupled to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These constructs were then cloned into the backbones pSB1C3 and pSB3C17 and transformed into competent E. coli cells already containing one of the YenR constructs J23110-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381005 ), J23102-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381006 ) or J23101-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381007 ) on the backbone pSB1K3. The double transformed cells were then streaked on plates containing both the antibiotic Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol and left it overnight to grow. Cells containing only the constructs yenbox_promoter-B0032-GFP were also streaked and left to grow.
The following day, overnight cultures were prepared and left for 16 h to grow into stationary phase. After that, 10 µL of the overnight culture was put into 500 µL of PBS solution and left for one hour for stabilization. The green fluorescence production was then measured using a flow cytometer. The results of the test is shown below.
Graph 1 above, shows the induction relative to the base level of expression. In graph 1.A. we can observe the induction but cannot predict to what extent. This is because these cells are transformed with two high copy plasmids containing the same ori (origin of replication). The consequence will be that the cells will confuse the two plasmids with each other and have no control of in what amount the two respective plasmids are present. It will only ensure that it is 100-300 plasmids present in total, regardless of which plasmid it is. This is why we also cloned the yenbox containing constructs into a low copy plasmid with a different ori than the high copy ones.
In graph 1.B., it can be seen that the amount of YenR that is produced is correlated, as expected, to the rate of the induction. When coupled to the strongest of the three promoters, J23102 ( BBa_J23102 ), the production is increased up to five folds.
In graph 1.C., we did not observe any induction  This implies that our customized version of the yenbox fused with the promoter J23113"

Because the ITC experiment requires a higher protein concentration and buffer composition. The preliminary analyses lead to unsatisfactory results are as follows. 1) The low concentration of ligand and receptor leads to less meaningful data. 2)VEGF is an insoluble protein, probably due to its poor solubility in buffer (20 mM HEPES + 150 mM NaCl) resulting to lower protein concentration in solution. 3) The activation of proteins in solution buffer were weaken.
We’ ll do further experiments to confirm our conclusion, by optimizing the method of protein expression and purification as well as the contains of solution buffer.

KDR is a receptor with immunoglobulins-like domain. Not a standard antibody, KDR still has some homology with antibodies. We got the crystal structure of KDR binding to VEGF from protein data bank (3v2a.pdb). However, some key residues are missing, probably because of the accuracy of solution structure. We used SWISS-MODEL [9][10][11][12][13] to rebuild the structure. Then, RosettaAntibodyDesign was operated. We tried GraftDesign, replacing whole CDR H3 with a CDR structure from antibody database. The interface energy has decreased from -41.850 to -43.639 REU. Thanks to the GraftDesign, the CDR H3 has been replaced by a longer one, and the contact area has increased a lot.

Week 5
6.23.15
Goal: Make cultures and plate cells.
Made 2 mL overnight cultures of cells that will later be used in the microplate reader to measure fluorescence.
MACH empty, Top 10 empty, 3 devices + top 10, 3 devices + mach
Plated both the mach and competent cells overnight on LB plates to see if they would grow to use for the biological and technical replicate part of the interlab.
Technical is more how many times we repeated something.
Biological is doing new sets of colonies.
6.24.15
Goal: Measure fluorescence for MACH and competent cells.
Took out Mach and Top10 Competent Cells to do measurements of flouresence with on a TECAN microplate reader.
Used same TECAN parameters as 6.02.15 except used a Gain of 100 instead of 150.
Estrogen Sensor:
7.1.15
Tried newly transformed cells, all taken from the same plate
Tried to get similar-sized colonies
Tested the following amounts of estrogen:
100 uM, 20 uM, 10 uM, 1 uM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 0 nM
Got very varied and inconsistent results
No pattern between amount of estrogen added & reading
High standard deviation
Think that there is a problem with the transformation
Will try another transformation
7.2.15
Tried the restreaked  cells with 1:100,000, 1:1,000,000, and 1:10,000,000 estrogen dilutions
High standard deviation amongst duplicates, no pattern between amount of estrogen added & reading
Determined that restreaked cells do not work
7.7.15
Transformation 4 of Mach cells did not work
Gave unexpected results with high standard deviation
Did not seem to be a difference between the different amounts of estrogen
For tomorrow:
Do another transformation -- possibly get Donna & Michelle to do it
Try again with the colonies we have now
7.29.15
Made dilutions (1:100) from the starter cultures for the estrogen sensors and controls.
Set up transformations for CD-cel Gaussia (on plates and in culture) for testing of luciferase activity in response to addition of coelenterazine.
The isolation of CD-cel domain and gaussia domain didn’t work.

Without the collaboration with other iGEM teams, our project would not have been successful. Thank you!
Reached out to various stakeholders, charities, public services and many others to make sure our device addresses real-world needs in a responsible and efficient way.
Integrated the investigated issues into the design of your project by modelling the cost analysis of the AlcoPatch and finding suitable alternatives for risk-posing substances used in this project.
Improved an existing BioBrick by adding two missing restriction sites – XbaI and SpeI making assembly process easier.
Characterised previously existing BioBricks BBa_K1033930 and BBa_K1033925 .
Demonstrated a functional proof of concept of our project.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," beehive. BeeT's biocontainment was ensured through the introduction of an optogenetic kill switch and a Cas9 kill switch. We also modeled various parts of BeeT: the optogenetic kill switch, the subpopulation dynamics circuit, the effects of the method of application on the chassis, and the effect of BeeT on mite and bee population dynamics.
BeeT should only affect Varroa mites. To accomplish this, we decided to use Cry toxins. These toxins are naturally produced by Bacillus thuringiensis and therefore also known as Bt toxins. A functional Cry toxin is only effective when specific binding occurs to the gut membrane of the target organism. After binding, the Cry toxins will form pores in the cell membrane, resulting in cell death 1 . To find a Cry toxin active against V. destructor we engineered our own toxins, and also searched for them in nature.
Because testing toxins on Varroa mites in vivo is near to impossible, we developed an in vitro test for Cry toxins.  Due to their parasitic nature, mites in laboratory conditions are very fragile and frequently die irrespectively of their treatment. For the new assay, we made Brush Border Membrane Vesicles (BBMV's) out of the membranes of Varroa mite. The vesicles were loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein. Any functional Cry toxin will create pores into the BBMV's, which results in the leaking of fluorophores out of the BBMV's. Due to the self-quenching behaviour of 6-carboxyfluorescein, the leaking can be measured as an increase in fluorescence. As a proof of principle, BBMV's from the gut of Tenebrio molitor were made and loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein to test the pore formation ability of Cry3Aa, which is known to be toxic to T. molitor larvae 2 .  Figure 1a shows how the fluorescence of BBMV's incorporated with fluorophores increases in the presence and absence of Cry3Aa. The kinetic value was calculated for the process, which are shown in Figure 1b. From this we concluded that the in vitro toxicity assay can be used to test for functionality of Cry toxins.
Figure 1. (a) The fluorescence of two solutions with BBMV's obtained from T. molitor incorporated with fluorophores were measured over time, one in the presence and one in the absence of Cry3Aa. (b) The reaction rate constants for six individual measurements were calculated"

Escaping bacteria from lab by disposing wastes without autoclave might harm the environment that includes natural life.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
An entry to our lab space without any permission, which may occur after losing the key to our lab.  The entry allows the individuals to do an abuse of the regents.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
Follow the rule for lab safety. No entry for those who have little concern.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What would happen if all your dreams came true, and your project grew from a small lab study into a commercial/industrial/medical product that was used by many people? We invite you to speculate broadly and discuss possibilities, rather than providing definite answers. Even if the product is ""safe"", please discuss possible risks and how they could be addressed, rather than simply saying that there are no risks at all.
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
A toxic protein can be produced using parts we are going to make.  Any materials in our lab should not be transferred without a permission from our instructor.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
Be careful not to talk information and details of our experiment to others.

In our project, we examined the use of Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) to confirm whether the lengthened metallothionein combined with heavy metals. To use their metals safely, we discussed the potential dangers and how to treat them, with our team members and some professors.
First, Cd is harmful to living things, so one of our members anticipated giving damage to health of experimenters, causing pollution, and destroying ecosystem. But the damage to health of experimenters will not happen unless Cd enters the body through our mouths, and the pollution and the destruction of ecosystem do not happen when waste liquors are disposed following the standard"

Introduction
Humans, as a species rely on energy greatly since the industrial revolution; whether it is for lighting, heating; or much              more advanced systems of contemporary life. Thus, it's fair to say that security in electric energy supply is essential to              us which made us rely heavily on fossil fuels (McDaniel et al., 2002).
Problem Statement
Typical energy sources of now; which are petroleum, coal and natural gas have proven to bring tremendous economic progress              where they are abundant (Abu-Rub et al., 2014). Worldwide primary energy consumption has grown by 1,8% in 2012 alone              (Abu-Rub et al., 2014). In the same year; coal, natural gas, and oil accounted for 87% of the global primary energy consumption              (Cusick, 2013). With this data, it’s fair to conclude that we are actually growing more dependent to fossil fuels by the day.
A dependency like this is very unhealthy; since such fuels' combustion produce plenty of air pollutants, which contribute to              greenhouse gas emissions, also the resources are very limited (Radovič, 2006; Frost, 2015). Furthermore, they cause a plethora              of political and socio-economical problems; which can reach catastrophic levels, even in regions prospering from them (Radovič, 2006).              They are like a poisonous band-aid to a larger problem.
Among fossil fuels, oil starts hurting us even before getting a chance to be used; when they are being transferred (Nikiforuk, 2016).              Oil spills happen more than one would think; just in 2016, 11 oil spills happened just near the lake in Saskatchewan (Suzuki, 2016).
Cleaning an oil spill comes at a hefty price; costs can snowball up"
RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," sufficient training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future, and indeed, it will be a significant threat to the current biosafety basis. Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, and the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, in which we found no laws related to credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of a center for disease control and prevention. He said that in his experiment with the disease caused by the bacteria leak, vast impacts such as environmental pollution had been observed. and our country has been making great effort towards elimenating such leakage accidents and incidents. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, rather it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, in which the outbreak of pathogens caused significant physical and social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, and the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing. In a biosafety forum in October, we invited a team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teachers from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in their DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve its safety and security concerns is through implanting biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMers, we should strive to be the considerate and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all over China, in which we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China contrasted with the lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between schools to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually"

Characterisation
Initial testing of these three chromoprotein reporter variants was conducted by inoculating 1ml of LB containing the antibiotic Chloramphenicol with a colony from each colour proven by colony PCR and sequencing data to be correct and grown at 37° for 2 hours as well as a control of wildtype DH5α. Cultures were then plated onto a LB agar + Chloramphenicol plate which were then innoculated in four locations with 10μl of connector 2 (C12 - Rhl) and grown overnight resulting in the picture below.
Figure 5: Initial Testing of Chromoprotein Reporter Variants
There is a visible vibrant colour change present for both the spisPink and the aeBlue chromoprotein variants however, as the colour of the amajLime is very similar to the wildtype colour, both in cultures, pelleted and plated, the colour is difficulty distinguished. For this reason, it was decided to carry forward the two brightest chromoproteins for further testing while optimising amajLime separately. In order to test these two chromoproteins reporter variants into the Sensynova framework, cultures of IPTG detector, processor unit and three reporter modules, two chromopreteins and the sfGFP control, were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12,5ng/μl). The cultures were then diluted at OD600: 0,1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:1 and 1:1:13. Some samples were supplemented with 1mM IPTG to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 6, 7, 8).

This is a very big clue on the fact, that some HA4 proteins are also in the same protein solution then SH2-cI after elution. Therefore it is possible, that SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ are    interacting with each other.
Interaction Measurement with BLItz
With the affinity chromatography experiment a first clue of an interaction between SH2 and HA4 was given. To validate the results a second experiment was implemented. The direct interaction of SH2 and HA4 was measured with the BLItz System of ForteBio. For the BLItz (Bio-layer interferometry) measurement it is necessary to immobilize one of your proteins at the biosensor surface of your tip with a biocompatible matrix. The BLItz system works by emiting white light down the biosensor and collecting any light reflected back.   Reflected wavelength are are affected by the thickness of the coating on the optical layer. Some of these wavelength show some interferences, which are captured by a spectrometer as a unique spectral signature. Any change in the number of molecules bound to the biosensor causes a shift in the interference   pattern that is measured in real time. Therefore, it is possible to measure if two proteins are realy interacting with each other.    In our case the HA4 protein was fixed with a amino matrix directly at the biosensor. As the targets we choose obviously the SH2 protein and as a negativ control BSA, thereby it is excluded, that HA4 do not bind with every protein.   The figure 5 shows the results of the BLItz experiment. At first the basic interference was defined by doing a measurement with only PBS buffer . After 60 seconds the second protein was added to the PBS buffer. The green, black, orange and purple curve describe the results of adding SH2.    Directly after that point of SH2 addition the graph raises constantly. Therefore, a interference between the basic line and protein addition can be measured. Such an interference is only visible, if their is an interaction between our fixed protein (HA4) and our target (SH2). This is a proof, that these two    proteins are interacting with each other.
Figure 5: Results of the BLItz experiment. Illustrated are the measured base line, the association and the dissociation of the protein-protein interaction in the BLItz. The addition of the second protein is marked at 60 seconds after measuring the base line. The SH2-cI fusion protein was added at the start without washing (green), after one (purple) and"

All Principal Investigators, mentors, and undergraduate researchers were required to undergo complete lab safety training and take safety courses developed by Environment Health and Safety (EHS) prior to working in the lab. The mandatory safety training included updated versions of WHMIS course, occupational health and safety course, laboratory safety course, hazard assessment course,incident reporting and investigation course, spill response course, biosafety program course, biosafety laboratory course, and biosafety bloodborne pathogens course. The courses cover biological containment protocols, handling of hazardous materials, such as liquid nitrogen, and disposal of waste. All were required to take a test following each course which certifies safe lab work under EHS Guidelines. All members have received credit for each course and training program. Supervisors were always present in the lab to ensure the team was working safely.

Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety?
Researcher safety: Our project utilized Bacillus subtilis and a commonly used lab-strain of Escherichia coli TOP10 which are non-pathogenic and non-infectious as they are Biosafety Level 1 organisms (BSL-1). Thus the organisms were harmless to researchers.  Additionally, the team worked with HCT116 cell lines, and 1BR3 cell lines which are Human colon carcinoma and Human skin fibroblast cell and are classified as Biosafety Level 2(BSL-2).The cell lines were received from completely anonymous donors. We handled these cell lines at containment level 2 in accordance with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard and Biosafety Committee guidelines.
Public safety: Auxotrophy using Threonine was integrated in Bacillus making it unlikely it will survive outside of lab.
Environmental safety:  It’s possible our Bacillus incorporated with BBI could possibly outcompete native microbes, however the the bacteria’s survivability outside the lab has not been increased enough to make a significant difference

In experiment, synthetic biologists always find gene circuits formed by BioBricks are incompatible with the host cell, thus cannot work as expected. However, Biopano uses sequence alignment to analyze the possible reasons of the failure and design more acute gene circuit for your consideration.
Our Blast algorism derives from NCBI. However, the original version only offers sequence alignment and fails to analyze what impact the host environment might have on the injected gene circuit, let along predicts whether it will work.
Firstly, Biopano offers BioBrick searching to make it convenient for you to study all standardized biological parts on the official website of iGEM. Secondly, you can input a BioBrick and even construct a brand new sequence. Biopano will find the gene nodes of E.coli K-12 sharing the deepest homology with it based on authoritative Blast algorithm. Then you can Expand these nodes to find out the possible regulation on them. In this way, Biopano helps you analyze whether the injected gene circuit will actually work.
Biopano abstracts biological parts and the regulation among them into nodes and arcs to realize data visualization, and displays gene regulation and metabolism network of E.coli K-12 dynamically by continually Expanding nodes. Single database cannot make an entire material network, so our back end combines Regulon DB, KEGG, Uniprot and abundant data. You can ceaselessly Expand the nodes in the network to comb the relationship among them and satisfy your curiosity.
Compared with Biopano, Cytoscape and Netscience mainly support file importing and network displaying without powerful database from the back end. Hence you cannot search for biological parts online and view the certain part of the biological network you need with them.
Now that there is enormous astonishing material relationship in biological body, more and more biologists hope to find the specific function route between two biological parts or even two biological blocks that seem not related to each other, such as c-di-GMP signalling and Quorum Sensing. Unfortunately, the interactions of the biological parts are saved in database as records and it is almost impossible to find the route in thousands of records. There haven’t been any software to offer any help before. Luckily, Biopano brings hope to this.
You can input two biological parts and set several shortest routes, then you will find their relationship. We used this powerful function to find the specific relationship betweem c-di-GMP signalling and Quorum Sensing, which was corroborated by corresponding literature. How amazing!
We have to admit that Biopano may show you wrong gene route. However"

Purpose
We did not succeed in expression of tyrocidine from Brevibacillus parabrevis in Bacillus subtilis [ here ]. This inspired us to think of alternative approaches for production of nonribosomal peptide drugs than through NRPS engineering. We came up with a peculiar idea of generating short cyclized peptides with similar length to tyrocidine by using self-splicing proteins. Inteins are such short self-splicing proteins that have no function in the proteins they are a part of, besides catalyzing their own excision after translation. The splicing makes a peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids next to the inteins (Figure 1).  If the N-intein and C-intein are placed at each end of the same polypeptide; cyclisation would give a cyclized protein - or in our case a short cyclic peptide cyclized from head-to-tail.
Achievements
 
Designed constructs for expression of two short cyclic peptides using BioBrick BBa_K1362000  and two short oligo primers.
Generated the cyclisation construct
Analyzed constructs for cyclic peptides, but no products could be detected.
Background
Figure 1 N-intein and C-intein is spliced out by forming a leftover extein scar of the size of the N-extein and C-extein. The size and amino acid sequenceof the scar depends
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are not exclusive in their ability to produce short cyclic peptides. CyBase contains 818 entries of ribosomal head-to-tail cyclic "

Sharing designs becomes much easier, especially, since the creation of the data structure is quickly achieved. The compilation times are very reasonable as the column in the table above shows. We have confidence that as designs move to encompass 10’s or 100’s of devices, the compilation time will remain very reasonable.

Conclusions
Overall, Eugene is a human writeable language that demonstrates both efficient textual representation of biological systems but also the capability of validating constructs. It presents the ability to work both on lower level property information but also on a Device level design. Eugene proves to be a portable solution to large system designs through its connection to different databases. Furthermore, based on its direct one to one relationship to standard biological Parts, Eugene can be translated to visual designs and vice versa.
For future releases, it will be important to incorporate other control statements. The language will require a notion of systematically going through lists, which can be achieved through loops. This can be useful when different combinations of Parts or Devices need to be traversed and some operations on them performed. At the moment the highest level in the Parts Hierarchy are Devices. Ideally, we would like to extend Eugene to contain Systems and the ability to operate on such a level by providing built-in functions, which will depend on new assembly standards. At the same time the user should have the ability to create functions. This introduces the importance of scope in variables and instances, since functions should only apply to specific instances. Currently, all instances in a file can be accessed globally.  Another aspect in the language is the direct access to a database. By providing a function to connect to a specified database would certainly give more expressional power to the language. Currently, data base access is performed outside of Eugene by translating XML information from the database to Eugene code.

Attendance
Alaa, Dennis, Julian, Sindhu, Udhaya, Verena and Ela
1.) Money - GZMB
Julian has managed to write a letter for the GZMB to ask for money and let Prof. Dr. Rolf Daniel sign it. Prof. Daniel will send it this afternoon and we     should have a response within 2-3 days.
2.) Schedule – overview
Scaffoldins:
Finances needed: Maybe Prof. Daniel will pay for one of the constructs, ordering (2-3 weeks), vector cloning (4-6 weeks). Labwork could therefore start in     4-6 weeks
Dockerins:
Strains have to be ground and DNA isolated, PCR and cloning into pBAD, extraction and purification when fused to enzymes. Lab work can start now.
Enzymes:
Chosen enzymes need to be cloned into pJET (no activity) and then into pBAD with Dockerins. Expression and purification follow afterwards. Labwork can     start now.
3.) Working groups
Due to started lab work, exams and practical courses we had to rethink our groups for the moment.
Ela gave us the advice that it would be the best to have (at the moment) 2 groups working on the enzymes (5 enzymes plus GFP), 1 group working on the     dockerins and 1 group pushing the sponsors. Without money we cannot register and go on with the project!
Enzyme groups:
1) Avi, Stefani, Joschy
2) Debby, Alaa, Udhaya

Unintentionally, she touched a book while there were no results in her tests. That book about pesticide was borrowed from a library in earth and had never been returned back. After one minute, she recalled that a doctor from the earth once talked with her about that drug. And after testing the soil, she convinced that thought. After 20 times purifying, she got some transparent crystal C8H14ClN5. There was no doubt that it came from the Earth. But the rest part of its remains was unknown. Why did these things fly to her planet? It was really strange. Maybe she should pay a visit to the earth recently. Before proceeding, Summer belly began to growl. She remembered that she had a guest.

“There are some fast-food I had made a year ago in my storage room. Can you help me to heat two please? I am busy dealing with the problem.”
“A year ago?”
“Don’t worry. They are edible, full of nutrition, and absolutely delicious! Little Dot and Mr Careless lead the way please. Wind and Lily, will you come here?”
“Yes, sir!”Four kids replied together.
Wind and Lily came to Summer’s lab. Watching Summer’s serious expression, they knew that they had been arranged to complete a mission. They were loyal guys because they would do whatever they can to protect their home and master.
“You two are the best partners.”
They smiled to each other. Indeed, they can communicate in a language that no one else could understand which was efficient. So, the two would finish their task in the shortest time. According to the urgency they met, nothing could wait.

Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
Chains in our Chain-Node Model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those with definite structure.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: Compare first the partReference and partType defined in database of the first part of two chains in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or the end of either chain. Meanwhile, a part in bound and unbound state(这里多了半句？)
If unicode_c of each chain is different with others, then we could sort the chain list by comparing their unicode_c (just the same with comparison of two strings). However, it is not always so: chains with same unicode_c may be equivalent or not. It is due to the mark asterisk *. Unicode_c knows where are the binding sites, but it does not know the binding details of that part. In other words, unicode_c could not solely determines the order of the chains since it lacks of information of the trees defined in our Chain-Node model. The forest (set of trees) in Chain-Node Model describes the binding details of parts in chains. We need to find something like unicode_c to represent the essence of the associated trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bond state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," would the whole device or system change its properties and what unintended effects would result thereof?
Mutation of our BioBrick parts would most likely result in loss of function. Thus, our organisms would either go blind, or stop glowing. Should the extraordinary happen and gain of function occur, we fathom our organisms would be over-taxed and they would die. Since our parts are only a net drag on the survivability of our organisms, it would require some extreme mutations to render them a selective advantage for the host. However, this risk exists for any exogenous protein in a host.
What unintended effects could you foresee after your engineered organism is released to the environment?
We can foresee the spread of the BioBrick parts through the environmental bacterial populations via horizontal gene transfer. However, since the bearing plasmid only holds a selective advantage under antibiotic conditions, we expect it to be quickly lost. Moreover, in the event our devices escape the original plasmid and hop into another structure, light communication holds no selective advantage in and of itself within current free-living populations of E. coli. Thus we feel confident our devices would over-tax their hosts and ensure death.
Try to think outside the box, what is the absolut worst case scenario for human health or the environment, that you could imagine?
The Absolute Worst Case Scenario? As if in a movie by Micheal Bay? Well...
We can image our E. colis forming a structure much like a neural network to process information as a colony instead of as a single cell. Under quite permissive conditions, they might gain a selective advantage by operating in a multi-cellular organization. If grown to 1.2 optical density in a 1 liter beaker, they may very well have more connections than a human brain. Given sufficient time, they might learn to think as a collective. Should they develop proteins that receive wavelengths of around 1mm, they might tune into Radio & Television. Thus, they might learn of and imitate the Borg Collective, posing a danger to Human supremacy of the Planet!!!
Seriously though, due to the chassis mutations required by our system, either the bacteria are producing non-stop tryptophan (which constitutes a tremendous metabolic stress), or they can not adjust osmolarity (which makes them utterly incompetent in the outside world). Morevoer,  for them to sense in more than one color, both mutations need to be present, which makes the bacteria even less competent. One way or another, these cells need careful human attention to survive. Thus can the be easily controlled.

UP-element design
UP-elements are known to significantly increase the RNA polymerase-recruiting power of promoters by interacting with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. Work has been done to identify a consensus sequence for this transcriptional enhancer based on 31 natural E. coli promoters  (Estrem ST, Gaal T, Ross W, Gourse RL, Identification of an UP element consensus sequence for bacterial promoters, PNAS, (1998), 95, 9761-9766 PubMed ).
Figure 1: Tabulation of UP-elements in E. coli and nucleotide frequency at each position (adapted from Estrem ST, Gaal T, Ross W, Gourse RL, Identification of an UP element consensus sequence for bacterial promoters, PNAS, (1998), 95, 9761-9766 PubMed )
We have designed novel UP-element sequences as modular BioBrick parts by modifying a naturally-occurring UP element.  The primary design goal in developing these new parts was to vary the strength of transcription initiation enhancement by rationally modifying the nucleotide sequence of the variable regions (i.e., non consensus regions). This approach was guided by the hypothesis that natural sequences resulting in stronger promoter enhancement have been selected for over evolutionary time by E. coli and therefore occur more frequently than weaker UP-elements.
Tabulation of UP-element sequences in order of observed strengths and correlation with nucleotide frequency
Data showed direct correlation between the strength of naturally occurring UP-elements and the frequency of each nucleotide at each respective position.  Thirty one UP-element sequences were analyzed for nucleotide frequency and the relative activity was tabulated for each sequence (Estrem, et. al).  From this a consensus UP-element sequence was identified which was composed of the most frequently occurring nucleotide at each position.
UP-element consensus sequence and observed variable regions for selected sequences (that most closely matched the consensus sequence)
We separated the UP-element sequence into regions of highly conserved and highly variable nucleotide frequency.  We hypothesized that variation of strength of the UP-element is attributed to the variable regions within the sequence.  Upon further analysis of the nucleotide frequency in the variable regions we determined that changing a single base to the second most frequent nucleotide would allow us to quantify the relationship between nucleotide frequency and UP-element"

On-campus lecture
We have developed a series of four lectures for students who are interested in synthetic biology and participating in the iGEM competition.                             Content included what are we doing, what we have done, what are the basic concepts of synthetic biology,                             and the harvest we participate in and answer the questions to the students.
Public Engagement
TEDx event
In order to enable more people to hear our voices,                             this year we successfully established a partnership with TEDxSUZHOU and participated in a series of online and offline activities.
Campus Open Day
At the invitation of the school, three members assist the department in campus open day activities.                             The campus open day event is very large.                             We not only introduced our work on synthetic biology to interested parties but also expanded our visibility and influence.
Visit Genequantum pharma tech Co., Ltd.
We maintain a long-term cooperative relationship of Genequantum pharma tech Co., Ltd.                             This year, we talked with Dr. Chong Liu and Yunpeng Zhong,                             requested their advice from proposals of the project establishment to a policy of clinical trial.
Social Media
We attach great importance to an emerging platform such as social media as an effective tool for more people to understand synthetic biology and expand the influence of the team.                             This year we registered a WeChat subscribed account and released some press on popular science and team activities.                             There are about 400 readings and visits.
In addition to our own publicity channels,                             we also attached importance to the interaction with University’s marketing and communication division this year.                             Our news of successfully organizing lectures with the Suzhou Youth Science and Technology Museum was posted on the University’s official Weibo (equivalent to China's Facebook or Twitter) pages.
Laboratory Tour
In order to implement our value of“open science”,                             we invite some students interested in synthetic biology to come to our laboratory and visit our research process.                             One of our instructors, Dr. David Sun-Kai Chiu, led them to visit and explain what we are doing.
Freshman introduction session
At the beginning of each academic year,                             all freshman will gather to participate in the faculty’s introduction briefing to learn about the majors they have studied.                             This year we are invited to join our Department of biological science to hang our posters and Roll stander next to their booth,                             distribute iGEM brochures, souvenirs and communicate with interested students.

Guide RNA (gRNA)
Another important part of our project was deciding which part of the C. albicans genome to target. After some research we found that Hyphae Wall Protein 1 (HWP1) was a unique target for C. albicans [3]. We performed a BLAST search of the HWP1 sequence against several bacterial and fungal species common in the vaginal flora (Table 1) [4, 5]).    The dCas9 enzyme would be guided by a 20 nucleotide RNA sequence to its complementary DNA sequence in the C. albicans genome. We designed the gRNAs with the CRISPR function in the Benchling software . When inserting the DNA sequence of a specific protein the tool automatically designs the most effective gRNAs. Out of many choices we selected gRNA pairs consisting of two gRNAs with an interspace between 15 and 30 nucleotides.

We made four different sgRNA sequences, that when combined in pairs would result in different spacer lengths ranging from 15 to 30 nucleotides, allowing us to find the optimal spacer length for the best color readout after the split β-lactamases recombine and cleave their substrate, nitrocefin, into a colored product [5]

In contrast RFP reporter gene, which is joined to the down stream of the GFP construct, is under control of a constitutive promoter. So, if arabinose is added to the culture medium, E. coli produces both GFP and RFP so that the bacteria become yellow. However, if arabinose is not added, only RFP is produced so that the bacteria become red. We have registered the T3SS signal domain mentioned above as a new BioBrick part.
Bacteria and cell culture condition
   To perform the injection assay, we used LB medium (1.0% Bacto-Tryptone,  0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1.0% NaCl) and magnesium minimal medium (MgM) [11] containing 170 mM MES-NaOH buffer(pH=5.0 or 7.2), 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 8 uM MgCl2, 38 mM glycerol and 0.1% casamino acids. We named these medium as MgM5(pH=5.0) and MgM7(pH=7.2). Also we used the acidic cell culture medium RPMI-10% FCS + HCl (pH 5.0) [RPMI5] and normal RPMI-10% FCS [RPMI7]. Bacteria were cultured at 37C with aeration and RK13 cells were cultured at 37C in 5.0% CO2. Appropriate antibiotics were added according to the resistance marker on each plasmid (25 ug/mL of chloramphenicol and 15 ug/mL of tetracycline). To induce GFP fusion protein L-arabinose was added to the medium at each step (final concentration = 0.4% ).

Plasmid PCR to verify signaling circuit in AC plasmid
Purpose: use PCR to verify the presence of PQ-B-R-OU-B in the psB1AC3 vector. A pTaq PCR was set up using BBK CP F/R primers using the following conditions: 94ºC for 3 minutes; 36X (94ºC for 30 seconds; 55ºC for 45 seconds; 72ºC for 6 min 30 sec); 72ºC for 10 minutes; held at 4ºC. The products were then run on a 0.8% agarose gel (see below). We can see that colonies 6 and 7 reveal the desired size of the construct (~6.0kb), however, the negative control lane shows two bands, when we want no bands. We must therefore repeat this PCR with colonies 6 and 7 to receive a clean negative control lane.

Let a new collaboration begin!
Sunday, September 21th
After discovering the awesome video of the Edinburgh team on Twitter, we wanted to know more about their project. As it is clear that the three quorum sensing systems we consider are crosstalking, finding a team focused on the development on communication ways between bacteria was really interesting for us. Their topic is metabolic wiring.
We had a Skype meeting with them this week to discuss about possible opportunities of collaboration. Given the stages of our experiments, we decided that a theoretical collaboration would be more plausible. Next step will be to talk about the models and design a set-up that could fit our two projects.

It was fascinating and inspiring to once change the point of view and to approach complexity from new positions. For the priest, Josef Fuisz, the struggle of men with complexity might be represented by the following psalm (42.5):

AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," only because it has to respond positively to our genetic circuit, but mainly because it has to behave as a probiotic and cause no harm to its host. When we decided to create a project using a probiotic microorganism, the first chassis that came into our minds was Lactococcus lactis, one of the most engineered probiotic for protein delivery studies [1]. As a well characterized microorganism, L. lactis could be, in the future, the main standardized chassis for engineered probiotics. In order to have a good production of insulin, we chose the cremoris strain that has better ability to produce heterologous proteins than the other strains. For plasmid, we decided to use pSEUDO, a association of the pCS1966 vector with llmg_pseudo_10 locus from L. lactis MG1363, allowing the plasmid integration [2].
As we were using Lactococcus for the first time, as a plan B, we decided to use a well established microorganism on our lab: Bacillus subtilis, that is also considered a probiotic [3]. We chose K07 strain, that is known for not producing extracellular proteases, which is indispensable for the project idea. Two vectors were used for this microorganism: pBS1C (BBa_J179000) for homologous integration and pLIKE-rep as a replicative plasmid [4].

Biofiltration & Functionalizing Mycotecture
Clean water is vital. A self-assembling habitat for extraterrestrial exploration is simply not stable without a sustainable, regularly filtered water supply, and access to clean water remains one of the largest challenges humanity will face in the upcoming future, whether it’s in space or on earth. Another challenge is metal acquisition, whether from waste electronics or martian regolith. We developed a cost-effective, scalable, completely biodegradable filtration system for waste metal recovery from aqueous solution, using copper as a proof of concept. We first modified metal binding domains through computationally-aided rational design, and tested multiple in tandem to increase the binding capacity of our peptides. We then created metal binding domain - chitin binding domain (CBD) fusion proteins, using the CBD as a platform for functionalizing the mycelium surface and enhancing its properties. We quantitatively characterized and modeled the binding affinity of the individual domains to rigorously understand the molecular underpinnings of the filter. We finally created a tangible, functioning prototype composed of filter strips of pure mycelial material that removes >92% of the copper from a >300 μM aqueous solution within 30 minutes through surface adsorption and tangential flow, demonstrating the viability and utility of our novel process for filtration and biomining applications, both on earth and in space.
Mission Architecture
Mission architecture involves designing and planning a mission.
The goal of our mission was framed around giving other missions feasibility  by giving them the ability to work in places that might be too dangerous on the surface by providing a protected environment which our mycelium structure would provide.
The habitat is based around a 3 layered plastic dome, of which the outer layer is a layer of water which will freeze into ice, another shell encloses the cyanobacteria, and lastly the layer of mycelium. Each layer provides its own benefits. The ice water layer will be drawn from a pump which will melt subsurface ice water from our landing site, this layer provides insulation as well as providing radiation protection. Lastly this layer can be partially melted to provide water to our living cyanobacteria and fungus. The layer of cyanobacteria, suspended in a water solution will receive the sunlight which passes through the ice and use this energy it to break down carbon dioxide as well as molecular nitrogen, and create biologically available carbohydrates and nitrogen. We considered a design for a"

Heat shock was carried out at different temperatures in a water bath. Then, the cuvettes were maintained at room temperature and OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different time points.
During the first experiments, we did not get any successful result... As we can see in the following graph, fluorescence emission showed no significant increasement after different heat-shock treatments:
Figure 7. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures subjected to a 44 ºC heat-shock treatment of different durations. Heat-shock was not applied in the control experiment.
That was suspicious! Since we were sure that our experimental set-up was fine, we decided to check if our bacteria were actually carrying the right construction (Bac2, that consisted of groE promoter + AsRed2). Then, we found out that we had lying bacteria in the lab! Cheaters !
After that, we started to perform new experiments with ""honest"" bacteria, and good results arrived soon: as shown in the graphs below, we found a correlation between the temperature at which heat shock was carried out and the level of expression of the fluorescent protein. Higher fluorescence intensity was obtained when higher temperatures (ranging from 40 to 44 ºC) were applied (check the molecular mechanism details ). According to our results, it seems that protein expression cannot keep increasing at temperatures higher than 44 ºC, probably due to lethality effects.
Figure 8. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that
were subjected to a 10-min heat-shock at different temperatures. Measures were taken 60 min
after the shock.
Figure 9. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures that
were subjected to a 10-min heat-shock at different temperatures. Measures were taken 120 min
after the shock.
Express your gene!
In order to test our UV-induced construction, the E. coli strain carrying the ZsGreen1 gene under the control of the lexA promoter was grown on LBA (LB broth supplemented with ampicillin) until an OD value of 0.8. Then, cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh medium, and 100 uL were spread in agar plates. Once the medium was completely absorbed by the agar (to avoid UV absorption by medium), cells were irradiated inside the TORDEITOR (the"

Part BBa_K2217018 was composed of  U6 (BBa_K2217002) as a promoter for gRNA (BBa_K2217003)(Designed using MIT CRISPR web tool according to the addgene protocol).[1][2] The gRNA needs a scaffold to guide the Cas9 (BBa_K2217004) and finally it was terminated by SV40 poly(A) signal Termination (BBa_K2217005).
 
Fig-2 Composite Part BBa_K2217019
Part BBa_K2217019 was composed of CMV Enhancer as well as CMV Promoter (BBa_K2217000 and  BBa_K2217006 respectively) as constitutive promoters to enhance the transcription process of the Cas9 (BBa_K1218011) part which was transcribed using  T7 Promoter (BBa_K2217007) following Protocol[3]. The design aimed at generating Homology Directed Repair instead of Non-Homologous end Joining repair of Cas9 by knocking in the circular RNA as a Competing endogenous RNA enhancing its transcription to regulate miRNA action, so we designed Homology repair template (BBa_K2217009) to be transfected on a separate donor vector then terminated with CYC1 terminator(BBa_K2217008).

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"See DNA” event engaged a group of approximately 25 girls, aged 12-14, participating in a summer program held by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). To start, we delivered a presentation about a variety of subjects related to genetics. In the remaining time, we guided the students through the isolation of visibly clumped wheat germ DNA. The most interested participants asked many unexpected questions throughout the activity, such as what we thought about GMO food and whether they could safely eat the wheat germ DNA.
Sam, Jordan, Sara, and Paul at the SWE outreach event.
Everyone displayed visible excitement when we used phrases such as “gamma radiation” and “you might die if you eat enough protease” in our answers. We concluded that in order to keep the public’s attention, it is a good idea to pause for questions frequently and to highlight the most exciting parts of the topic being presented. Overall, we provided the participants with a chance to learn about an engineering field they hadn’t encountered during their program, as well as an opportunity to experience molecular biology firsthand.
Center for Talent Development
Our “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum was presented to a group of eight high school students taking an Introduction to Genetics course at Northwestern’s Center for Talent Development (CTD). First, we played a video explaining gene drives, CRISPR, and how CRISPR can be used to make an effective gene drive. We then asked the students to split into two groups, and they clearly split into a quiet group of friends and a boisterous group of friends. Both groups excitedly worked through the material, clearly demonstrating that they understood the video and found the subject matter intriguing. We asked them to fill out the Building with Biology standard exit survey, and while reviewing their submissions, we learned that the students enjoyed having a chance to debate the ethics of genetic engineering. Until our forum, their class had focused entirely on technical material. We also concluded that the Building with Biology standard survey did not exactly fit our needs, and resolved to develop our own survey going forward.
Within the week, we gave the same class a tour of two labs belonging to our advisors. Kelly Schwarz, our team’s graduate student advisor, exhibited projects investigating exosomes in Josh Leonard’s lab. She then led a “painting” activity employing fluorescent bacteria of various colors. Ben Des Soye, a grad student in Michael Jewett’s lab, talked to the students about research in cell-free protein synthesis. The students asked insightful questions on both tours, such as “How do you avoid contaminating mammalian cells?” and “Why would you want to make"

Last time we spent a whole year working on the siRNA based drug system dealing with opioid addiction, and this year we’ve been trying to update the system and apply it to a more clinical direction. Besides that, I have also been doing labwork on microbiology since sophomore. One more thing, Post-Rock huge fan=D.

Hello, iGEMers! I'm Chenhui, a junior student in Nanjing University, major in Biology. It's my pleasure and privilege to be involved in NJU-China and the last couple of months were such an enjoyable and meaningful time for me. In our team, I participated in our lab works such as qPCR experiments both in vivo and in vitro validations and human practice. Also, I am one of the presenters to present our project at the Giant Jamboree in iGEM2016. I'm so glad to have this excellent experience working with such a lot of great minds and really appreciate the opportunity to share ideas with iGEMers from all over the world.

Hi! My name is Jiaxin Cai. I’m a junior student at Nanjing University. Although my major is advertising, I’m quite interested in biology because it can help us to know more about ourselves and other creatures from a special aspect. So it’s a big pleasure for me to join NJU-CHINA team. My main work includes the human practice part and video production. I participated in the interview of doctors at Gulou Hospital in Nanjing, sent questionnaires to patients at Tianjin Tumor Hospital and analyzed our questionnaires. Also, I’m responsible for producing the background introduction film and interview video. In brief, wish we could have a wonderful time in Boston and get a good result.

Hello! My name is Jingyi Chen and I’m a junior student from Nanjing University. It’s really a pleasure to become a team member of NJU-CHINA. In my team, my job covers lab work, part of the human practice and doing presentation. Participating in iGEM offers me a great opportunity to learn lab skills and experience real experiment work in lab. More importantly, my teammates are all great guys and share the same interest in synthetic biology. I have a wonderful time working with them. This precious experience really inspires my passion in"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," was fascinating to see a completely different team dynamic and research area. It was a pleasure to help them working on their own exciting iGEM project and we learned a lot on considering different working conditions. It was such a great experience mentoring an iGEM team, which has as much interest and fun in synthetic biology as we do, and we hope the iGEM friendship between Hamm-Lippstadt and Bielefeld will continue between the future teams of our universities. Thank you guys!

iGEM Team Duesseldorf
After participating in the March for Science in Cologne, we had a skype meeting with the iGEM team Duesseldorf and they invited us to a team meetup. Thus, on the 4th of May, we went to Duesseldorf . It was an inspiring day with the iGEM team Duesseldorf and we had so much fun together. We discussed critical aspects of both our projects and we compared the difficulties both teams had to overcome. It was really helpful for us to practice presenting our project to another team. Back in Bielefeld we asked the iGEM team Duesseldorf to test the promoter part (BBa_J23111) of the distribution plate 2018, because we had trouble cloning it. Therefore, we requested the team Duesseldorf to clone and sequence this part as an independent validation of our sequencing results. In contrary to us, they were able to validate the sequence of this part. We were greatly happy that the team Duesseldorf followed our invitation to our dual use panel discussion and provided us with a lot of input, which we could perfectly include in our work in this field. We are extremely happy to celebrate the third year of a friendship between both our teams!
Networking
Beside the collaborations with the teams of Hamm-Lippstadt, Duesseldorf and Rheda Bielefeld our team got in contact with many people from all over the world throughout the year. We would like to give a short impression on how we became part of the world-wide science community.
Postcards
Like in the last years, team Duesseldorf organized a campaign to promote synthetic biology by inviting other iGEM teams to design interesting postcards on the topic of synthetic biology. We were enthusiastic about this idea and started designing our own postcard. This year we decided to recreate a famous picture„Lunch atop a Skyscraper“ in a biological way and complement it with our team.
