Biobrick Cloning
Light Regulation Group - Benjamin Huang
Cloning the biobricks was more difficult than expected. Ben tried to do digestion/ligation using the restriction enzymes using the PSB1C3 backbone from BBa_K1017726 , but transformation into E. coli strain DH10B yielded low efficiency with minimal number of colonies. He ran sequencing PCR with primers that bound to both the backbone and the target part. He found the prefix but not the suffix.
Ben and Cheryl tried different sequencing primers that bound to sites on the genes instead, and re-ran sequencing PCR to no avail. Next, they tried religating using higher molar ratios 3:1 vector to insert, and the sequencing PCR ran into the same issue.
We then got a new purified backbone from the distribution well from caroline and used that to clone. We also used Andrew's CPEC protocol to clone both the hybrid and normal part. We weren't able to clone the positive control because for the protocol you need 15-20 bp overlaps and the primers we had on hand did not allow for that. Also there was a very similar part on the parts registry so there was no use sending a part that essentially had the same Ptet and EYFP.
Using PCR purified products, the CPEC cloning had much higher efficiency than digestion/ligation. We ran colony PCR on the colonies, checking for both the prefix and suffix, and the colonies that came from the CPEC had the right bands. We sent in the sequences for sequence verification and successfully sent in 2 biobrick parts.

Nitrogenase Group - Caroline Focht
The original idea was to break the nif cluster from Cyanothece sp. 51142 into six different parts since the entire cluster is upwards of 35 kb. Primers were designed, and the desired fragments were produced via PCR. After running a gel to confirm the products, it was observed that some of the PCR reactions had not produced any of the desired fragments.
Using a temperature gradient and DMSO, all of the fragments were eventually obtained. The BioBrick backbone pSC1B3"

Newsletter
We also participate in the newsletter project organized by Amoy_China. We were always keeping in touch with them and our contributions were published on three issues. The topic of each issue is different from each other, so they would make an arrangement in advance with us for our contribution to publish in the next issue. Through the newsletters, we shared the thoughts of how to build an iGEM team and introduced the team members, and most importantly, the detailed illustration of our project. Besides, the both teams shared thoughts about top events at that time and we gave some advices about topic selection. With our cooperation, the bond between both teams becomes stronger; we sincerely wish that the newsletter would be even better in the future! 
SKLBC Meet Up
Our team members participated in the iGEM meet-up held by SKLBC-China on 19th,July. Students and teachers from SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-software, SCUT, and SCUT-China also participated in this meet up. First was the ice breaking part, in which all the participants introduced themselves, bringing everybody much closer together. The second part was the presentations from each team. Those who listened were asked to write down their advice and questions and show it to the presented team. During this part we made a brief introduction of our track. Many showed great interest and appreciation to our project, many other appreciated our PPT, and some gave helpful advice. We also discussed many problems of the projects of SCUT with their team members, and talked about some mistakes from the biobricks. The third part was called the world cafe, in which all participants were divided into groups and were asked to discuss over iGEM issues( biosafety, the relationship of software and experiments, etc.). The meet up lasted for 3 hours, and the online discussion is still proceeding. The meet-up was very successful, as by sharing and discussing, not only have we gained better understanding of other teams' projects, but also deeper recognition of our own project.
Team Selection
This year, we received an invitation to attend SCUT's team selection competition. Prof. Huang attended the selection competition at 8th July. Professors from SCAU also presented. Finally, one team won the permission to attend 2015 iGEM competition held in Boston.
Biocamp
We also participated in the biocamp held by the student union and had our own tent. With posters and display boards, we introduced synthetic biology, IGEM competition and our project to passers-by in the campus. Besides"

To investigate if the transporter can be visualized on a gel using an anti-cMyc antibody, the same experiment was repeated, and the western blot performed using an anti-cMyc antibody. In case that the cMyc epitope tag remains attached to the transporter during possible cleavage events, it should be possible to visualize the transporter on a gel using the cMyc antibody.
Figure (17): Western Blot of the isolated membrane fraction using an anti-cMyc antibody.
Again, fragments can be observed around 35 kDa for all samples except for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide. No bands can be observed for the full construct, but a very weak band can be seen between 55 and 70 kDa for the fusion protein of the native transporter.
Once again, bands could be observed for all transporter variants except for the TAT signal peptide variants around 35 kDa. One very weak can be observed for the fusion protein of the native transporter between 55 and 70 kDa.  All these results show how difficult the isolation of integral membrane proteins can be. A number of reasons can be brought forward to explain why isolation of PtNTT2 from the membrane proved to be so challenging. First of all, PtNTT2 has 10 transmembrane domains, making it a highly hydrophobic protein. To find a correct detergent to solubilize the protein from the isolated membrane fraction also proves challenging. The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) lists dozens of possible detergents on their site (European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Protein Purification). To find a best suited detergent is also a challenge. Another reason why the visualization of membrane proteins on SDS PAGEs and western blots is challenging is that membrane proteins tend to aggregate when boiled and that they often exhibit “gel shifting” (Rath et al., 2009). For that reason, another SDS PAGE was run using the isolated membrane fractions of the PtNTT2 constructs without cMyc-GFP tag, but this time the samples were loaded onto the gel without previous boiling.
Figure (18): SDS PAGE of the isolated membrane fraction without previous boiling
No thick bands can be observed around 70 kDa. Slightly above 100 kDa, bands can be observed for all PtNTT2 variants but not for the negative controls. But given that the samples ran quite different on the gel compared to"

June 25 – July 1, 2012
The Gibson Assemblies of our iGEM team had been failing in the last weeks. This week new enzimes arrived. We hope that this will solve our problem.
Also, this week we tried to redesign our project. Our first task is to continue with our attempts to make a biobrick with the spider silk monomer ADF-3. We ordered the primers that we need to do that. Now we are exploring the possibility of improve the product of the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig in his paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”. One idea is to attach a growth factor (e.g. recombinant human BMP-2) to the molecule of ADF-3. But the problem with the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig is that it works on salmonella, and we cannot work with such an infectious bacteria.
July 2 – 8, 2012
This was a week of exams. Therefore, no major advances were accomplished during this week.
July 9 – 15, 2012
This week we made important advances in our wiki. We will start with the template of the iGEM team Johns Hopkins 2011 as a base.
Furthermore, we studied carefully the paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” and its supplementary information. We realized that each protein secreted with this system comes with a 3x FLAG (DYKDDDDK)3. It is a priority for us to find if someone can share us a little of the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Cat# F3165). That way, if we use this secretion system we will be able to quantify the production of our protein of interest. But, if we want to use Voigt´s system, we need attenuated salmonellas with their pathogenicity island 1 intact.  Something similar to Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. After some research we found a professor of our University that works with salmonella (Dr. Susan Bueno). But she was out of the country and we could only send her some emails asking for the salmonella.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments
I) Purpose
To start modeling phage plaque sizes against several variables including, but not limited to phage particle size, agar concentration, and bacterial concentration.
To determine variables within modeling and make preparation for actual experiments
II) Expected Outcome
A inverse relationship between phage plaque size and phage particle size/ agar concentration/bacterial concentration.
III) Reagents Used
LB
Different stock of E coli strain.
Stocks of phage
IV) Procedure
1) E coli strain preparation (8.2-8.5)
We normally use E coli BL21 for our experiments with T7. The large phage group kindly provided the streak of E coli B.
E coli W3110 and K12 was streaked from frozen glycerol stock and agar stock respectively.
Because K12 streak from last step didn't work, liquid culture was prepared to amplify bacteria from agar stock. To three test tubes, 1mL of LB was added to each. After this,
test tube 1: a pipette tip was used to stab the agar stock, after this LB was pipetted up and down to get the agar into LB.
test tube 2: a wooden stick was used to scrap the agar stock, after which it was submerged in LB
test tube 3: after preparing test tube 2, the wooden stick used was submerged directly in the LB of test tube 3
2) Phage viability/infection test (8.5)
Prepare 2 plates for a spot test using E. coli BL21 by adding 0.5mL"

Overview
USTCers believe that scientists must take the responsibility of science and technology propagations among the public. Our iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for the popularization of science among children in China.
This year Team USTC, along with ELA, delivered human practice activities for the public. In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, public engagement, education, biosafety, environment and society.
In our minds, human practices are not only to clarify what is our synthetic biology, what is our daily work or the common phenomenon of scientific reason, but also to take people into a more in-depth thinking.
If a human practice can encourage people to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become the new scientists, the human practice would seem more precious. Human practice works can also climb up to the highest level of science hall. In fact, it reflects more scientific issues.
Poster Presentation and Survey
During the Science and Technology Week of our school, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to public and our schoolmates by showing posters about the iGEM projects that Team USTC had done, and we also conducted a survey about synthetic biology at the same time.
Team USTC members and Team USTC-software members worked together to give presentations"

Strategy and focus
While detection is the first step, characterization and quantification are equally important to reliably assess the danger of an infection.
Popaye is devised based upon a SynBio approach comprising of a two-dimensional biosensor and a measurement device . The two-dimensional biosensor (Figure 1) is designed to recognize quorum sensing molecules secreted by the pathogen cells and generate a distinct fluorescence signal.

Figure 2 Measurement device based on counting of visual signal density
By embracing the open hardware approach and using both low- and high-level components such as Arduino microcontrollers and systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) as Raspberry Pi, we maximize the measurement device’s versatility.
The visual signals generated by the biosensor will be captured by a camera (Figure 2) and analyzed by our measurement software, ‘Measurarty’. The software uses modern region- and graph-cut-based evaluation methods to analyze the data efficiently.
The device will be finally tailored to perfectly fit the needs of end users, for example by minimizing the need for electricity.

Strain Construct
In order to test the improved flip flop properly, we constructed a new strain of Escherichia coli based on E. coli X90 ΔSspB and other E. coli X90 ΔClpX (F’ lacIq lac’ pro’/ara Δ[lac-pro] nalA argE [am] rifr thi-1). E. coli X90 strain has two different problems which we should solve for the accurate control of the improved flip-flop: on the one hand, RybB deletion in the chromosome was performed to achieve the expression of the RybB gene only from the improved flip-flop device; on the other hand, due to the presence of lacIq within F’plasmid, whose expression could interfere in the bistability, we caused its lost.
We carried out the mentioned deletion to our Sspb- and Clpx- strains by using the lambda red protocol ( Datsenko & Wanner, 2000 ). We have disrupted the chromosomal gene RybB by using PCR products in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene. In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter, in a temperature sensitive and low copy number plasmid. We generated PCR products by using primers with 50-nt extension that are homologous to regions adjacent to the RybB gene. The template consisted on an antibiotic resistance cassette ﬂanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites.

Content: we verified our first assumption that the overexpression of cI protein may restrain the growth of host which cause the failure of construction of gene circuit one, so, we designed another method to construct it and finally made it. Then, we integrated three circuits into one plasmid to form our repressilator.
1.Verification for the first assumption that there were little LacI proteins in DH-5α, and it was not enough to repress PLlacI promoter, resulting in the overexpression of cI protein which may restrain the growth of host:
We designed a primer contained PstI site which could match the middle part of the coding sequence of cI protein, and then, we conducted a PCR by using VF2 primer and the designed primer to get a sequence which can express an inactive cI protein. We put this sequence behind PLlacI promoter through the same way mentioned above and the sequencing results showed that we constructed it and it proved our assumption to some extent. Then, we came up with a different way to construct our first repressilator which will be explained in the following.
2.New way to construct our first repressilator: Due to toxicity of cI protein on host bacteria and the expression of cI protein which was regulated by PLlacI promoter, we came up with a new method that putting the gene circuit three in front of PLlacI promoter because circuit three would express LacI protein to repress the activation of PLlacI promoter and thus, cI protein would not be overexpressed. So, we digested circuit three by EcoRI enzyme and SpeI enzyme and digested PLlacI promoter by EcoRI enzyme and XbaI enzyme, and then do a ligation to get a circuit contained PLlacI promoter controlled by LacI protein. After that, we connected the coding sequence of cI protein with the previous product to get a compound contained circuit one and circuit three. Gel electrophoresis spectrum diagram of plasmid is shown in Figure 7.

The Tristable Switch
Tristable Switch is a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while signal interference is prevented. In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s Tristable Switch model in 200"

This supports our second hypothesis                 that there should be an increase in expression after induction by AHL.
Antisense type I (PFB+asRNA1)
Antisense type II (PFB+asRNA2)
Fig. 5 Error bar presents SD from 6 biological replicates.
Fig. 6 Error bar presents SD from 6 biological replicates.
Conclusions
Our antisense RNAs construct can verify the following hypotheses:
There is a significant decrease in basal expression level when antisense RNA type I and II are used.
Antisense RNA type II reduces basal level expression more efficiently.
Positive feedback loop remains function after activation by 1.00E-05 M of AHL after 3 hours.
Suggestions
Antisense RNA sequences can be further fine-tuned to investigate higher efficiency of basal level reduction. Insertion of a stabilizer element would increase antisense RNA’s half-life (Engdahl, 2001).
Higher concentration of AHL can be tested with PFB+asRNA1 and PFB+asRNA2 to investigate their effects on expression level in positive feedback loop.
The effect of AHL positive feedback loop can be tested in population dynamics
Additional comments/Notes
W/ PFB sample increases the expression by only 4,316.5 gfp/OD600 when induced by 1.00E-05 M AHL after 3                     hours, at the same time which fluorescence of w/o PFB increases by 10 folds.
Fig. 1 and 3 show that w/o PFB produces the highest fluorescence/OD600, while W/ PFB is significantly lower.                     This has been experienced by brown iGEM team 2007, where their hypotheses have been proven false due                     to an inverse relationship of GFP expression between the control (no feedback loop) and the one with                     LuxI (Positive feedback loop). Given that the concentration of SAM is constant, the unpredictable lower level of fluorescence may be due to high concentration of AHL and low concentration of luxI that cause the shift in equilibrium to the reactant (SAM) rather than to the product side. However, in our course of experiment, we were interested in the efficiency of two types                     of antisense RNA in reducing basal expression level, so we took W/ PFB construct for the comparison.
We have considered tuning pLuxR promoter instead of adding ABR and antisense RNA. However, we predicted                     that there will"

    Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids learn more about synthetic biology in an enjoyable way. To our surprise, when they were playing these games, they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. ( Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
II Gene circuit
    In our system, E.coli is divided into two groups, with each group having three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    Concretely, the gene circuit of each character is displayed below.
Fig.1 Principles of this circuit can be seen at Design of characters .
III Invertase assay
    In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)
Fig.2 The number of cells expressing mRFP
More details can be seen at Invertase assay
IV Orthogonality test
     Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by the AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
    Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test
    However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should"
Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#IP#_-_-_TEXT.html," to ensure that the platform technology will not be hampered in the event that the system can be used for other markets and applications.
Intellectual Property Relating to the iGEM Competition
An important aspect of our IP comes into play with those who were responsible for developing the original platform technology on the University of Calgary 2012 iGEM team.  This team consisted of 4 professors at the University, ~25  undergraduate students from various faculties, and 4 graduate students (MSc and PhD) from the faculties of Biological Sciences and Medicine.  More information on team composition can be found here .  Additional parties which hold a stake in our technology include the University of Calgary.
The IP for our project was developed exclusively from a subset of the undergraduate and graduate students who were a part of the team.  Because of the rare situation with non-University employee’s developing IP using University of Calgary services we are presently negotiating with the University to determine their stake in our venture.  Additionally, we have approached the University of Calgary tech transfer office known as Innovate Calgary.  They provide support to new start-up ventures hoping to spin out of the University of Calgary.  To collect the IP within the individuals moving the company forward, we have approached all members of the 2012 team and asked them to sign a release form for their contributions to the project.  Additionally, we have negotiated with the professors of our group, who have signed release forms, and provided written consent that we have their permission to develop this technology independently.  All of this information is available upon request.
In addition, many of the professors at the University have been given the opportunity to become involved in our company or to sit on our advisory board.  Those who have not displayed interest in doing this have also been approached to sign a release.
Figure 2. IP strategy relating to previous iGEM members and professors.
In order to protect our intellectual property previously developed, we have chosen to hold the IP as a group of six members from the iGEM Entrepreneurial team and license this IP to any legal body which we are involved with and require that IP to grow.
IP that is developed in collaboration with our Academic and Industry groups will be held by all parties involved in the development of the technology.  To ensure that this technology is not disclosed we have asked all parties involved with our technology development to sign non-disclosure agreements to ensure all information remains patentable.

Education and Public Engagement
We have adopted two-way science communication that is accessible to all, innovative and interactive, and takes advantage of technologies to communicate  aspects of our project, and related issues.
No audience too big or too small
Of the general public, we engaged with families, over 200 Year 8 students (12-13 year olds), over 150 sixth formers (16-17 year olds), and dozens of adults at a pub. We communicated various facets of our project, from light reactions, fireflies and glowworm conservation to potential use of luciferase and synbio in space to wider issues surrounding self-testing kits.
Inter-team outreach- from Coventry to Paris to Xiamen to Toronto
We immersed ourselves in engaging with other iGEM teams, nationally and internationally. A few team members attended the European and UK meet ups in Westminster and Paris respectively. We participated in XMU China's online magazine feature on iGEM teams. Chris represented us on the Toronto synbio panel while Asal ran a stall alongside Sheffield and Warwick.
Life on Mars? Hands on workshop with 3D printed models
For a kinaesthetic workshop for Year 8 students on synthethic biology's potential for life on Mars, Rob and Dan designed 3D printed models that light up when a student adds a reporter gene 'plug'. This workshop successfully engaged over two hundred 12-13 year old students at the STEM Live event in the Sherman Theatre.
Luciferase- from medical devices to conserving British glowworms
We performed enzymatic luciferase demonstrations for sixth formers and families when discussing Cas-Find, and Asal encouraged young children to build log piles to help conservation of the luciferase producing glowworm at the National Museum in Cardiff.
Synbio, STI self testing, and a pint
An interactive talk at the Cardiff Science Cafe on synthetic biology, iGEM, and our project proved a popular night of pop culture references, prizes, and discussions. Asal and Rob enjoyed surveying attendants, and having discussions, on STI self testing kits before revealing our investigation results."
SYSU_CHINA,2015,Team:SYSU CHINA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," invertase-EGFP fusion protein when induced; pInv-rep produces mcherry signal when inverted by invertase-EGFP. The dynamic pattern of the two signal can be mathematically analyzed, and the interval between bursts of green and red signals indicate the timing length of the invertase module. Furthermore, we tested effects of promoter, fusion sites, and ssra-tag in this system, and these elements are extremely helpful to enhance the performance of the device. With this system, we successfully tested the activity of invertases including Cre, Vika, Scre, Vcre, Dre, and Flp.
Prokaryotic Timer
Our group aims at constructing an innovative timer in bacterial system based on recombinase-triggered flipping, in which we attempted to construct several parts and devices served for relevant function. ECFP, mCherry and GFP were detected in different time scale to exhibit wholly flipping process. We developed a creative joining method called ""2A"" assembly to cope with plentiful scattered DNA fragments, when, at last, we managed to get our circuits tested  by certain ways on its availability.
Telomeric Timer
Telomeric timer，also called Micro-timer 2.0, is designed to endue microorganisms with programed life span based on the cell cycle specific promoter (in eukaryotes) )or other cell division related promoter (in prokaryotes). In this system, the flanking RTSs are of same direction, enabling the sequences between them to be excised by specific recombinases, causing deletion of DNA fragments. With every cell division, this device will sequentially truncate a part of the sequence and finally lead to cell death when there is no more sequences to be truncated, working like a telomere.
Eukaryotic Timer
Eukaryotic timer，also called Micro-timer 3.0, uses recombinases from Ser family such as Bxb1, which typically catalyze site-specific recombination between an attachment site on the infecting phage chromosome (attP) and an attachment site in the host chromosome (attB) in natural system. The resulting integration reaction inserts the phage genome into the host chromosome bracketed by newly formed attL and attR (LR) sites. When attB and attP are engineered to be opposite BP sites, the integrase catalyzes the inversion of sequences flanked by BP sites, changing BP sites into LR sites, and will not revert the DNA flanked by LR sites.
In the design of Micro-timer 3.0, each inverted promoter flanked by BP"

BioBrick System
Figure 1: Principle of BioBrick Standardization. Click on the picture to get to pubmed entry of this paper. Mueller KM & Arndt KM (2012). Standardization in synthetic biology. Methods Mol Biol. Vol. 813:23-43.
The BioBrick system of iGEM is based on the idea to divide complex biological systems in single components that are available to all iGEM teams. Each component, also called BioBrick, is flanked by a standardized sequence that allows for easy shuttling between different biological model organisms. The standardized sequences include sites for specific restriction enzymes, EcoRI and XbaI upstream and SpeI and PstI downstream of each brick (Fig. 1). Therefore, the BioBricks also can easily be combined. The restriction sites SpeI and XbaI between two bricks can ligate together and leave behind a scar. The restriction sites are buried in the scar and are not accessible be the enzymes anymore. The BioBricks are annotated in the Registry of Standardized Biological parts and are catgorized by function. Parts are for example proteins, promoters, primers or plasmids.
Part Registry
The Registry of Standardized Biological parts is a comunity ressource for all participating iGEM teams. Every team adds new parts or BioBricks to the registry every year. In return, a Distribution Kit with a selection of highly requested and well-annotated parts is provided. Parts that are not included in the Distribution Kit can be orderer from the iGEM headquarter. The Registry of Standardized Biological parts grows rapidly, since the number of teams participating in the iGEM competition is increasing, too. During the course of iGEM the regulations for the part description are improved continously, including the catalog for parts and devices , help pages and videos.
The following links will lead to an overview of all components included in the Distribution Kit 2012 and of all BioBricks encompassed in this, respectively:

The only way to do great work is to love what you do - Steve Jobs
Motivation
As long as mankind remembers, different diseases struck from time to time and demanded millions of lives.              Maybe the most fatal of these epidemic outbreaks was the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed between 50-100 million people worldwide.             Derived from a simple influenza virus only a few mutations were necessary to change this virus into one of the deadliest threats              that ever existed. Pandemic viral infections like this were the reason for our project selection. Our highest             motivation was to create a system to counteract these             extremely high risk potential slumbering in commonly known and seemingly not to dangerous viruses. Of course the influenza virus              stated 1918 a much higher risk than it does today. But still viruses are very hard to treat and especially members of the family flaviviridae like Zika or Dengue virus, show a high risk potential because of their high mutation rate.
We found a way to create in a short period of time antibody-like proteins.              Evobodies are binding             proteins that are able to be quickly adapted to altered targets like viral hull proteins and              re-establish binding properties in extremely short periods of time             The limiting"

At the European iGEM meet-up in Delft (Netherlands) we met the current iGEM Team from NAWI Graz and recognized several opportunites to help each other out. We were happy to share our experience about project funding and the iGEM competition with a younger, highly motivated iGEM Team. One big issue for all iGEM participants is the funding of their project. In this context we could help the team from NAWI Graz with the acquisition of interested sponsors by arranging for contacts between them and potential supporters. We further also discussed possible wet-lab collaborations. As our chitin deacetylases (CDA) produce acetic acid as a side product, we thought about measuring  our CDA’s actitivity with the help of NAWI Graz’s pH-sensitive E. Coli strain. Unfortunately the generated acetic acid level would not be high enough for activating the pH-sensitive system. We are glad that we could exchange experiences with iGEM NAWI Graz and look forward to future collaborations of our teams.
Collaboration with HFUT-China
We had the great oppurtinity to test the BioDesigner Dolphin tool from HFUT China . An impressive online platform to search all iGEM projects of the last years. We strongly hope, that this platform will still be available in the next years, because it is handy for future iGEM teams to start their research. We gave the following feedback:

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by inserting two different sensitivity tuner constructs between the processing units of the Sensynova platform; BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 .
Background Information
Both selected sensitivity tuner constructs were made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Cambridge 2009 team. They were chosen as variants to the empty processing module present in the Sensynova platform due to the fact that, although they have been included in the iGEM distribution kit since their submission in 2009, they have yet to be successfully implemented into a team’s system, as far as we are aware. The 2007 Cambridge iGEM team built 15 different constructs that amplified the PoPS output of the promoter pBad/AraC detailed by image below taken from the Cambridge 2009 team's wiki.
Figure 1: Cambridge 2007 Amplifier System
The 2009 Cambridge iGEM team then re-designed these constructs to be PoPS converters, as image below taken from their wiki details, and generated a set sensitivity tuners corresponding to Cambridge 2007’s"
Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_I20260. These were then diluted 1:100 and regrown for roughly 4 hours under the same conditions. They were then diluted to an OD between 0.05 and 0.09, and regrown for 1 hour, again under the same conditions.
After this, the cultures were diluted into a 96-well plate at 8 different concentrations of inducer (arabinose), ranging from 0 to 6.4 uM. The plate was then incubated in a Wallac Victor3 multi-well fluorimeter at 37 degrees Celsius, and repeating measurements of absorbance and fluorescence were taken at 10 minute intervals, with shaking after each measurement. Untransformed BW27783, at each concentration of arabinose, was used to measure background fluorescence, and wells containing only broth were included to measure background absorbance. The machine settings used were identical to those described in the paper referenced above.
With this data, we aimed to calculate the steady-state per-cell GFP concentration during log-phase growth, for both BBa_I0500 and BBa_I20260 (measurement kit for the standard promoter, J23101). The ratio of these values would then characterize the strength of the AraC/pBAD promoter in units of RPU. The justification for this approach can be found in the supplemental material of the paper referenced above.
Results
The results of the experiment were anomalous, and considered too unreliable to be conclusive. There was no clear relationship between cell fluorescence and inducer concentration.
The fluorescence curve did not qualitatively match the predictions of the model; across all concentrations, and for each of the 3 cultures, we observed a high initial fluorescence, with a rapid drop to a lower steady state value. For each culture, this drop in fluorescence aligned well with the growth curve.
In addition, the untransformed BW27783 cells exhibited consistently higher fluorescence than cells containing BBa_I0500, which was highly anomalous. Because of this, we could not reliably use these cells to measure background fluorescence.
Below, a sample graph of Total Fluorescence is shown for each of the 3 cultures. These are curves of the total fluorescence for each culture, averaged over 3 replicates for each culture.
Discussion
It is believed that an error in our strain of BW27783 is most likely responsible for the anomalous qualitative features of our data. This is because for each concentration of inducer, the untransformed BW27783 cells exhibit a fluorescence curve highly similar to that of BW27783 containing BBa_I0500, and yet the untransform"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," DSF model slightly harder to work with than PQS (sorry guys!), as it contained a lot of components; our first model started with about 12 equations! We were able to reduce these down and simplify the model, which enabled us to input them into MATLAB and produce some graphs. We had a few problems determining exactly what our GFP production was reliant on, but after a lot of work on our blackboard, we came to a conclusion! Again, our deterministic model allowed us to change our initial conditions allowing us to see what would happen.
A lot of stochastic modelling happened during this week; PQS wild type and PQS E.coli being our priority. Adding in an external signal proved a little difficult, as we did not get the expected results! There was a lot of trial and error in trying to match up parameters from MatLab and Maple, but by the end of the week we thought we were there! Netlogo was also coming along nicely, with PQS wild type and PQS E. coli finished! BDSF E. coli was almost finished too, with only DSF to tackle after that!
Week 6
We were all excited to test our first sensor, an inducible GFP production assay was set up, by spiking overnight cultures of transformed E. coli MC1061 with a range of concentrations of synthetic PQS. Unfortunately, we obtained no mCherry expression....along with a lot of perplexed biologists! We successfully removed the first illegal site from rpfC. Meanwhile clp BioBricking was underway, and work had begun on the BDSF system. We were halfway through the 10 weeks and we were feeling productive! The dry lab were certainly ahead of the game as far as BDSF was concerned; after working through the mammoth DSF system, the closely related two-component BCAM0227/BCAM0228 system was a breeze. In fact, with such a head-start it was decided that there would be a presentation given by the maths boffins of the team entitled: “Modelling for the Perplexed Biologists and Dave”. This was an interactive lesson on how to apply equations to biological systems which helped the lab-rats get to grips with how the figures being generated by the dry team could inform the final design of the biological systems. By the end of the week, rpfG, rpfC and clp were cloned into pUniprom!
Around this time, the “Device Committee” was formed; a small group of wet and dry members who would begin the design of a physical unit to house and interpret the output from"

Biosafety education video in Chinese
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.

Aim
   We developed a sensor to detect whether a particular bacterial strain carries a specific antibiotic resistance gene. Our sensor system consists of E.coli lab strain and of a synthetic phagemid with a CRISPR/Cas system and LacZ as a reporter under the control of a pRecA promoter (SOS response promoter).
If our CRISPR/Cas system can bind to the target (antibiotic resistance gene), the Cas9 generates at this specific target site a double strand break, which will induce the expression of our double-strand break SOS sensor (Figure. 1). Having the system on a phagemid, the sensor system will spread all over a population, to get a clear color output if the target has been detected. Depending on target sequence the system carries"

Late Blight
The one billion annual loss in China
For the 2014 late blight, Yunnan, northwest, north and northeast China are main areas suffering from this epidemic, the incidence area are over 233 hectares.
Use of resistant varieties is one of the basic measures to prevent potatoes from late blight; however the mainly used varieties are always not resistant to late blight. Potato late blight spreads rapidly under suitable conditions, and the most commonly adopted strategy is the use of fungicides, which may lead to other severe problems such as environmental pollution, development of resistant strains, etc.
Prevention of late blight
Sowing prevention:
Breeding resistant varieties is one of the efficient ways to prevent late blight. Since the seed virus is the only source of infection, lands without virus can greatly reduce the infection rate. Prevent continuously growing crops of the Solanaceae family, apply crop rotation with plants of the Brassicaceae family for more than three years. Prepare soil, choose high terrain and planting land with good drainage, elevate potassium concentrations to increase resistance. In each stage closely monitor the sowing seeds: eliminate infected tubers; small seed sowing is recommended.
Growth prevention:
Earth up the potatoes in the late growing period to keep spores from infecting tubers. Once the stem is infected, mow it immediately and harvest after 2-3 days of exposure to sunlight. Rational close planting can improve ventilation and light conditions and reduce humidity in the fields. Apply protective drug prevention before the onset of the disease and adopt chemical treatment after the onset. In early stage of late blight, immediately remove the infected plant. Spray pesticides within 30-50 m of the infected plant.
Storage prevention:
One week before harvest, kill the seedlings, clean out the stems and leaves, clear them out of the fields, and choose a sunny day for harvest. Enhance ventilation during storage, with the temperature controlled between 1-4 °C and the humidity no higher than 75%.
Trading
The cost of planting potato is about 11226 RMB(CNY) per hectare, the average total revenue is about 14344.5 RMB(CNY) per hectare, average gross revenue is about 3118.5 RMB(CNY) per hectare. It means the net revenue of 1 kilograms potato is 0.15 RMB(CNY).

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". The students are tested on their abilities to tackle biological problems as well as performing laboratory experiments. Its aim is to promote science to young students and to emphasize the importance of biology in society. In the national finals on the 9th of June in Wageningen, twenty students of The Netherlands gathered for a week of science. We contributed to the NBO by educating the students about DNA techniques and the field of synthetic biology. A summary video of the whole NBO can be found here.
Before the lecture, the students knew about Golden Rice and insulin production by microorganisms as the only examples of biotechnology. During the practicals on plant genetics, we gave a one-and-a-half hour lecture about current techniques for the manipulation of DNA and other topics regarding molecular biology and its applied use, followed by an exam of 10 closed and 2 open questions. This covered the basics of gene expression and DNA construct assembly, as well as more complicated assembly methods and modification techniques. Attendees were introduced to the field of synthetic biology, a subject that was new for most of them. After the lecture, they were encouraged to think about the rational and ethical issues that may arise with this technology. This way, we involved these students in synthetic biology and our iGEM project, and we got their input into these fields as well.
The students concluded that they saw the potential in synthetic biology to combat infectious diseases. However, it also raises some safety, ethical and biocontainment-related concerns. Following these findings, we worked on the proposed issues. The outcome of this can be read on the biosafety page.
Synthetic biology has the potential to run out of control, but I believe we have the knowledge to keep it within limits.

Full findings NBO
The greatest advantages of synthetic biology they discussed can be summarized into four main categories:
The opportunity to improve food production. For example, increasing yield by resistance introduction, drought-resistant crops, and more sustainable production.
Production and development of medicines. Both developments of novel, better and cheaper medicines were mentioned, as well as better diagnostics.
General, non-specific improvements in current and new industrial processes; faster, easier, more efficient, and economically favorable.
Reduced impact on climate, by using synthetic biology for protection of the environment, protect threatened animal species, and improvement of sustainability.
However, there were also some concerns, both personal as well as on how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. These can be summarized into three categories:

В этом году команда IGEM Heidelberg ставит перед собой цель, используя огромный потенциал дарвиновской эволюции, упростить задачу создания биомолекул на благо человека. Для этого мы воспользуемся методом PACE (непрерывная эволюция при помощи фагов), позволяющим воссоздать в миниатюре и ускорить процесс эволюции и направить его к достижению заранее поставленной цели. Метод PACE привязывает выживаемость быстро мутирующих фагов, несущих каркасный белок, к направленному отбору внутри их хозяев – E.coli. Таким образом белки с желаемыми свойствами могут быть получены за несколько часов вместо столетий. Чтобы использовать этот огромный потенциал, мы разработаем комплексный стандартизированный инструментарий и сопутствующее программное обеспечение, которые позволят применять метод PACE к белкам различных классов, в том числе к энзимам, предназначенным для производства лекарственных препаратов и биоматериалов.

Project Description
The goal of our project is to create a biosensor to detect naphthalene. This could be achieved simply by placing a reporter behind iGEM part BBa_J61051. When naphthalene is present, the reporter is produced so one could be alerted to the exposure. However, this design presents a few major limitations. It signals that naphthalene is present only in the moment when the cell is exposed. This provides no real advantage over taking a water sample and testing for naphthalene without a biological system. In our design, we aimed to create a recording aspect within our device to show if there has at any point been naphthalene exposure.
There are two key features of our design to achieve a recording aspect:
Genetic Switch: On plasmid #2, there is a genetic logic gate (see black arrows) in the DNA sequence, which the Bxb1 integrase can invert the DNA, creating a sort of genetic switch. Between the two Bxb1 recognition sites we have placed a terminator so that in the absence of naphthalene, the switch is “off” as no transcription is occurring at this locus. Once the integrase is expressed, the DNA will be inverted, turning the genetic switch “on”. This creates a genetic and therefore permanent change that is recorded in future progeny as well.
Signal Amplification: Our design amplifies a small signal via the Quorum Sensing system from Vibrio Fischeri. In our design, we use the LuxR, LuxI, and LuxPr promoter components, which allows us to employ cell to cell signaling to create a device that will visibly turn a single color across the entire device, even if it was just one single cell that was exposed to naphthalene.
Plasmid #1
NahR (BBa_J61051): The NahR-pSal-sfGFP-Terminator part designed by Peking iGEM 2013 is a sequence of genes that promotes transcription via a metabolic pathway that converts naphthalene to salicylic acid"

The construct was cut with EcoRI and SpeI. The pSB1C3 backbone was cut with EcoRI and PstI. Together with the previously cut BBa_J61002‑BBa_E0240 construct the synthesized BBa_1001‑BBa_11023‑BBa_1001 construct was ligated in the cut pSB1C3.
BBa_K1976001:
The ligation product was transformed into E. coli Top 10 via heatshock.

The GUI is in principle ready to use. Our RAMPS board is maybe broken and we buy another one. The syringe pump was tested and it works like expected.
We met on Tuesday with the whole team.
Lab Week 24:

Reporter System
BBa_K1976003:
Clones were screened with colony PCR using VF2 and VR oligonucleotides. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones .
miniColicin
BBa_K1976054 was made by digesting Bba_K1976048 with Xba1 and Pst1. Also BBa_K525998 was digested with EcoRI and PstI. Both were ligated into pSB1A3. The ligation Top10 E. coli were then transformed with this construct. A colony PCR was performed to check for the right band height.  Lastly the construct was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated in pSB1C3, which was digested the same way.
Metabolic burden
BBa_K1976000:
The attP2‑site was mutated to λ‑attp via Quick‑Change‑PCR, using the following primers: QC_attp_fw and QC_attp_rev (for more details see our primerlist).
BBa_K1976001:
To check whether BBa_I11020 was expressed properly a SDS‑Page was made.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Our team
Our team brings together 19 students from different fields of study : law, design, biology, chemistry, and physics … It is this multidisciplinary approach that allows us today to discuss the various aspects of this project and to complete it successfully.
We come from different institutions:: Pierre et Marie Curie University , Paris Diderot University , Paris Sud , ESPCI , ETSL and ENSCI . And we are lucky to be mentored by our three tutors : Deshmukh Gopaul, Patsy Polston and Vincent Le Gros.
The multidisciplinarity of our group give us also the opportunity to constantly learn from each other, wether in biology, chemistry, physics, but also in design and law. Being able to conduct our laboratory experiments for our own research is a real achievement for us. IGEM is a great adventure in which we can deepen our knowledge and acquire new skills.
But don't take us too seriously, we still know how to have some fun!!!!

This underrepresentation by Latin America can be caused by several factors, but for now it is considered a future market, and no correlations will be made.
Teams using antibodies
Figure 3: Chart of teams using antibodies distributed in regions
We have investigated how many teams according to regions that have used antibodies in their project. The results are depicted in  figure 3. Though Europe only represents 28 % of the total teams, these teams use 55% of the totale usage of antibodies, whereas North American teams used antibodies half as much as they are represented. Several reasons can be responsible for this under- and overrepresentation. If it is assumed, that all teams producing proteins could potentially use antibodies, it is a possibility that projects on this subject is more common in Europe than in North America. This will be investigated next.
Teams producing proteins
Figure 4: Chart of teams producing protein in regards to regions
Figure 4 shows that the teams producing proteins follow the general distribution globally, therefore there is no correlation between protein production and the uneven distribution of antibody usage. It has not been possible to determine if resources is the cause of the bias, but this does not seem unreasonable. If that is the case, teams will benefit from PAST’s product globally.
Teams producing proteins and teams using antibodies has been compared in figure 4. This shows that only a few actually use antibodies. This could be due to teams not reaching a point, where assays using antibodies are necessary, rather than a lack of resources. However, it has been decided to ignore this as a reason, since it must be assumed, that research projects generally have more time to evolve. Therefore it has been decided to base the estimate of production size on the protein production rather than antibody usage.
Figure 5:comparison of protein production and antibody usage
Using the assumption an estimate can be made. A total of 123 teams where involved in projects producing proteins, and on average the teams used two types of antibodies per project. Therefore a production of approximately 250 varieties of peptide aptamers is presumed appropriate. Though this estimates the number of batches per year, each project will only buy a small amount of the production. Therefore it should be evaluated if, it is reasonable to assume that the rest of the production can be sold as well. To reach a conservative estimate the European market has been evaluated, as this is the region where most antibodies where used. 63 universities were represented at iGEM 2014 out of approximately"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Social Study
Background
This year, we decided to overcome the issue of food and drug safety—“detecting metals and mycotoxins in Chinese medicine” as our project.  We aimed at using what we learned in synthetic biology to solve this issue.
Inspired by the article “The role of social scientists in synthetic biology”  written by Jane Calvert and Paul Martin, we believed that we should and we could use solid social studies to strengthen our project, to justify the signficance of our project, and to generate new and valid knowledge that can be used for future research.
Thus, we designed three social studies for our project.
1. Social epidemiology: to investigate the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan
2. Media analysis: to explore the context of gene technology and synthetic biology in Taiwan's media
3. Document analysis: to compare the difference of Food security policies between Taiwan and the other countries

Social epidemiology of Chinese medicine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Abstract: Chinese medicine plays an important role in the Asian culture as food and medicine. In this study, we want to investigate the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan and the association with socio-demographic characteristics.  We used three waves of National Health Interview Survey (year 2005, 2009, and 2013) to examine the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan.  Our results showed that Chinese medicine is commonly used in Taiwan.  Poor knowledge regarding regulations on Chinese medicine manufacturing and purchase is associated with lower education.  Our study reveals that Taiwanese people are likely to be exposed to potential risk in taking Chinese medicine.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Social epidemiology applies the method of epidemiology to investigate the prevalence of a social issue and its association with potential determinants
1.Motivation: Western medicine has been dominating our society in treating diseases for decades.  However, Chinese medicine has been playing an important role"

ized approaches. If a circuit is completed correctly, a light bulb which symbolizing a certain functional CDS would be
lightened. By turning the microcosmic process into the visible and operable way, we successfully attracted many partici-
pants to get involved in our game, especially some kids and teenagers who got the pure pleasure of scientific research.
“This is absolutely the most exciting game I’ve ever played. “It inspires me to take more time in biology study as a stu-
dent of senior high”, said by one student.
   As to the second part “Design a Circuit”, you must use the synbio knowledge you’ve already learned in the first
game and your imagination to design a much more complicated circuit. Made up of more than twenty biobricks and re-
lated to Toggle Switch, the circuit was so hard that even some of our team members were stumped. However, to our
surprise, some participants did finish the circuit with least effort, including a pupil. During this garden party, we’ve seen
more and more Chinese teenagers devoting themselves in the joy of life sciences, and our team will try our best to
make contributions to spreading this joy to the public without any doubt.
Biological Contest in Modeling.
   As a good instance in the collaboration between outstanding universities in Guangdong Province, the “Bio-5-Talk” is
a series of activities which really make difference in developing communications among college students in Guangdong.
The highlight during “Bio-5-Talk” is absolutely the Biological Contest in Modeling. This year the annual party attracted
15 teams. By using fruits, styrofoam and other materials which are common in daily life, the participants are asked to
make a fabricated eukaryotic cell by hand. Our team used toothpicks to imitate the cytoskeleton together with plasti-
cine as the organelles, making a patterned and simple eukaryotic cell. We managed to use the cell model to illustrate
the basic process of transcription and translation, together with the knowledge of synbio to the other teams. At the
same time, we surely made some other participants interested in synthetic biology.

To check whether a diffenece in RBS efficiency could compansate for equal copy numbers, we multiplied transcription factor by RBS efficiency. In our case, RBS efficiency ratio of AraC gene to LacI gene is $5:3$, which gives $t_a = 150$ min-1 and $t_a = 90$ min-1, Concentrations of Arabinose and IPTG were kept constant at 0.7% and 3mM repectively.
To couple GFP to our oscillator, we added three more differential equations-         \begin{align}         \frac{dm_a}{dt} &= \frac{n_a b_a (1+\alpha c_a a^2(t - \tau_a))}{(1 + c_a a^2(t - \tau_a))(1+ 2c_r r^4(t - \tau_r) + {c_r}^2 r^8(t - \tau_r))} - \gamma_{m_a} m_g \\         \frac{dg_{uf}}{dt} &= t_g m_g - k_{fa}  g_{uf} - \gamma_{g_{uf}} g_{uf} \\         \frac{da}{dt} &= k_{fg} g_{uf} - k_g g \\         \end{align}         For GFP we have taken following values-          $$         \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}         \hline         \text{Sr.} & \text{Parameter} & \text{Description} & \text{value} & \text{units} \\ \hline         1 & k_{g} & \text{Rate of degradation of GFP} & 0.18 & min^{-1} \\  \hline         2 & k_{fg} & \text{Rate of folding of GFP} & 0.9 & min^{-1}  \\ \hline         3 & t_{g} & \text{Rate of transcription of GFP} & 200 & min^{-1}  \\ \hline         \end{array}         $$
Results
As can be seen from fig.1, our model gives stable oscillations in the concentration of AraC and LacI proteins. The period of the oscillations follows a curve given by fig.2, which matches well with the curve reported by Stricker et al.(2008).

Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," properly disposed. But in every recycling process, the quality of the PET decreases. After several processes, it can only be used for example for clothes. After about five times of recycling, the PET cannot be used anymore and is burnt in waste incineration plants. Toxic gases may occur if the PET is of low purity. This material is available at a very low price and could be transformed to Catechol by means of the method explained above, which would lead to an immense increase in value. Instead of burning it, the PET would be brought to special plants; the extracted Catechol could be sold at a high price.   This procedure offers a great economic incentive and could lead to a better strategy of collecting PET, so less waste would be disposed in the environment. A closed plant would be simple to install and probably be approved with regulations easy to satisfy.
b3) Cleansing of the global oceans
The motive of the project, cleaning the world from PET-waste, stays utopian at the current state of the art. As mentioned before, the only possible model-organism that comes into question would be yeast, for it combines the ability to degrade, transport and metabolize. Yeasts do not occur in salt water, so a matching carrier-organism that is viable in salt water has to be found. Amino acids are supposed to be the metabolic products.  Upon questioning the team of students, 63 % come out against the settlement of an artificially created organism (27 % no opinion, 10 % agree). The possible risks as mixture with other micro-organisms, uncontrolled mutation, digestion of other even natural polyesters and uncontrolled spread are unpredictable. The cleansing of the global oceans is not possible this way.
c)  Aspects of security
Even if the risk of unplanned genetic exchange with other bacteria is low, because the bacteria’s ability to conjugate has been removed, it can still not be fully eliminated. Consequences of mixture are unpredictable for the lack of empirical values. If the artificially designed bacterium is set out in the environment and if it comes to a genetic exchange, the now missing factors of pathogenicity may be built-in. This scenario is unlikely, but not impossible. Completely new, unknown bacteria strains may evolve.  For this reason, the bacteria may only be used in closed facilities.

For repressors we are interested in how much of the DNA is still unbound and active:  $\frac{1}{1 + ({\frac{[Repressor]}{K_{d}}})^{n}}$
For activators we are interested in how much of the DNA is bound and active:  $\frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[Activator]})^{n}}$
The Hill coefficient gives an idea about the strength about the interaction between the DNA and the protein and is sometimes used to estimate the amount of proteins that bind the DNA but caution is needed in using it. Indeed, the Hill function has knwown shortcomings, but it is still very useful because of its simplicity (citate paper).

${K_d}$ is the value which corresponds with the amount of repressor or activator necessary to repress or activate half of the promoters. Since our copynumber is 200, we multiply the Hill constant with 200 because this higher value seems more logical to us.
3.4 Complexation and dimerization
Before the proteins can bind the promoter region, they first have to make complexes. cI and penI form homodimers, while luxR first forms a heterodimer with AHL and afterwards forms a homodimer with another luxR/AHL. This next part will describe the kinetics of such complexation.
3.5 Protein production kinetics
Our models comprise two product forming enzymes: LuxI and Transaminase B.  LuxI is the enzyme responsible for AHL production and Transaminase B is responsible for Leucine formation.
For LuxI kinetics Schaefer et al. (1996) found a value of 1 molecule/minute for the Vmax. Since we assume that LuxI is fully saturated with substrate, we take this value as the synthesis rate of AHL.

Samples were taken every one hour (0h included) until the value of single cell florescence intensity (SFI) stopped changing significantly (roughly 4 hours, according to our experience). OD600 and florescence intensity were measured through a plate reader.
During a series of repetition experiments, we discovered that under the induction of IPTG, the increase of single-cell fluorescence of the experiment group is greater than the control. When CI-protein exists, the expression level of GFP gene will increase 1.5 times than the control, which indicates that CI-protein has the ability to improve the downstream gene’s expression. However, on the condition of the anti-cascading mechanism of TGATG linkage or the hairpin structure, present result can hardly satisfy the growth advantage as we expected.
The primary cause is the dosage of IPTG inadequate or too strong. The experimental group has two IPTG-inducible promoters, including the CI and GFP promoter. However, the control only has GFP promoter. As a result, the exogenous IPTG in control can be fully utilized to induce the expression of GFP but when it comes to experimental group, the amount of exogenous IPTG doesn’t equalize that for GFP expression.
As a consequence of we don’t have accurate data for the expression-level and the sensitivity to IPTG, in order to guarantee the induction dosage is adequate in two systems, we designed a gradient-experiment with the IPTG concentration of 0.5mM, 1mM, 2mM and under 1mM we observed the most conspicuous activation phenomenon, whereas the strains had already lysed under 2mM.
All the same, we can’t fully guarantee that the concentration of 1mM IPTG is overdose, which is affected by the direct or secondhand interaction between two lac promoters. In the follow-up experiments, we will replace CI-promoter with a constant-expression promoter to avoid the concentration problem. Moreover, we can screen out separated dots to modify the deviation caused by equipment problems.
Besides, it is reported that the co-expression of the carboxyl of CI-protein and the C-Terminal Domain of bacterial RNA polymerase can greatly improve motivation effect by two orders of magnitude, which will remain to be tested in future experiments.

By expressing the SdpI immunity protein under the control of the Pxyl promoter (Fig. 2B) we were able to evaluate the functionality of SdpI by growth curves measurements.
Delayed loss of immunity
A time delayed loss of the immunity protein SdpI in BaKillus can be achieved by interposing the alternative σ-factor ECF41bli aa 1-204 BBa_K823043 which is also under the control of the quorum sensing promoter PQS (Fig.3A). When expressed, ECF41bli aa 1-204 binds to the target promoter PydfG BBa_K823041 leading either to the expression of fsrA, a small RNA, or transcription of sdpI-antisense, a RNA, a complementary RNA to the sdpI mRNA (Fig. 3B).  To veri- and quantify the time delay due to the interposition of Ecf41bli aa 1-204 we replaced the fsrA coding sequence with the lux-cassette luxABCDE allowing lumi assay measurements (Fig. 3C).
For the loss of immunity we implemented two strategies, both causing translational inhibition of the sdpI mRNA.  The first strategy is based on an artificial synthesized RNA called sdpI-antisense RNA, which is complementary to the sdpI mRNA sequence. The sdpI-antisense sequence is regulated by PydfG (Fig. 4A) which is activated by the binding of Ecf41bli aa 1-204. As a consequence the sdpI-antisense RNA and the sdpI mRNA form a double-stranded duplex which is inaccessible for the ribosome making the cell SDP-sensitive. We tested the sdpI-antisense RNA in B. subtilis W168 with the xylose-inducable promoter Pxyl. (Fig. 4B)
The second strategy involves fsrA, a small RNA regulated by PydfG which binds to its binding site sdhC' (the 5'-UTR of sdhC mRNA) which is cloned between PsdpRI and sdpI (Fig. 5A). Binding of fsrA to the sdhC' site on the transcript inhibits the ribosomal translation process of the sdpI-mRNA. To evaluate this small RNA and its binding site in B. subtilis"

Meet the QGEM 2017 Team
The Queen’s iGEM team consists of fifteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines. Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2017 research project.
Yifei Wang (Director)
Yifei is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. Yifei is the new QGEM Dictator after overthrowing Dragos in a peaceful coup and enjoys bossing the QGEM team around from his SynBio throne. His favourite class at Queen’s was molecular biology, and he hopes to pursue a career that combines SynBio and medicine. Yifei has a burning passion for Metro prepared meals, but hopes to have enough money one day after becoming the CEO of his own biotech startup that he can hire Chef Dee #anotherone. His favourite sports team is the Toronto Raptors, and he hopes that his amateur career as a Roots model will one day allow him to replace Drake as their new courtside celebrity.
Nolan Neville (Wet Lab Co-Lead)
Nolan is in his fourth year of Biochemistry. He is particularly interested in bacteria and the rise of antibiotic resistance, so this year’s biofilm project was right up his alley. When he isn’t running around in the lab or admiring crystal structures, he can be found listening to old Dire Straits records and learning classic rock riffs on his Les Paul. In the future, Nolan hopes to pursue a career in research working to create novel antibiotics.
Mady Thompson (Wet Lab Co-Lead)
Mady is in her fourth year of Biochemistry. She is particularly interested in biomaterials, and hopes to pursue a Master’s degree in engineering in this field. She hails from Sunnyvale Trailer Park; ask her how the mosquitos are tonight for a guaranteed laugh. When she isn’t in the lab characterizing kinesin proteins, she can be found scouting the halls of Botterell for cute firefighters. Mady also moonlights as a professional basketball player in the lab, so be sure to wear your goggles to protect your eyes from her stray 3-pointers. Mady hopes to one day use her biomaterials engineering skills to make toothpaste less spicy.

Thus our project is focus on the bio-signal transformation to     diversify output methods of biosensor. In account of the high     maturity of silicon analysis, it will be a great advantage to transduce     biological sense into electric signal. Following this idea, we design a transducer which can convert the     change of gene expression level that stimulated by inducer directly     into the electric signal via inductive synthesis（or destroy）of     nanowire between the electrodes. Curli fiber, a well characterized     amyloid fiber which forms β-sheet-rich amyloid fibers, seems     to be an ideal foundation of our nanowire structure. CsgA, the     modified morphon protein of curli fiber with the ability to bind     nano gold particles, will play the role as the conductor. Once we synthesize conductive curli fiber, there are two approach     to carry out the target sensing, by inductively synthesizing the     conductive fiber between the electrodes to turn on a switch for     connecting a open circuit, or inductively expressing the gene     coding the curli-degrading enzyme to destruct the pre-synthesized     nanowire. The change of the electric current shall represent the     concentration of inducer.

OUR PROJECT
Cholerae is major cause of death in children during first year     of life in tropical country. Cholera is tropical neglected disease     because it causes significant illness more than one billion people     and cholera outbreak rises when the disaster comes, because of     bad water sanitation.
In high cell density, Vibrio cholera formed biofilm to protect them     from milieu exterior disturbance therefore antibiotic and other     drugs treatment can not be effective against cholera infection. Here,     we proposed a novel strategy to degrade cholera biofilm by using     principles of synthetic biology. Our team genetically engineered     E. coli to specifically detect quorum sensing (QS) molecule from     Vibrio cholera. We use E.coli because it is normally found in human     intestine.

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," labeled with the fluorescent dye from the peptide. Furthermore we expected the excised intein (17.3 kDa) to show up on the gel, unlabeled since the splicing mechanism should transfer the fluorescent dye unto the protein.
After 24 hours, we did instead encounter a brightly fluorescing band weighing roughly 20 kDa and one with less fluorescence weighing roughly 27 kDa. The SDS-PAGE showed a band around 60 kDa, which was absent in the control. We suspected this to be the product NAGA (52.2 kDa) without the excised intein (data not shown).
After 48 hours, we encountered the same pattern of bands, but the band weighing 60 kDa was much more pronounced, even though there was still no fluorescence visible from this band.
This pattern can be explained with the side reaction, which Volkmann et al. termed N-cleage. Upon formation of the intein-peptide complex, the part of the splicing reaction N-terminal of the intein complex takes place, while the reaction on its C-terminus does not. This way the generated fragments are different. While we expect: NAGA-Extein-Fluorescein (53 kDa), the excised Intein (17.3 kDa) and the 6 amino acid peptide to be generated, we get NAGA (52.2 kDa), Intein (17.3 kDa) and Peptide-Fluorescein (1.5 kDa). Since the part of the fluorescent peptide, which gets transferred to the NAGA is very small (0.8 kDa) this side reaction would barely show on an SDS-gel, aside from the lack of fluorescence.
We were unable to explain the actually fluorescing bands. However, since they were quite bright, a band only exhibiting little fluorescence might be not picked up. So to find if our intein was active but the resulting fluorescence overshadowed, we attempted another analysis using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. At the same time, we tried to find out what caused the fluorescing bands.
Maldi II: Peptide coupling/functional assay
We cut out the bands indicated in the graphic below and treated them as explained here .  Trying to fit the peaks to the expected protein (NAGA) yielded a sequence coverage of 18.2% and an intensity coverage of 2.9%. This result cannot be considered significant.
The two other gel pieces we analyzed turned out with high probability to be ribosomal proteins.  However"

With all of the components of the system being produced, we could begin to test for a response to BDSF. To test how the system would respond to BDSF, cells containing the construct were cultured in LB medium and spiked with synthetic BDSF in DMSO at concentrations of 50 µM, which corresponds to the levels found in the sputum of lungs colonised by Burkholderia3 and 500 µM. A western blot with anti-GFP antibodies was performed on the treated cells alongside an un-spiked, BDSF-negative control, and MC1061 cells harbouring the empty pUniprom vector. The results are shown in Fig 4.
These results indicate that GFP production is activated regardless of the presence of BDSF. To test whether our E. coli chassis was responsible for activating GFP production, either via phosphorylation of BCAM0228 or by directly activating the cblD promoter, we made a new construct harbouring PcblD-gfp and BCAM0228-HA, but lacking BCAM0227. Fig 5 shows that GFP was only produced in the presence of BCAM0228-HA. We therefore concluded that GFP output is likely caused by crosstalk by two component regulatory systems within E. coli promoting the phosphorylated state of the BCAM0228 response regulator.
We are continuing to investigate this issue by screening E. coli mutants carrying deletions in genes coding for sensor kinases, taking advantage of the E. coli Keio mutant collection3. Alternatively it may be that BCAM0228 is being phosphorylated by a small molecular weight phosphate donor such acetylphosphate. Acetylphosphate production can be eliminated in a pta-ackA double deletion mutant. Further work is required before the BDSF sensor is fully functional.

Equation 3 Sensitivity of GFP signal to nicotine input
Due to the application of difference without the calculation of limit value, the sensitivity value is not completely same as the real differential coefficient of GFP intensity-nicotine input curve. To increase the accuracy and smooth the sensitivity-nicotine curve, the sampling interval of log10 nicotine is set to 0.001.
Figure 5 GFP concentration vs nicotine
Figure 6 Signal sensitivity vs nicotine
The variation between promoter 1 strength may influence the GFP signal response to nicotine input, so we select three groups for comparison: 0.1 (group1), 0.5 (group2) and 1 (group3). Figure 5 shows the change of GFP maximal concentration with different nicotine input. All three groups have two bursts in the curve, which means that there are two regions with high sensitivity. This phenomenon is also reflected by figure 6. When nicotine input is between 1e-3.8and 1e-3 M, three groups have very strong sensitivity. The left boundary of the interval is the threshold of the sensing system, which is about 1e-3.8 M for group 2/3, and 1e-3.6 M for group 1. But for the second burst, the interval of the three groups vary a lot. The burst interval of the three groups is [1e-3.2, 1e-2] M, [1e-2.7, 1e-1.3] M and [1e-2.3, 1e-1] M separately. This difference of sensitivity distribution means that we can select specific promoter 1 strength to achieve high sensitivity and precision sensing and measurement in the defined nicotine input range. This idea can be developed to a new application in our future work.
Time point of signal processing
In the experiment, we need to choose the appropriate time to measure the GFP signal to determine the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium. Besides, to collect the maximal quantity of final product, it is important to select the time point when 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches highest concentration. This session we simulate the change of GFP/NicA2/3-Succinoyl-Pyridine and identify the start time of observable GFP signal and the duration time of GFP signal and NicA2 high expression. At last, according to simulation results, we propose"

Although GMOs and synthetic biology are not that mature at present, corresponding research and experiments shouldn’t be stopped because starvation is still a severe global problem. GMOs and organisms modified by synthetic biology often cost less than ordinary products and are easier to plant or raise. Because of this, they are of great potential to solve the problem of starvation and can create more wealth for farmers.
Positive side [3rd debater]:
Thank you, my fellow debaters. Although GMOs and synthetic biology have many merits, they have not been widely accepted by people. Citizens’ distrust and rejection of GMOs may be the biggest obstacle on the way of promoting GMOs and synthetic biology.
Forth Round
Negative side [4th debater]:
Thanks. There is no doubt that making GMOs and synthetic biology widely accepted by most people is not that easy, because it will necessarily cost a lot to promote a new concept or technology. However, this kind of cost is worthy and escaping from the trend of technology is definitely not a wise option. In fact, the high cognitive cost and the manipulation from interesting groups are the main reasons for anti-GMOs.
Positive side [4th debater]:
Thank you for your suggestions. GMOs and synthetic biology may be beneficial in the future. However, the immature technology shouldn’t be applied in a large scale, for instance the large area of soybean planting. The unclear consequence of modification and other potential risk that probably appear after several decades pose a great threat to the future generation who eat soybean since childhood. Therefore, we hold the opinion that the GMOs and synthetic biology cannot be developed until we get a profound understanding of biology fundamental theory.
Summary
Simply from the aspect of technology, any kind of technology ought to be developed. Nevertheless, considering the social reality, the development of some sort of technology is restricted, such as nuclear technology, which is viewed to be evil. Although nuclear technology is potential to destroy the earth, we keep exploring it and have made such surprising achievements that nuclear energy can peacefully make contributions to our life.
Similar to nuclear technology, GMOs and synthetic biology are also technologies that are like a double-edged sword. It should be noticed that the significance of GMOs and synthetic biology in handling starvation and climate change, which potentially outweigh the side effect.
It is obvious that how many benefits a new technology could bring to someone determines how much support it will get from someone. Currently, developing GMOs and synthetic biology in China contrad"

Figure 1: Relative position of the verification primers. a) no integrants; b) single integrant and c) integrant with multiple tandem copies. P1/P2 and P3/P4 pairs give an amplicon when at least one copy of the vector is integrated in the Phi80 locus. P2/P3 pair show an amplicon only when multiple tandem copies occur.
Competent cells preparation: all the E. coli strains were made competent following a slightly modified version of the protocol described in [Sambrook J et al., 1989]. Briefly, cells were grown to and OD600 of ~0.4-0.6, harvested (4000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in (30 ml for each 50 ml of initial culture) pre-chilled Mg-Ca buffer (80 mM MgCl2, 20 mM CaCl2), centrifuged as before and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in (2 ml for each 50 ml of initial culture) pre-chilled Ca buffer (100 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol), aliquoted in 0.5 ml tubes and freezed immediately at -80°C.

The Chloramphenicol concentration in plates was 34 ug/ml for the high copy plasmids, 12.5 ug/ml for the medium/low copy plasmids and 12.5 for the three control strains transformed with the R6K plasmid.
Integration protocol:
Transform the <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> helper plasmid in the host strain (MC1061 or MG1655) and select transformants on Amp (50 ug/ml) plates under permissive conditions (30°C) overnight.
Inoculate a single colony in selective LB and let the culture grow at 30°C, 220 rpm. When the culture reaches the OD600 of 0.4-0.6 prepare chemically competent cells.
Transform the integrative vector with the desired insert in the BBa_J72008-containing strain and select co-transformants on Cm (34 ug/ml) plates under permissive conditions (30°C) overnight. At this temperature <partinfo>BBa_J72008</"
