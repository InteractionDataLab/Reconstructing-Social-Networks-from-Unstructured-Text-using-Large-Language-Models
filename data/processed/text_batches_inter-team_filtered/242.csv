Part 2  On Fundamental Study
Knowing that there was a gap between scientific research and product development in China, with the proposal of team Tianjin team, six universities worked together to make research on how the laboratory results are converted to market products. We conducted market research on the products based on fundamental study and then investigated the evaluation mechanism. The final report of commercialization of research findings worked as a reference guide for foundational advance.
The body of the report is the analysis and research of this transformation process (with theory and case study) and our projects. The theoretical part was completed by iGEM Tianjin and our team. The case study was completed by OUC-China and Jilin_China. In our own project analysis section, ZJU-Chian and XJTU-China wrote a detailed application plan.
The theoretical analysis we were in charge of is as follows:
Finishing this part of the report, we discovered that the transformation of research findings was a comprehensive process related to many factors. Government, users, companies, and scientists should work together for the final goal. In view of our project, we should consider market demand if we wanted to convert our innovative protein degradation tools to a practical curing method.
CFDA Inquiry
As our project will finally apply to mammalian cells in curing protein-related diseases, we must take laws and policies into consideration from the time we conduct experiments in the laboratory. We have inquired China Food and Drug Administration about this issue and got a feedback of the interpretation related to Technical Guidelines for Research and Evaluation of Cell Therapy Products.
Cell therapy technology is currently the key development field of international medical frontiers, which provides new hopes for the treatment of some complicated diseases. This policy was released in 2015 in order to better create an environment for cell product research and development and provide technical support to relevant scientific research institutions and enterprises.
The contents helpful to our project are shown as follows.
According to the general principles and basic requirements, we designed and conducted our experiment and future work in a more effective and rational way. We had a deeper investigation of non-clinical research on cell therapy products.
Gold & Integrated HP
Overview
Initially, we interviewed professors in universities about the design, feasibility and application of our experiments. Based on the promoted lab work, we conducted company research for more market-based information, and then had the idea of degrading target proteins related to some diseases. Next, we investigated people's attitudes towards our innovative tool of curing methods with speeches at streets and got some positive feedbacks. Realizing most people"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," releases pexiganan molecules. These pexiganan molecules are active lysis molecules that cause cells to splinter. For this reason, pexiganan molecules lysing E.colis which contain pexiganan and get it out of the cells. The pexiganan which set the release of the cell will allow the elimination of Helicobacter pylori.
In this case, the protein that binds to DAMP and the tip imbedded in PEX. will be produced in the E. coli without rupturing the cell membrane. TEV Protease that produces in the presence of AND GATE and the active pexiganan will leave from DAMP,  and keep releasing the effective dose within and around the h.pylori. At the same time, we will provide eradication E.coli which is used as a producer and a carrier so that there won't be anymore possibility of colonization mucosa to have to be removed.
Background
Pexiganan
According to our researches, a very efficient protein called pexiganan, a molecule showing a broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activities against both gram negative and positive bacteria, seemed beneficial for killing H. Pylori.(Figure 1) Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are very popular because of their bactericidal activity and they seem potential alternatives to current antibiotics. Also, antimicrobial peptides are not affected by classical antibiotic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, so this class of peptide have advantages to eradicate H.pylori instead of using current antibiotics. The other advantage of AMPs is that there aren’t any resistance to them-yet.  This was shown in a study too. (Figure 2)
In a paper, pexiganan’s killer activity is proved under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. (Xiao-Lin Zhang et al. 2015) It has exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and it has been tested against 3109 clinical isolate strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ge, Y; MacDonald, D,L et al. 1999). By using normal H.Pylori treatment way, complete eradication is not possible because of the low antibiotic concentration in gastric mucosa. In addition, in the low pH of the gastric fluid, antibiotics are unstable. As a result of gastric emptying, the residence time is short for antibiotics in the stomach. Therefore, our strategy depends on providing production of pexiganan enter the mucosa according to presence of H.pylori or not. This system is based on the"

2. Evaluating an uncarried-on project by Artificial Intelligence.
In the future, we are going to adding a crowdsourcing feature in our software. To evaluate the project, a reliable auto-judging system will be created. The evaluation system will not only consist of simulation results but also variety of aspects that may affect the reliability of a project to function well (not only for Competition Awards but also for TRUE scientific & social effect it has). Machine learning and other method in big data mining area will definitely be used in the coming feature.
3. More validation experiments and feedbacks.
According to basic principles of engineering, iteration of the design-test-redesign circle for a product could never be enough. More efficient and user friendly features will be added during our further human practice in Synthetic Biology field. In our human practice section, we have demonstrate how we gain the idea of S-Din and how we enhanced it during the summer. We will do the same job for future improvement of S-Din, to make S-Din more popular and well-featured.
4. Dynamic data flow for synthetic biology.
During the brain storm, we want to add the feature that can provide dynamic data (news, latest paper) which can automatically upgraded everyday. Due to the limitation of time, we didn't merge this function into our software. In the future, these feature will be also added.
5. System optimization of the whole genome with the inserted circuits.
As a software team in synthetic biology, we felt responsible to build a software that can truly utilize the power of computer and algorithm to manage synthetic biologists  to accomplish important and complexed tasks. After circuits getting used seamlessly from search results, an consideration of the genome level are going into our sight. As the electronic system, performance and connection can be optimized to a most efficient or robustest way.
S-Din is the first step of our ambition to solve real synthetic biology problem based on which further project will have a ground foundation of data collection.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

r/iGEM_Exchange
As members of iGEM, we are taking our first steps towards becoming participants in this field of science. It's important we create a discourse within our community aimed at making us all more self-aware and conscientious towards the societal impacts of our work so that the power of bioengineering is in responsible hands. Also, everyone needs a good meme now and then to get through a long day of lab work!
In order to meet these needs, Duke iGEM started r/iGEM_Exchange. The following teams have collaborated with us as moderators of this forum for iGEM discussions:
Gaston Day High School
East Chapel High School
Together we've had fun discussing a wide variety of topics such as the ethical implications of synthetic biology, current research, and IGEM memes! Currently we are working with iGEM HQ to expand our advertising in order to get the whole community involved. Check it out here !

 CDHSU-CHINA
We held a lecture at Chengdu No.4 High School and give them a total introduction on iGEM. We help them know about iGEM and explained how to set up teams and how to register the competition in detail. This year, the school established their 2018 iGEM team, CDHSU-CHINA. Since then, we have been guiding them how to fulfill the criteria and giving instruction to them when deciding on their project.

Brainstorming 2/3: Lab Assistant
Brainstorming 3/3: Private vs. Public space
Today, each group presented their findings on the topics we had been assigned at the beginning of summer research. Between each presentation, we shared ideas that popped into our heads and devoted around 10 minutes to brainstorm how each of what had been researched could be integrated into our iGEM submission.
I found the idea of the DiamondSpin (i.e. the Lazy Suzanne for platforms) really interesting. It has several functions but I found it to be most intuitive for the windows to shrink as they were dragged towards the center. Then, should a person at the other end of the Beast, for example, want to access it, they would just use the outer rim of the circle to rotate it such that the window’s orientation would be adjusted appropriately and it was closer to them. Then, they’d be able to drag it outside the circle and examine it. As for the idea of windows getting larger as they were dragged towards the center, while this may seem useful for presentations, considering that the circular form makes sense for a platform with people surrounding it like the Beast (change in orientations), then enlarging it in the middle to present it to people would keep it in one orientation. Consequently, the orientation may be readjusted enough times that it would become a distraction during the presentation.
After the presentations, we were split up into two different groups and each came up with five different big ideas for projects to pursue over the summer. I really liked the idea of having a graph, inspired by the idea of Semantic Search, that essentially tracked the person’s “trail of thought.” They begin with a main query that constitutes the middle bubble. Then, the succeeding nodes represent queries they made right after and/or related to the node it is attached to. If the person wanted to go back to change a query or start another trail, they’d be able to. There was also the idea of the personal lab helper (like the animated clip on Microsoft Word). The program would different between people by recognizing their irises or fingerprints to prevent confusion. The surface would be the lab table and through each protocol, if a certain tool was needed, the shape of the tool would appear on the surface and keep blinking until the person prepared the correct tool. A camera would be placed above the table and record while the researcher would be doing an experiment. There were also a lot of ideas for the eLab Notebook, like being able to zoom in to a protocol and annotate it but when you zoom"

Part improvement
Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which initiates de novo RNA synthesis with the help of specific RNA promoters. In our project, the RNA interference is conditional because the pri-miRNA analogue which partially pairs with an inhibitory strand is unable to be processed by DROSHA. Once NS5B is introduced to catalyze a substitutional hybridation to release the pri-miRNA in the nucleus, the analogue gets to evolve into miRNA and interferes with the target gene mRNA.
Since the existent NS5B from Standard Parts collection which can not translocate into the nucleus does not suit our needs, we tend to design our own part that is able to do its job in the nucleus. After deep consideration, we decided to improve the function of the part submitted by iGEM14 Warwick ( BBa_K1442028 ). We load a nuclear location sequence (NLS) to the N terminal of NS5B (NS5BNLS) to transport the RdRP into the nucleus ( BBa_K2624002 ). We demonstrate this improvement by indirect immunofluorescence. As the following figure shows, NS5B with NLS (NLS+) have a higher ability of nuclear translocation than NS5B without NLS (NLS-)."

Differentially downregulated genes in vitiligo melanocytes included integrin alpha 7, integrin beta-like 1, integrin beta 7 and catenin alpha-like 1 (cadherin-associated protein). The adhesion between the melanocytes and the basal membrane is mediated by integrins and the contacts between melanocytes and keratinocytes are mediated by cadherins (Hara et al., 1994; Tang et al., 1994; Zambruno et al., 1993). The importance of regulated expression levels of cadherins have also been shown during migration of melanoblasts (Nishimura et al., 1999).

Microbial Biosensors
A biosensor is a analytical device which makes use of a biological component to detect an analyte [1]. This biological component is broadly defined and could include enzymes, nucleic acids, and antibodies. Here, we will focus on whole cell microbial biosensors. In whole cell biosensors, the biological component consists of a living cell [2]. The use of whole cell microbial biosensors has certain advantages over the use of other biosensors and non-biological sensors.
One of the major advantages of whole cell biosensors is that they are able to detect substances by class, and not only one specific substance ["

Discovery
    Maybe you have not thought about it before--game is not only for pure fun, but is also a good tool for thinking and educating. In fact, our game E.coli War has many deep meanings for us to explore. For example, we have found it really interesting when we compare our game theories with typical historical events.
    When a player manages to conclude some theories about how to win the game, he will find that the war between our little bacteria is very similar to the war between empires in history. Different ways of initializing bacteria symbolize different eras. The growth and kinds of bacteria symbolize the changing of dynasty. They wisdom and strategies a player conclude is like the wisdom that is needed by the rulers of a kingdom.
    What's more, the game can also help us in considering spatial factors' effects on population interactions (For example, discoveries metioned below) and even promoting synthetic biology.
    Now let us take a look about different discoveries that we conclude. (In movies, the yellow ones are from side A(left) while the blue ones are from side B(right))
I Era of Peace without War
    In this case, there are no warriors on either side. Therefore, the initial position of where to set the bacteria accounts the most. The following movie shows the situation where both sides own the same amount of bacteria: side A has 4 farmers while side B has 2 farmers and 2 beggars. If side A initializes its bacteria in the middle of media, then they can easily win.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#HEARTBEAT database_-_-_TEXT.html," outcome of our in vivo test tell us?
Can promoter design become fully automated?
[ TOP ]
Transcription factors have a spatial binding preference
Upon statistical analysis of over 4000 promoter sequences, we discovered 90 out of 356 TFBS distributions with one significant peak reflecting the spatial occurrence of a particular binding motive. 54 distributions contain two equally high local maxima. For the remaining 212 transcription factors less than 50 TFBS could be detected by Promotersweep and hence were not in the scope of our analysis. Transcription factors have been shown before to have certain spatial binding preferences [3] , [4] , but no analysis based upon multiple databases and gene orthologies was ever conducted. Our method therefore minimizes false positives, and still, our results confirm existing findings.
[ TOP ]
Improving HEARTBEAT database
As noted above, for 212 TFs, less than 50 TFBSs could be detected. In order to overcome this problem in the future we plan to accomplish the screening of the entire genome and to systematically expand our promoter screening by including genomes from different mammalian species. With the increased variety of input sequences we hope to decrease the influence of false positive hits in our statistics. Furthermore it could also help to understand the 54 distributions with multiple maxima and answer the question about the occurance of multiple potential binding sites of one single TF within a given promoter sequence. To make HEARTBEAT even more universal we plan to screen a broader range of the natural promoters which will comprise the sequence downstream of the TSS as well, as it is a well known fact that TF bind to introns and 5' UTR also [24] . In parallel we want to focus on promoters involved in disease related pathways which promises deeper insight in the differences in their molecular regulation.
[ TOP ]
In vivo test of predicted sequences shows that functional promoter can be predicted by HEARTBEAT
Figure 12: HEARTBEAT generates functional promoter sequences. Sequence HB 8 and 9 are inducible under appropriate conditions . Sequences marked red were introduced as a negative control
Of all the designed sequences, HB8 and HB9 showed activity under appropriate conditions (compare Fig. 11, Results). These sequences are highly similar (see Fig. 12 for how SREs were placed) since they have Transcription Factor Binding Sites under both peaks of the distribution with at least one auxiliary Sp1 element. The other sequences either lack the second SREBP binding site or the Sp1 binding site. Sequences having another type of putative SREBP response element are not functional"

Parts
Once we received our parts from IDT we transformed the plasmids in DH5-alpha cells in ampicillin resistant plates.All of our plates (OspA, WSP and GFP) had many colonies due to the fact that we added 3 times the amount of DNA since we had some problems with transformation in our practice rounds. The positive plates were positive and the negative plates were negative.
We picked 5 colonies from each plate and we purified the plasmids using mini-preps. We checked the plasmid purity using agarose gels, all of the colonies had the plamid inside. We did not sent the plasmids for sequencing due to the cost, we just selected one of the five colonies and did a PCR using Gibson Assembly primers. We had a lot of difficulty doing the PCRs because the melting temperature between the primers was not similar. It took us quite some time to get all of amplicons ready, especially WSP to which we had to add b-mercaptoethol to get a good yield.
Our first attempt at PCR
Optimized PCR amplicons :)
For the Gibson Assembly we used a linear ampicillin plasmid backbone (pSB1A3), and the gel purified amplicons for the reaction. Due to the way we designed our primers and parts (composites), we could only do the Gibson Assembly between GFP and WSP. RFP cells are present in the plate and at first we thought it was contamination until we read that it was undigested plasmids.
Problems
Our main problems were of human error, whether not labeling something properly or leaving an experiment half way because a team member had to go to work or practice.Our team was mainly composed of Freshman (who can't drive) and it was difficult for some of them to attend our meetings.
Our next problem was equipment, being from high school it was really hard to maintain our competent cells in dry ice.
We are not sure if the fluoresece of the GFP is real, since it is faint, we are seeing some teams doing exposures of 30 seconds so we might do the same, but this may not be"

8.Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments. The fragments of DNA are usually referred to as ‘bands’ due to their appearance on the gel.
EXTRACTION THE DNA FRAGMENT FROM THE AGAROSE GEL
1.Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2.Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 µl).
3.Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved).To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation.
4.After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5.Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
6.Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
7.To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min.
8.Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9.Recommended: Add 0.5ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for1min.
10.To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
11.Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1min at 13,000 rpm.
12.Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
13.To elute DNA, add 50µl water (pH7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1min.  Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Uganda_-_-_TEXT.html," the leaves of plants allow farmers to reduce the impact of fungal infections.
Farmer dries harvested peanuts
Despite the increase in crop yield, Mr. Dhikusooka noted that pesticides can harm farmers who do not wear any protective gear while spraying. He suggested that this is due the high cost of protective equipment and lack of knowledge regarding negative consequences from pesticide exposure. He estimated that only between 2-5% of farmers wear protective gear in his district and noted that early detection would help minimize unnecessary spraying and direct subsidies towards farmers affected by rust.
After learning about our project, Mr. Dhikusooka expressed an interest in using our device in his work to track the spread of the fungus and more readily identify different strains and types of fungi. He also mentioned that its use would increase as government-sponsored labs work to develop resistant crops since about half of the farmers in the district use seeds provided by multipliers who produce improved seed varieties developed in government-sponsored labs. As more farmers begin using improved seed varieties and the quality of multiplied seeds improves, developing seeds with an increased variety of resistance genes will become increasingly important. Tracking which strains are most prevalent and identifying more resistance genes will play a large role in such progress.
Demonstration Farmer
Our team spoke with George Bunyinza who receives guidance from the community development organization, Musana, and brings in other farmers for brief training. He mentioned that climate change and fungal infections are some of his largest problems. He listed the orange dog caterpillar, coffee borer beetles, army worms, and nematodes as other pests that significantly affect his crops. His fields are sprayed regularly by a hired laborer as a preventative measure against fungal infections.
Mr. Bunyinza and family
Mr. Bunyinza noted that most farmers don’t use preventative equipment because they cannot afford it. He and a Musana representative added that Musana ensures that those spraying wear protective gear. However, when asked to see the equipment they require people to wear, we were only shown a few pairs of rubber boots.
While discussing our project, he said that earlier detection of the presence of fungus could help his farm as he would increase the frequency and dosage of spraying to combat its presence. He claimed that increasing the frequency and dosage has decreased crop losses when fungal diseases have been present. Despite the process working for him, he agreed that an early detection system could further help increase crop yield by beginning the process earlier. Since fungicides are expensive, fungal detection mechanisms would make the process more effective and less costly for farmers.
He also provided insight on optimizing our hardware for Ugandan farmers. He suggested"

In the picture there's the result: we miss a signal from T7lac-RFP and we have a weak signal from T7lac2-RFP therefore these two reactions have been repeated succesfully (see picture on the left).
Alessandro made PCRs to amplify pSB3K1 and pSB3C5 plasmids to use them as backbone for our device (T7-lysis/RFP) and they'll be ran on gel the day next. The extension PCR for T7-lysis failed because extension time was erroneously set as 1 minute instead of 2 minutes and therefore they have been repeated and will be ran on gel the following day.
Lilia run MITOMI on spotted 1-off library with GFP-wtTetR expressed off-chip with SP6 ITT. The results are being analysed.
Tuesday, 16 August 2011
Nadine got the sequencing results for digested-ligated pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR and they look fine! There is no trace of RFP, and Pconst-TetR are perfect. Seems that we have our 1st beer award. She co-transformed this plasmid with J61002 pTet-RFP and booked the plate reader, and finished ordering all the needed primers, including colony PCR primers.
Alessandro ran the gel for the PCR products of the previous day: we miss pSB3K1 therefore the reaction has been repeated with different templates (even with the plasmid from the registry) and it worked. Another PCR has been run to amplify the backbone from pSB3K5 but it didn't work (maybe because the plasmid taken from the registry's plate has a very low concentration); the reaction will be repeated only after the miniprep for this sample will be done. Alessandro proceeded with the protocol started the day before from Henrike to make competent cells: the BL21 (DE3) which will be used for the T7-lys plasmid since these bacteria have the T7 polymerase gene under the control of Plac (they overexpress LacI). Unfortunately the PCR purification gave us bad results for the T7-lysis which is at very low concentration. pSB3C5 instead has an high concentration. Henrike suggested, to have an higher yield, to dilute your PCR products 4-fold before starting the PCR purification protocol. Alessandro PCR purified the previous succesfully amplified T7-RFP products but for T7"

Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
Our team researched how factors beyond the bench can impact the potential of an iGEM project and more broadly synthetic biology to make a positive real world impact. After realising that bioremediation of chlorinated solvents had potential not just as an iGEM project but as a solution to the pollution faced by the Environment Agency, we decided to investigate: How can an iGEM Project change the real world? Our broad approach allowed us to explore many areas as facets of this question, including intellectual property, practicality (including safety), and public participation. The result was a far-reaching Policy and Practices project which impacted on almost all aspects of the scientific project and addressed a question of interest central interest to our scientists and hopefully to other iGEM teams! Our research into Intellectual Property policy strongly influenced our decision to encourage other iGEM teams to use our novel ‘BioBead’ containment system; our research into safety drove the design of the DCMation prototype; our research into the environmental problems posed by chlorinated solvents has constantly guided all aspects of the scientific project. We hope our approach will encourage others to consider the non-scientific factors which impact the success of their project, to take these seriously, and to realise just how much good an iGEM project really can do!
See our Policy and Practices page for details on our approach, evaluation and its influence on our project.

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Results#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,", diffuse red regions were found and are probably due to release of anthocyanins by stressed or aging cells.
The bright red cells seen in Marchantia transformed with the TsPurple construct
It is notable that in the red cells, the vacuole is not visually distinct from the cytoplasm. As GFP, a protein of similar structure, is not accumulated in the vacuole without specific targeting, this implies that either the colour we observe in the bright cells is not due to chromoprotein expression, or perhaps that tsPurple is toxic enough to cause cellular damage and leaky organelles.
Plants transformed with asPink (which is also known as asFP595 due to its fluorescence), nuclear localised with an N7 tag, while not visibly pigmented, did have areas that fluoresced at the literature wavelengths.
Part of an asPink:N7 transformant visualised using a fluorescence microscope with a GFP filter (the only one with wavelength windows that intersect those of asPink's absorption and emission peaks)
In addition, we measured the absorption spectra of the chromoprotein as expressed in E.coli for comparison purposes.

Raspberry ketone production
As another example output module, the biosynthetic pathway from coumaroyl-coA to raspberry ketone was assembled, to allow the smell of raspberries to be used as an odour signal that the input module has been activated.
To characterise the enzymes involved, a bacterial constructs was made, and the E. Coli transformed with it we called RaspberrE coli. The construct consisted of an arabinose inducible expression plasmid coding for 4-coumarate coA ligase, benzalacetone synthase, and benzalacetone reductase, and the strain of E. Coli we used had the TnaA indole synthase gene knocked out to somewhat reduce the faecal odour associated with this molecule. (growing in M9 salts with casamino acids and no tryptophan eliminated the faecal odour entirely, as the smell is due entirely to tryptophan derivatives).
The RaspberrE coli were incubated for two and a half days with 3 or 9mM p-coumaric acid and 50mM arabinose to induce expression. The cultures were then shaken with ethyl acetate which was then run on an LCMS setup (which was only possible due to the kind giving of time and expertise by Ben Pilgrim at the Cambridge Department of Chemistry).

Safety of chassis:
We use Escherichia coli as our chassis,the names of all strains are:Escherichia coli strain Nissle, BL21 Competent E. coli, DH5-Alpha Escherichia coli strain.Our chassis organisms are all widely-used E.coli strains.So they're all very safe, and even if they get out of the lab, the risk can be effectively controlled.
Safety of parts:
We add lethal sequences to our plasmids, and there are two ways to do that.
Figure 1   Conditional lethal system 1, composed of two plasmids. Plasmid 1 is composed of the promoter hucO, hypothetical uricase regulator which called HucR, uric acid transporter which called ygfU, sRNA and lysis protein. Plasmid 2 is composed of the sRNA and lysis protein.
SRNA in plasmid 1 is an inhibitory element of lysis2 in plasmid 2, which inhibits lysis2 expression. SRNA in plasmid 2 is an inhibiting element of lysis1 in plasmid 1, which inhibits lysis1 expression. When one of the plasmids is lost, the lytic protein of the other plasmids will not be inhibited, that is, the bacteria will express the lytic protein and cause the bacteria to lyse, thus killing the bacteria that lose the plasmids, so as to prevent the loss of plasmids.
Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestines of hyperuricemia patients, we use uric acid as the response signal of the lethal system. When the uric acid concentration exceeds the threshold, HucR is inhibited by uric acid, and Phuco is in the open state. Subsequent genes can be transcribed and translated normally, but since lysis1 is inhibited by sRNA, the bacteria will not be cracked. When the"

Insertion of G. metallireducens pilA Into G. sulfurreducens Proved Difficult
A fragment consisting of pilA from G. metallireducens, camR, and the 500 up- and downstream regions of the endogenous pilA genes of G. sulfurreducens were successfully constructed by PCR. The fragment was validated on gel electrophoresis, as seen in Figure 27-Left, with the band just above 3000 bp. The first electroporation was performed, and afterwards chloramphenicol was added for a concentration of 10µg/ml, this was added to isolate  the G. sulfurreducens recombinants, as done by Coppi MV et al. 2001 Coppi MV, Leang C, Sandler SJ, Lovley DR. Development of a Genetic System for Geobacter sulfurreducens. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2001;67(7):3180-7. . After the selection of the G. Sulfurreducens recombinants, a PCR of its genomic DNA was carried out to identify the expected 3000 bp insertion. However, we were only able to retrieve a 1700 bp fragment, as seen in Figure 27-Right, and not the expected 3000 bp fragment. For this reason, a new experiment using the same 3000 bp fragment was performed, this time increasing the chloramphenicol concentration to 30 µg/ml for the selection of recombinants. This, however, resulted in no bacterial growth after electroporation. Due to a lack of time, we eventually decided to put this part of our project on hold.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". However, the bacterial equations experience the same dilution term, which is a result of the cytoplasm constantly expanding during the growth phase. As the population transits into the stationary phase, the dilution, following the growth rate, slows down as well, allowing the concentrations to increase freely.
Results (with growth model)
Figure 7: QS curves with growth for increasing culture volume. The final time is larger for the last plots. Culture volume left to right: 4μL,16μL,64μL,512μL,1024μL
Figure 8: QS curves with a reduced growth rate. Culture volume: 4μL. Compared to figure 7 , QS is indeed triggered later (since here there are fewer bacteria at equal times), but at an earlier growth phase, before the transition to the stationary phase.
Figure 9: QS curves at an extreme colony volume: 5000μL. This volume is about the same as the agar in a small petri dish, which will become a useful reference for the diffusive model.
The growth model impacts the QS system greatly. As is evident in figure 7 vs 8 , while the growth rate is high (r=1.5) quorum sensing is difficult to achieve. This corroborates the result in figure 3 . As the volumes increase and the growth curve remains the same, more AHL has to be produced to achieve the same concentration, which takes more time. At an extreme volume of 5mL, in figure 9 QS still happens, but much later, at 40 hours. This volume is significant, because it is the volume of a small petri dish, which we would like to simulate with the diffusive model to compare the results.
Diffusive model
We’ve modelled a bacterial population in a well-stirred liquid culture so far. Without the “growth model”, we either model a stationary population or one that grows at a steady rate, its density maintained constant by compensating dilution. With the growth model, an initial inoculation grows to the environment’s carrying capacity, modelling a bacterial colonization of a new environment.
Bacteria growing on a surface are packed very closely together, but the AHL they produce is free to leave their immediate surroundings and diffuse into the surrounding area. Diffusion is a well-described physical phenomenon and this model aims to couple the diffusive process with the chemical reactions of AHL inside millions of independent bacterial cells that are geometrically defined. There doesn’t seem to be any case of electrochemical l gradients affecting AHL diffusion, therefore our model is concerned only with"

Safety
Our labs are at Risk Level 1, meaning all reagents used in lab are well characterized and known not to cause disease within humans. These labs are equipped with safety showers, eye washes, and fire extinguishers if any emergency were to occur. All members have gone through extensive training to work in these labs, which included a detailed tour of facilities and numerous quizzes over safety standards. No member was allowed to be in lab alone unless under supervision of a graduate student.
Our labs used the following E. coli strains: DH10B, BL21, MG1655, JM109, and WM1788. All strains are Group I organisms, which have been proven not to cause disease in humans. In working with these organisms, we used fume hoods and ensured no contamination occurred through bleaching any area these organisms come into contact with. Gloves were worn at all times while in lab. Group members disposed reagents used in experiments into their respective waste bins for proper disposal.
We wanted to develop nitrogen fixation within E. coli to understand how this biochemical process could be translated to plants. To date, hazardous effects of introducing these genes into E. coli have not been observed.

The course has received very positive feedback from our student too. The course have grown from a total participant of 12 to around 45 participants (including staff members) and is currently one of the most famous Co-Curricular Activities in our school, attracting a lot of newcomers every year. We are working on building a much larger team and creating a stronger bond between the teammates.
Sharing to parents of our school (Coverage: 10 students, 15 parents)
As we sincerely hope that synthetic biology can be promoted to the general public, we held a sharing session to parents of our school on 30th of October. During the session, we introduced iGEM to them, including with why our school is sending students to attend the competition and how can they support us, of course, we also told them about the details of our project. This activity not only let them know about us or about iGEM but also let parents to have a understanding of what research actually is and they will also like their children to join our team.
Core Team Member Training (Coverage: 15 students)
During the summer vacation (July to August)this year while preparing for this project, the core team( including the iGEM team and other interested student from the Biology Research Team) received training from the experts of handling C.Elegans, one of the research interest of this project, to learn more about C.Elegans and the method of handling them, such as synchronisation, picking up C.Elegans under dissecting microscope. They also did some discussion with us about the significance of the data we have collected during the Assay test.
Local competition (Coverage: 30 students)
As we hope to develop student’s full potential in science, we also encourage our school’s students to join local science competition. Therefore, we have joined the “The Hong Kong Student Science Project 2016”(SSPC 2016) to let students get a feel of what competitive science exhibition would be like. We have a total of 3 teams competing including 1 junior team and 2 senior team. The junior team focus on how to convert air pollutants, such as SO2 and NO2/NO,into fertilizers. For the 2 senior team, we focuses on BioPrinting, with one team working on the engineering part and another team focussing on the the printing material, we have successfully build  a workable BioPrinter that can print a cube of E.Coli and Gelatin.

Figure 2.
Burning lengths of cotton samples soaked with E. coli BL21 expressing proteins.
Taken together, the data of flame test strongly proved that phosphorylated SR protein is able to retard the fire propagation and further extinguish the burning. Moreover, the unphosphorylated SR protein has also some effect on fire retardancy. The results are not only demonstrating phosphorylated SR protein is a novel fire retardant protein, but also verifying our theoretical hypothesis of phosphoserine and nitrogen contents that play unique and additive roles on the fire retardant properties.
Casein and wool are natural products with fire retardant properties. Phosphorus and nitrogen play important roles on the fire retardancy. We searched the highest (phospho)serine and highest arginine (nitrogen) contents in the protein databank of Uniprot by data mining. SR proteins are a family of proteins conversed in serine/arginine-rich domain and highly be phosphorylated. We expressed SR protein and SRPK1 kinase protein in E. coli BL21, which were analyzed in SDS-PAGE with coomassie blue staining and Western blotting with specific antibodies. Next, flame tests were performed on cloth and cotton samples soaked in the culture media containing protein-producing bacteria, demonstrating the fire retardant efficacy of phosphorylated SR proteins.
 
In protein analysis of phosphorylated SR proteins (section “Protein Expression”, Figure 3), total lysates were blotted with anti-GST antibody. The data showed various levels of band shift on SR plus SRPK (Lane 4) compared to SR only (Lane 2) around 53 kDa, indicating modification of SR protein. This result highly suggests SR protein underwent phosphorylation due to the presence of SRPK kinase. On the other hand, we’re trying to blot the lysates of phosphorylated SR protein with anti-phosphoserine antibody. However, we technically failed the experiment and didn’t get a good result with anti-phosphoserine antibody.
 
Phosphorus and nitrogen are important on the effect of fire retardancy. We tried to synthesize a gene encoding a polypeptide with arginine repeat. However, IDT company, a sponsor of iGEM, replied us a technical difficulty on synthesizing nucleotides with high frequency repeats. As for phosphorus, as we mentioned, proteins don’t carry any phosphate groups until being phosphorylated by specific kinase. Therefore, finding an existing protein and using an identified kinase are ideal to make phosphorylated proteins.

After the transfection of the receptor plasmids cells were stained with the following reagents: Hoechst dye for the nuclear staining at 405 nm; Alexa488-bioting to stain biotin binding proteins; mRuby3 which is a part of the receptor and is expected to show a membrane localization and Dy634-antiA3C5-Fab. The staining was followed by three washing steps with PBS. Following this staining procedure the cells were mounted on a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). The results for each fluorescence channel are given in the following figure (see Fig. ???).
Quantification of functionalized membrane proteins using flow cytometry
Fig.11 Flow cytometry data of stably integrated cells. Intrinsic mRuby fluorescence was measured as well as binding of a A3C5-tag specific Fab and of Biotin to single chain Avidin and enhanced monomeric Avidin.
To make sure the receptor is properly presented on the surface of the cells and to quantify the yield of stably transfected cells we used flow cytometry analysis.  The results presented in Fig. 11 show a positive signal in the rfp channel for the scAvidin and the eMA receptor bearing cells. As already observed in microscopy mRuby-fluorescence could not be detected for the BAP-receptor cells. But surprisingly about 40% where positive for Dy634, meaning that the A3C5 tag, against which the fluorophor labeled Fab is dierectet, must be present on the cell surface. This results suggest that there might be a problem about the folding of the mRuby beta-barrel leading to a loss of fluorescent activity.  For scA and eMA cells Dy634 signal has been positive albeit not as high as expected.  Another stain was the eGFP coupled with biotin giving a positive signal for scA and eMA to which the biotin binds. For BAP cells there was no signal since this receptor, is biotinylated by the BirA and doesn't cooperatively bind the Biotin. Moreover the biotin snd the dye are coupled via the C-terminal tail of the biotin leaving no contact point for the BirA to ligate the eGFP-biotin to the receptor's acceptor peptide.

Bacteria 2
The Large Worm Buster
Another method is to engineer a bacteria that can be applied to pasture samples and report the amount of large strongyles in pastures. By detecting large strongyles in pasture the large strongyle “buster” can help horse owners prevent their horses from getting infected since they can see which fields that are infected or not.
Worm culturing
The first step in obtaining live nematodes is the recovery of the eggs from the feces. This is done through filtration of the feces and different centrifugation steps with saturated salt water followed by a bleach containing solution to obtain sterile eggs. The eggs are successively stored in LB media for a period between 7 and 10 days to allow them to hatch and reach the third larval stage. After this process the large strongyles are divided from the small strongyles under a microscope and stored for successive use.
Transcriptomics and Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we need to choose approaches that allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we chose two distinct approaches. For the first one, we’re doing transcriptomic analysis, which relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli for 2 or 3 hours and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA, which will reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
The second approach utilizes libraries of phages expressing a set of peptides on their surface. By various rounds of incubation and washing, only phages specific to the strongyle will be found and sequencing of their genetic information will allow us to construct a peptide that is specific to surface markers of the nematode leading to creation of a biosensor
Reporter system
Once we have the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, we’ll have to be able to see what we’ve done! We plan on using fluorescent chromoproteins to be able to detect our worms in both grass and in feces. This would allow a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect our worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!

C. imager Simulation
Introduction
In our modeling efforts, we followed closely on our major 2 sub-projects,
Color Imaging and Motion Control
and their experimental connection.
Conjugation
Combing all the above, came the
C. imager Modeling.
The governing idea is that a model, intrinsically, should stare at the corresponding experiments, at the same time, go boldly beyond it. In this light, we built models not only deeply rooted in the experimental data, but also powerful of making audacious predictions.
In the Imaging part and the Motion Control part, we built models to simulate the behaviors of light-sensing, color-printing and motion-control genetic circuits, respectively.
On top of that, we attempted to build a procedure bridging the connection between a desired output image and the input image projected onto the bacteria. Also, in-depth modeling about motion control render us penetrating insights, clearly answering the question that how the sticky characteristic of C.C. could contribute to the clearance of output images.
Besides, as the experimental connection between the 2 sub-projects, process of conjugation is highly significant. Therefore, we elaborately established a model to analyze the concentration change of all types of bacterium involved in that process. Founded by concrete parameters extracting from experiments, it produced useful predictions to guide this experiment.
Despite the range, amount and power of our models, they also covered many mathematical & computational methods, ranging from ODE, phase-space analysis, agent-based model to Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, a variety types of figures and animations ensure the results vividly displayed.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

Lethbridge_HS,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"products of carbon black production are plentiful. We decided to combat this problem by producing a colorant of our own. We chose to produce four pigments in the colors cyan, magenta, yellow and black. These are made from different plant and bacteria genes using synthetic biology (Figure 2).
Figure 1: The process of carbon black production as a byproduct of burning petroleum for energy.
Figure 2: Our process of pigment production using synthetic biology and four constructs which will be put into bacterial cultures.
SynthetINK
Our final decision led us to SynthetINK, the environmentally friendly pigment production. We will be creating four pigments that are found in different organisms such as apple trees or petunias. We have selected the genes that will allow us to have the optimal production of pigment from our bacteria and media. Our project is designed to solve the problem of harmful byproducts of ink colorant production, and it does just that. We can produce pigments using synthetic biology and extract and purify them while producing minimal byproducts, which include Carbon dioxide and other cellular debris. Our project will become more applicable as the world shifts more and more towards green energy. As the world starts to move away from burning fossil fuels for energy, the source of carbon black will decrease in demand, while the demand for colorants is ever-increasing. This is where we come in. Our project will be able to fill the need for colorants and that is where it will be most applicable. Our business plan and market analysis showed us that as it stands we would not be able to make our project into a company on our own as we cannot compete with the market giants, but if we were able to somehow sell or licence our technology to a company then we might be able to get our project out early into use in the large industry.

Figure 3 Quercetin degradation by 186 microbes collected from global soil samples. Single colonies were inoculated in M9 minimal medium and grown for 6 days. Quercetin was measured by absorbance. Strains to the extreme left of the figure represent the highest-degrading strains. Red bars represent strains isolated from selective media and blue from non selective media.
Figure 4 Quercetin degradation detail. The top-performing strains included those isolated from both selective and nonselective media. Strains marked with an asterisk were selected for further investigation. Red bars represent strains isolated from selective media and blue from non selective media.
Working with M9 quercetin plates can be challenging. The bright green color of the plates makes colony visualization difficult.
Indeed, only fungal mycelia were visible due to a white halo resulting from quercetin degradation. However, working with liquid media allows the control of residual sample carbon source contamination through sample dilution.
Additionally, we were concerned agar in plates could be used as a carbon source.
8 top-performing strains were selected for detailed valication in a time-course assay, and all were able to degrade quercitin significantly better than E. coli negative controls.
We observed a 50% degradation over 6 days in the best case.
Figure 5 Kinetics of quercetin degradation by 8 promising strains. This experiment had two negative controls, one with no bacteria (black line) and one with non-quercetin degrading E. coli. Pseudomonas putita was included as a positive control. Four strains, shown in bold, degraded quercetin at a higher rate than our P. putida control.
Phylogenetic analysis of quercetin degradation
Using the 16s rRNA sequences, we constructed a global phylogeny of all the assayed strains (Figure 6).
Quercitin-degrading activity was concentrated among the Pseudomonas genus, where most of the strains were positive.
However many diverse species were able to significantly degrade quercitin, suggesting that the phenotype may be highly variable in evolution.
Figure 6: Phylogenetic Tree of isolated strains. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of all isolated bacterial strains. Strain taxonomic classification is indicated by the color key to the left of the figure. Strains that demonstrated high quercetin degradation are marked with an asterisk. Those strains marked with a large star were selected for whole genome sequencing to look for common anthocyanin-degrading genes.

This part was designed to function as lead binding peptide in our project.It is expressed in the cytosol and when fused with the periplasm protein Dsba and membrane protein lpp-ompa, it will be expressed and translocated to the periplasm and membrane.In short, this part function as the fundamental metal binding peptide of lead in our project.
Part:BBa_K346004: main introduction
MerR family TFs share a high similarity at the C-terminal metal binding domain , which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure.Previous work shows that C-terminal metal binding domain can act as a metal accumulator without the help of the N-terminal DNA binding domain.Function test of mercury MBP showed that our whole-cell bioabsorbents can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 M Hg (II) in 120 minutes, indicating that cells expressing certain metal binding peptide engineered via our method can decontaminate corresponding metal ion from aquatic environment. This design has been successfully applied to another homolog of MerR family – PbrR, the lead responsive regulator.In our project, we try to tandem two metal binding domains together to make a high performance and less energy consuming metal binding peptide. Our bacteria achieved an equivalent lead accumulation capacity as the mercury MBP, which proved validness of our engineering strategy. This part works as the core part in the lead bioabsorption device.
The figure shows the structure of PbrR and MBP(lead). The left figure is PbrR  a member of MerR family and the right figure shows the predicted structure of resulted metal binding peptide of lead, which is engineered from PbrR. lead ions are indicated as black balls in metal binding pockets.

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," other agents and is influenced only by its local                         environment. The goal in agent-based models is to study the emergent                         systems-level properties of a collection of individual agents that follow                         relatively simple rules. In smoothed particle hydrodynamics for example, fluids                         are simulated by calculating the trajectory of each individual fluid particle at                         every timestep. Fluid properties such as the momentum at a certain point can                         then be sampled by taking a weighted sum of the momenta of the surrounding fluid                         particles. A large advantage of agent-based models is that the agent rules are                         arbitrarily complex and thus they allow us to model systems that do not                         correspond to any existing or easily derivable PDE model. However, because every                         agent is stored in memory and needs to be processed individually, simulating                         agent-based models can be computationally intensive.
Hybrid Modeling Framework
In our system, there are both bacteria and chemical species that spread out                         and interact on a petri dish to form patterns. On the one hand, the bacteria are                         rather complex entities that move along chemical gradients and interact with one                         another. Therefore they are ideally modeled using an agent-based model. On the                         other hand, the diffusion and dynamics of the chemicals leucine and AHL are                         easily described by well-established PDEs. To make use of the advantages of each                         modeling approach, we decided to combine these two different types of modeling                         in a hybrid modeling framework. In this framework we modeled the bacteria as                         agents, while the chemical species were modeled using PDEs. There were two                         challenges to our hybrid approach, namely coupling the models and matching them.                         Coupling refers to the transfer of information between the models and matching                         refers to dealing with different spatial and temporal scales to achieve                         accurate, yet computationally tractable simulations.
In the following paragraphs we first introduce our hybrid model and its                         coupling. Once the basic framework is established, the agent-based module and                         PDE module are discussed in more depth and the issue of matching is highlighted.                         We also expand on important aspects of the model and its implementation such as       boundary conditions and choice of timesteps. Then the results of the       simulations are shown and summarized. Finally, the incorporation                         of the internal model into the hybrid model is discussed.

Opening of BLINK1 channels hyperpolarizes the cell to the K(+) equilibrium potential. Ectopic expression of BLINK1 reversibly inhibits the escape response in light-exposed zebrafish larvae. BLINK1 therefore provides a single-component optogenetic tool that can establish prolonged, physiological hyperpolarization of cells at low light intensities.

Co-Transformation & Induced Expression
Expression vectors used in the project for membrane protein expression are modified versions of pRSFDuet-1, pETDuet-1,pACYCDuet-1(NOVAGEN), which are originally regulated by T7 promoter. These plasmids can coexist in one cell.
The Connector is pBluescript II KS(+) .
Figure 1.3.5 pBluescript II KS(+)
We used the four reformed plasmids to co-transform and induced the Connectors to express. Now the structure of the crown appears in the E.coli cell membrane or cytoplasm. Here we used the fusion proteins with two kinds of enzymes and TAL1 as examples.
Figure 1.3.6 ssDsbA-Lgt-pykF/poxB-TAL1-His Tag
Test Methods
We used formaldehyde to stabilize the connected fusion proteins and Connector, then separated the protein-Connector complexes and digested the protein. Finally we used PCR to detect the three sequences of the Connector which TAL proteins were designed to bind to.
Then, we were able to test the yield of different products to determine the efficiency of selective combination.
Application
Based on our design, our project has many application prospects. In prokaryotic systems, enzyme polymerization can be used to regulate various metabolic pathways, such as the example we mentioned above. pykF and poxB are two enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism. By binding them to the connector, we can improve the reaction efficiency to a great extent. Besides, our project can also be applied in eukaryotic systems, including gene therapy and regulation of stem cell differentiation.
What’s more ?
We are trying to put more enzymes into the polymerization system, which makes the Crown more practical and brilliant. And with more enzymes on the Crown, there will be more possible choices for selective combination.

We submitted an inducible expression systems, by which we regulated the expression of downstream genes in CHO-K1 cell line.  TRE-3G promoter is a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The expression of downstream gene can be induced by the addition of doxycycline (DOX). It has been submitted by our predecessor, SUSTC-Shenzhen in 2014 (see the BioBrick at http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1431301 )  They combined these 2 parts into one plasmid. It is useful to improve the success rate of transfection.  Considering the difficulty to cut the whole fragment as a submitted part, they only constructed the assembly with a part of the regulation system.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 organism. The same risk level applies to the majority of organisms used during development. In the rare occasion that a gene from a Level 2 organism was required - a Serratia gene coding for chitinase, for instance - we opted instead to create it from sequence, rather than using the whole organism. An integral part of BeeT’s premise is a presenting a lower danger/nuisance to bees and humans as compared to more conventional Varroa-exterminating methods. This is the reason we opted for extremely specific toxins .
Kill Switches
BeeT’s twin redundant kill switches are its primary biocontainment measures, designed to trigger when the organism leaves its designated environment. In order to carry out its function, BeeT only needs to be active inside the beehive; its presence anywhere else is undesirable. The first kill switch, the Optogenetic TA system , keeps the organism alive as long as it remains within the dark interior of the hive. Being exposed to sunlight over a period of time - which can be inferred as an escape from the hive - will activate the system, killing the bacteria. The second switch, the Auxotrophy-Cas9 system , relies on the inclusion of a synthetic amino acid when BeeT is introduced to the hive. In absence of the amino acid - outside the hive, or when the supply is spent - the system will trigger. As the activated Cas9 targets BeeT’s own DNA, this also helps address the issue of horizontal gene transfer. This design makes BeeT both self-containing and self-disposing.
For more information regarding safety in our project, see our Safety Form .
Laboratory
Maintaining a healthy and contamination-free work environment is a major priority in the field of synthetic biology. Before starting, each member of Team Wageningen UR involved in wet lab work received an introductory tour by the laboratory technician in charge of safety. The tour and subsequent training covered proper clothing, waste disposal, equipment sterility and so forth. The majority of BeeT development was done under Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) conditions , with a small amount of work done at BSL-2. For the latter case, specialized training, as well as up-to-date vaccinations, were required.
Left: Standard wet lab gear (basic white lab coat and safety glasses). Right: BSL-2 lab gear (BSL-2-only blue lab coat, safety glasses, disposable gloves). Note the use of closed shoes, long pants and tied-back hair.

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," predicted sample bleed-through on the illumina MiSeq machine, making it a cutoff for removal of low confidence OTUs.
Using QIIME we can then create alpha- and beta-diversity charts for the samples, and pie/bar charts for taxonomy for each phylogenetic group (class, family, genus, etc). Examples of these can be seen below, and these charts from our fecal sample analysis can be found here
PICRUSt:
After taxonomic assignment, a tool called Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was used to determine functionality of OTU’s within the microbiome of each animal.
PICRUSt works by predicting the gene families contained inside a bacterial or archaeal metagenome identified using 16S bacteria or archaeal sequencing. It uses QIIME taxonomy assignments that were done using a closed OTU search. In the case of PICRUSt, the OTU picking is done against the GreenGene database, and that database is then used to predict gene familes from the metagenomes associated with that database.
The PICRUSt algorithm works in two steps. The first is gene content prediction, which involves predicting the gene content of ancestral organisms from their living relatives. This step is extended to organisms that are part of the living relatives group, but are still unknown because they have not been studied. This is done by estimating the unknown living relatives' gene content through their 16S sequence similarity to studied and sequenced organisms. The PICRUSt algorithm therefore precomputes the gene content of all known organisms in a reference database. Because this is a particularly daunting task for even a strong computer, this step is only done once and the output is provided for the next step. This is why OTU picking from QIIME taxonomy assignments must be done to a closed reference database. Otherwise, matches will not correspond to the precomputed reference database and PICRUSt will be unable to complete the second step.
The second step is metagenome inference. PICRUSt infers the gene content of the organisms present in the OTU picking output by comparing them to their sequenced evolutionary relatives. This metagenome inference is done by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to known sequences and makes conclusions on the identity of each sequence’s evolutionary relative. PICRUSt can then output a predicted metagenome for each 16S sequence picked in the closed OTU picking step and provide inferred gene content for the entire microbiome.

From the beginning of the brainstorming, the main idea involved the expression of therapeutic proteins that would act as toxins for tumor cells. At this point, we realized that we needed more specificity if healthy tissue was to be unharmed. In the hypothetical case that our bacteria were liberated into the environment and some way it survived and maintained its plasmid without a selectivity marker, it would be a catastrophe. This imaginary scenario led us to the idea of implementing safety locks in the design of our project.
The first issue we needed to address was the potential harm of the bacteria triggered by the immune response against the lipid A and the Braun lipoprotein components of the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) membrane of the Escherichia coli. Thus, we devoted our <a href=""module1.html"">Module I</a> to develop a strategy to avoid this problem. Literature showed that the deletion of the msbB and the lpp genes can produce viable strains; furthermore, according to studies performed by he mutants of this strain by Stritzker et, al., the bacteria with the msbB deletion could still be able to reach and colonize tumours. This action also reduced the side effects in mice.
We wanted that the action of our therapy was site-directed; as a result, we designed our phages to internalize in the mammalian cells. The infection in bacteria is initiated when P3 binds to the F pilus on the surface of an E. coli which facilitates the translocation of the viral DNA into the cytoplasm. In our case the P3 will be binded with the peptide CTVALPGGYVRVC, that specifically binds to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Normally, GRP78 expression is maintained at low levels but is upregulated in stress environments and induced in tumor environments. Thus, the phages will only bind to this cancer-specific receptor that express this receptor protein, ignoring the healthy cells.  For more information, you can check <a href=""module3.html"">Module III</a>.
Also, we needed to design our genes that we wanted to"

Integrated: Kill Switch
Overview
Discussions with Leading Experts: Developing Our Experimental Design
Overview
Kill switch is a blanket term often used by iGEM teams and outside researchers for any molecular device that can cause cell death. Our initial investigation into their use caused us to question what their intended purpose was and whether a catch all term was appropriate. It seemed that one size couldn’t fit all with a kill switch as the specificity that makes them effective can also limit the scope of their implementation. As we looked further we found that there was very little quantitative data on kill switches in the iGEM registry. We concluded that as they are commonly attached as a biosafety side project in iGEM, we should try to better characterise not only the kill switches we would be testing but also provide a better definition of what a kill switch is. We got in touch with individuals from industry and academia who had differing views on the application of kill switches and their effectiveness. We took direction from these discussions and endeavoured to address the issues raised experimentally.
Discussions with Leading Experts: Developing Our Experimental Design
By interviewing academic and industry researchers about their understanding of kill switches, we could analyse whether they are effective biosafety mechanisms and if they are appropriate for use in either industry or academic research.
One of the main factors driving our decision to focus on the use of kill switches in synthetic biology was the nature of their use in iGEM. It seemed that they were often employed as an afterthought and the dedicated kill switch section of the biosafety page on the registry had parts named ""oh my god"" and ""test"". We decided that providing better quantitative data on kill switches would be valuable.  We asked individuals from industry and academia about kill switches and how they thought they might be most effectively implemented, we used their input to inform our work inside and outside the lab.
We contacted Dr Markus Gershater, the chief scientific officer at Synthace Ltd, to ask him what the application of kill switches might be in an industrial setting and what evidence would be satisfactory for their use. Dr Gershater gave the view that kill switches would not be as effective or economical as the physical and chemical bio-containment methods that Synthace currently employ. One of his concerns was that increasing the complexity of an industrial"

Great ideas and practical designs are the core of synthetic biology development. But what truly makes a project outstanding is its applicability in real life. So our team spent a lot of efforts on pushing our project towards this ultimate goal. Now we would like to illustrate the efforts we had made and the actual results that testify the applicability of our device in real life.
In terms of experiments performed in wet lab, four parts were involved corresponding to four steps in our project’s colon cancer diagnosis process.
First, we examined the T-antigen expression as well as adhesive properties between engineered E.coli and colorectal cancer cell. The results from both cell and mouse experiments returns positive, illustrating that our device is capable of specifically binding with cancerous cells.
Then, we observed gas vesicles in the cancerous tissue of mouse intestines under ultrasound, receiving not only positive results in the distinctness of vesicle signals, but also determination of cancerous section and normal ones. Meanwhile we’ve proved that our nitric oxide biosensor can react to nitric oxide in the environment and synthesize the medicine we needed. Finally, we made sure biosafety by constructing cell lysis pathway that has been tested by plate count method. For more details, see Results page.
Although we had accomplished these experiments mentioned above, we are still not hundred percent sure about whether our project can function properly in real situation in vivo. To solve this problem we built a model to stimulate the environment in human’s colon and the possible behavior of the bacteria. Moreover, in order to make sure that gas vesicle signals can be observed through clinical ultrasonic equipment we built another model to clarify the relationship between the frequency of ultrasound and the intensity of gas vesicles’ signal. The results show great possibility in making this brand new diagnosis method accessible to even the most common hospitals. More details can be found at the Model pages.
While we kept pushing ourselves to make progress in both wet lab and dry lab, we also reached out to experts in relating fields, leading enterprises, patients in hospital and general public. We’re glad that the experts we enquired gave a lot of helpful advice to assist us"

Determination of the values of parameters
For accurate results, the precise determination of the values of parameters used in the simulation was essential. We had to determine the values of the two diffusion coefficients(the cell and the autoinducer) along with the production rate of the autoinducers and the growth rate of the colony itself.
The growth rate of the colony was measured by experiment which took place in our lab[fig_model.1]. As a result the value of the colony's logarithmic growth rate μ is 0.0024[s-1].
fig_model.1 growth curve
The diffusion coefficient of the cell is, by definition,
・・・(7)
where vcell, the average speed of a cell, is 0.02 mm/h(=20 μm/s) and T, the average random walk time, is 1s. So in conclusion the diffusion coefficient of the cell is 300 μm2/s [2] .
The diffusion coefficient of serine is known as 1000 μm2/sec. Since the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight by simple computation we were able to figure out the diffusion coefficients of the autoinducers we used. The autoinducer's diffusion coefficients is as follows [1] .
DC4HSL = 784 μm2/s
D3OC6HSL = 702 μm2/s
D3OC12HSL = 607 μm2/s
The production of autoinducers and the growth of E.coli
Since the E.coli used in this experiment has itself an ability to produce autoinducers, a term which considers the cell's production of autoinducers must be contained in the equation. The added equation is shown as it follows.
・・・(8)
where δ is the production rate of the individual cell. Because the autoinducer's amount, produced by the colony increases in proportion to the numbers of individual E.colis, a term of multiplication to the cell's density was added.
The growth rate of the colony is slightly more complex. Since the nutrient of the medium is limited, E.coli's density is finite. So we expressed the colony's grwoth rate by an sigmoid curve.

Triangle model
This triangle model is one of the model we worked on. In this triangle model, three different cells send signal which inhibit the motility of other cells in a cyclic way. Fig_model.2 indicates this model. Red cells"

Background
Positive Feedback Loop for NzFE
This is a device to reduce nitrite ion to its elements: oxygen and nitrogen. The device is regulated by signaling molecule AHL(3OC6HSL). The right p(tetR) promoter will constitutively express Plux’s repressor: LuxR protein. Two LuxR protein molecules can bind with two AHL molecules to form a complex which in turns switches on the PluxR promoter. The down stream LuxL is an enzyme for catalyzing AHL(acyl-homoserine lactones) from normal cell metabolites. The LuxL translated will increase the AHL content in the chassis. This forms a positive feedback loop with increasing AHL resulting in increasing PoPS from PluxR. We utilize this increasing PoPS, and place CDS for NzFE(Nitrite Degradation Fusion Enzyme) in the down stream of the circuit.

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"After many discussion and revised, this is our plan:
We are going to do a five-week program, every week we will have two hours to do our program.
Each week we will choose a topic and gave them a fun science lessons.
We will give them lessons in question and answer, not just traditional teaching them the answer
They will be separated in to groups and work together to do some cool experiments that is associated with the topic.
The last week we will host a quick answer race to see how much do they learnt instead of traditional paper test.
Previous Next
WEEK ONE 04/27/2017
Topic: EYES
What caused myopia? How to prevent it? What is the shape of the eyeglasses? How many kinds of lens do you know? What is blindspot? How do animation make?
Experiment
Test your blindspot
Materials:
This is an experiment don’t need any materials but your two hands.
Steps:
Thumb up your both hands and extent them in front of your eyes.
Close your left eyes, and keep your right eyes staring at the left thumb.
Slowly move your right hand from the middle to the right side.
At a moment, right thumb disappear, and keep moving it, it will reappear.
When the right thumb disappear, that is your blindspot.
Animation Stick
Materials:
A chopstick or anything that is stick shape, a piece of paper, some tapes or glue, drawing or coloring tools.
Steps:
Fold the paper into half.
Draw two picture on the paper, the two picture is going to fuse together and become a simple animation. For example, you can draw a sun on one side and a sunglasses on the other side, and it will become a picture of sun with sunglasses.
Glue the paper on the stick.
Quickly rotate the stick and you can see your masterpiece.
WHY WE CHOOSE THIS TOPIC
Taiwan’s students are suffered from myopia, according to the Taiwan Health Promotion Administration, 63.85% of sixth grade students and 76.5% of ninth grade students have myopia. We want to teach them how to take good care of their eyes even under the             circumstance that they have to keep staying indoor studying and didn’t get time to go outdoor. Extended from vision care, we talk about some cool phenomena linked with vision, including persistence of vision, blindspot and etc, the experiments             are dispersed into the lessons.

Key considerations while designing the software
Open source
Ease of use
Single programme for all analysis and design
Error-free sequence modification
Codon-optimization for common chassis organisms
User guide
We have created a user guide that outlines the step-by-step procedure for using this software. The user guide can be accessed here .
BBrickIt Software Beta Testing
Several iGEM teams tested our software along the way.
Many teams asked us to make a comprehensive user manual for this software, which we did and shared with all of them! Also, initially, we uploaded a .exe file on Github, which worked only on the Windows operating system. As MacOS is also widely used,  the MacOS version of BBrickIt is also available in the GitHub repository.
Target audience: The iGEM community!
Feedback from iGEM teams
Extremely happy to bypass the hectic job of having to think of prefix and suffix sites, scars, illegal sites etc. before planning to clone anything in the standard vectors
Team IISER Kolkata
The tool is easy to use and well outlined. This software would have helped us catch that we initially forgot to add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to our gene sequence!
Team WashU
“BBrickIt is a useful tool for iGEM teams in producing complete BioBricked part and is also very efficient.”
Team ECUST
Methodology
The initial idea for this software came to us while we were shuttling between various software tools in order to identify the compatibility of our sequence as per the BioBrick RFC 10 standard. We shuffled between various tools for performing tasks like identifying illegal restriction sites, reverse complementing the sequence, and manually adding prefix and suffix sequences. We then decided to create a simple, user-friendly GUI that can perform all these functions and specifically look for sites as per BioBricking standards.
The programme also suggests a codon-optimized sequence in case the input sequence is not RFC 10-compatible. Currently the programme works for three commonly used chassis organisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
BBrickIt was coded using the Python language, and the GUI was created using the Tkinter library that is provided along with it. This is an open source programme and its source code can be found here .

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#DiscoveryFestival_-_-_TEXT.html," communicate about their project with laymen. She will observe us on the Discovery Festival and so, there will be science within our science.
The festival
Discovery is a Dutch festival that, according to its own website (in Dutch), is all about the kick you get when discovering new things. Be it new science, art or music; Discovery tries to excite and stimulate its visitors with new experiences. Synthetic Biology, as an exciting new branch of science, deserves a place here. Together with the iGEM teams of Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Groningen, we will teach synthetic biology to the public and simulate a SynBio Experience. We will do this on all three simultaneous festivals in the cities of Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Rotterdam.
The SynBio Experience
The major part of our participation in Discovery is the SynBio Experience. We will build a provisional laboratory on each location, where people may have a taste of what it is like to work on synthetic biology. In just 20 minutes, they will go through a 7 step process of simulated genetic modification and get the opportunity to do all the work themselves. Safety is of course priority, so we will not bring actual GMOs or even Escherichia coli with us.
In the first step, visitors may visit a specially built offline version of the Parts Registry to choose between several genes encoding colours or smells, to clone into ‘their bacteria’. In the succeeding steps visitors may manually pipet their DNA and bacteria around from one machine to the next, including a vortex, a table-top centrifuge, a make-shift electroporator and an incubator. After the last step, we show them an agar plate with the bacteria they made. These will not actually be GMOs, but they will possess the phenotype that was selected in the first step.
The Poster Game
At the start of the festival, we want to stimulate people to think about synthetic biology and get them interested in us. In order to achieve this, our iGEM team made posters that describe amazing synthetic biology and iGEM projects from the past. We will walk around with these posters to ask people which of these projects they believe are true and which aren’t. We will invite them to our lab, where they may learn that actually all of the projects we describe are true.
The Idea-Box
To stimulate people to think about synthetic biology and the wealth of opportunities it gives, we invite them to share their thoughts on camera. Next to our laboratory, we place a video guestbook. Here we will ask people to share what they think would be a good use for synthetic biology. What should next year"
Slovenia,2016,Team:Slovenia#Mechanosensing#Gas vesicles_-_-_TEXT.html," Fluo-4 (green line) and Fura Red (red line) are shown. (D) Ratio (blue line) was calculated                                                 from fluorescence intensities of Fura Red and Fluo-4 using CaPTURE.
This is the first time demonstration that that gas vesicle-forming proteins can be expressed in human cells and that they improve the sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels for ultrasound. Moreover when the gas vesicle-forming proteins were co-expressed with ectopic ion channels the calcium influx could be achieved with low-power ultrasound stimulation.
Ultrasound is a type of mechanical stimulus, therefore we reasoned that cells might exhibit response also to other types of stimulus such as the touch. The next task was to couple the response of mechanosensitive channels to the mediator of signaling or to the genetically encoded reporter. Mediator of this activation are Ca2+ ions, which are sensed by different cellular proteins and which have been in the literature detected by several designed sensors. The mechanosensing device was then coupled to the calcium split luciferase reporter based on M13 and calmodulin or can be coupled to the protease split system and response of cells was determined against mechanical stimulus in a Touchpaint implementation .

PROJECT UPDATE
Our project is about biobleaching and our work is now mainly about producing XynB, ArfB and ManA1.
We have got each expression vector for each protein. And XynB has been expressed successfully.
After we get these three proteins successfully produced, we will detect their activity and decolor efficiency. We will use DNS solution and draw standard curves to do some quantitative determination. These things will be talked about in later issue.
We have used XynB to do some decolor experiment which turned out to be quite effective. We will do further experiments to make the result confirmable.
PLAN FOR FUTURE STEPS
1. We are now planning to do a demonstrative experiment to show audience the using process and result of our products.
2. We are also trying to make some Chinese brush writing paper to arouse people’s interest in paper-making industry and they can focus on the opportunities to make an environmental contribution of our products.

PROJECT UPDATE
This year, we choose a project to produce fatty acid. We use GC-MS to detect the constituent and the concentration of the fatty acid.
Now, we are in Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology and we have already got some result.
Here I’m gonna to show you some result.
This is the MC result of the Fatty acids. Those fatty acids were produced by E.coli in M9 culture medium. Peak 11.624 is marker. As you can see, peaks are very clear. And we can get more detail with GS figures.
As you can see, we increase the production of fatty acid with 16/18 carbon.
More details are waiting for us to discovery. We hope to show you later.
In the next 2 weeks, we will get on with our experiments. Then we will do our human practice.
My question is that why some operons such as lac operon and ara operon are not work all the time.
