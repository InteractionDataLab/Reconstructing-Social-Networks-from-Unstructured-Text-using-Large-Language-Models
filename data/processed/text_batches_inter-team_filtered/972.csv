UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a"

3) Taking urine sample from a potential patent or poley-catheter.
4) Taking blood sample.
2. Conduct susceptibility test
It usually takes 48 hours for a patient to get the result. In case
that the patient asks faster detection, other detection method
such as PCR, DNA sequencing are recommended. The
alternative test can produce the result within a few hours.
MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) is most commonly used susceptibility test.  It is used for the detection of all pathogens. However, pathogens such as Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria that are hard to be cultivated are not detected by MIC. Mcroscan system that is using automated microdilution and E-test are used for MIC.
Paper Disk Method For the test, spread plate culture and pour plate culture are mostly used. Depending on the type  of LB agar plate and testing antibiotics, many manufactures have been offered a variety of testing kit. This method should be done by manual procedure from the beginning to the end. Therefore standardized reliable protocols of the testing method should be developed and well observed.
Agar Dilution Method
The antibiotic to be tested is added to agar, which is then placed in dilution plates and diluted with varying levels of water. After this, the pathogen to be tested is added to each plate, plus a control plate that does not receive any antibiotics. The dilution plates are then incubated at a temperature of 37 degrees C. The plates are then incubated for sixteen to eighteen hours, although incubation time may be less for bacteria populations that divide quickly. After incubation, the plates are examined to determine if bacterial expansion has occurred. The lowest concentration of antibiotics that stopped the spread of the bacteria is considered to be the minimum inhibitory concentration of that bacteria
Agar dilution is considered to be the standard of susceptibility testing, or the most accurate way to measure the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The results of agar dilution are easily reproduced and they can be monitored at a much cheaper cost than what is required of other dilution methods. Additionally, up to thirty pathogen samples (plus two controls) can be tested at 0o0nce, so agar dilution is useful for batch tests.
Each dilution plate in agar testing has to be manually infected with the pathogen to be tested, so agar dilution testing is both labor intensive and expensive. And agar dilution cannot be used to test more than one pathogen at a time.

iGEM Pasteur Paris 4th Annual Parisian Meetup
For the 4th time since the creation of the iGEM Pasteur team, we hosted the annual Parisian Meetup. Despite its name, all iGEM teams from France (Aix-Marseille Université, Bordeaux, Evry_Paris-Saclay, GO_Paris-Saclay, Grenoble-Alpes, Montpellier, Paris_Bettencourt, Sorbonne_U_Paris and Toulouse-INSA-UPS) participated.
Every team presented their project in 20 minutes followed by questions and comments from the judges and the audience. The essence of the Meetup was to get feedback and constructive criticism on the projects from the judges. In the judging committee, we had:
Pascale DUPUIS-WILLIAMS, researcher at the INSERM (Medical Research Institute in France) and Professor of Cellular Biology at the ESPCI (Ecole Supérieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles, de la ville de Paris).
Jonathan KELLER, lawyer and legal consultant in charge of intellectual property and Open Science at La Paillasse.
Deshmukh GOPAUL, researcher in Biochemistry at the Institut Pasteur and head Design for Biology Center - Education Department.

Jac Niessen, we wrote a press release about our project. The article “Wageningse studenten ontwikkelen diagnostische test voor Zika” was posted as a news article on the website of the university (in Dutch).
Intranet Following our Go/No-go presentation at the end of August, ing. Liesbeth Idema, the online editor of the Wageningen University & Research Intranet, published a short article “Support Wageningse iGEM-team bij detecteren tropische ziektes”. The intranet of the Wageningen University & Research is only accessible by employees. The article covers our aim and raises attention for our Crowdfunding project.
Bionieuws Bionieuws is a magazine for biologists in The Netherlands. Via drs. Gert van Maanen, a small article in their magazine on the iGEM competition was posted (25 August 2017, year 27, page 12), featuring all Dutch iGEM teams, including iGEM Wageningen. The article, “Zes Nederlandse teams in iGEM-competitie” (in Dutch) cannot be reached online, but the page of the magazine can be found below.  View the article here
Figure C: Article about the Dutch iGEM teams in Bioniews magazine of Aug 25, 2017. Global One Health blog The Global One Health blog is an initiative of Wageningen University & Research. Global One Health is a theme that reflects the interconnectedness and global nature of health care. More specifically, it focuses on interdisciplinary ways for controlling the risk of disease outbreaks and reduction of endemic infectious diseases. Not only for human health care, but also for food supply, hygiene, medicines, vaccines, vector control and crop protection. More about this initiative can be found here.
For this initiative, we wrote a blog about the rise of infectious diseases, taking African Sleeping Sickness as an example for the problematic situations in tropical regions with regards to infectious diseases, and how there is a need for a new diagnostic device. Moreover, an infographic was made to visualize our device.
The blog can be read on the website of Global One Health blog (in Dutch).

ZJU-China,2017,Team:ZJU-China#Project#mt_-_-_TEXT.html," —— The original sequence of Ferritin is gotten from addgene (plasmid #79649). It is in the same ORF of TRPV1. We inverted it into our GPD-CYC1 expressing system and transferred this plasmid into BY4741. Here follows the result of western blot. The two red-circled bands are exactly Ferritin we expressed.
Fig.7 Western blot of Ferritin
To further test the function of Ferritin, we have planned to purify it with the flag tag and test the heat effect under medium radio frequencies. However, due to the time limitation, we haven't finished it.
TRPV1 —— The original sequence of TRPV1 is also gotten from addgene(plasmid #79649). We inverted it into our GPD-CYC1 expressing system and transferred this plasmid into BY4741. Here follows the result of western blot.
Fig.8 Western blot for TRPV1
The band of TRPV1 is quite shallow. But it's OK because we have perform further experiments to test the function of TRPV1.
We use Fluo 4-AM to indicate the concentration change of calcium when the our yeast suffers a heat shock or be treated with capsaicin. The result shows that our BY4741 transferred with TRPV1 can be sensed a higher calcium concentration  than the control when it has been heated or treated by capsaicin. As Fig.9 indicated, when the transgenic BY4741 is heated, the relative intracellular calcium ion concentration increases 71.6% while it increases 61.9% when treated with capsaicin. Compared with 8% enhancement when the yeast is cultured in high calcium concentration medium(200mM Ca2+), they are really huge changes and we're sure these change will induce a high strength of expression of the CDRE promoter.
Fig.9 Relative calcium content of differet groups
We tried to construct a medium radio frequency generator, but the heat effect of device is too significant that it can directly heat the whole medium even without Ferritin. Given more time, we would optimize this device and test our TRPV1-Ferritin system.
See Chemical Transduction...
Combination
Due to the lack of time, we haven't finished the combination of TRPV1 and CDRE promoter. Besides, they're still only expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We are going to express TRPV1-Ferritin in Trichoderma atroviride and build up its own calcium-sensitive promoter.

The reason for starting with the promoter, is that this unfinished construct could have some limited use in the finished product, while the gene and terminator has no direct application.
Experiment: Gibson Overhang Extension PCR
Homology regions for Gibson assembly was added via PCR extensions to specific fragments. This time the 5x round of the PCR were done at the intial annealing temperature of the primers and afterwards the annealing temperature was increased to account for the elongated DNA molecules present which can then bind the full primer (with the extension on). The products was run on a 1% agarose gel producing the following bands. Thus, all fragments was succesfully extended except for GfaA, which continues to be a problem. This could very well indicate a need for redesign of primers.

Protoplastation and transformation
Osmotic buffer and sorbitol solution made and autoclaved. This is the day that the Ganoderma protocol was attempted changed for the first time. With no Driselase available we had to think of other ways to protoplast Ganoderma. After consulting Ecovative we tried the first time with higher concentrations of Glucanex  instead of both Glucanex and Driselase as originally in the protocol.
Drylab Overview
The sample from the pilot study was burning at different time intervals according to the optimal DOE. the samples were after the burning carried over to byg where the hydraulic testing of the cubes were commenced. Following the test resulted in the replicated DOE which was implemented into the DOE script and an optimal design was found which was carried out the same week.  Doing the pilot sampling study, a huge part of the data (the fungus) were mushy and thus a lot of substrates were left out as optimal conditions. Another interesting results were that fungal cubes gets more brittle at higher temperatures.  The first thoughts of implementing the Ganodermerma as a second brick option was considered due to"

Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: lacp (Lac repressible promoter)
Length: 200 base pairs
Strength with:
Weak RBS (BBa_B0032): 290.27-195.5 (+17.7) RPU
Medium RBS (BBa_B0030): 11.347-9456(+487) RPU
Strong RBS (BBa_B0034): 1.126-7648 (+152) RPU
In gram negative bacteria, LacI represses lacp which regulates the binding of RNA polymerase and inhibits transcription by binding to the lac operon.
Repressor name: LacI (LacI repressor)
Part Length: 1153 base pairs
Structure: Homo-tetramer
Binding affinity: To lacp, very tight, 60.145M
The LacI repressor is an allosteric protein exists in 2 states: silent and active. In the absence of inducers, the active state of LacI binds to the lac operator sites of the lacp promoter and interferes the binding the RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting transcription. In the presence of inducers, however, LacI undergoes allosteric rearrangement and switches to its silent state, resulting in its release from the promoter, thus allowing transcription to take place.
Inducer name: IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)
Effective Concentration : 20 ng/ml
In our project,  Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce lacp driven expressions. IPTG is a lactose metabolite, lacp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to LacI. On top of that, it cannot be metabolized by Escherichia coli so it concentration remains constant during the experiment, making it a more suitable inducer for our Tristable Switch system.
Mechanism of lacp - LacI - IPTG Interaction

So, we have to turn the GFP brightness information into the possibility of patient being afflicted with cancer. And we use the CV technology to help us achieve that goal.
For example, we now have the photo of the test paper(The color of test paper itself might be light yellow due to the ambient light or the paper quality).
We use Matlab to read this file and we can get an array of the RGB value of this image.Then,we can use this function to calculate the Brightness of each pixel:Y=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
Then we have to normalize these data to eliminate the effect of the ambient light.We pick an pixel in the “white” area and calculate its brightness/255, set this as constant C, and use it to multiply every pixel’s brightness.
After that, we will get a new array of the normalized brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We assume that there is a linear relationship between the brightness of the system and the amount of GFP in the system. Now we can get a relative stoichiometric relation of three mi-RNA. We use the function mentioned above to sum the data proportionately. We set B2P(Brightness to Possibility) as the symbol of this value.
Finally we use this data to calculate the possibility of having cancer.(Of course we have to get the threshold of B2P value. But that can be easily calculated through a machine learning or a basic statistical method if we can get enough samples.)
HUMAN PRACTICE
We try to ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine our projects in a social context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of our technologies.

Our project was inspired by the UCLA’s projects presented at iGEM in 2014 and 2015 about synthetic silks. As already mentioned above, silks are a very interesting material but one of the main problems is dealing with its high content of Cytosine and Guanine. Most of the expression systems are not able to deal with that, however we have known Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has naturally high GC content which makes it interesting as an expression chassis. One of UCLA’s projects was called Silk Functionalization: Developing the Next Generation of Performance Fibers. The team has created a genetic construct using the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) inserted between N- and C- terminal domains of Bombyx mori’s silk to express proteins able to bind to native silk proteins. When this customized GFPs and native proteins were mixed they were able to recognize each other by the terminal domains, resulting in a fluorescent silk.
From this idea our team realized: “Silk is a very interesting material and it could be expressed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism that has many advantages and that remains under explored. Which gene could replace GFP to be expressed in microalgae? Which biomolecule could be produced with this amazing silk feature? It had to work while immobilized... Why not enzymes? There are many studies about enzymes immobilization, enzymes are very appropriate and useful in many applications around the world!”. But we knew it could not be any enzyme linked to the silk, we knew it needed to address technical, social and economic issues. So we read that spider silk has been studied for many biomedical applications, like burn victims treatments. Then we studied about burns in order to find an interesting enzyme that could solve some problem and we learned that one of the most important problems"

Not all WWTPs are as large as the one in Taipei. One of our advisors (Jude Clapper) went to visit the Boswell WWTP in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. We learned that the same processes that occur in the Taipei Dihua WWTP also occur in the Boswell WWTP, but with different water flow rates and waste quantities. Since both facilities use a similar water purification process, we were inspired to create our current prototype design--a rotating polymeric bioreactor coated in biofilm--which is applicable to both WWTPs. This prototype will be placed in the secondary sedimentation tank, where the majority of organic solids have been removed and only smaller particles exist. The plant manager, Robert J. Blough, also confirmed that since our project is bacteria-based, it will be killed by UV light and chlorine in the disinfection tank, similar to the Dihua WWTP, before the water turns into effluent and goes to the rivers and oceans.
We plan to add our bacteria either in the deep aeration tanks or the secondary sedimentation tanks. The disinfection tank will kill the bacteria used in previous tanks.Figure: Christine C.

We contacted the company that removes our NP waste because we wanted to know what happens when it leaves our lab. They directed us to National Cheng Kung university who actually treats the waste for them. The university uses chemicals and burning to aggregate NPs. Through literature research, we discovered that burning NPs is the most prevalent way for removal, however it is not 100% effective at removing all types of nanomaterials (Marr et. al. 2013).

Spring Fair -- Spreading Public Awareness of Nanoparticles
At our school’s annual spring fair, we operated a booth where people could create their own glitter slime by mixing polyvinyl alcohol and sodium borate solutions. The slime was meant to simulate the trapping of NPs (in this demo, glitter) by biofilm. We also showed a few SEM images of bacteria, as well as everyday products that contain NPs such as toothpaste and sunscreen. Everyone who came to our booth was encouraged to take our survey so we could record opinions on bioethics and concerns about NPs. (Whole team activity)

In order to reduce the observed level of background resulting from the plasmid backbone, the PCR amplification of the pSB1C3 backbone was treated with DpnI (NEB) and purified to a stock concentration of 9.84 µg/ml. A subsequent attempt at Gibson assembly was then attempted using 6.53 µl of the DpnI treated backbone. To check the results of the miniprep of colony 19, PCR was performed using the primers 4CLF and CHSR in an attempt to amplify the 5 kb operon. Additional PCR was performed using primers for the detection of each gBlock (Table 6).
Week commencing- 1/10/18
All PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis, however, no bands were observed on the gel. Despite this, colony 19 was sent for sequencing as the plasmid was of the expected size (Eurofins Genomics). This plasmid was also used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for potential future expression analysis. In concordance with this, the Gibson assembly with the DpnI treated backbone was used to transform TOP10 and DH5α commercial E. coli cells. This resulted in lots of colonies on the DH5α cell plates and less than 5 on each TOP10 plate. Colonies 21-25 from the Gibson assemblies using variants of gel extracted and amplified gBlocks were transferred to overnight cultures, alongside colonies 27-34 transformations with the DpnI treated Gibson assembly mix. Minipreps were performed on overnight cultures of colonies 21-34, and one band was observed at 7 kb for colony 23 when analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. This was subsequently sent for sequencing. Plasmids extracted from a further 10 colonies were analysed, however, all were found to contain the template plasmid from the pSB1C3 amplification. Sequencing data for the two plasmids sequenced did not provide sufficient coverage to confirm the correct assembly of the naringenin operon into the pSB1C3 backbone.

Utah State iGEM team has collaborated with several teams this year and have provided parts and advice. We collaborated with the UC Chile Team by providing them with a cyanobacterial transformation vector ( BBa_K390000 ) we designed during iGEM 2010, as well as providing them with details and procedures for its use and customization. We collaborated with the Copenhagen Team by providing them with a cyanobacteria promoter ( BBa_K390008 ) that is active in the dark that we designed during iGEM 2010, as well as providing them with information from our literature review about the part.
High School Outreach
Engineering State Event
Our iGEM team had the amazing opportunity to reach out to high school students through a program at Utah State University called Engineering State. This event allowed us to positively impact high school students from 43 different school districts in which 4 charter schools were represented.
We had four teaching sessions with an average of 23 high school students per session. Our team focused specifically in the area of synthetic biology and biotechnology, teaching them current research being done in this area as well as techniques used.  The topics included bacterial transformation, fluorescent proteins, fluorescence microscopy and the iGEM competition. They showed particular interest in the projects held by our Utah State iGEM team and were informed that they could join as high school students if they wished to participate. We also offered the students a hands on experience to give them an in-depth view of the strategies that we use in our own lab.
The exercise consisted in transforming green fluorescent protein (GFP) into competent E. coli cells. The students added GFP DNA cells to the competent cells and allowed them to incubate for a few minutes. The mixture of cells were then placed in a 42 degree Celsius water bath to “heat shock” the cells, allowing DNA to enter the E. coli cells. Then LB growth medium was added and the cells were incubated for some time to be then transferred to Amp"

Overview     Peptide YY     Population Control
 
Summary of the Project
     The Citadel team decided to tackle  a unique and exciting challenge for iGEM 2010.   In humans and many other mammalian species there exists an intricate  communication network between the digestive system and the central nervous system  (CNS) called the brain-gut axis.   Interactions between the two regions of the axis are performed by  hormonal peptides produced by cells within the gastrointestinal tract.  These proteins are absorbed into the bloodstream,  traverse the blood-brain barrier, and interact directly with neurons within the  brain to regulate the intake of calories.   Inspired by this connection between the gastronomic system and the CNS,  and acutely aware of the plethora of engineer-able microbes already inhabiting  the human GI microbiome, The Citadel team set out to harness this potent  natural system for applications to human and animal health, especially in the  areas of medical diagnostics and drug delivery.   The student researchers pursued a project that would demonstrate the production  in E.coli of a novel protein associated with the brain-gut axis,as  well as indicate the far-reaching potential for engineered microbes to  influence complex systems in remote regions of the body.  Hunger was an especially appealing target for  bacterial influence, and quickly became the focus of the project.  The team identified a protein, Peptide  Tyrosine Tyrosine (3-36), abbreviated PYY3-36 which is naturally  generated by L cells within the intestines in response to calorie absorption  after a meal.  PYY3-36  migrates across the brain-gut axis and binds  to receptors within the hypothalamus, triggering the activation of pathways  that result in taste aversion, a decrease in pancreatic secretion, and a  reduction in appetite.  The Citadel team  converted the PYY3-36 gene into the Biobrick standard format and  designed a system for it's expression and control.
 
Genetic Circuit Design
     There are two separate modules  contained within the circuit envisioned by The Citadel iGEM team.  The next few paragraphs are devoted to a  explanation of how these modules were designed and what they accomplish.  Please refer to the illustrations – they  will be very helpful as you follow the description of the circuit.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"age and bacteria do not require a specific pH, although we will need to perform further tests to prove it. Furthermore, due to our system’s self-renewability, it is greater in both functional efficiency and cost efficiency. Our system is more complex in comparison to chemical precipitation, due to its requirement of heat and UV disinfection; however, our system proposes a solution that solves the issues faced with chemical precipitation in an effective manner, providing a sustainable alternative.
Incorporation
To incorporate our system into the biological wastewater treatment plant, we would put it in the secondary clarifiers as this is where metal removal occurs, according to our interview with the process coordinator of our local wastewater treatment plant, Duane Guzzi. Additionally, it would be the final process before UV disinfection, where all the organisms are killed. Currently, we are unsure as to where our system would integrate within industrial wastewater treatment plants; this will be a future direction.
Figure 1. Wastewater treatment plant process
Positive Impacts of Our System
The incorporation of our system into wastewater treatment plants could reduce the number of metals present in a more inexpensive manner, as it is self-renewable; doing so would help prevent heavy metals from negatively affecting the ecosystem, without the cost with chemical precipitation. Additionally, it could also be used in addition to chemical precipitation and biosurfactants for the complete removal of metals from wastewater. In biological wastewater treatment plants, the sludge made from the process is used as fertilizer for crops and soil which meet the guidelines for metallic concentration; our system could lower the concentration, allowing a greater amount of crops to benefit from the fertilizer. This reduces the amount of unnecessary sludge dumped in the landfills, increasing the reusability of waste [5]. The use of this system would be particularly ideal for places dealing with heavy metals present in wastewater, such as current industrial plants. Additionally, it can be used in places such as Flint, Michigan, where drinking water is tainted with large quantities of lead [6].
TAILINGS PONDS
Current Methods
Biosurfactants are one solution for metal removal in tailings ponds. Biosurfactants can be defined as the surface-active biomolecules produced by microorganisms with a wide range of applications [7]. Surfactants increase the solubility of hydrophilic molecules, thereby reducing both surface and interfacial tensions at oil or water interfaces, and have been studied for the removal of metals from tailings ponds. In one study, the removal of arsenic from mining tailings ponds was done by  Rhamnolipid biosurfact"

To characterize the binding of the coils we pulled down with either an immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) that serves as a negative control or with GFP antibody. The idea behind this experiment is to pull down the E coil which is fused to GFP with a GFP antibody and then probe with a anti-his antibody which recognizes the his tag on the TALE fused to the K coil. Upon interaction between the E and K coils we will see an output at approximately 86 kDa when probed with a His-antibody as seen in Figure 7. Our test groups included the coils by themselves and both the E and K coils put together in solution. As seen in Figure 7 a band appears only when we pull E and K coil with a GFP and probe with an anti-his antibody indicating the presence of both GFP and TALE in the elution solution indicating that the coils interact with each other.
Figure 7. Immunoprecipitation assay showing that the E and K coils interact with each other. The first three lanes show E coil, K coil and E coil with K coil pulled down with IgG (control) antibody. The last three lanes were pulled down with a anti-GFP antibody and probed with a anti-his antibody. The E coil is fused to GFP and the K-coil is fused to TALE with a his tag. Therefore, if we pull down with GFP and probe with his-antibody a band would appear the size of TALE. This indicates that both the GFP and the TALE are present and that is possible upon coil-coil interaction.
How does the use of Coils versus Direct Fusions of TALEs Affect our Prussian Blue reporter?
After successfully confirming that we could convert our own ferritin proteins that were produced from the parts we constructed ( BBa_K1189018, BBa_K1189021 ) into Prussian blue ferritin the next step was to evaluate how the design of our parts could potentially affect the reporter activity of our Prussian blue ferritin. Based on the spatial modelling performed by our team it was suggested that assembly of the ferritin nanoparticle with TALE proteins directly fused was highly unlikely. This is because the TALE proteins are significantly larger than the ferritin subunits. Their size would likely result in steric hindrance and prevent the assembly of the full ferritin protein. In order to test the predictions put forward by our modelling we ensured that our protein samples were balanced in order to have the same number ferritin cores in each sample. The"

There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05, the mean response time differs significantly differs at alpha = 0.05 between the control blocks and the mix compatible block (paired-samples t-test; p >0.05, d.f = 14). Even though there was a violation of the normality assumption, the departure from normality is of little concern.
There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05, the mean response time differs significantly at alpha = 0.05 between the control blocks and the mix incompatible block (paired-samples t-test; p < 0.03, d.f = 14). Even though there was a violation of the normality assumption, the departure from normality is of little concern.
Boxplots comparing the distribution of mean response time (ms) each presented word of participants (n = 15) for the the mixed compatible and mixed incompatible blocks. Sampled in 2017.
Discussion
We noticed some very interesting trends.  Overall, we saw that the mean response times for the mix incompatible block have been significantly slower than the mean response times in the control blocks two and four. Surprisingly, this indicates that participants were generally slower at responding when the “biotechnology” and “unpleasant” categories shared a key (p < 0.03). This could mean that the average participant may have had a slight bias towards synthetic biology. Conversely,  participants showed no statistical difference, indicating no bias (positive or negative), between the mix compatible block and the control blocks. Their mean response times were not statistically different when “biotechnology” and “pleasant” shared a key.
When we looked at specific words from our project, we also got some interesting results. The word “aggregate"
NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," about good quality management by biosynthetic palm kernel oil?
Transparency. I think technical comprehensible processes are way better than bare certificates. I can prove with a method of testing, that everything is ok, it’s ways better than owning 5 certificates, which might get easy forged with pen and TippEx.
Do you know RSPO?
No. (We gave him a short overview)
Do you think if there were more certificates from different organizations, the quality of them would increase and they would be more transparency?
Every certificate, which is not based on technical methods of testing, might be a swindle. Especially with new products one should not make the mistake of not being transparent. Furthermore, it’s not the number of standards to be followed, it’s’ the accountability for the consumer. In doubt I would say, the more standards, the worse it gets.
Would you advice other corporations to exit RSPO?
I cannot answer this question. For me, and I didn’t know this organization before, if it’s common sense, that they do doubtful things, it would be better to have something good.
What do you think the future of the plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia will look like?
Maybe it depends on the success of your project (laughs). Anyway, I believe they will grow on.
Despite all activism against palm (kernel) oil?
I hope not, but I think so.
Do you think the Austrian oil market would notice the impacts?
If not only food, but also biofuels are on the spot, then I think we will get to see way more litres of palm oil in the next years.
Thank for your time!
Summary of the interview with Hollu Systemhygiene
Hollu Systemhygiene GmbH is an Austrian producer of washing and cleaning products. In an interview with Benjamin Göllner of the company’s science department, we talked about the use of palm kernel oil in the production of cleaning products, GMOs, palm (kernel) oil certifications, environmentalism and our project. His company is not using palm oil but he said to us that European commodity supplier deliver 1-5 tonnes per year for surfactant. In his view, the plantation of oil palms is more productive than other plants and there are no alternatives because of the price.
In his opinion, biotechnology will become more relevant in the production of detergents in the next decades and he doesn’t see a problem with the use of GMOs in this industry (as opposed to the food industry for example). However, it would have to be proven that the synthetic palm kernel oil is more environmental friendly that the"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#Cloning_-_-_TEXT.html," (X). As positive control the domain SH2 of the tyrosine kinase Abl1    as target and the monobody HA4 as binding protein are used. Also, the HA4 mutations Y87A ( BBa_K2082222 ), R38A( BBa_K2082223 ) and the double mutation     R38A and E52A ( BBa_K2082224 ) were created. A detailed explanation about our decision for this bacterial two-hybrid system is availble in our project description.
In consideration of the space between both halves of our RpoZ-HA4 construct we designed a 30 base-pairs linker with an anti-cMyc binding site for easy detection of the expression of     the protein within the E. coli coli via western blot assay with a cMyc antibody. For the cI-SH2 fusion protein we designed constructs with the alternative linkers    possibilities. The BioBricks are designed without a linker ( BBa_K2082205 ), with a short nine base-pair linker     ( BBa_K2082206 ) and the cMyc-linker for integrated expression control ( BBa_K2082207 ).
The reporter of our system is based on a lacZ promoter expanded by the OR1 binding site for the cI repressor protein of the phage 434. To make the first studies of the transcriptional     activation we choose a RFP gene as the reporter ( BBa_K2082211 ). Stronger interaction should result in higher expression of RFP and a stronger red fluorescence in the E. coli cell. Later for     our final system the RFP is replaced by a beta-lactamase gene to put on a selection pressure on our bacteria( BBa_K2082238 ). To use the reporter in our two plasmid system, the whole part was at first    integrated upstream of the SH2-cI fusion protein encoding sequence( BBa_K2082231 ).
The reporter activity could be dependent on the plasmid number. Therefore, a knock-in     of the reporter in the genome of our final E. coli strain JS200 with the CRISPR/Cas9 system was done. The main construct of the knock-out was also added to the part registry ( BBa_K2082251 )
For different tests with our bacterial two-hybrid system more constructs were created. At first the DNA binding domain and the associated OR1 binding site was changed from the cI of the phage    434 to the cI protein of the phage lambda( BBa_K2082252 ). For the cI"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.

Clearly, the optogenetic guidance system of tissue engineering has well-founded potential. To achieve our vision, we focused on better characterising existing optogenetic tools in two scenarios: instantaneous cell adhesion and light-induced gene activation and regulation - key to achieving controlled tissue growth, as previously mentioned.
Currently, in the synthetic biology community we need to resolve the need for more optogenetic tools and to characterise the existing ones better.
Instantaneous cell adhesion
The problem
A synthetic tissue cannot rely on a stream of previous information in the same way that embryo cell adhesion does - in natural development, molecules and cells interact with each other in a complex system before and after cell-cell connections are formed. Our optogenetic approach would rather hijack these processes elegantly.
The solution, then, is post-translation control. This approach enables us to combine light control with protein-protein inhibition, which in comparison to transcriptional control results in less noise and fewer off-target activation. Also, the process is instantaneous, allowing for light to break any prevention of cell adhesion immediately.

Collaborations
Stop, collaborate and listen!
Collaborating with other teams is a core part of iGEM. We spoke to many different teams, exploring a variety of different possible collaborations, however most of our collaborations involved IDE, a software tool we developed to aid Wiki building.
IDE
We created iGEM Development Environment (IDE) , a tool which allows faster and easier Wiki editing. We shared this tool with the iGEM community and spoke with a lot of teams           who were interested in using IDE. We Skyped many of these teams, explaining how to use IDE as well as gaining valuable feedback. We collaborated with the following teams, who used IDE to help build their Wiki:
•  University of Nottingham
""The IDE was not very difficult to get set up and this was coming from someone who has only just learnt html coding (I have used           python before). Using it was slightly more difficult however this was more due to me having gaps in my knowledge of html coding. With that said, Albert was extremely helpful with helping me use it so I could design our wiki page how we had planned           it. There were a few problems due to the IDE being coded in Linux while I am doing all my editing in Windows but I think these may have been fixed in an updated version of the IDE.
""It helped me by allowing me to test creative ideas,           animations, layouts and much more without editing our actual wiki. This means I was not interfering with what anyone else was doing on our wiki by making big changes to the css files or navigation bar.""
•  Munich
""All in all, the IDE is a helpful tool to develop the wiki faster. The strongest feature of it is how fast changes actually come through.           At least for our team, whenever we changed the code in a template on the iGEM servers, we had to delete the cache to see the changes on pages using the templates, which was bothersome. With the IDE we only had to edit the code, refresh and were           able to immediately see the modifications. That made the implementation of the css files and specially templates for menu and footer easier and more convenient. We also liked the possibility to, at least to a certain extent, work without internet           connection,"

Origin Story
The team was selected over a five day sandpit event, from February 16th to February 20th. About 30 keen volunteers showed up, and over the week we learned about iGEM, its mission, and what we would be setting out to achieve. We pitched ideas, looked at Human Practices for the first time, and got to know everybody. At the end of the week, the chosen project was voted as ‘radiation-sensitive bacteria’ that would be sent up into space to do… something.
The following week, the ten members who were chosen got the e-mail they were hoping for, and the team was born. It was glorious.
We were eager for fresh ideas, and many proposed projects were considered at informal meetings. We met with the supervisors on April 30th, and our list was whittled down to five promising ideas: building a novel one-gene toggle switch, building a sensor for metabolic load, looking into ‘bacterial glowsticks,’ getting bacteria to make dyes from plants, and getting them to make L-glucose. We split into five two-person groups to look into each one in more depth.
At this point in our story the record goes dark, as we all entered into the exam period and our attentions turned away. We emerged from the exams intact, ready to devote our time to iG"
MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," have inspired us, is also a critical part of a great human practice initiative. Based on this feedback the             team decided to make a formal responsible science curriculum that could be used for future iGEM teams as well as other             institutions such as LabCentral and pgED, both of whom had conversations with us and gave us some feedback on the devised             curriculum. We also planned to make a HP How-To and build on the efforts of the Williams and Mary database of iGEM HP             initiatives so far. But we have thus far not finished that project."

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

Step3 Assemble the plasmids
Now we can assemble the parts we got into the plasmids’ backbones.
Fig.3 the part of head-to-head promoter module
Fig.4 the part of terminator module together with the homologous arms L1,L2 and L2,L3 for assembly;
Fig.5 the part of L1, resistance gene and the homologous arms, ech42-LB which is the integration chromosomal locus located in the genome of T.atroviride.
Fig.6 the part of L3 and ech42-RB
Therefore, we can utilize the three-module strategy to finish the  dual-transcription unit assembly.
Fig.7 Modularized head-to-head promoter module and a pair of terminators was assembled with two genes. Thus, two transcription units were assembled. Then the two transcription units were transformed into T.atroviride for assembly and integration with modules of selective markers and integration sites.[1]
The process of integrating the several dual-transcription units into the genome of T.atroviride bases on the homologous recombination in vivo. The important point of this process is the dedicated overlap regions L1-L3 so that each fragment can assemble with adjacent fragments by the overlap regions. Plus, these overlap sequences were designed to have least homology with the genome of T.atroviride by sequence analysis.
Result
The first phase：random insertion
According to the GFP observed under the fluorescence microscope(P2), we can prove that PKD1 plasmid contains both H3 promoter and Hex promoter can work. Meanwhile, the hex promoter is weaker than the H3 promoter.

We put the hyphae picked from the T.atroviride which confrontational cocultured with the P.nicotianae on a clean glass slide, next to the hyphae from T.atroviride without P.nicotianae. The different fluorescence strength between them revealed that Pech42 was activated by P.nicotianae (P3,P4"

Gene-transfer of the Bt gene could hurt the wild biodiversity. The plants overall fitness would increase, due to the ability to fight off arthropods who feed on it. This would lead to an overall fitness decrease in the feeding arthropods, as feeding animals dies from the toxin. This might lead to birds who feed on said arthropods to migrate from the area in search of food, leading to another loss in biodiversityBerthold, Peter. Bird migration: a general survey. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2001..
Future impact on biodiversity
As stated, climate change does have a negative impact on biodiversity. One way for GMOs to help improve biodiversity is to decrease the output of greenhouse gasses, or decrease the amount already found in our atmosphere. HT and Bt crops already help with that, lowering the amount of herbicides and pesticides used in agriculture fields. Optimizing photosynthesis for agriculture plants Ort, Donald R., Xinguang Zhu, and Anastasios Melis. ""Optimizing antenna size to maximize photosynthetic efficiency."" Plant physiology 155.1 (2011): 79-85. , would not only reduce CO2, but could also increase growth in the plants. Incorporating photosynthesis into daily life usage, like our PowerLeaf, is one such possible and responsible solution.
GMO alone will not be able to negate the negative impact on biodiversity from climate change, and some effects we are already experiencing. GMO is able to help us on a direction to reduce the impacts on biodiversity. If used in conservation by reintroducing newly extinct species Folch, J., et al. ""First birth of an animal from an extinct subspecies (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) by cloning."" Theriogenology 71.6 (2009): 1026-1034. , possible rebuilding lost ecosystems.
Lastly GMO can also help ecosystems by engineering flora and fauna, so they can resist changes caused by climate change, or promote a specific phenotype. When talking about releasing transgenic organisms into the natural environment, it leads to a whole other discussion of GMO.
The PowerLeaf
To avoid the discussion of GMO in the environment, and not at least to mitigate any effect, positive and negative, on the environment we designed our PowerLeaf to be isolated in a material called polycarbonate. This, alongside with a kill switch, should ensure that no contamination of local fauna and flora would arise. Therefore our product will not be able to influence wild types, neither by out"

Therefore, we not only have a simplistic cell growth model to take into account.  Instead, we will also have to take note of the cell growth and its changes when protein production is induced.  The time duration will no longer be purely overnight, but rather it will be about a whole day (growth to high cell density plus around 6 hours of protein production).
We have tried to optimize the growth conditions.  We have decided that the nitrogen source 0.2% Casamino acids is necessary for cell growth [modifying of Endy protocol, Larry], while glycerol should be omitted as it will be taken up similar to a secondary carbon source. Preliminary experimental data has shown that with 0.05% glucose, the switch point occurs after about 7 hours.

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t"

Model - Coacervation
To understand the physics behind the coacervation method requires a brief introduction into the theory of polymer solutions. Consider a solution of positively and negatively charged polymers (polycations and polyanions respectively) of equal valence $Z$, and that no salts are present in the solution. It will be implicit that throughout all that follows, temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ of the solution are fixed. For simplicity, we assume that we have a symmetric solution, which means that the volume fraction of the polycations $\phi_+$ equals the volume fraction of the polyanions $\phi_-$, so that $$\phi_+=\phi_-=\frac{\phi}{2}"

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM team, we had a good time in the lab space and working place during iGEM at The Advanced Wet Lab Room, The Teaching Lab G128/129, and MSc Study Room of Peter Wilson Building, King’s Building campus. The labs are sufficient for nearly all of our experiments like PCR, Gibson assemblies, transformations, and restriction-ligation. In addition, we also worked in other places including JCMB and Roger Land building, King's Building campus in case of insufficient working places. All the activities taking place at above areas except The Teaching Lab G128/129 were supervised by correlated professors and staff, following the guidance on requirements for transports of biological materials.
For each team member who already had wet lab working experience for over 4 years, we still received sufficient safety training and had good laboratory practice, past the tests during the introductory week. During our working process, we always followed safety guidance produced by the Health and Safety Department of the University of Edinburgh. During the wet lab time, we always worked with lab coats and gloves, face masks were worn when required, like with powdered reagents such as kanamycin. Long hair was required tied back as always, proper devices and equipment like fuming cupboard and fan were used. When using the UV-light, the gloves and a UV protective screen were provided, as well as UV glasses.
For the risk assessment of single substance, group of related substances or a process/procedure as well as any proprietary purchased materials, we fulfilled COSHH forms and executed as indications. The biological agents were assessed and operated properly, there is no pathogen and toxin materials were used in our experiments. For containment controls, the biological hazards, the general waste from labs were treated separately. For all above guidelines and forms, every lab supervisor and student had to read, considered, signed and respected.
For each activity of our project, our lab technician Dr Annegret Honsbein prepared detailed protocols for us and modified them better against our conditions. Besides, all team members had discussed with Annegret about their own experimental plans separately to make sure safe and accurate operations. During experiment time, three lovely demonstrators always supervised and helped us. Other than that, we kept cooperation with Edinburgh undergraduate team to promise better works of each other. Other than the gene modification works, we also carried out tasks for products purification, as well as characterization of the products. For these experiments required for specialized equipment, substances and chemicals, we looked for advice from CTO (the Chemistry Teaching Organizations), the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, Dr Louise Horsfall and Dr Andrew Free, and operated following their suggestions.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,". Testing of the presence of AI-2 via Vibrio harveyi reporter strain BB170.
Abstract: Vibrio harveyi can express bioluminescence in response to small signal molecules called autoinducers, which accumulate in the environment. Mutant strain BB170 responds only to autoinducer-2 (AI-2).  Therefore, BB170 became a universal strain to test the presence of AI-2.
☞☟ 
Steps
BB170 was grown for 16 h with shaking at 30oC in AI-2 Bioassay (AB) media. AB media is made by adjusting 400 mL of distilled (DI) water to pH 7.5, and adding 7 g of NaCl, 2.4 g of MgSO4, 0.8 g casamino acid and 8 mL of glycerol. AB media is supplmented with 400 μL of potassium phosphate buffer (K2HPO4 10.71 g and 5.24 g KH2PO4 dissolved in 100 mL of DI water), 400 μL of 0.1 M L-arginine (0.1742 g L-arginine in 10 mL of DI water), 40 μL of riboflavin (10 μg/mL), 40 μL of thiamine (1 mg/mL) and 40 μL kanamycin (50 mg/mL).
Overnight cultures were diluted 1:5000 in fresh AB media. Test samples were added to BB170 cultures at a final concentration of 10% (vol/vol). The cultures were shaking at 30oC.
In the next six hours, 200 μL cultures were added into black 96-well plates every 30 min, and luminescence was measured by microplate reader in the mode of Chemiluminescence.

5. Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli using CRISPR–Cas9 meditated genome editing
Abstract: Engineering cellular metabolism for improved production of valuable chemicals requires extensive modulation of bacterial genome to explore complex genetic spaces. Here, we use the development of a CRISPR–Cas9 based method for genome editing and metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli. This system enables us to introduce various types of genomic modifications with near 100% editing efficiency and to introduce three mutations simultaneously.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", our results for the comparison between tetp with and without the PhlF transcription unit (Figure 5.) showed that the fluorescence activity driven by tetp with the PhlF transcription unit was higher than that without the PhlF transcription unit. This is unexpected and further investigation is needed to explain this phenomenon.
To investigate crosstalk between lacp and TetR:
To investigate crosstalk between lacp and PhlF:
We compared the fluorescence activity of the two constructs above against a GFP generator driven by lacp (the construct that was used to characterize lacp promoter strength).
Figure 6. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of lacp with and without TetR transcription unit. Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Figure 7. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of lacp with and without PhlF transcription unit Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Due to the high error bar generated from our results, we could not make a reliable inference regarding the interaction between TetR and lacp despite the mean fluorescence output of the lacp driven GFP generator being much lower than that of one with a TetR transcription unit upstream to it. Unfortunately, we could not repeat this set of characterization due to time constraint. With regards to PhlF interaction with lacp, our results seem to suggest that PhlF may have a repressing effect on lacp. This needs to be taken into account when fine tuning our design to ensure that the crosstalk doesn't result in instability.
Performance of Promoters under Full Workload
We were also interested in studying how well the promoters perform when they are driving the expression of two repressors on top of the reporter gene just like how they would be in the full Tristable Switch construct. To visualize how well the promoters would perform under full workload, the following constructs were built:
To investigate performance of phlFp:

To investigate performance of lacp:

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) which was codon optimized for expression in cyanobacteria. The gene was also synthesized with a double transcriptional terminator designed from sequences described for iGEM part BBa_B0015. The synthetic gene was subsequently subcloned into pSB1C and has been designated BBa_K558006.
petBD promoter+RBS: The strong light inducible petBD promoter will be used to drive the expression of invertase gene in Synechocystis. The petBD+RBS (BBa_K390015) was generously provided to us by the Utah State iGEM team.
Kanamyacin resistance cassette (KanR): The kanamycin resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pUC4K (Taylor and Rose (1988) NAR 16:358). This cassette includes the neomycin phosphotransferase 2 gene with its own constitutive promoter and transcriptional terminator. This cassette is frequently used to select for positive transformants in Synechocystis.
Gibson Assembly of AGP K.O./INV Components
Primer Design: Forward and reverse primers for each DNA part were designed with 20 base pair overlapping sequences with the upstream and downstream flanking segments. This will create 40 base pair overlaps between neighboring parts in the construct.
PCR: Inv, KnR, and petBD+RBS were amplified from BBa_K558006(Nevada), pUC4K, and K390015(Utah State) respectively under standard PCR conditions. AGP in pSB1A3 will be amplified to include the vector. This will be used as the backbone for Gibson Assembly.
Assembly of Parts: The above parts will be assembled into the following construct
Primers developed for PCR and Gibson Assembly for INV operon. Overlapping DNA sequences can be created through PCR by adding twenty base-pairs of the end of your first genetic sequence to the beginning of your second genetic sequence. A blunt-end 40 base-pair sequence is then created that is ideal for Gibson Assembly.
Transformation: Synechocystis will be naturally transformed via homologous recombination.
Engineer Synechocystis to secrete hexose sugars to the medium
Synechocystis lacks the ability to secrete hexose sugars. Therefore it was necessary to introduce a sugar transporter through genetic engineering. Previous studies (Nedierholtmeyer et al (2010) Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462)"

Attribution
Attributions are an important point of any iGEM project as it is necessary to put the results obtained by the team into the context of individual responsibilities. Thus, we will attempt to candidly describe how our project evolved, which student was responsible for which sub-project, and who supported our project with scientific or non-scientific contributions.
Finding the biotINK project
For the story of finding our project, it is essential to know that there was no iGEM team from either TUM or LMU in 2015 and no team at TUM in 2014. Thus, each of these years saw students wanting to participate in the iGEM competition but facing the bleak perspective that there was no hosting lab that offered the support necessary to make the ""iGEM experience"". For this long a time, students have brainstormed in order to find interesting ideas that they could convert into an iGEM project. Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year – at least in theory"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#SravantiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the order of parts, etc. The first design we came up with used multiple panels that mimicked the workflow of Eugene but without actually writing code. We liked the visual of splitting results into different “piles” based on categorization and incorporated this idea into both of our design prototypes. Our second design emphasized the focus the rule parameters biologists will be looking for by dedicating half the screen to selecting rules, creating them, and turning them “on and off”, although the latter feature is not supported by Eugene. These are very preliminary ideas, and I think having more input from the BU team will help narrow down which features we would like to include in Eugene DeSyne and which direction to take our future prototypes.
Thursday:
Today, we continued to brainstorm ideas to further develop our ideas. We delved into greater detail with both of our designs, and ran through example queries. With some direction from Orit, we decided to focus our efforts on visualizing first-order logic in different ways. We came up with a refined user interface, but we'll probably refine our ideas tomorrow.
Presenting our preliminary ideas to BU
Friday:
Today, we let go of our limitations when designing. Casey came to talk to us about our designs, and afterwards, we were inspired to not let something like a web interface limit our design. In a sense, we started from scratch, and came up with a completely new design. We have an icon based idea now, which uses elements from games such as Little Alchemy to overlay icons on top of one another to create new icons. We created sample icons for each property to overlay on icons for each part, which we felt was more intuitive for a novice user and was much easier than actually coding. We broke away from the conventions of visual programming language, and although our project is heading in a different direction, I'm really happy with it because it's more creative and exciting than our previous designs, which I think will be great when it comes time to actually code our design.
Week 4: June 10-14
Monday:
Today, after coming up with our icon idea on Friday, we came up with an alternative idea. After some direction from Orit, we decided to investigate two projects: the MoClo design from last year's iGEM project, and UML, or Unified Modeling Language. We drew more inspiration from UML and its organized design. We liked the way it compartmentalized the properties and methods that applied to an object. While we were inspired by such a design, we decided to create a tree, which was very different from our icon idea. The"

The resulting plasmid is called the Reporter plasmid, it is used in our second readout system along with the Inverter plasmid . You can access the complete sequence of the plasmid on this page .
TetR plasmids
First plasmid - pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR
This assembly was quite tricky, as we had to test 3 plasmids before succeeding.
We first took the J23019 plasmid from the registry and designed plasmids, but we never succeeded in amplifying it during PCRs. We assumed that probably the plasmid is not exactly the one described in the registry and went on with plasmid number 2.
Our second choice was pSB3C5, as we could partially reuse the primers designed for J23019. But the PCR results were very weak and the assembly failed.
So finally we used pSB3K1, which is really similar to pSB3C5, designed new primers and succeeded in doing the Gibson assembly!
We amplified this backbone, and added TetR under control of a constitutive promoter.

5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate of bioreactors reaches certain degree.
Hypothesis:
1).Because DszA and DszB are both inhibited by HBP, the catalytic rates of these two enzymes fit the models as below respectively:
In the equation, kAcat,kBcat are the conversion coefficients of enzymes A and B respectively, and Km,A,Km,B are the Michaellis constant of enzymes A and B respectively, and IC50,A,IC50,B are the concentrations of inhibitors that lead to a 50% reduction in the enzymes’ activities respectively.
2).Because enzyme DszC is inhibited noncompetitively by HBP, and it is also inhibited by catalytic substrates HBP, the catalytic rate of enzyme DszC is:
In the equation，kCcat is the conversion coefficient of enzyme C ,and Km,C are the Michaelis constant of the enzyme C, respectively, and KI is the inhibition constant of HBPs to DzsC enzymes,  shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
3).Estimate the variations of different components in 4S pathway, using differential equations:
2.4 Result Analysis
1).The optimal proportion of DszA, DszB and DszC..
Using MATLAB, we simulate different components’ concentration change with different DszA, DszB and DszC’s concentrations.
Using Matlab2015a, we found that:
when the proportion of three enzymes is A:B:C=1:2:4 or A:B:C=2:1:4, the decreasing rate of DBT is well suited, showing that DBT is well degraded. However, with the proportion of A:B:C=1:4:2 or A:B:C=4:1:2, the effect is not so obvious as the previous one.
In addition, taking HBP into consideration, methods with the proportions A:B:C=1:4:2 and A:B:C=1:2:4 will achieve better results;
However, intermediates are produced with greater amount in the conditions of A:B:C=1:2:4 and A:B:C=2:1:4. Because of the molecular movement effect, the reaction is harder to control.
In conclusions, we decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:

MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity. The sample optical density (OD) is therefore inversely correlated with cell death. Percentage cell death can be calculated with the formula: Cell death(%) = 1- Sample OD/Control OD x 100% . In our assay, Sample OD is the mean OD of drug-treated cells, while Control OD is the mean OD of non-treated cells.
Cells were plated at a density of 1e5 per well in 96-well plates to reach 80% confluence.  Doxorubicin (150μM), Doxorubicin-loaded NDC (150μM Doxorubicin + 1μM NDC) and Doxorubicin-loaded NDC-AS (150μM Doxorubicin + 1μM NDC-AS) was diluted 5 times in a serial 10X dilution, before being added to the cells in wells. After 24 hours incubation, 20μl MTT was added into each well and incubated for 4 hours. 100μl DMSO was then added and incubated with shaking for 10 minutes. Finally, the optical density (OD) due to formation of purple formazan crystals was measured by microplate reader at 570nm.
The preliminary cytotoxicity study revealed that both NDC and NDC-AS were able to kill MCF-7 breast cancer cells within this range of dilution. However, free doxorubicin only exhibited cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (ie. when less diluted). This may be explained by increased cell entry of doxorubicin as shown in fluorescence microscopy. In this assay, NDC-AS exhibited overall higher cytotoxicity than NDC. This may be due to extra inhibition of cell growth by the nucleolin aptamer AS1411. In the future, we hope to replicate this assay, to confirm added therapeutic effect of NDC and NDC-AS compared to free doxorubicin.
