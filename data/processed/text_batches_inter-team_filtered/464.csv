WITH SZU-iGEM
After to last year’s collaboration, this year we had an even stronger collaborating relationship with SZU-iGEM team. At early stage of our project, we encountered some problems in the transformation of B.subtilis strain. SZU-iGEM had previous experience working with Bacillus species , so they set up a meeting to help us with the transformation as well as technical trouble shooting. We did manage to successfully transform our B.subtilis 168 based on their suggestions. In the later stage of protein purification step, SZU also lent a vacuum pump to us to be used in affinity chromatography.
In return, we helped them by sharing our iGEM interlab kits as they ran out some of the key materials in their experiment. By providing silica Beads and Fluorescein Sodium Salt, they were able to finish their Interlab project on time. Additionally, we helped them promoting their Mini Program by sharing the process of our team project on the program and giving them detailed feedback after using it.

WITH Jiangnan_China
This year we formed a collaborating relationship with Jiangnan_China, it is whose first year participating in iGEM competition. We helped them with Wiki construction and technical supports, so that their Wiki is compatible with the required format. Furthermore, we also provided them with a supernova kill switch in a light-controlled gene system, which was an essential part to our last year’s iGEM project. In return, they suggested on a method, Ubbelohde viscometer, which we used to test the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.

We performed sensitivity analysis to discover ways to improve the effect of CRISPRi repression and to more precisely estimate the parameters above. Sensitivity analysis was performed on a global and local level. Since we were interested in improving upon the best possible case of our system, analysis was performed using the 35-fold model. Local sensitivity analysis involves computing the relative change of the steady state with respect to a change in the parameter. Using Matlab and a finite-difference approximation of the derivative, sensitivities were calculated for 5% changes in the parameters. The larger the sensitivity of the parameters shown below (in magnitude), the more important it is for said parameter to be estimated precisely.
The data provided by the local sensitivity analysis provides insight into parameters that need further investigation, such as the Hill Coefficient. However, these parameters are structural and cannot be easily modified through external control. Therefore, it was determined that a more overarching analysis be performed that covers a broad range of the parameter space. Global sensitivity analysis provides a method of estimating parameters that have the greatest effect on the system over a large range. We chose to use an approach that accounted for observed data from (Qi et al., 2013), as used during the least squares fit. The approach used is equivalent to used by Chang and Delleur (Chang et al., 1992) as well as Jia and Yue
. The steps of this analysis are explained below:
Formulate upper and lower bounds for the parameters. We chose to let parameters vary one magnitude above and below the least squares fit.
Generate a set of sample parameter sets that fall within the upper and lower bounds using Latin Hypercube Sampling. Latin
Hypercube sampling is a technique that effectively distributes random samples over a space of values. It ensures good coverage without needing to generate an absurdly large number of samples.
Run a simulation for every parameter set and calculate their errors from the observed data set (in our case, Qi et. al)
Calculate the average error, and set this as a threshold.
Choose a parameter named Q.
Partition parameter sets as acceptable and unacceptable.
Calculate the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of parameter Q for acceptable sets, and for unacceptable"

Hi~My name is Zhilin Chen   \(^o^)/ and I'm a sophomore student in life science department of USTC. Greatly attractied by synthetic biology, I chose to take part in iGEM2011 team,UTSC-China.I not only learnt a lot about Synthetic Biology,practiced my experimental skills,also, I believe it's worthwhile to spend time and energy to our promising project, which will certainly pay back. As for myself, outgoing, optimistic, considerate are all my characters,yet sometimes I could be really sentimental and depressed. Now I'm looking forward to the 2011 Jambooree and making friends with a common goal.

Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret.

THE DESIGN: AN OVERVIEW
Not content with simple fermentation to produce our target compounds, we sought to address the gaps in current biomanufacturing and incorporated various features into Coup Dy'état. Our system was designed with three main principles in mind: commercial viability, eco-friendliness, and emerging technology adoption ( Figure 1 ).
Figure 1. Design principles of Coup Dy'état
In our project, we set out to demonstrate the possibility of converting waste to dyes in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (subsequently, BL21*) via dynamic and stress regulation, achieved using computer-assisted optogenetic control. The illustration below encapsulates how all the features are integrated together to complete the bioproduction process.
The various parts of our system are designed to be modular; they can be incorporated into another system and be expected to work. With the advent of more biomanufacturing technologies, additional features can be assimilated seamlessly. Coup Dy'état is thus a technological platform where microbial production of any chemicals can be optimized.
With Coup Dy'état, we hope to set the standard for biomanufacturing.

Click on each segment of the illustration to find out more about each feature of our system! Let's begin with xylose, the feedstock, and then down the biosynthetic pathway to luteolin, our target compound, before exploring the various elements of our technological platform!
XYLOSE AS FEEDSTOCK
We are certain that our approach is much less harmful to the environment than the production of synthetic dyes. But what if we compared our project to traditional methods of obtaining natural dyes? While synthetic biology opens up new vistas for the bioproduction of heterologous compounds, we can only consider ourselves a superior alternative to plant cultivation and extraction if the process of acquiring the sugar feedstock for fermentation consumes significantly less land, water, and other resources [1].

The lysine decarboxylase is an enzyme whose synthesis is promoted by anaerobiosis and an acidic pH.  This enzyme is also the first step in the production of desferrioxame B which is a siderophore.
We succeed to produce DesA under an Arabinose indcution.
We registered the original sequence of this subpart in the iGEM registry of standard parts ( BBa_K1951000 ). We optimized our sequence for E. coli and ordered the synthesis by addition of an inducible promoter.
As you can see in the registry all our expectations on this BioBrick were validated and it worked fine.

The purpose of this biobrick is to produce desferrioxamine B siderophore by a controled manner, for controlled potential toxicity. This is also to reconstruct the full pathway of this siderophore production.

Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds secreted by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and grasses. Siderophores are amongst the strongest soluble Fe3+ binding agents known.
A precious metal binder
Previous work showed that siderophores are able to catch other metals by default. Especifically, many articles showed a high affinity of Desferrioxamine B (produce by Streptomyces coelicolor) for tetravalent metal ions like platinum. These results encouraged us to make a biobrick coding the sequence corresponding to the 4 enzymes involved on the metabolic pathway of Desferrioxamine B. E. coli was used to produce this biobrick. Produce a gram positive bacteria pathway in a gram negative bacteria is restrictive [1] , considering the risk of toxicity for themselves. To counter this potential issue, we regulate transcription using the control of an inductible promotor (pBAD/araC).

We improved the E.coli suicide mechanism which stemmed from the 2014 Peking iGEM team and transformed pigment genes (which expressed in E.coli in past igem teams) into cyanobacteria. In suicide mechanism, we constructed the parts containing both holin and endolysin, grouped it with Nrt-A (BBa_K2350021), and even verified that the suicide mechanism worked successfully in functional test. In pigment experiments, we are the first team to transform pigment gene BBa_I742157 (CrtZ) into cyanobacteria, and even verified that the engineered cyanobacteria with BBa_I742157 had better photosynthetic efficiency.
Endolysin-Holin
Our team’s project this year is to use microalgae to produce biofuel and we proposed a mechanism to reach this goal. After a few months hard work, we can conclude that this mechanism worked successfully, and yet this is not our final target.  Our team’s ultimate goal in this project is to cultivate the microalgae in an open pond so that we can have a magnificent production of biofuel. This mechanism contains transformed-E.coli and others necessary bio-bricks. And concerned about the biosafety methods in an open pond, we, therefore add in a suicide mechanism.
This mechanism which contains holin and endolysin was first proposed by 2014 Peking team. They used parts BBa_K1378031(holin) and BBa_K1378032(endolysin) for the suicide mechanism but our team has done some literature review, in the end, we decided to choose other parts of holin and endolysin which labeled as BBa_K112000 and BBa_K112806 .

The average buoyant density of a gas vesicle is reported to be around 120 kgm-3. While this density is much lower than that of water, this doesn’t necessarily imply a flotation advantage to the gas vesicle due to the presence of diffusive forces in a suspension. The smaller the particle, the stronger these diffusive interactions and the greater the deviation from the ideal concentration profile in a vertical column.
Our Model
The following sections detail the development of our mathematical model, which deals with gas vesicle dynamics in a medium and determines how their concentration profiles in a suspension evolve over time.
Terminal Velocity
A floating particle in a medium experiences multiple forces, some more prominent than others. Given the buoyant density of the particle, we can calculate its terminal velocity by equating all the upward forces and the downward ones and solving for velocity from the Stokes’ drag term.
Modeling the gas vesicle as displayed above, its volume V in terms of length l, half-angle θ and radius r is given by
\[  V = \pi r^{2}(l+\frac{2}{3}r cot \theta)  \tag{1.1} \label{eq:1.1} \]
The buoyant force on the gas vesicle is given by
\[  F_b=V\rho g = \rho g\pi r^{2}(l+\frac{2}{3}r cot \theta)  \tag{1.2} \label{eq:1.2} \]
where ρ is the density of the media.
Similarly, the force due to gravity is
\[  F_w=V\rho_{gv} g = \rho_{gv} g\pi r^{2}(l+\frac{2}{3}r cot \theta)  \tag{1.3} \label{eq:1.3} \]
where ρgv is the buoyant density of the gas vesicle.
When the particle reaches its terminal velocity, all the forces are balanced. Thus we can equate
\[ F_{d} + F_{w} = F_{b} \tag{1.4} \label{eq:1.4} \]
The viscous drag is usually a complex function of particle shape and size; in our case however, we will evaluate the drag using the hydrodynamic radius of the particle using the well-known expression for a spherical particle given by
\[ F_{d}=6\pi\eta R_{H} v \tag{1.5} \label{eq:"

Purified enzyme assay
Since the phaz1 BBa_K1149010 construct contains a His tag, the protein could be purified by metal affinity chromatography . The colourimetric assay was carried out, as with the cell lysate. 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer was used instead of the Tris-HCl buffer, to eliminate the esterase activity caused by imidazole in the buffer used previously. Every 30 seconds for 30 minutes the absorbance at 405 nm of the reaction mixture was recorded. The reaction mixture contained 1 ml of phosphate buffer, 2.5 µL of purified PHB depolyermase (stock concentration 0.230 mg/ml) and para-Nitrophenyl butyrate to make final concentrations of 50 µM, 100 µM, 150 µM, 200 µM and 250 µM of substrate.
The purified PHB depolyermase (phaz1) is definitely active. The graph shows that more 4-Nitrophenol is produced with greater concentrations of para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM
The above graph shows how the concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced is greater when the para-Nitrophenyl butyrate substrate concentration is greater. This data shows that we have successfully purified active PHB depolyermase.
SDS PAGE gel shows that PHB depolymerase was purified from the crude cell extract. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM
Michaelis-Menten kinetics of phaZ1 PHB depolymerase
To gain the kinetic parameters for our P(3HB) degradation model, purified phaZ1 PHB depolymerase was used in the same activity assay as described above. The para-Nitrophenyl butyrate substrate concentrations used were 0.5 mM,1.0 mM, 2.5 mM and 5.0 mM and 5 µL of purified PHB depolymerase (stock concentration 360 ng/µL). From these preliminary results and using graphpad, we have predicted the kinetic parameters to be a Vmax of 29.59 µM/s and a Km 1.56 mM.

We use a EPSON CB-X03 LCD projector as the red & blue light sources for CoChR & Chrimson. The projector's 3 LCDs(red, green and blue channel) functions as 1024*768 electronic shutters in each channel. Projector's super high pressure mercury lamp functions as a high-intensity light source[Fig. 2].

Firstly, we need to ""purify"" the light wavelengths of projector. Although the original filter can separate white light into red light and blue light, the bandwidth of red light or blue light is not narrow as what our optical sensory proteins(CoChR & Chrimson) require . We install additional red filter Chroma ET630/20X and blue filter Chroma ET480/20X outside 3LCDs. (Fig. 3B) According to the principle of fluorescence microscope, corresponding Di-Mirror 89402bs and emission filter 89402m are installed inside the microscope filter wheel(Fig. 3C). You can see all filters we use in our project (Fig. 3).

The double LH Adapter is connected to microscope. (Fig. 5) However, based on the optical principle of microscope, the light should focus on the plane of Double LH adapter. To project the whole image (from projector) to microscope, it should be about 5cm*5cm on plane. The focus distance of Dukane 3 inch/2.5 (we used to replace the original lens) is 3 inches(75mm).

Simple and inaccurate modeling of biological process could not keep pace with the development of synthetic biology and undoubtedly, our Chain-Node model provides a possible solution to the imbalance.
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
A simple example, tetR dimer, is shown to illustrate our simple modeling idea (做一个tetR2的模型放在右边做为配图，否则右边太空了). It has two chains with each containing only one part, tetR. Dimerization of tetR will create a node to indicate the bound state of two parts. To explain more clearly, bound parts are also considered as nodes so that in this example, all nodes are organized in a tree structure, which includes two children (leaf) nodes and one parent node. We will conform to this convention in our wiki.
To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea and deeper understanding of our modeling system.
Modeling with Templates
Modeling manually of biological system is widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data. The underlying reason making modeling so difficult is that the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur through different mechanisms. Based on this. we are always seeking feasible ways to implement our automatic modeling idea. The automatic does not mean modeling without any information provided, but however, there indeed exists a minimal data set to enable the automation.
Similar to C++ programming language, we introduce templates to allow generic description of species and reactions of a certain pattern. It is essential to implement our automatic modeling idea since
to share the same
Automatic modeling of biological system, Similar reactions happen for similar reasons. For example, the repression of pTetR promoter by TetR dimer can happen on many different DNA molecules with pTetR, regardless of what other biobricks is constructed on the DNA. With this thought, we add the part of Substituent , which can replace inactive parts of Species in Reactions , making it more general, and actually turning it into a reaction template. Having substituent, a pTetR TetR binding reaction is re-interpreted as the binding reaction of ANY DNA with pTetR(Figure 2) with ANY protein with TetR-dimer binding site. Modeling with templates allows us to describe reactions of new complex even without rewrite the reactions and"

2nd Place:
One of TJU_China’s gels really messed with our eyes. Their team leader said he tried to tweak a protocol to get better product outcome.  He upped the amount of plasmid and he upped the amount of restriction enzyme (4 µL).  As you can see, the resulting gel has a super blurry band. If you stare at it long enough, it looks like it is vibrating!

Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner:
Looking at Stony Brook’s gel will definitely make most people say “WUT”. This was their team’s first time using Diamond Dye,  since they grew wary of ethidium bromide (Jarek understands). They left their gel running for an hour,  but their gel fell apart before they could even soak it in the new Diamond Dye. Fighting through the tears,   they went ahead and soaked it anyway. When they went to view it on the UV imager, the gel shattered again!   Our heart goes out to Stony Brook for staying strong through tough lab times.

UNebraska-Lincoln’s Survey
Who doesn’t like an old-fashioned survey? We were able to get 43 responses from other iGEM teams.  The results gave our team an idea on how the current iGEM community feels about invasive species and GMOs.  The graphs can be fun to look at, however no significant conclusion can be made from this small and diverse sample size.  We still encourage you to interpret some of the data for yourselves!

Missouri Rolla
Early in the summer, we were happy to learn another iGEM team was working to stop the spread of Emerald Ash Borers.   We were fortunate enough to eat with Ryan Baumann, Rolla’s lab daddy, at Noodles and Company in Lincoln.   At Noodles, we had fun getting to know each other and talking about our projects and possible collaborations.   We had lots of ideas such as hosting a seminar or educational video together (which is still a future possibility).   We ended up deciding to create an informational brochure together that we will hand out at the Giant Jamboree.   Our goal is to spread awareness, to both foreign and domestic teams, about the EAB and its detrimental impact on North America.

Project Motivation
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Without it, there'd be far too much time spent just on merging in changes from other programmers and far too little time spent actually coding. It's reasonable that an analogy exists in synthetic biology, where complicated structures are modified with the utmost of detail. But because most synthetic biologists work on relatively small logical functions in comparison to the hulking data structures programmers wield, introducing a version control system seemed like overkill. With today's exponentially-increasing complexity of synthetic life, though, it will soon be a grave mistake to not use some sort of change-tracking tool; biologists will soon get caught up in the same logical complexity that plagues professional programmers. Especially as synthetic biology grows as a field, with increasing support from government and enterprise, more people will get involved in these projects and an inability to effectively collaborate could hamper the entire industry.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Existing methods of tracking gene changes don't scale well, and don't incorporate the power of the version control tools programmers are used to. While programming version control tools could be used to cover DNA data, they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. Darwin is a way around that. It's built off of version control tools, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it manipulates the DNA data to optimize for these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system. Darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," In addition to these modifications, we also transformed the two strains with LITMUS28i-I716104.
Biofilm assays were carried according to a modified protocol detailed by O’Toole 2011 (13). First, cultures of JM109, JM109 LITMUS28i-I716104, JM109 LITMUS28i-I716104-merRNA, ZK1056, ZK1056 LITMUS28i-I716104, ZK1056 LITMUS28i-I716104-merRNA were grown up overnight at 37°C in an orbital bath shaker in LB media, or LB media with ampicillin to maintain the plasmid. The cultures were then taken out of the incubator and diluted 1:100 in the fresh, original media. They were left sitting on the bench for 30 minutes after which 250uL were dispensed into untreated 96-well polystyrene plates. Each of these plates was covered with a plastic lid. Plates were then wrapped with a moist Kim Wipe. The plate was then placed in a pipette tip box such that it sat on the grating while the bottom of the box held about a centimeter of water. By slightly closing the lid, the box remains humidified and media do not evaporate. The boxes were then placed on a shelf in a static incubator and held there for twenty-four hours at a given temperature. To process the plates, bacteria were shaken out of them and the plates were rinsed in a reverse osmosis (RO) water bath three times. Each well was then stained with 275uL of 0.1% crystal violet for 30 minutes. At the end of this time the crystal violet stain was shaken out and the plates were rinsed in a RO water baths until the water was clear. Plates were left to dry overnight, after which the stain was solubilized with 300uL 80% ethanol/20% acetone, 250uL of which was then transferred to another plate in order to obtain a readout at 550nm.

Expectations
Because the merRNA was thought to sequester c-di-GMP and consequently prevent bacteria from entering into a persistent biofilm state, fewer bacteria were expected to adhere to the sides and bottom of the well plate. It was anticipated that bacteria expressing the merRNA would remain in suspension and therefore be rinsed off prior to staining with crystal violet. Those without the merRNA would adhere to the well and to each much"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

BNDS_China,2017,Team:BNDS China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," After each lecture, we provided a Q&A section, helping club members better understand these concepts.
After our club members had enough background knowledge, we arranged lab courses in both our high school and Peking University for them to practice basic experiments.
The establishment of the iGEM club enables us to learn about synthetic biology in a constructive and supportive environment. Moreover, we were also impressed by questions asked by our team members, since these questions demonstrate not only understanding, but also application of knowledge. These questions forced us to review the mechanisms of molecular biology in more depth. And when teaching our club members about experimenting, we learned through their mistakes, often points that we forgot to point out, which strengthen our experimentation skills.
Street Science
In order to spread the idea of synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we held a street science exhibition at school during lunchtime on October 19th. We performed the DNA extraction from fruits with two steps: polarizing and extracting. Strawberries, salts, and detergents were prepared for the exhibition as raw materials of the experiment. In the first step, we mixed salts, ground strawberry jam, detergents, and water to differentiate nonpolar substance from cells. We put the mixture in water bath 60° Celsius, for 15 minutes to speed up the reaction. Then we put the final DNA solution into a beaker and poured the same amount of alcohol into the beaker. Feather-like substance sank down to the bottom of the beaker in a process known as ethanol precipitation.

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to be especially helpful. Hearing this, the Human Practices team brainstormed initiatives that we could attempt to inform both the public and frontline staff on antimicrobial stewardship. We considered flyers such as the ones developed by Dr. Main’s team to be one of the most viable options for the resources that we had available.
Dr. Marc Ouellette
— CIHR III Scientific Director; Canada Research Chair in Antimicrobial Resistance
In Canada, CIHR (or Canadian Institutes of Health Research) is the main funding agency for health research. We were able to have a discussion with the Scientific Director of CIHR’s Institute of Infection and Immunity, Dr. Marc Ouellette. Dr. Ouellette’s extensive research on antimicrobial resistance, as well as his extensive oversight of the scientific community and research surrounding this topic, made him ideal for synthesizing the knowledge we gained and showing us where to go next.
During the meeting, several key themes emerged. Firstly, Dr. Ouellette’s insights on the gaps for detection assays reverberated with previous researchers’ statements: cost and rapidity were at the crux of the issue. Although there was a multitude of current diagnostic assays in the field of AMR, it was a necessity to make those technologies more affordable, so that more healthcare centres could have access to them, and more rapid. Specifically, if an assay could not determine an answer “within 30, 40 minutes, then it’s useless in that it has the same base as classic microbiology tests. The decision has been taken, the patient has moved on.” However, he also saw that “...adding a rapid diagnostic for general bacterial infection would have a huge impact. This is the quest to everyone involved in diagnostics: to distinguish between a bacteria and a virus. Right now, looking at the RNA-seeking test, we can determine this, but it’s not cheap or rapid... This is where an assay like [iGEM McMaster’s] could come in and really advance molecular medicine.”
Taking a broader outlook on the issue, we learned that Canada invests approximately $20 million each year into the issue of AMR. With regards to C. difficile, there were no exact monetary figures, but this bacterial disease was also a recognized crisis in hospitals and long-term care facilities. As a complex global issue however, Dr. Ouellette shed light on the multi-national collaborations that were in place to tackle AMR’s three pillars: surveillance, stewardship, and innovation. Bringing up the severity and wide scope of the issue around the world, he said:

Problem, ob Brief oder Email:
Brief teuer aber man wirft ihn nicht so einfach weg
Email zu unpersönlich aber für die Firmen einfacher, da die Email einfach weitergeleitet werden kann
Einwurf von Sascha: Aus dem Brief ""Eine Gruppe von engagierten Studenten"" entfernen, da die Firmen sich denken könnten: ""Das geht eh schief, da verschwenden wir kein Geld"", ABER das ist nun mal das Prinzip und der Hauptgedanke vom iGEM (Kristian)
Grundidee von Stefan:
Liste mit Möglichen Sponsoren erstellen und an die ""Freiwilligen"" aufteilen, damit die potentiellen Sponsoren nicht doppelt oder dreifach angeschrieben werden.
Größe der Firma ist dabei eher unwichtig: kleine Firmen können nicht soviel Spenden, Größere mehr und eher Finanziell/Sachspenden.
Halbwegs sinnvolle Sponsoren sollen gefunden werden, jedoch können alle Firmen gefragt/angeschrieben werden, ""denn Geld stinkt nicht"". (Kristian)
Niklaas: Auch Botschaften (Konsulat in Bosten) können fördern - Beispiel der Kunststudenten, die Berlin in Bosten vorgestellt hat, und mit 500€ gefördert wurde.
DFG - Auf Antrag gibt es Förderung von Forschungsprojekten, jedoch dauert die offizielle Forschungsförderung etwa 5 Monate. Man kann jedoch veruschen die Stellen des DFG für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit anschreiben und, gut begründet das unser Projekt dort rein passt, Gelder beantragen/""gewinnen"".

Team Meeting
Nelly has finished the first part of the analytical model for the stratum corneum. She will continue working on the next two parts of the analytical model for the next week
Dave has been researching ways to manufacture to create the patch. For most industries including 3M they will only manufacture for large scale industry
As a result Dave is focussing on how to manufacture our patch ourselves or with some professors
Nelly will help out with Dave with this by researching into the adhesive and how to attach it
Both Nelly and David have contacted professors for help in manufacturing the patch. We have a meeting with Dr. UT next Thursday at 1:00 pm with David, Nelly and Tiff
If worse comes to worse and no one can help us, we are visiting the machine shop to see if anyone can help us
Christine and Tiff have finished their prototypes. Tiff has sent hers to get 3D printed and will hear back in a couple of business days about the progress
Christine and Tiff will start David’s assay next week and run triplicates throughout the week to see if the patch growth curves matches the ones under optimal conditions already done in the lab
Discussed with Nishi what needs to be done for mouse trials
There are three trials being run: 6 mice for a positive and negative control, 6 mice with patches with BBI dissolved in DMSO, and 6 mice with patches with cell culture
The patch is 1 cm X 1 cm X 0.2 cm
The patches need to be completed Monday prior the experiments begin the following Monday
Alina also messaged back Tiff to see how things were going
She will be escorting an astronaut from the Apollo 11 mission during a science fair and so we can send her questions we can ask the astronauts that will be there
Tiff will create a document for questions to send to Alina. Focus the questions on either radiation in space or their lifestyles in space
As well she said she will try to help us with our model. She said to message her as a group if we have questions about the diffusion model. Currently she is working on her own MATLAB project and she said could help us with this aspect specifically

As it can be seen that the positive result has failed(far left) not much can be inferred from the interaction of the two parts of OBP2A. However it looks like the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting. As this was a first attempt, subsequent assays will be performed in order to determine if in fact the two separated parts of OBP2A aren't interacting in vivo - like these results suggests.

It can also be inferred from this graph that the two parts of OBP2A don't seem to be interacting as it has a low millers activity when compared to the controls.

The graph seems to suggest that the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting in vivo. This can be inferred from the fact that the millers activity of the OBP2A sample lies lower than the negative controls from within the experiment. As a result of this information, one more assay will be prepared in which the two subunits will be switched with regards to the bacterial two hybrid vectors to eliminate any possibility of this being a factor effecting the interaction between the two subunits.

Since we were working on a project related to the fermentation and quality inspection process of yogurt, we already explored very much relevant knowledge. We were becoming increasingly clear to the gap between theory and actual practice. So we visited a dairy factory in order to know more about yogurt production.
During this visit, a guide showed us around the workplace and informed us the procedure of actual yogurt production. It was the first time for us to see the huge production equipment in person! Then, to achieve the primary goal of this visit, we consulted with a quality control inspector to learn about the main pathogens in yogurt and the current inspection procedure. We learned that a cup of eatable yogurt may contain certain amount of coliform bacteria, but must not have other common pathogens such as Salmonella or Bacillus. We also learned that coliform bacteria are the most common pathogens in yogurt. So in our subsequent experiments, we chose E. coli to validate the function of our device. Moreover, quality control inspectors utilized plate count to detect coliform bacteria in yogurt. Later on, we applied this method to our tests for the quality of yogurt under different storage conditions in our own experiments. Last but not least, we realized that the conventional detecting methods cannot be easily used in our daily life due to the complicated steps and demands of facilities. 
This visit had a great influence on us. We realized the urgent need for a handy method of detecting pathogens in yogurt and this promoted us to proceed with confidence. Certainly, we knew we still had a long way to go.        
                    
 
 
 
Conference
On August 13th, 2015, we attended the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) summit held by Peking University. We presented our project and shared our ideas and experience with other teams. They heard about our project and responded to our presentation with valuable feedback. Besides, the summit also gave us a great opportunity to learn from the excellent projects of others. The meet-up truly promoted communications among iGEMers. Here we express our sincere thanks to them!

Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating its effect on lung cancer cells (A549) by examining KRAS expression after transfection. The result confirmed that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA could effectively down-regulate KRAS transcription level and reduce its protein expression. Later, the EDU assay further ascertained the biological role of KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation suppression in vitro.
To perform in vivo validation, none-small cell cancer mouse model was established after implanting tumor in 40 mice by subcutaneous injection with A549-LUC cells. After a short-time treatment, tumors harvested from killed mice were measured, then protein and RNA extracted from these tissues were examined, results supporting that KRAS siRNA can efficiently suppress KRAS expression, inhibit cell proliferation and thus have its potential to be taken as a cancer treatment. Besides, endotoxin detecting validated that our drug system satisfies the safety requirement and won’t impact on biological activities. To be more meaningful, we purified the batch of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA for liquid fill, completing a full process including experiment design, compounds synthesis, effect test and drug production.

The Background
Evolution vs. Design
Evolution and design are two sides of the coin.
Until 150 years ago, people believed that we are designed and created by the God, a god, gods or other intelligent designer s. After Charles Darwin 's On the Origin of Species in 1859, more and more people began to realize that a god is not necessary. During the process of evolution, we can be created automatically, without any intelligence.
Design and engineering are processes with the need of knowledge. Before we can design a machine, we have to know everything about the possible parts. If any information is unknown, we have to learn it. If nobody knows it, we have to measure it by ourselves. If all the knowledge needed are too much, we have to collaborate with others. Computer-aided design have to be used to accomplish more complex tasks. Space shuttle and microprocessor are seen as the most complex systems engineered,"

This confirmed our earlier observations that the relation is not linear and that the derivative d arginine/d kf is high for low values of kf (0 - 0.01) and decreases towards zero for higher values of kf.
 
Figure 3. Max arginine amount as a function of argR degradation rate.
This model has shown us that fine control over the arginine concentration in e.coli is theoretically possible. Although the functional relationship between the concentration of arginine at steady state and the rate of argR degradation needs to be established, the results obtained using our model suggest that the arginine pathway may be a viable target for any future work exploring the link between the arginine pathway and ageing.

Answer: We have reviewed a group quantity control system of Imperial College of Science and Technology in 2016. We have made improvements in light of our own situation. Simply put, the concentration of signal substances controlled by the bacteria itself controls the opening and closing of the suicide system, thereby regulating the number of bacteria.
Quiz2：Your final product is a bacterial preparation. There are great potential threats to the environment. Have you thought about any suicide mechanism? We are doing a cold lethal system, and if you are interested we can cooperate.
Answer：Thank you very much for your proposal. We also checked the information and found the Blu-ray lethal system, etc., but I am still very happy to work with you. You can provide our plasmids. We can help you to characterize and provide relevant data.
Question from DLUT
Quiz1: As a system for detecting lactic acid, what are the advantages of your products with lactic acid detection products on the market?     Answer: Compared with the normal detection of lactic acid products, we have more use of biological related technologies. By referring to some of the design experience of the 2015-year team at the ETH Zurich, we used the group sensing system of E. coli and used fiber optic circuitry for detection,. It is low cost and ease of use.
Quiz2: How do you ensure that E. coli in your system does not pollute the fermentation industry?     Answer: We intend to paste our product into a portable device, and the part that touches the fermentation liquid is only the probe. The E. coli inside the unit does not pollute the fermentation broth.
Collaboration with SCAU-China

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#Economic potential analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," small and medium-size enterprises (SME’s). A start-up company                 often needs a significant better product to gain some market share in the                 medical device industry. Many of them choose to first enter a niche market to                 establish some early market share. Once they obtained a solid position in the                 industry, they can broaden their horizon by reaching out to new, unexplored                 markets.
Relevance of using traditional materials for bone implants
Traditionally orthopaedic devices have titanium alloys as the dominant material                 used in most artificial bone implants. However alternatives with new and better                 functions, lower failure rates and less resource demanding are finding their way to the industry. One                 of the most promising examples is tissue engineering where the cells from a                 patient or a donor are isolated. Thereafter, they are combined with                 biomaterials, grown in laboratories and then implanted into the patient. This approach is becoming more and more               a reality due to technological advancements. However there are some major concerns and drawbacks that prevent this technology to  really break through in the market for medical devices. The limited viable window from the point of extraction                 of cells to the reintroduction makes this technology less flexible. (9) The transportation of these cells to and from the laboratory is also a huge                 challenge. Besides, the storage of tissue engineered products (TEP) at a                 constant temperature of -32°C puts pressure on the cost-efficiency. (9) On top of that, TEP's in Europe suffered a lot under the                  the lack of regulation. They are beyond the medical device regulation and the                 pharmaceutical regulation. (9) This ambiguity concerning the regulation               in Europe leads to a strong delay in market introduction. At the moment there is no                 dominant supply model based on mass production due to capacity limitations. This                 prevents TEP’s from really breaking through and becoming the industrially                 standard technology. (9)
In the last decade, composite materials, polymers and ceramics steadily found                 their way to the medical device industry. This is mainly due to the lower                 failures rates, recalls and weight. Most materials also suffer from substantial wear effects.The particles that come loose during the process could possibly have a negative effect on the human health.    The trend to use more eco-friendly and less scarce materials which are produced in a sustainable way is pushing the need for new materials. With our Spot E.Shape project,                 we would like to take this to the next level by imitating the natural bone                 structure as much as possible through the use of micro-organisms.

Rationale behind improvement: We have improved this part by introducing a hexahistidine tag to it, this has proven to be the optimal length for purification. Adding the histidine tag creates the opportunity to use a simpler method of purification, as well as increase selectivity for the desired protein."
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," To serve our great interest in public engagement and education, we came up with the idea of hosting a panel discussion. The event was called ""Limits of Life” and aimed to tackle two essential aspects within the field of synthetic biology; the limits of scientist health & well-being, and the limits of biohacking. For this event, iGEM Lund was also involved in planning and executing the event. The event was a success, and it was able to captivate people from all educational backgrounds, even people who studied humanities. People left the event feeling more interested in the field of synthetic biology and what iGEM is. We had great contact with iGEM Uppsala during the summer, and we had two BBQs together during the summer, to get to know each other better.
iGEM USP-EEL-Brazil
In mid-September, iGEM USP-EEL-Brazil contacted us after reading our project description about degrading antibiotics in wastewater. Working with degradation of endocrine disrupters (EDCs) from water bodies using engineered laccases, USP EEL Brazil are relevant to our project in solving the growing environmental problems in wastewater. After our Skype meeting, we started a collaboration by exchanging the outcomes of our visits to different wastewater treatment plants in our own countries. With this knowledge, we were able to compare how the Nordic and South American regions treat their wastewater, and where they differ.
iGEM Warwick
At the beginning of September, we hosted a Skype call with iGEM Warwick whose interest lies in the detection of Legionella, detoxification of estrogen from water bodies and removal of lead from water with floating bioremediation bacteria. We talked about similarities and differences in our projects approaches. Besides sharing an interest in solving the rising problems in water purification, we noticed that our Human Practices outreach strategies focused on bringing the fun of synthetic biology to children. iGEM Warwick helped us to distribute our children’s book on several events in the UK. Furthermore, we created a "" Synbio for Kids Guide "" to give future iGEM teams a supportive booklet at hand, filled with tools and strategies in how to teach synthetic biology to children. Together, we hope to not only spread the word of synthetic biology to young future aspiring scientists but also joy through our iGEM meme collaboration. Recently we made a Facebook group open for Jamboree participants, a place to unleash our creativity and share our love for memes. This we believe will also give people the opportunity to meet before the Jamboree, and help us feel more relaxed during the competition.

Public Surveys
In order for us to assess the public perception of Synthetic Biology, we     decided to hand out surveys on regents street and oxford street and     collected the data. The results were somewhat surprising.
We found that although 78.6% of the 250 interviewed were aware of the term     antibiotic resistance, data unfortunately showed that only 35.9% of people     adhered to their recommended dose. Human error in terms of forgetfulness     seemed t be a major cause of people forgetting to finish off their course.

Analytica Fair Munich
The analytica fair in Munich was the perfect chance to establish contacts with companies for future sponsorings and collaborations. But we also took the chance to spread the popularity of iGEM among them. We exclusively received interest and positive feedback about our team and project.
HyperpodX, University of Oldenburg
Luckily, we were able to cooperate with many student organisations inside Germany and various countries within Europe which enabled us to further reach out with our ideas, ambitions and the spirit of iGEM in general. In a meeting with the Hyperloop pod competition team of the University of Oldenburg (HyperpodX) both sides learned a lot about how to organize work and communication inside larger student groups and enjoyed the mutual exchange about two projects from very different areas.
German and European Meet Up
During the German Meet Up in Marburg and the European Meet Up in Munich we had great fun in presenting our project to other iGEM teams, exchanging experiences associated with the progress of our work and listening to intriguing talks.
Meeting iGEM Würzburg
This year our team also had a special connection with another iGEM team: iGEM Würzburg. Two members of this teams, Vic and Annabel went to school together. Nowadays, Vic is a member of our team while Annabel is the initiator of the first iGEM team of Würzburg. Back in time at school they used to compete against each other with their skills and knowledge about biology - and this year they worked together as young scientists to make their footprint in synthetic biology together with their teams.   As Vic took part in iGEM last year Annabel came in touch with the synbio competition and was inspired by this great opportunity for challenges besides normal studying. So Annabel took the initiative and built the very first iGEM Team of Würzburg. They had mentoring during long skype calls - beginning with basic questions: What's needed for iGEM? How is a team structured? Due to the advice to go to fairs like the Analytica for fundraising it was possible for Annabel to establish a good and working team. On Meetups like the German and the European Meetup the teams got to know each other and talked about problems within the teams or how to set the focus during the projekt work. Since our team in Tuebingen already mastered many years of igem participation and already overcame various difficulties the team members provided Würzburg with many helpful advice.  It’s great to"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," would be a useful tool during busy periods. However she recommended the use of a window so the emptying of the pipette could be seen to prevent accidental redrawing of blood, and suggested a translucent casing in place of a red casing to better see blood through the window. She felt it was unclear how the components clicked together or whether the pipette should be separate or contained within the kit. General practitioner, Dr Ben Riley, liked the sealed kit for blood containment, small size for ease of packaging and transport and distinctive shape for ease of identification. He also suggest a target for the cost of the kit as £3, comparable to a one-use test diabetes strip. The insights from Sarah and Dr. Riley were hugely useful in assessing and refining the practicality of our diagnostic kit, consequently improving our applied design.
David Sprent, Juan Solano and  Alfons Van Woerkom
We received invaluable advice from David Sprent, an expert in International Supply Chain, and Juan Solano and Alfons Van Woerkom, representatives of the Global Fund, an international financing organisation which has worked to fund several large-scale projects in the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. They advised us on evaluating costs of manufacture, transport and taxation of a kit for end use by the Bolivian healthcare system. We found out about the concepts of financial and market analyses, which may provide recommendations to potential investors regarding a product's investment feasibility. Having spoken to them about the importance of providing well documented details of unit cost, their help was invaluable in cost analysis of our kit for the applied design section. They introduced us to the concept of market and financial analyses in order to outline opportunities for a new diagnostic to come to market and to optimise its implementation. Furthermore, they suggested further research into the regulatory framework of the country, which featured in our policy brief.
HeLEX and InSIS
We consulted with Dr Michael Morrison from HeLEX, which is the Centre for Health, Law and Emerging Technologies and specialises in investigating the relationships between law, ethics and practice in the area of emerging technologies in health. We also worked closely with Dr Louise Bezuidenhout and Dr Chris Goldsworthy at InSIS, the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society at the University of Oxford. InSIS researches and informs key contemporary and emerging issues and processes of social, scientific, and technological change. The insights from both HeLEX and InSIS were highly useful in evaluating the ethical and social issues related to our project, and heavily influenced our applied design.

I've known iGEM since my undergrad days, as a synthetic biology enthusiast with an inclination towards metabolic engineering, I always wanted to be a part of an iGEM team. As soon as I learnt about iGEM team at IIT Delhi, I decided to be part of it.
Responsibilities: Lab, strategy making for experimentation and execution, troubleshooting.
TEAM
Chandel Angad Singh
Fifth Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
The basic motivation for me be a part of iGEM is that here we can work the way we want. From designing the strategies to encountering every single problem which comes in our way, it's all us. We have the liberty to work on our own and that's the most important part of the team. The actors become famous by the movie they act in, while it’s the director who makes the movie famous! I am the director in this case.
Nikhil Patidar
Fourth year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Initially, I was involved in introducing new faces with lab basics and later on carried on with creative team as thought provider. Pioneered in conceptualizing the wiki, tour, poster, banner and presentation.
Arpit Dhupar
Mechanical E8ngineering Graduate, working in FITT.
I am highly passionate for clean energy solutions. This passion became the driving factor for getting involved with the project of Igem-Iitd.
I took the responsibility of designing and developing proof of concept prototype that could work in conjunction with bacteria designed by team and explore future possibilities of scaling up the model.

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we met many iGMEers cherishing the same ideals and following the same path and we still kept in touch. In the end, we got the feedback of “the most interesting reason for the failure of the experiment”.
5th CCiC
The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (2018 CCiC)  was one of them. This year, it was held by ShanghaiTech University in 8.28-31. We delivered a formal presentation and explaining our projects in front of other teams both on the stage and by the poster exhibition. Judges also provided us with ideas on the demonstration of our project. We also communicated with other teams, exchanged our ideas about projects and posters design, and helped other teams deal with bottlenecks. We had great fun in CCiC!

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#Networks_-_-_TEXT.html,", where teams significantly assisted other teams with their projects.
Ted Harrison Middle School
Ted Harrison Middle School is a middle school that started an iGEM project in the 2015 iGEM season. They collaborated with the University of Calgary as well as the University of Lethbridge. Even though they did receive aid (first year mentorship, wet lab training) that would qualify as significant enough to be collaboration, their collaborations were not counted because they were not a registered iGEM team - they did not appear on the Team List for 2015 or any other year (https://igem.org/Team_List?year=2015).
Sheffield 2014 & Chicago 2013
OLS Canmore, a high school in Alberta, collaborated with Team Sheffield and Team UChicago. These collaborations were an edge case because it was the 2014 Sheffield team and 2013 UChicago team that helped the 2015 OLS Canmore team. When asking for clarification from iGEM HQ, the Waterloo Policy and Practices team was referred to Kim de Mora, Ph.D., the Director of Development at the iGEM Foundation, who also coordinates the judging program. It was confirmed that as long as the collaboration is properly documented and proven to be a valid collaboration, it counts.
Macquarie_Australia
The iGEM teams representing University of Sydney, Linköping University, Birbeck University and Oxford University directly took part in an episode of the world’s first synthetic biology themed game show, “So You Think You Can Synthesise”. Given this unique and creative circumstance, it became difficult to judge whether this was justified as a human practices collaboration. But to abide by our true definition of a collaboration, this still falls under the category of surveys. For all intents and purposes, this is one team who creates a material or activity and other iGEM teams only participated. Since there was no reciprocative collaboration where a knowledge gap has been bridged between two or more teams, this cannot be classified as a valid collaboration.
Korea_U_Seoul
The University of Korea created a large survey that many teams or the general public eventually filled out to gather data with. The questions ranged from asking if others were aware about the concept of synthetic biology, to other questions based on open science. Although other teams did reciprocate these surveys that gave information to help the University of Korea with further research, there was no exchange of ideas in lab work, mathematical modelling or policy and practice work that helped both teams grow and learn.

Afterwards, 750 μl Buffer PE were added, incubated for 2-3 minutes and centrifuged for 1 min at 3800 x g (6000 rpm). Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. The column was centrifuged for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) to remove residual buffer. Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 μl water (55°C) was added to the center. After 1 minute incubation the sample was centrifuged for 1 minute at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The 1.5 ml tube now contained the eluted and purified DNA.
Purification of PCR products
To purify PCR products the QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) was used. Therefore, all solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Five volumes of buffer PB were added to 1 volume of the PCR reaction before mixing. Since no changes in color were observed the pH was not adjusted. A QIAquick column was put into a vacuum manifold and the sample was decanted to it for binding the DNA. Vacuum was applied until all liquid residues were drawn through the column. Afterwards 750 μl buffer PE were added to wash the column and vacuum applied. Te remove residual wash buffer the QIAquick column was put into the provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20 ml water (55°C) were added to the center to elute the DNA. After 1 minute incubation the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute. The microcentrifuge tube now contained the eluted DNA.
For small amounts of DNA PCR products (cleanup of up to 5 μg PCR product (70 bp to 4 kb)) the MinElute® PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All steps were conducted and solutions prepared as specified in the protocol. Five volumes of buffer PB were added to 1 volume of the PCR reaction and mixed. Since no changes in color were observed the pH was not adjusted. A MinElute column was put into a vacuum manifold"

Dr Nicholas Coleman
PRIMARY INVESTIGATOR
Nick Coleman is a microbiologist with an interest in environmental microbiology and biotechnology. He completed a PhD at the University of Sydney studying explosives-degrading bacteria, and in his work as a postdoc at Tyndall Airforce Base in Florida, USA he isolated the first and currently only bacterium able to grow on dichloroethene as a carbon source. He then returned to Sydney to study mobile genetic elements in Pseudomonas stutzeri, leading to a new method for quantifying integron activity, and now runs his own lab in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences.
Nick’s research spans across metagenomics, microbial ecology and diversity, and agricultural microbiology, but is focused on molecular genetic analysis of bacteria capable of degrading pollutants, and the role of mobile genetic elements in bacterial adaptation to hostile environments. He has lectured to students across many degree programs and co-ordinated courses and practical classes for multiple microbiology units. His work has been supported by ARC Discovery grants, a NSW Environmental Trust Grant, and collaborations with industry partners such as Orica.
Nick helped us design the sequence for Winsulin, and developed our insulin expression system as well as instigating the project. The amount of work Nick did for this project cannot be quantified. From troubleshooting endless gels, digestions, ligations, transformations, PCRs, more gels, protein extractions, inductions, purifications, and even more gels, to replying to our many panicked emails about upcoming events and looming deadlines, to giving us the space to work in his lab and organising a great deal of our outreach events, Nick has given so much to our project and we absolutely could not have done it without him.

We completed the purification in early 1962, obtaining about 5 mg of the lightemitting principle. The substance was found to be a protein with a molecular weight about 20,000, and it emitted light when a trace of Ca2+ was added-whether in the presence or absence of oxygen, to our astonishment. We named the protein “aequorin” after the genus name of the jellyfish. Aequorin is an extraordinary protein containing a large amount of energy that can be released when calcium is added; thus it resembles a charged battery that releases the energy when short-circuited. The system was so unusual that some biochemistry professors expressed their skepticism. After 30 years of discovery, however, the importance of aequorin and its use as a calcium probe are firmly established in biochemistry and physiology. The word “aequorin” now can be found in various common dictionaries.

We decided to form a collaboration with Imperial College (Here is a link to their wiki)
They were concerned with waste, especially plastic waste.  One of their projects was using Proteinase K, a peptidase from proteinase K family, to degrade PLA.  Therefore, since our project was creating E. coli that synthesize PLA, the collaboration was perfect.
Our plan is use our extracted PLA from our E. coli, and use the Imperial's teams E. coli to degrade it.

Cost Analysis of the consumables required for detector construction.
In order to make the detector, a variety of reagents are needed and the protocols and experiments validating their use can be seen in  the relevant sections. Our team decided to do a cost analysis on what was required in preparing the detectors used  by our team throughout the summer and the cost of making the detectors sent to  TCD and UCL in our collaboration. We felt it important to address the economics of making our prototype detector as this is a major factor in deciding whether or not the technology could be used on a large scale.  The costs were broken down into the cost per detector and cost per detector reaction. Each detector contains 50 uL where 1 uL can be used for each diagnosis. As you can see below, the cost per diagnosis of the pathogens like HPV and TB is very low. Although it is hard to find reliable data of how much a single diagnosis costs due to the large amount of variables
Cost Analysis of the consumables required for detector construction
Testing of the kit
The kit was sent out to the TCD & UCL iGEM teams so that they could test the detector system.  The results showed that the detector worked when shipped to another lab and that the results could be replicated in different locations. The only consumables required for the clinic or hospital setting are LB agar plates with the correct antibiotic and petri dishes. This allows for a very cheap diagnosis of pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If the lab has an incubator, results could be seen overnight, for those labs without an incubator, results can be seen in perhaps 2-3 days which should be sufficient time for E. Coli to grow at room temperature.
The results show what our team would have expected to occur, the detector reaction where the correct target i.e nucleotide that is fully complementary to exposed single stranded detector region of the detector plasmid hybridises and anneals on. This plasmid is then transformed and recircularized in E. coli and the subsequent colonies grow.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test bild_-_-_TEXT.html," coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy
Requirements
Our bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The first stage of worm culturing.
2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
Transcriptomics
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!                                       As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Figure 3: Flowchart representing the trancsriptomics outline.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind"

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"x, Y \sim N(0,\frac{1}{X})$$ Where $X$ is the frequency of not extreme mutation and $Y$ is the percentage of the protein structure change resulted from the mutation, which is related to production rate.
As for the production,there are many variables which have impacts on the original production, such as the quantity of E.coli, the rate of E.coli, the conversion rate of psicose and the total amount of substrate which determines the scale of the production system. The original production rate is as follows
$$\frac{\text{d}oriPrd}{\text{d}t}=N\alpha C_{sub}$$ Where $oriPrd$ is the original production of the psicose production system, $N$ is the number of E.coli in the system, $\alpha$ is the conversion rate for D-psicose 3-epimerase, $C_{sub}$ is the concentration of substrate, which represents the concentration of fructose in our production system for psicose.
As for the of E.coli, we use Logistic equation to describe the process of E.coli proliferating. $$\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t}=r_1N(1-\frac{N}{r_2})$$
Meanwhile, the concentration of substrate is changing during the process of fermentation in our psicose-production system. We assume the concentration of substrate changes little and can be processed as a constant in order to simplify our process and to find out the discipline of production change, as well as simulating our system in directed evolution method. The concentration of substrate is as follows: $$C_{sub}\approx C_{sub}(t_0)=constant$$  In this way, we can get the original production of psicose from the very beginning. The original production of psicose can be calculated as a constant as below  $$oriPrd=\lim_{t_0\rightarrow 0}\int_0^{t_0}\alpha N(t)C_{sub}(t)dt$$  Finally, based on the probability distribution function, the variation of production is defined and we can compare the psicose production in natural system and directed evolution system.

Official Mentoring Program Cooperation with Team Munich
The German Meetup in Marburg was the initial chance for us to meet many other iGEM teams from all over Germany. We received a lot of helpful advice regarding team structuring and organisation and became interested in the official mentoring program. Later at the European Meetup in Munich we finally initiated a mentoring cooperation with team Munich and together we are now taking part in the official mentoring program. As a very successful and well-established team they are the right contact persons to help us with different problems that need to be solved during the process of evolving our project. Our team on the other hand, recently funded and full of iGEM youngsters, we can ask them everything about team organisation, sponsoring or iGEM deadlines quickly receiving helpful answers. Read our monthly mentoring reports for further Details.

Mentoring report August JMU_Wuerzburg
Our mentoring partner from Munich always supported us concerning various tasks and provided us with help whenever necessary. At first, they helped us with working out regulations for our team to ensure that every team member is properly working on the project. Furthermore, Team Munich supported us with our InterLab Study by sending us their remaining silica beads for the experiment and answering all our remaining questions. They also advised us for the track selection, when we were not sure if we had to choose the track “diagnostic” or “open”. To help us improve our sponsoring outreach, they sent us their sponsoring brochure as an example for us to create our own. With the help of their guideline we improved the design of our brochure. We hope that this helps us getting more recognition from sponsors for our project. In addition, they gave us hints, how to reach out to more sponsors. Furthermore, Team Munich helped us with the wiki. We followed their idea of a premature wiki freeze to increase the amount of contents in our wiki.
Mentoring report September JMU_Wuerzburg
September was a busy month for us and we had to meet some crucial deadlines: During our regular skype conference Team Munich provided us with useful information about the wiki the Giant Jamboree and the design of the BioBricks"

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Dental hygiene_-_-_TEXT.html," existing examples of lantibiotic resistance compared with antibiotics and only one mechanism of resistance to mutacin III, known as CprRK in Clostridium difficile, has been established (13). Moreover, the fact that a closely related lantibiotic nisin has been shown to exhibit low in vivo toxicity levels (14) and has been widely used as food preservative from as early as mid 1940s (15) further encourages the prospect of considering the employment of mutacin III as an anti-cariogenic agent.
Fig. 3. Simplified representation of the application of the mutacin III biosynthetic device in replacement therapy
LanA
In addition to the proposed device, we created a separate Registry entry for lanA recognized as synonymous (identical in sequence) to mutA (4). It is a structural gene for mutacin 1140 identified in Streptococcus mutans JH1140. LanA is a propeptide gene which could be used as the first step towards the assembly of an alternative bacteriocin-producing device.
GFP Test Device for Spy Promoter
The oral cavity is inhabited by a wide range of interacting communities of metabolically and structurally organized microorganisms which synthesize an extracellular polysaccharide matrix (EPS) enabling them to adhere to the surface of the teeth and assemble in matrix-embedded biofilms. Progressing biofilm accumulation puts the bacteria under increasing metabolic stress which leads to localized metabolite and acid accumulation and a shift in the dynamic homeostasis towards acid-tolerating species such as Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans (3). A resultant decrease in pH causes tooth demineralization and constitutes a mechanism of dental caries.
We decided to target pH and an indicator of deteriorating oral health and use it as an system to regulate the relate of antimicrobial peptide known as mutacin III, is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental caries, e.g. other strains of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces naeslundii, while Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to inhibition (5).
An existing BioBrick in the iGEM registry ( BBa_K239001 ), designed to detect misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or shear stress has been further characterised to demonstrate the BioBrick functions as a pH inverter.
Compared to the control, as pH increases from 3.97 to 6.78, GFP expression gradually increases for E. coliwith BBa_K239009 . The maximum GFP expression is observed at 6."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

IGEM 2015 Project Description.
The 2014 WashU iGEM team successfully transferred the nif cluster from Cyanothece 51142 to E. coli. However, the nitrogenase activity they measured was minimal. Therefore, the WashU/Penn State 2015 team dedicated itself to increasing the nitrogenase activity of last year’s E. coli strain by knocking down and overexpressing certain genes on the nif-containing plasmid. Additionally, we are using genome-scale metabolic modeling to guide potential genetic interventions and facilitate nitrogen fixation in E. coli. We are performing a systematic analysis of metabolites and genes in our model to optimize nitrogenase activity.
A few weeks into our work, a member of our lab had trouble repeating the 2014 results and we began to consider the notion that E. coli may be incompatible with components of the plasmid—whose parts come directly from Cyanothece 51142—at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. After an evaluation of our remaining time and resources, we decided to construct a more minimal nif cluster for E. coli in order to reduce the effects of any native regulation present in the original plasmid we used. We plan to continue our analysis of the nif cluster using overexpression, knockdown, and metabolic engineering.
Our team is part of a larger project that is seeking to confer nitrogen fixation capabilities to a non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis pp. 6803. Synechocystis is evolutionarily related by the endosymbiotic theory to plant chloroplasts, so a nitrogen-fixing Synechocystis could be used as a model to engineer plants that fix their own nitrogen. We hope that the results of this year’s iGEM team will be useful to the researchers working on The Nitrogen Project since E. coli is a well-characterized, fast-growing model organism.

The detected gas content proves the correctness of the literature data.According to the proportion of gases in the exhaust gas in the literature.We conducted the simulation in the laboratory.A proportionate gas is manually mixed and passed through water to prepare an unsaturated solution. Depending on the time of access, the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution is continuously tested and used as a source of data for our mathematical modeling.
First of all.By using MATLAB to conduct the correlation analysis of the experimental data,we found that the color readings (five dimensions: B, G, R, H, S) showed a certain linear correlation with the concentration of carbon dioxide.This conclusion is consistent with the literature [1],which obtains its conclusion by using lambert-beer's absorption law. That is, there is a certain relationship between the substance concentration and the color reading. Secondly, using the multiple regression of statistics to carry out regression analysis on the data, the relationship between the material concentration and the color reading (five-dimensional) is obtained, and the appropriate mathematical expression (or mathematical model) between them is determined as the empirical formula or Regression equation.
A mathematical model for determining color readings and carbon dioxide concentration - a linear regression equation. Firstly, a linear regression model between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading is established. The residual of the model is large and the fitting effect is not good.
Considering establishing a nonlinear quadratic regression model.Using the rstool function modeling in the MATLAB statistical toolbox, and evaluating the pros and cons of the model by residual standard deviation and residual. In the final nonlinear quadratic regression model, the residual standard deviation is small, the prediction model is very good, and the residual of the model is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the multiple linear regression model. Therefore, the linear quadratic regression model is better than the linear regression model. The comparison of the errors of the two models shows that the nonlinear regression quadratic equation has higher precision.
Model establishment and solution:
According to the previous analysis.Firstly, we established a linear regression model,which is consistent with the problem.by using the experimental data (ie, Table 1) and linear regression with matlab, we obtain a linear regression equation between"

Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CIlam)2, (tetR)2 and (lacI)4. The internal binding strength of (tetR)2 dimer and (CIlam)2 dimer are stronger than that of (lacI)4 tetramer. more details
Modeling Details of Repressilator
Modeling Details of Repressilator
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
