Policy & Practice
We have planned and carried out many activities related to synthetic biology and our projects throughout this competition. The ultimate goal for our team is to promote synthetic biology as well as this competition, iGEM, to the public.
The power of innovation and advance in technology have become one of the most important indicator of the development of a society. Even though Hong Kong is one of the fastest growing city in the world and very well-known as the “trade centre” of Asia, much of the development of this city relates to aspects of financial industry. In Hong Kong, innovation technology and scientific research attract much less public attention than financial industry and are frequently over-looked. In recent year, there has been much controversy on whether to establish an Innovation and Technology Bureau. Its establishment is believed to be able to facilitate and support the growth of innovation and information technology industry in Hong Kong which includes technologies related to renewable energy, waste management, as well as research and development in Chinese medicine. However, the legislative council have not yet approved the budget to develop this bureau due to many reasons. Therefore, there is still no end as to when science and technology can be better focused and to become more well-known and valued among the general public in Hong Kong.
By conducting several surveys and activities, we hope to have a better understanding of current public opinion and attitude towards life sciences and particularly synthetic biology, and to raise certain awareness of the importance of supporting basic scientific research in local community.
The followings are high-lights of the activities conducted by our team to promote synthetic biology as well as our project.
1. Local questionnaire
Report of questionnaire
In order to have a better understanding of the public opinion, we think the best method to collect data massively is to distribute questionnaire to people from different backgrounds. We examined the respondents’ attitudes toward life science and synthetic biology for two months starting from early June this year. Among total 206 responses were received, most of the respondents expresses that synthetic biology is quite uncommon among the public. Not only does our data reflect this conclusion, but the immediate response we received from the people whom we have approached and invited to complete the questionnaire. Most people refused to participate, some due"

June 21th
Yes, Sunday in Cory Hall...I have some further reading about the current version of Java RMI in Java 6. To set up the server-client, we need an interface that extends from java.rmi.remote, using in both server&client programs. A *simple* way I'm doing now is code the interface in my plug in package in Clotho, then I use jar command line to generate a jar file that have packagename.interfacename class file. I copy this jar file to the lib folder of my kepler actor and do an ""include packagename.*;"" in my actor code, so it can use this interface as well. An improvement from previous version of RMI is that I don't need to pregenerate stub file of my server implementation anymore, and it will be downloaded from my server in runtime, so if I don't change my interface, I can modify my Clotho server and not recopy to kepler source.
I made a simple server Clotho plug-in to use with my simple Kepler actor-client, and it seems to work well. The next step will be coding the remote methods so it can call Clotho tools, and I have the 1st version of Clotho-connection actor. It feel so good to see ""Hello from Clotho"" popped up in Kepler display after this whole weekend.
day.  -- Thien.nguyen 02:09, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
Week 4
We decided that I will spend time working on the new Clotho Core and making some functional API for Clotho sothat Clotho can communicate with Kepler.
Week 5
I continue to work on the new Clotho Core. With the new Clotho, there will be only one collection of plug-ins/tools derived from ClothoTool class. We will use the PluginManager to instantiate all the tools at run time, so everything will be a plug in in the new Clotho. We plan to have a simple working core by next Monday. I also talk with the wet team and we have some workflows, which non-Clotho actors. We look at BioJava with is a large computational package for bio, we will design some use for this package in the future.
Week 6
We have a basic working Core now, using PluginManager to instantiate ClothoTools packages at runtime."
Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," reduction may occur by direct contact between cell surface and substrate or may be mediated by Flavins[2] to reduce substrate far from the cell surface. Riboflavins can mediate such indirect reduction of the substrate because of their conjugated double-bonded structures, allowing the small energy transitions carried by the electrons. Additionally, its large polar tail confers its significant solubility within the external medium to shuttle electrons to distant substrates.
Aside from its extensive electron transport pathways, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is particularly useful to our project from a microbial fuel cell perspective because of its ability to produce biofilms that facilitate close contact between the bacteria and the cell electrode. These biofilms are formed by an interconnected network of a type IV pili from the cell membrane that adheres to the solid substrate. The pili are conductive and function as nanowires that aid in the direct reduction of the substrate[3]. It is, however, worth noting that more robust biofilm formation occurs in anaerobic and low-nutrient conditions. This was an important factor to consider while designing our microbial fuel cell as we had to decide the nutrient concentration of the culture medium for optimal cell growth and biofilm formation while maintaining an oxygen-free environment.
Figure 2 MFC design
Having gone through many prototypes, we designed our own microbial fuel cell taking inspiration from those of past iGEM teams such as the 2013 Bielefeld team[4]. We decided to employ 3D-printing as a fast and low-cost method to produce our own prototypes.  For the body, we chose ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) because it could not be degraded by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, while is known to be non-toxic. In our experimental set-up, as shown in figure 3, the anode compartment housed the culture medium containing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain in anaerobic conditions. To achieve such an anaerobic environment, we initially considered flooding the chamber with inert nitrogen gas but later decided to use an anaerobic chamber due to limitations our lab faced with the usage of nitrogen gas. For the anode material, we decided to use carbon cloth as it has a high effective surface area and provides a suitable surface for the bacteria to tether onto and initiate biofilm formation. Meanwhile, the cathode compartment was aerobic in nature with Ferricyanide as the terminal electron acceptor and PBS buffer to maintain the pH constantly at 7 throughout the cell’s operation. We needed a proton-selective membrane to separate"

EtnR2
BBa_K1996000 to BBa_K1996002 These three parts were obtained from the ethylene metabolism operon in Mycobacterium NBB4, as they were suspected to function together to regulate the expression of genes responsible for ethylene oxidation. EtnR2 (BBa_K1996002) is thought to bind to ethylene and phosphorylate EtnR1 (BBa_K1996001), which binds to EtnP (BBa_K1996000) and activates bidirectional transcription, resulting in the expression of ethylene degradation genes.
EtnR1 has been shown to bind to EtnP through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay , demonstrating its function as a DNA-binding protein. The characterisation of EtnR2 as an ethylene receptor, and the binding of EtnR1 and EtnR2 is still underway.

amilCP Green
BBa_K1996003 to BBa_K1996005 Each part is an improvement on the basic amilCP part submitted by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011 (BBa_K592009). Each part contains the coding regions of different coloured mutant amilCP chromoproteins, created by error-prone PCR. BBa_K1996003 is the pink mutant chromoprotein, BBa_K1996004 is the purple mutant chromoprotein and BBa_K1996005 is the green mutant chromoprotein. Colour can be readily observed by the naked eye following growth in liquid media or on agar plates for 1-3 days, rendering the parts useful as reporter genes.
Figure 1:  Purple, pink and green mutants compared to the wild type. Protein was extracted from 50mL of culture by bead beating and resuspended in 0.5mL TE buffer.
Maximum absorbance for the purple mutant was at 579nm (Figure 2), indicating that it had been shifted slightly compared to the wild type’s maximum at 589nm. The absorbance maximums for the pink and green mutants are also shifted, to 576nm and 609nm respectively (Figure 2).

This page demonstrates the activity and function of our control constructs, K2268003 and K2268004, by measuring LacZ activity. Overall, our constructs appear to respond to light as intended - although the addition of an supplementary repressor in K2268004 does not seem to have lead to a greater degree of control on over our designed kill-switch.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html," We already discussed that the chance of percolation increases very sharply above a certain \( \ p \). However, we are not only interested in the chance of percolation but also in the conductance of the network. Unfortunately, this does not scale linearly with the chance of percolation, see figure 2.
Figure 2: Top: A resistor network where each square can be occupied (black squares) or empty (white squares). The grid is connected by two electrodes. Bottom: A qualitative figure where the dashed line represents the chance of percolation. The solid line represents the conductance between the two electrodes. [3]
We can intuitively understand the qualitative result from figure 2. The formula for the conductance \(\ \sigma \) in \(\ \Omega ^{-1} \) of a resistor of length \(\ l \) in \(\ m \) with cross section area \(\ A \) in \(\ m^2 \) and electrical resistivity \(\ \rho \) in \(\ \Omega m \) is \(\ \sigma = \frac{A}{l \rho} \). When there is percolation just above that certain \(\ p \) where the chance of percolation increases very sharply, chances are that the path between the two opposite electrodes is very long, thus the path has a low \(\ \sigma \). When the chance \( \ p \) is increased further, more paths are created (larger \(A \) ) and the paths will also be shorter (shorter \(\ l \) ), hence the conductance increases drastically (exponentially according to [3]). We expect similar behavior for the conductance of our system in the conductive curli module.
Graph Theory
Graph theory is the study of graphs. A graph is made up of vertices and edges and is a representation of a set of objects where some objects are connected by links [5]. The set of objects are represented by the vertices and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are represented by the edges.
Edges may be directed or undirected, which will result in directed or undirected graphs, respectively. If an edge is undirected, it means that when it connects say vertex 1 to vertex 2, it also connects vertex 2 to vertex 1. However, if an edge is directed, it means that when it connects vertex 1 to vertex 2, it does not mean that vertex 2 is necessarily also connected to vertex 1.
Also, edges may have a certain weight, which results in a weighted"

Aspartate concentration detected by E. coli
Over ~5 orders of magnitude, 10nM up to 10mM. Can detect changes of as little as ~0.1%
N/A
E. coli detect small changes in concentration of 0.1% via temporal comparisons (4s) over a large range ( 10-8 to 10-3 ). Most computer simulations of chemotaxis are based on experimentally determined rates and concentrations. As a result they predict that the minimum detectable concentration of Aspartate is at ~200 nM. Experiments performed by Segall et al. in 1986, exposed tethered E. coli cells to iontophoretically delivered quantities of chemoattractant. These experiments indicated that a change in receptor occupancy of as little as 1/600 could produce an detectable change in swimming behaviour. With a Kd of 1 µM, this corresponds to a minimum detectable concentration of about 2 nM Aspartate. Wild type E. coli cells can detect <10nM of Asp and respond to Asp concentrations of upto 1mM,(responding to over ~5 orders of magnitude). M)
Competitive and Cooperative Interactions in Receptor Signalling Complexes
Temporal comparison of chemotactic gradient
4 seconds
N/A
The past second has positive weighting, the previous 3 seconds have negative weighting. E coli compares past and present concentrations by comparing the average occupancy of the receptors over the 4s. Models reflecting this system have been developed by Segall et al and Schnitzer, cells compare their average receptor occupancy between 4 and 1 s ago  c1-4 to the average receptor occupancy during the last second  c0-1 . Hence b= c0-1 -  c1-4 .   If b>0, the cell reduces the tumbling rate to Ttumbling from the ambient value T0 , 1s-1 e.g. b>0 don't tumble. b< 0, tumble at a rate of 1s-1

Checking the electro-competent cells I made the week before. I electroporated my electro-competent cells with a pUC19 vector to measure their transformation frequency but I hardly obtained any colonies. Being suspicious that the pUC19 preparation may be bad, I repeated the transformation with a more recent preparation of pBluescript SK(+). I obtained approximately 107 transformants/g for the three strains. This is an acceptable frequency for MC4100 and LT2, but we need a really high transformation frequency (over 109 transformants/g) in order to perform cloning experiments with DH5α-λpir. We decided to prepare a new batch of DH5α-λpir electro-competent cells.
The mini-Tn7 was designed with a Gm resistance cassette flanked by selected restriction sites to facilitate exchange for other resistance cassettes. To construct mini-Tn7 variants with different markers, I designed primers to amplify kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance cassettes from the vectors pSB4K5 and pSB1C3. Also, I did mini-preps of these vectors.
Another thing we would like to do with the mini-Tn7 is to generate a handful of functionally useful mini-Tn7 vectors. The idea is to insert into the BioBrick cloning site of the mini-Tn7 useful BioBricks, like reporters for gene expression measurement, inducible promoters and constitutively expressed fluorescent and bioluminiscent labels. We selected the following BioBricks:
Promoter measurement cassettes: BBa_K093005 (RBS+mRFP1), BBa_I732094 (LacZα+GFP-AAV).
Inducible promoters: BBa_I0500 (pBad/araC), BBa_I732083 (pLacIQ+RBS+tetR+STOP+ptetR).
Strain labels: BBa_I13521 (ptet+mRFP), BBa_K325909 (pBad+Lux).
This week I transformed these BioBricks in DH5α and prepared the corresponding plasmids.
In order to test the site-specific insertion of the mini-Tn7 transposons in our strains, I designed primers to amplify from the Tn7R end to the glmS gene. I took this opportunity to train my self in doing sequence comparison and analysis using common tools such as Clustal and Blast. I searched for a conserved motif to make one primer suitable for all four bacterial strains, but"

Conclusion
We found the ethical matrix very useful to highlight the pros and cons of our project. It clearly showed that using the Cerberus technology have to be a progress for both the end-users, the manufacturer and the environment. Safety will be a definitive go/no go. Assessment of non-toxicity and environmental friendliness will be top priorities before Cerberus hit the market.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS
In the scope of the Cerberus Project, we created surveys and interviews to know what people think about biotechnologies and synthetic biology, and their perception about using products issued from such fields. However, we very soon found out that each iGEMer from our team had a different perception of biotechnologies and beyond of iGEM and their expectations from the competition after these months of working on the project.
Here you can find these individual thoughts and their synthesis.
SYNTHESIS
Why did you take part to iGEM?
Many reasons led us to the extraordinary adventure that is iGEM. Firstly, we were all interested in biology and more precisely in synthetic biologies that we chose to study at the University or the INSA school. iGEM was for us an opportunity to make a step in our future and develop our first team project as we hope to do later as researchers. What an adventure to make! Some of us were also implicated because of the extreme diversity of the project and its openness on the world.
What was your responsability during this project?
We separated our project in different part such as business, human practices, or modelling. Each member of our team was accountable for one aspect of Cerberus. You can find in the individual files what each of us have done and what we prefer in our “task”.
What did you learn from this experience?
We all learned a lot about building a scientific project from scratch to its valorization. We started this project as student, some of us had never even done an internship. It allowed us to encompass the full aspects of how to create a little business. Moreover, being a part of a team during nearly one year was not easy everyday, so we had to learn how to work together, how to support each other when stuff gets hectic. With iGEM, we also discovered domains that we never thought about like finances, collaborations with teams from all over the world, communication with the public or even teaching in"

UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO
University of Waterloo was founded in 1957 and has grown to accommodate 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students, and has become Canada’s leading university in comprehensive learning. Also, the university has consistently been voted as the most innovative, most likely to produce the leaders of tomorrow, and best overall University in Canada for over 18 years (according to Maclean’s Magazine). Waterloo’s reputation is however based on its excellent and pioneering co-op program which offers students a balance of work and school on a per term basis, making it a unique learning experience. The city of Waterloo has recognized University of Waterloo and its students, by meeting its demands in terms of funding and involvement. The University has also opened up two new campuses; the pharmacy building, and the joint McMaster medical building in Kitchener, as well as the architecture building in Cambridge, contributing to not only the city of waterloo but the whole Grand River area.
WATERLOO - KITCHENER COMMUNITY
City of Waterloo mainly revolves around the two universities: University of Waterloo and Laurier University. Waterloo is surrounded by Kitchener and thus, the two cities are known as the twin cities, also referred to as Kitchener - Waterloo. The population of the city of Waterloo is always fluctuating due to temporary residents at Waterloo’s two universities. Total population in 2009 was recorded to be 121, 700; approximately 20,000 of which were temporary post-secondary students. Due to its small size, people in the past have tried to merge the two cities together but have been unsuccessful. As of today, both cities have their own identity and their own separate city governments.

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#CTCD#Content#Humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html," of living modified organisms into the environment. “Type 1 Use” means use which is not subject to taking measures similar to “Type 2 Use.” When we use E. coli, which collect objective biomarkers or toxic substances and release profitable substances, under natural environment, our experiments are categorized “Type 1 Use.”
When we make, import, and/or create Type 1 Use of Living Modified Organisms, we must stipulate regulations concerning usage which is based on the evaluation criteria about potential adverse effects on biological diversity provided by the competent minister. We also must obtain the approval of the competent minister. The evaluation criteria are close to the risk appraisal. The criteria also consider host’s properties including distribution, usage history, and competitiveness. In the case that iGEM members create Living Modified Organisms and plan to conduct field tests, we need consider these criteria. After the approval, usage in conformity with the regulations can be restricted only in order to prevent potential adverse effects on biological diversity. If new findings after the approval suggest adverse effects on biological diversity are suggested, experimenters need not take the responsibility. However, if they do not obey the restrictions, they will be imposed a penalty including imprisonment.
In Type 2 Use, if containment measures are prescribed, experimenters must obey them during the period of use. If containment measures are not prescribed, we need the competent minister confirming them. The containment measures are related to the biosafety guidelines. When we use BioBrick, we follow the BSL according to its sequence and host.
There are various penalties and seems a unique Act concerning Living Modified Organisms. The Act restricts a wide range of act and is grounds to punish for not following the biosafety guidelines. However, the object of penalty is involved with misconduct including false application. Penalties are difficult to happen as far as we naturally act as a scientist. It is much more instructive for us to understand what regulations justify Living Modified Organisms than what penalties are.<P>

NortheasternU-Boston,2017,Team:NortheasternU-Boston#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," of three main systems :
“The problems begin at the point of purchase,” says Kebba Jobarteh. The vast majority of pharmaceuticals in the Mozambican health system are purchased from India, where there is variable quality control and reliability. They are transported on boats, where storage conditions are also known to be variable, which can damage the product. When they arrive in Mozambique, they are stored in a centralized warehouse in the capital Maputo. Notably, there is no facility for testing the quality of the imported products.
From the central warehouse, the products are transported to the district level in refrigerated trucks, which offers another opportunity for spoilage ; many biologics, such as vaccines, have strict storage requirements, and can spoil if frozen ( http://www.who.int/immunization/documents/IIP2015_Module2.pdf ). “We had to teach healthcare workers that the vaccines should not come in contact with the cold packs, in order to avoid freezing and spoiling them,” describes Ms. Bechtel. Village Reach also worked to improve awareness of simple tests for whether or not the vaccines had frozen beyond the point of safety, such as the shake test. If a vial has frozen and thawed, shaking the vial will show the solution is cloudy, and that the vial is unfit for use.
From the district level, samples are once again transported by truck to individual facilities, which are fraught with their own set of cold-chain, logistical, and training problems
Facility-level Storage and Administration
As imperfect as the logistic system is, many problems arise only once biologics have reached facility-level. Storage conditions at the level of the individual clinic vary enormously, from facilities with good electrical and refrigeration infrastructure to more remote clinics with only unreliable solar or generator power.
A lack of training and information exacerbate these problems at the facility level. Undertrained and overworked staff often miss small details that can impact the effectiveness of a medication. One common issue that Village Reach found was that staff were leaving medication out of refrigeration for too long, resulting in spoiling.
At-Home Storage
Beyond even the “last mile” of biologic delivery and storage, a final hurdle exists between having a medication in hand and treating a patient. When a patient is prescribed a regular medication or treatment regimen, often they are given the medicine to take home, store, and use as directed. However, this raises two more problems : inadequate cold storage and inadequate instructions for administration.
This poses a troubling ethical question for clinicians and medical professionals in the field: Should they prescribe or dispense medication if they think or"

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Education_-_-_TEXT.html,", BioWatcher is designed to output autonomous bioluminescence signal. The system can be altered into therapeutic application when the bioluminescence signal is changed into drug delivery. With boundless creativeness, the application diversity of this system is limitless.
2.    Is the design of BioWatcher better than the current blood test?
Yes! Current blood test is the most direct approach for everyone to learn about his/her bodily health. However, it’s rarely performed due to its several drawbacks, invasiveness, time-consuming procedure and the fact that it can only be carried out with the help of medical professions. Although new smart wearable devices attempt to deal with these problems by offering noninvasive measurement and instant report, what the trackers can tell the users, such as heart rate, steps taken and calories burned, are not direct and useful indicators for early-stage diagnosis.
BioWatcher aims to overcome the disadvantages of both blood test and current smart wearables and combine the advantages of both:  using noninvasive measurement wearables providing instant report to directly assessing disease indicators.
3.    Are we sure that this system can be used in humans?
Not until the experiment can successfully prove feasibility will we be able to give a confirmed answer. However, even at the worst scenario--failing to apply this system in humans-- this design can be widely apply on other experiment animal model. BioWatcher is going to be a great help to scientists and bring them immense convenience and efficiency in lab.
We are very grateful for all the questions asked that once again examine and improve BioWatcher.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects, and present and share their projects with all the other teams. Besides the fun experience, the presentations and synthetic biology discussions with the other teams inspired us to engage in several collaborations. We hope that the rest of the attending teams were also equally inspired to collaborate with each other!
TU Delft iGEM 2017 is happy to have collaborated with the teams of Munich , Wageningen UR , NTHU Taiwan and Hamburg as well as have contributed to the surveys of UNebraska-Lincoln , NTHU Taiwan and BU-Hardware .
NTHU Taiwan
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted in a biosensor device, in this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) on-site in sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan. However, after a closer study of our vesicles' BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points (such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles) that made us aware of  the weaknesses of our approach for packing Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to their integration in our project.
However, the collaboration changed its direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation of their plasmids.
Figure 1: Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the issue and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and  achieve transformations with higher yields.
Finally, NTHU communicated TU Delft the accomplishment of their transformation! We wish all the best to our fellow iGEMers of NTHU Taiwan and look forward to meeting them at the Giant Jamboree!

The discussion was finalized with the introduction of many recommendations for the continuation of the Initiative Biotechnology 2020+. Afterwards, an exhibition of the research projects of all present research societies took place.
For us, the most important event of the conference was the presentation of the projects of all iGEM Teams in Germany for the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) in 2013. It was great to meet members of the other german iGEM teams, to exchange ideas and to discuss questions. Taken together, a nice point to start networking!

TU_Delft,2010,Team:TU Delft#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," Oil Spill, 1979, 138 million gallons (4)). Besides, regular industrial activity also causes oil pollution that needs to be taken care of. Considering the size of these operations into account, one can imagine the need for effective and large-scale remediation technologies.
In the iGEM competition bioremediation is also a popular topic. Many students believe that engineered organisms might be the solution to many types of pollution. For instance 2009 finalist Team Groningen designed bacteria able to scavenge heavy metals (5).
Current Methods
Several strategies have been developed to clean up oil spills (Table 1), although all methods suffer from drawbacks such as high costs, slow progression and high environmental impact. Sometimes a trade-off must be made between the damages caused by the oil spill itself and the damages inflected by the clean up method. The problem with the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is that these (long-term) effects are unknown.
All the same, the trade off can also be economically. The total clean-up costs of the BP oil spill already exceed 3 billion USD and are expected to accumulate to over 20 billion USD (6). So on this scale a method that is slightly cheaper, already saves a lot of money.
Method
Description
Natural Recovery
No action is taken. Oil is left to degrade naturally.
Sorbents
Removal of surface oil by oil-attracting material placed in the water.
Booms/Barriers
Contains floating oil until it can be removed.
Skimming
Use of draglines and dredges to mechanically remove oil from the surface.
Dispersants
Surfactants that break the slick into small particles that mix with water.
Solidifiers
Polymerization of oil both floating and stranded.
Vacuum
Suction of the free oil from the water.
Our solution (strategy)
In order to solve the problem of oil in water, as seen in the Oil Sands tailing waters, the iGEM TU Delft 2010 team has designed a strategy composed of various parts. Each part focuses on a certain challenge faced when removing hydrocarbons from aqueous environments. Together, these subparts form a complete chassis for a hydrocarbon-degrading microorganism. Our general strategy is to create BioBricks® that will facilitate each sub-part of our project within E.coli. This will be done by taking specific genes from various organisms from nature and placing them in a BioBrick®, after which there functioning can be evaluated within E.coli.
Part I – Alkane Degradation
First and foremost the organism"

Our Future Aspect:
In our early rough drafts’ of our project we focused on PET degredation until Catechol but when we obtained  that Catechol can not use in biological pathways as biproduct, we decided to focus on PET degredation until pyruvate which is a substance that can be used by organisms directly in their metabolic pathways. We knew from our researchs of past iGEM projects, there are some great projects about generating electric from E. coli and some other microorganisms by MFC. MFC (Microbial Fuel Cell) can be utilized for electric generation through the conversion of organic and inorganic substrates by microorganisms.  We read wiki sites of some iGEM teams ,especially Bielefeld 2013 and TU Darmstadt, which was about generating electricity through MFC.  We know that through the reactions of PET degradation until pyruvate, after pyruvate metabolism there is overproduction of H ions and we think that excessive H ions can generate potential difference which can be further used for electric generation.  Can you imagine we can live in such a world, while generating electricity it destroys all plastic wastes!

SVCE_CHENNAI,2017,Team:SVCE CHENNAI#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," biology have sometimes only imparted an abstract overview of the subject we wanted to go a step beyond where an individual who did not know much in Biology learnt a lot about synthetic biology.
For this we designed a biohackathon – a hackathon where students had to build a tool that incorporated synthetic biology in some way. A fornight prior to the hackathon we began a rigorous two-week workshop for computer science students and taught them the basics of synthetic biology and molecular biology. The first week we focused on teaching them the basics of molecular biology such as the basics of DNA, transcription, translation and operon theory. The second week we taught them the basics of synthetic biology such as the biobrick standard, 3A assembly, the role of fluorescent proteins and how synthetic biology is the driving force of standardization in Biology.
A total of 7 teams participated in the 48 hour biohackathon, where the first two teams were given certificates and a cash price. The top two teams built two really good tools. The team from IIT Madras won the first place for building a software based on codon optimization for biobrick assembly and the second place was won by a team from the computer science department from SVCE who created a game based on biobrick assembly.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"Association Respire
RESPIRE, National Association for the Preservation and Improvement of Air Quality, is an association of citizens, founded in February 2011, dedicated to the improvement of air quality. Specialized in understanding the issues related to air pollution in France and Europe, be they political, economic, social and health related. It builds on existing scientific and public data as well as regulations to inform, communicate, develop technical tools and build advocacy. The 31st of July, we met Sébastien Vray, the president of this association to discuss our project and better understand the issues of air pollution in France.
French Ministry of Environment
On August 8th, 2017, we met Mr. Hubert Holin, in charge of air quality at the Ministry of the Environment. We introduced him to iGEM, our project, and the application scenario we envisioned. M. Holin agreed with our idea of ​​targeting indoor pollution. Indeed, he explained that when cleaning the outside air, it is better to fight the sources than to find a solution downstream. He also described the energy autonomy of our product as a great advantage for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is a real interest and advantage for the general public and that there is a concrete solution to the problem of indoor air pollution. By mapping the pollutants, we could also sound the alarm. Finally, Mr. Holin gave us valuable advice on how we could get funding for our project.
Airparif
AIRPARIF is an organization responsible for monitoring the air quality in the Paris agglomeration. On August 11th, we met with Thomas Alcaraz, engineer at Airparif, who offered us the opportunity to become a member of the Airlab, a broad ecosystem with a network of actors in the fight against air pollution. It pushes the structures of Ile-de-France and develops employment and the economy around the fight against pollution.

Week 6: June 2 - 6
This week we requested parts specific to B. subtilis through the iGEM registry, as they were absent on the 2013 and 2014 plates we already had in our possession. Meanwhile, we performed plasmid mini-preps and confirmation digests, also designing primers for lacA, thrC, and amyE. Doing this was necessary because the necessary B. subtilis integration vectors were unavailable on current distribution plates.We then decided to submit these sequences to the iGEM registry for the benefit of future teams who may want to use them.
We dedicated an entire day to primer design and uploaded our newly developed primer sequences to Benchling, an online, cloud-based sequencing tool. Benchling was especially useful for our purposes as it allowed the easy sharing of numerous sequences amongst the whole team sans the hassle of word processors and e-mails. Due to Benchling’s numerous built-in features (e.g.the  displaying of enzyme cut sites, base pair tracking, automatic melting point calculations, illustrated sequence maps, etc.) productivity increased dramatically and a significant amount of time was saved during the designing of the primers. Once the necessary primers were designed, a request was sent out for them.
Colony PCRs were performed on the plasmids the Detective team had constructed thus far, but the colonies harbouring GFP and LacI ultimately failed. However, the failure of these colonies led us to the discovery that the plasmid containing LacI with a Chloramphenicol resistance grew better on Ampicillin agar plates. This strange phenomenon was explained by the hypothesis that ampicillin may have been more easily diffused by the bacteria.
Towards the latter half of the week , our Transformer team determined the components of the BioBrick we wished to construct. We decided to construct this BioBrick in order to gauge the transformation efficiency of B. subtilis and prepare ourselves for the insertion of the actual pathogen detection system in the coming weeks. It was crucial that we determine beforehand the loci into which we would insert our BioBrick. Simply put, our BioBrick was designed to “knock out” and replace the original gene within the receiving locus. This would mean that upon the successful insertion of our BioBrick, the bacteria would lose a certain inherent function, such as the metabolization of starch or the synthesis of threonine, at the cost of integrating our BioBrick. This “loss of function"

The polar characteristic of the amino acids gives it an amino acid profile that is comparable with human beta-defensin-like proteins, which are antimicrobial peptides implicated in the resistance of epithelial surfaces to microbial colonization.
PyocinS5 (BioBrick: K2018018 ) is produced by P. aeruginosa and elicit its effect against other strains of P. aeruginosa. S type Pycins is composed of an effector and an immunity component. The effector component is exerting a killing activity, which includes DNase activity. The effector component, which ranges from 498-776 amino acids, consists of three domains: a receptor binding domain, a translocation domain, which translocates it across the membrane, and a killing domain.  The immunity component ranges from 87–153 amino acids and gives the pyocinogenic strains immunity to their produced bacteriocins by production of immunity proteins, thus making the pyocinogenic strains insensitive to their own pyocins. Pyocin causes the cell membrane of target cells to be permeable and thereby causing leakage of intracellular materials, which cause cell death Ling, H., Saeidi, N., Haji Rasouliha, B., & Wook Chang, M. (2010). A predicted S-type pyocin shows a bactericidal activity against clinical P. aeruginosa isolates through membrane damage. FEBS Letters, 584, 3354–3358. .
Laterosporulin-ThuricinS (BioBrick: K2018008 ). From the bacteriocins Laterosporulin and ThuricinS we have designed another hybrid Laterosporulin-ThuricinS. No study have yet reported the effect of these bacteriocins as a hybrid and it is therefore still unknown whether these bacteriocins corporate and have synergistic effect or not.
LacticinQ-LacticinZ (BioBrick: K2018009 ). In our project we have designed a combination of bacteriocins, which is a hybrid made of LacticinQ and LacticinZ. LacticinZ has only three different amino acids from LacticinQ, and is similar in structure and activity. In our project we have found synergistic effects of the hybrids.

Wisconsin-Madison,2011,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#umad2_-_-_TEXT.html," and has since grown to over 130 teams in 2010 from all different countries around the globe. This year even more teams are anticipated, and there will be regional competitions held before the annual international jamboree held at MIT in the fall.
iGEM revolves around two main ideas: the use of BioBricks and the registry . Biobricks are pieces of DNA that have been given a similar structure and that code for something useful. They can be big or small and may contain one or many individual pieces of useful information all packaged into one coherent piece. These biobricks all contain the same interface and thus can be copied and pasted into new DNA with ease.
Each new part, once confirmed, is sent to MIT and physically stored there in the registry. Any other iGEM team can order any Biobrick from the Registry for use in their project, and get physical copies that are easily cultured and can be quickly used, without having to be manufactured by the teams. This open source structure speeds up the resarch progress significantly and makes great strides in the future of synthetic biology.

Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

Parts
For this year’s iGEM competition, our team has chosen two new parts to finish our project.
The first one is Nanobody with aldehyde-based precursor label, can be converted to fixed-point                 aldehyde-modified Nano (BBa_K2772000). It is anti-beta2 microglobulin nanobody with aldehyde-based                 precursor label, and it can be converted to fixed-point aldehyde-modified Nanobody by                 formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). It contains two sections: nanobody and ald tag, which is                 precursor                 of aldehyde label. Firstly it can cambein with beta2 microglobulin because of antigen-antibody                 interaction. Then its special label allow fixed point fixing or other fixed point decoration                 possible.
Another one is Formylglycine-generating enzyme(BBa_K2772018). FGE can specifically identify ald-Tag,                 which is consisted of 6 base pair or 13 base pair, then it oxidze sulfhydryl group of sulfhydryl group                 to aldehyde group. Conveniently, it can be used for in vivo catalysis of the substrate label of the                 precursor, i.e. higher conversion can be achieved without purification separation.

We used SPR (Surface plasmon resonance) to characterize Nanobodies.
First, we immobilized the antigen bound by our Nanobody on the SPR crystal. Then we configured different                 concentrations of Nanobody solutions (including blank solutions), and then, through a microflow system,                 a solution with nanobody is injected over the bait layer. As nanobody binds the antigen bound, an                 increase in SPR signal (expressed in response units, RU) is observed. After desired association time, a                 solution without nanobody (usually the buffer) is injected on the microfluidics that dissociates the                 bound complex between antigen bound and nanobody. Now as nanobody dissociates from the antigen bound, a                 decrease in SPR signal (expressed in resonance units, RU) is observed. From these association ('on                 rate', ka) and dissociation rates ('off rate', kd), the equilibrium dissociation constant ('binding                 constant', KD) can be calculated. The equilibrium dissociation constant"

The gate serves as a sensitivity tuner, allowing us to control on the timing of the measurement. When we want to start our measurement we just need to add IPTG to the bacteria solution.
The gate consists of the Plac promoter and the LuxR gene. When IPTG is added to a sample containing our bacteria, LuxR gene is transcribed. LuxR is a transcriptional activator that binds directly to the AHL molecules, so that a LuxR-AHL complex is formed.
And what happens in our system when the complex LuxR-AHL is formed?
Read the next sections about gates 3 to find out
Gate 3
Built alternative construct
Gate 3 enables us to see if our material of interest is present in a random sample by producing GFP and amplifying the signal.
This construct is the final part of our alpha system.
The promoter of the gate is the Plux promoter which undergoes activation when the complex LuxR-AHL binds to it. If the promoter is activated we get the production of a reporter gene (GFP) and the LuxI gene.
As we mentioned in the section on gate 1, LuxI transcription results in AHL molecules.
We experienced many difficulties in building this gate.  Therefore we built an alternative Gate 2-Gate 3 construct: Pcat_luxR_Plux_mCherry_luxI
In conclusion, the Alpha System is a 3 gate construct that produces GFP when a substance is detected and signals the other cells around it to produce GFP as well
Beta System
Beta System
According to the model ""Why it Should Fail"" of the Alpha System, we can see that it has some problems. We decided to test new methods to reduce the noise in our system. One idea was a new design – the Beta System, inspired by the noise reduction mechanism described by Goni-Moreno and Amos. (Goni-Moreno & Amos, 2012).  We used a double repression Toggle Switch similar to that described by Gardner et al. (Gardner, Cantor, & Collins, 2000)), to filter the inputs of our system. This makes the cell-to-cell communication more accurate, while affording them an internal memory capacity.
This system consists of three main circuits:
(1) The Computation Circuit (which acts as the CPU and determines whether or not to activate the Toggle Switch).
(2) A Toggle Switch (which acts as the internal memory bank, by keeping the system active or inactive over long periods of time).
(3) A Signal Circuit ("

Interactivity
It was important to us that the club was interactive and can be delivered by other schools in the future using the resources we created so for every session we created a Kahoot quiz which can be found by searching Kahoot for the username ‘BioBlast_Club’ and all the PowerPoints we used can be found on our <a href="" https://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/app/os#!igem/home "">website</a> as well as a more detailed description of what we did and how others can run this club.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborate_-_-_TEXT.html," on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Hamburg
iGEM Hamburg is another team whose project’s goal is the fight against antimicrobial resistance, on their case, by developing novel antibiotic compounds capable of dealing with multiresistant bacteria.
It all started with a series of preliminary conversations prompted by the common goal of our projects and the presence of a former student from Hamburg in our team. During the poster presentation held at our European Meet-up, both of our teams had the chance to get to know each other better and become more familiar with the science to our projects. Ideas ranging from stabilizing the siderophores in Hamburg’s antibiotic with our TDPs, to detecting a carbapenem-resistant strain with our device and eliminating it with Hamburg’s antibiotic turned into proposals.
Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned could be carried out due to time constraints and the prerequisite of our projects being in a stage as advanced as to enable the collaborations. Many thanks to iGEM Hamburg for traveling all the way from Hamburg to our European Meet-up to share their interesting ideas to make this world a better place!

Synthetic biology: concerns and issues
What is synthetic biology?  How different is it from recombinant technology? Can it already be safely implemented? And if not, which extra precautions have to be taken into account? In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. Furthermore, our attempt will provoke ethical questions and questions about issues of human practice.
Defining Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is one of the most audacious and controversial scientific ideas of the twenty-first century. The rise of synthetic biology brought a whole shift within the biological sciences. Scientists no longer confine themselves to the reading of DNA, but instead start to create new artificial DNA-codes. Tom Knight, research scientist at MIT, describes this difference as following.
A biologist goes into the lab, studies a system and finds that it is far more complex than anyone suspected. He’s delighted, he can spend a lot of time exploring that complexity and writing papers about it. An engineer goes into the lab and makes the same finding. His response is: “How can I get rid of this?” (1).
In “Leven Maken, Maatschappelijke reflectie op de opkomst van synthetische biologie” (2),the approaches towards synthetic biology are divided into two broad classes. On the one"

Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," the parts necessary to build our reporter system (i.e., the genetic circuit). Although we were busy in the lab this week, we also kept the community outreach portion of our project in mind and began preparations for our next event; painting with fluorescent bacteria.
Week 9: June 23-27
We continued with the restriction digests of our integration vectors from last week, digesting the thrC, amyE, and sacA vectors with the ScaI enzyme. After running a gel, we luckily saw the proper bands in the right places. However, we also noticed a single band around the 800 bp range, and after contacting iGEM HQ, we concluded that it must have been the RFP generator. We decided to contact the LMU team to discuss our findings. Following the restriction digests, we proceeded to cut two of the vectors with BsaI since the ScaI enzyme cut out the bla gene.
Figure 1: ScaI was used to linearize the thrC, sac A and Amy E vectors. An unexpected 1000 bp product was present in all of the samples. Amresco 1000Kb ladder was used inorder to determine the size of the bands.
The team met one of it’s largest project goals this week, having finally transformed supercompetent B. subtilis with a plasmid we designed.. Unfortunately, our first set of transformations failed and we witnessed a “lawn” of bacteria on our plates. After reviewing various papers, we realized that our antibiotic plates only had a chloramphenicol concentration of 5mg/L, when the optimal concentration was actually 100mg/L (of?) and 5mg/L of chloramphenicol. We also suspected our antibiotics to be defective, but nonetheless decided to attempt a second set of transformations on 30mg/L chloramphenicol plates.
We successfully transformed B. subtilis with select vectors (we observed red colonies, which means that the vectors integrated since it includes RFP in its backbone).
Figure 2: B. subtilis was transformed with the thrC vector, the sac A vector and the amyE vector. All three of these vectors carry the RFP cassette.
Week 10: June 30 - July 4
This week we attempted to optimize our B. subtilis transformations by using fresh B. subtilis cells containing the comK gene in lieu of frozen samples. Unfortunately, working with fresh B. subtilis cells resulted in no viable transformants. Last week we were able to successfully transform frozen B. subtilis cells with all"

3) We switched to a stronger promoter: pTet
We hypothesized that stronger pTet promoter would increase suppression of 5mer, allowing increased transcription of RFP. This has been supported with our data.
We will compare successful frame shift suppression with pBad promoter and pTet promoter driving tRNA production. pTet appears better than pBad.
4) Testing of second generation constructs
Is there a difference in frame shift suppression if the promoter+tRNA construct is upstream or downstream of the 5mer-RFP reporter? Yes, promoter and tRNA downstream gives stronger suppression, probably because we do not have a TT after the RFP and so the tRNA can be transcribed from both promoters.
Compare pTet and pBad promoters for frame shift suppressor phenotypes. The pTet promoter gives a better suppression phenotype.

External analysis
Opportunities
:
There is a high demand for frontline diagnostics.
The market is predicted to grow (see market analysis).
Cas13a is currently discovered and has a great potential to be a key player in rapid genetic material detection. Cas13a requires a techique to optimise the visible output
Threats
:
CINDY Seq is versatile and can be applied broadly. However, the versatility of the tool can be a bottleneck for finding a niche and outcompete more specific and specialized frontline diagnostic tools.
Lack of optimized techniques on which CINDY Seq relies will stop the development of the CINDY Seq.
Cas13a is patent-pending and therefore the owners of the Cas13a patent have time to develop their own on site detection methods that integrate with Cas13a.
CINDY Seq is open source due to the iGEM competition and therefore, easy to copy.
Figure 1: Outcome of our SWOT analysis.
Our patenting process
What is a patent?
A patent is a set of exclusive rights to inventors of a non-obvious solution to a technical problem. Once a patent is granted, the holder has the exclusive rights to the commercial benefits of the invention. For our novel detection method CINDY Seq, we filed a patent application with the Netherlands patent office (Octrooicentrum Nederland, Den Haag). The idea came up in one of our weekly meetings, in which we discussed weekly updates and thought about better ways for a readout of our Cas13a  detection assay. Clearly the interdisciplinarity of our team was an asset here. We speculated about the feasibility of using a phase transition as readout, and from that moment on it went pretty quick. We first tested the principle by showing that a non-specific RNase (RNase A) would redissolve RNA/spermine coacervates. This was indeed the case as we describe on the results page , and we speculated that the RNase A could be interchanged by activated Cas13a. Later in the project, we also successfully did this, giving a full proof of principle of CINDY Seq.
When could we file a patent?
Although in principle it is possible to file patent applications for an idea on itself, we were advised by patent attorneys to give a proof of principle before filing. In the following we would like to share some of our experiences how we got to this point. The entire process was accompanied by our supervisor Louis Reese, patent officers from TU Delft, and patent attorneys (from NLO). In"

Also, one of the constructs with promoter pbad is an inducible promoter. Therefore, this construct must be induced with arabinose so it can express the colors, green, red, and in my case yellow. We attempted to induce this promoter by a concentration of arabinose of 50 uM.Unfortunately this did not cause the cell culture to glow.
Once the plasmids checked out, it was decided to restriction map all of the constructs just to verify the correct parts were ligated. The construct, pbad_YFPc and pcat_YFPc had a single cut and double cut to check the insert and the whole plasmid size. BBa_I14033_BBa_E0240 (pcat_GFPc) was also cut twice to check the various sizes. The products of the restrcition digest was run on a gel.
This is a figure of a gel with multiple cut construct samples.

It seems that a double cut was not made.) 13-15: BBa_I14033_BBa_E0240 (pcat_GFPc) uncut, cut, double cut (These bands also seem wrong according to the DNA ladder. The bands for the double cut seem too high)
Week 9: 7/30-8/5
Since the sample construct of pcat_YFPc seemed to not work on the gel or cut correctly. I thought the sample might not have been ligated correctly and contain the restriction site needed. Another restriction digest reaction was made of a double and single cut of the construct, Pcat_YFPc from a different colony. This reaction sample was also ran on a gel.

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," be more effective (possibly because of the destabilization of the mRNA secondary structure around the site). An arginine at position one of the binding site supposedly binds to a different protein of the RISC complex [Bartel, 2009], thus increasing the binding site efficiency significantly.
Binding sites at the end or the beginning of the 3'UTR are more efficient. Binding sites within the first 15 nucleotides after the stop codon are not effective, since this region of the mRNA is inside the ribosome when translations stops. Thus a bound RISC complex in this region will dissociate after every round of translation and can not follow it's usual mode of action [Grimson et al., 2007].
Tissue specific miRNAs
A useful supplement to achieving tuned gene expression in cells is the ability to specifically target tissues where this should be carried out. Tissue targeting has, for quite some time, been an important field of research that has drawn much attention and is central to gene therapy. miBEAT tool not only allows generation of binding sites that regulate the level of expression of a desired gene, but also  employs strategies that help target the right tissue and exclude expression in others. This functionality is based on the principle of using tissue specific miRNA binding sites which can be introduced in the miTuner construct easily.
A smart way to specifically target tissues is to exploit the presence and absence of tissue specific endogenous miRNA in the target to specifically express or exclude expression of the gene of interest in the target. We make use of two of strategies based on this principle, namely, on-targeting and off-targeting. The off-targeting concept has been applied previously (Wenfang Shi et.al., 2008) wherein an endogenous miRNA is selected such that it is not present in the target tissue (therefore the gene is expressed) and is present in all the off target tissues (knockdown of the transcripts). Thus the gene is specifically expressed in the target.
In addition to the off-targeting strategy, we designed a new strategy, the on-targeting. In this case, the miRNA is present in the target tissue and excluded from the off-targets. The binding site for this miRNA is present within the 3'UTR of a repressor gene (in our case TET/O2) construct. The operator for the repressor in turn precedes the gene of interest (miGene) in the miTuner or miMeasure constructs. Therefore in the presence of miRNA in the cell, repressor is degraded and miGene is expressed while"

Yes, we had discussed our project with NYMU Center of Environmental Protection and Safety and Health. We have changed our project experiment from in vivo to in vitro after this review. Because we cannot ensure the exact effects once the Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 is transferred into the human brain before we have done the in vitro experiment properly.
c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.
Yes, we have biosafety and lab training before doing our project. We watched some video of lab safety and finished online bio-lab safety training of the following links

• http://www.sciencebyjones.com/lab_safety_quiz.htm
• http://www.edquest.ca/component/content/article/110
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?  If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
Yes, our country has national biosafety regulations and guidelines.

4. OPTIONAL QUESTION:  Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or security issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
We might need to label the genes extracted from those pathogenic bacteria and those genes should not be put in biobricks which will be sent to all registered team. The platform of those ""special"" biobricks should be established. To whom want to apply those genes should do some forms about the project design, how to use those parts, how do they handle the probable safety issues and so on. Once"

Knocking out PDH and PFL
J_exp4
Lastly, Laura was working on finding an alternate path in the model that produced acetyl­coA. However, the only reactions listed involve the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl­coA. We are interested in determining which reactions can be potentially knocked out of the model to maximum the production of acetyl­coA. Tom wanted me to run gams files that removed the PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and PFL (pyruvate formate lyase) reactions from the model, which are directly involved in the production of acetyl­coA, to determine if whether or not knocking one out will maximum flux through pyruvate synthase (POR5), which is the only other reaction involved in the production of acetyl­coA. However, our findings show that knocking either PDH or PFL from the model has no effect on the flux through this reaction, or on one another. Considering the flux ranges remained the same (0 ­ 10,000) for the PDH and PFL reactions, these reactions can potentially be removed from the model. When both PDH and PFL were both knocked from the model, the flux ranges varied slightly through the pyruvate synthase reaction­ from ­9,948.9478 ­ 444.251305 (for the lower and upper bounds respectively) to ­4068.693 ­ 444.251.

4. Let the newly poured gel sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified.
if  you are in a hurry the gel can also be set more quickly if you place the gel tray at 4 °C  earlier so that it is already cold when the gel is poured into it.
5. Loading Samples and Running an Agarose Gel
1. Add loading buffer to each of your digest samples.
Note: Loading buffer serves two purposes: 1) it provides a visible dye that helps with gel  loading and will also allows you to gauge how far the gel has run while you are running  your gel; and 2) it contains a high percentage of glycerol, so it increases the density of your  DNA sample causing it settle to the bottom of the gel well, instead of diffusing in the buffer.
2. Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit).
3. Fill gel box with 1xTAE (or TBE) until the gel is covered.
4.  Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel.
Note: When loading the sample in the well, maintain positive pressure on the sample to prevent  bubbles or buffer from entering the tip. Place the very top of the tip of the pipette into the buffer just above the well. Very slowly and steadily, push the sample out and watch as the sample fills the well. After all of the sample is unloaded, push the pipettor to the second stop and carefully raising the  pipette straight out of the buffer.
5.  Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel.
6.  Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80 % of the way down the gel.
Note:  Black is negative, red is positive. (The DNA is negatively charged and will run towards the  positive electrode.)  Always Run to Red.
Note:  A typical run time is about 1-1.5 hours, depending on the gel concentration and voltage.
7.   Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully   remove  the gel from the gel box.
8. Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments.
Note: When using UV light, protect your skin by wearing safety goggles or a face shield, gloves  and a lab coat.
Note: If you will be purifying the DNA for later use, use long-wavelength"
ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the rather extensive experience in mammalian cell culture and bacterial-mammalian coculture our team had gathered in the course of our project. Since the team of Stockholm did not have the opportunity to test their system in such a real-life system, we decided to validate their system by combining their engineered E. coli cells with their actual targets: HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
Validation of ABBBA binding to cancer cells
We characterized the system of Stockholm regarding the binding of their bacteria to HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The affibody-based system explored by the Stockholm iGEM team is designed to make engineered E. coli cells bind to cancer cells expressing the targeted surface marker. In the tested case of HER2-positive breast cancer, the team came up with three chimeric receptors, targeting different epitopes of the HER2 extracellular domain. We tested the binding of ABBBA E. coli expressing the respective constructs to HER2+ SK-BR-3 cells.
For better observation of colocalization of the bacteria and the mammalian cells we tried to introduce a second plasmid carrying a constitutively expressed fluorophore into the bacterial strains that we received from Stockholm. Unfortunately, all attempts to this failed. As an alternative, we tried transforming the plasimds carrying their test constructs into E. coli expressing GFP from their genome. It seems that cells are not quite happy accepting the plasmids of interest, which was surprising since we never had any severe problems with our transformations. Nevertheless, we were determined to give our best in this cause and went on to characterize the interaction of bacteria and mammalian cells after aplying a spheroblast protocol (removing the outer membrane) and inducing the bacteria with IPTG for expression of the LacI-regulated constructs by microscopy. The spheroplast protocol is necessary since the affibody construct is localized in the inner membrane of E. coli and has to be revealed by removal of the outer membrane.
Results
Unfortunately, the lack of a way to clearly identify the ABBBA bacteria via a marker made it very hard to differentiate between bound bacteria and bumps in the surface of mammalian cells. We tried to visualize an interaction but we have to say that with the methods available to us non of our attempts yielded conclusive results.
Figure 1. We tested three different constructs for their binding to HER2-positive SK-BR-3 cells. The comparison of induced and non-induced spheroblasts did not yield conclusive results.

Overview
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development                of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated                that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted                by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic                biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols.                The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest                contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by the 2015 Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they                would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that                they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 4.0                is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more                repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe                this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a                broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 4.0 works to establish                such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a                repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally,                ProtoCat 4.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by                allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
ProtoCat 4.0
ProtoCat 4.0 is optimized for collaboration among users and offers the best user experience we have developed. Features like Protometrics, visual protocol history and protocol favoring each help achieve the best version of a protocol. ProtoCat 4.0 now provides quantitative metrics and a visual representation of branch history in order to provide researchers with feedback and allow users to easily locate versions of protocols. Users can also favorite protocols they like to identify the best ones and quickly relocate them.
The user experience is another aspect that has been improved in ProtoCat 4.0. We've added features such as threaded comments, notifications, group accounts and a new chat system called ProtoChat in this year’s version of ProtoCat."

The enzyme produced by this gene is required to regenerate the FMNH2 consumed by the reactions carried out by DszA and DszC. Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 is the most studied model organism in investigations of the 4S pathway, and has been shown in many different research endeavors to be capable of converting DBT to 2-HBP.

An alternative to the DszD gene is HpaC, an oxidoreductase encoded in the E. coli W genome. This enzyme has been shown to increase the rate of desulfurization by x amount find citation Following this, other protocols added to our growing lab methods 'toolkit' were a restriction digest protocol, PCR purification, and finally, DNA construction digest. Aims moving forward include obtaining strains of the R. erythropolis , while also executing a timeline devised to biobrick, test, and incorporate the genes necessary in the above processes in a biobrick circuit.

Decarboxylation
This week, a gel was prepared for the colony PCR prepared last week, and the gel was run, yielding results that were very difficult to see. The PCR and gel electrophoresis process were repeated, yielding the following gel:
Results indicate successful transformation with the PetroBrick. Lane 1 contains the 1 kb plus ladder, while Lanes 2-11 contain the results of colony PCR. Each of these bands correspond to the PetroBrick vector, which is 2070bp, indicating that the transformation was successful. Lane 12 contains a positive control, which varies distinctly from the colony PCR results. The negative control lane is empty as expected.
Overnight cultures were grown from the colonies were prepared this week. Sigma compounds - for the purpose of testing the PetroBrick on naphthenic acid analogues - were selected from the list provided. The compounds to be used include cyclohexanepentanoic acid, cycohexane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid, and benzo[b]thiophene-3-acetic acid. A mini-prep was completed on the overnight cultures prepared earlier in the week, according to protocol obtained from the wiki. The DNA concentration in the resulting samples was measured by nanodrop to confirm successful plasmid extraction, and the resulting DNA concentrations were as follows:

Policy and practices is a key part of our project and one we have been successfully integrating alongside the wet lab work. Several areas have been of particular focus over the last few weeks including safety and education. Several members of our team have focused on safety, considering areas of ethical concern and practical contamination prevention. This has included consideration of a new catheter design to contain our modified bacteria and allow the therapeutics to be readily secreted. As well as the design of a kill switch, this represents an important element of control over our modified bacteria. The kill switch allows for the bacteria to be selectively destroyed in the absence of the target pathogen or if the bacteria carry out unwanted colonisation. The kill switch provides an additional level of control over our bacteria and addresses important public concerns about the use of genetically modified organisms.
Education has been the other major focus of our P&P over the last few weeks. An early goal of our team was to raise public awareness for both synthetic biology and the problem of antibiotic resistance of which UTIs present a significant example. Our team has engaged the public with surveys on public perception of synthetic biology and their thoughts on the use of modified organisms as an alternative to antibiotics. The results for both have been encouraging. To expand on this, we have further events planned, including a summer school workshop to expand science outreach to children, as well as a presentation on our project at the local natural history museum. For more information on our prgoress, access our Twitter for updates as well as YouTube where members of our team are providing more detailed explanations.

SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY IS MAKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA DRUGS CHEAPER
Marijuana is best known for its use as a recreational drug. The substance comes from the leaves of the Cannabis plant, and is made up of a number of compounds; most of these are compounds known as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are a group of compounds which act on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain, and at least 85 cannabinoids are found in marijuana collected from the Cannabis plant. These cause a variety of different effects between them; of these compounds, tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most abundant.
Cannabinoids exert their effects by binding to cannabinoid receptors, of which there are 2 types. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is found at the synapses of the central nervous system; primarilt sensory neurones"

Human Practices
We strongly feel that Human Practices are becoming more and more important in science. Since iGEM competition began in 2004, the number of teams that include Human Practices in their projects has increased exponentially. That's why we are dedicating lots of time and efforts writing a review about all topics discussed in all Human Practices reports from all iGEM teams and editions regarding safety, ethics, patents, etc. Additionally, we have interviewed experts in the area so to know their opinion about these topics.
Furthermore, we have also prepared a short survey to see what people from many different social and scientific backgrounds think about these issues. We get numerous and interesting data, as well as the largest compilation of Synthetic Biology definitions.
As a mean to encourage participation on the survey and to thank iGEM particpants efforts, we decided to offer collaborative teams with a series of honorary medals that teams are free to post on their wikis.

Current techniques depend on labour intensive culture dependent methods for identification of respiratory pathogens in clinical samples. On average, culturing the samples and informing treatment takes 2 weeks or longer if cultures have to be tested for specific antibiotic resistance.
The aim of The Lung Ranger is to identify specific respiratory pathogens from sputum samples in less than 1 hour by detecting the signalling molecules they produce.

A chest physician at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, and at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, Dr Rodgers introduced us to patients and the clinical care team in Edinburgh, allowing us to get a broader view of the impact of our device for CF patients.
Cystic Fibrosis Team Ninewells
Lawrie MacDougall (CF Clinical Nurse Specialist), Gill Brady (CF Clinical Nurse Specialist), Ali Smith (Physiotherapist), Alison Marshall (Dietician) and Ash Sinclair (Clinical Psychologist) make up the CF Clinical Team in Ninewells Hospital. Throughout the project they have been incredibly accommodating and welcoming each week, and have given us a holistic view of all the different aspects of care required in managing Cystic Fibrosis through their expertise in different disciplines.   The team had been incredibly kind sharing their time and knowledge with us. We took the opportunity to share some of what we did in the lab with the team and to introduce them to Synthetic Biology in action!
We wanted to understand what we were expecting of patients when we asked them to produce sputum samples in order to use our device. We needed to know whether it was reasonable for us to base our device around a certain amount of sputum brought up by the patients. To see for ourselves, Dave, Roddy and Jenny went to the Clinical Research Centre at Ninewells. Using nebulized saline solution, they were able to cough up sputum from their lungs. It was pretty unpleasant, and gave an insight into the daily life of someone living with CF, and also highlighted what we were expecting from patients.

Project description
We at City College of San Francisco, the world's first Junior College iGEM team, have begun constructing a bacterial powered battery.  The design has been generated with sustainability in mind, and aims to create an alternative to traditional fossil fuel technologies.
The battery owes its capabilities to two strains of bacteria: the heterotroph Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and the photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Each strain will occupy its own concentration cell and after being cultured anaerobically, will either oxidize (in the case of R. palustris) ferrous iron or reduce (in the case of R. ferrireducens) ferric iron.  The resulting current will be collected and used to demonstrate the functionality of the battery.
The reduction and oxidation reaction will be self-substaining.  This process is further aided by the genetic modification of R. palustris. As a photosynthetic prokaryote, R. palustris generates glucose readily. We intend to share this glucose with R. ferrireducens by inserting a passive glucose transporter into the cells of R. palustris.

We made the length of primer pairs longer to lower the high GC content of eryA. In addition to this, we done explore experiments about different concentration of DMSO from null to 10%.
This time, we got nothing unfortunately.
Latter, we choose mutant-enriched PCR. Extending the length of our target segment, we redesigned the primer pairs without RFC 10. During this period of time, we tried Primer STAR, GenSTAR, PCR Mix and KOD PCR enzyme and compared three-step process with two-step process [1][3].
At last, we can see the 5kb segment from the Gel Electrophoresis, which still not what we wanted.
Finally, we had to give up the idea of amplification eryA gene through PCR.
It sounds a pity.

Meetup with USTC-Software iGEM team
From Aug.14th to Aug.17th, 4 members of our team went to Hefei, China and take part in the iGem software track meet up arranged by USTC. In these 4 days, we not only had parties with students from different schools, but also went mount climbing with those guys which is super exciting. Yet the most crucial part and the main purpose of our coming to Hefei is of course the idea exchanging section during this meet up. USTC set up 2 rounds of presentation for all of us, one in Mandarin and the other in English. In that way, we could show our work to other members, inspire them, give them ideas of improvement, and practice our oral English at the same time.
Moreover, judges from USTC also gave us precious advises about how we could make our work and presentation better and be more competent to the final prize.
Members of SYSU finished the task smoothly. We articulated our work and ideas and our team leader Nie Peng also shared his experience with the audience about how to make iGem software professionally, which brought the whole meet up to an end perfectly.

Synthetic biology chassis
In synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, scientists and iGEMers are familiar with the concept of chassis, the conceptual extension of a living cell, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and so on. Many contemporary synthetic biology researches rely on the use of bacterial or eukaryotic chassis for plugging-in and plugging-out genetic circuits and new-to-nature functionalities.
The molecular biology workhorse, E. coli, is an ideal chassis in synthetic biology owing to our deep understanding of its biologic characteristics, its convenience of genetic manipulation and the relatively a large number of well-studied gene regulatory systems. It is therefore not surprising that E. coli has dominated in the iGEM competition. However, the opportunistic pathogen nature of E. coli, the lipopolysaccarides (LPS) contamination, and the intolerance to physicochemical stress and harsh operating conditions  hinder it to be an ideal choice for industrial application. Thus, the host of many productions  has been switched from E. coli to S. cerevisiae, such as the anti-malaria drug, semi-synthetic artemisinin. (Figure 1)
Figure 1 Classic chassis used in synthetic biology
Lactic acid bacteria
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram positive, non-sporulating bacteria that include microorganisms from different genuses such as Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Pedicoccus, and Streptococcus. LAB do not contain LPS attached to the cell membrane. The absence of such endotoxins avoids the possibility of anaphylactic shock when LAB are administered in humans. LAB has a long history of safe use in food production and preservation. It is used to ferment a range of raw materials, such as milk, which is used to produce cheese (species of Lactococcus) and yoghurt (species of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus). Some strains have also been used as probiotic bacteria producers of metabolites and macromolecules that are able to maintain and promote human health. LAB have been classified as food grade microorganisms"

Higher arabinose concentrations result in lower ODs Use PREDCEL for induction of mutagenesis and mutations

the probability for directed mutation should be high
Afterwards - propagation of the phages having the essential mutations by strains containing no MP Random mutagenesis
Alternative:
Transformation of MP1, MP4 and MP6 in S2208 strain (= S2060 - PACE strain - and pJC175e - Plasmid which is used for phage propagation)
several implementations of PREDCEL
propagation of phages should lead to several mutations - “phage-library”

Toolbox:
Most of the PCRs for amplification of the parts in our gibson-standard are done. Further steps will include the golden gate cloning for some parts and the integration into pSB1C3 for the iGEM standard. The amplifications which could not be implemented, will be carried out again or alternative primers will be ordered.
MinION Sequencing:
We implemented our first two sequencing runs with the MinION. According to the ONT Community, shearing can be performed using 26 gauge needles, instead of using the Covaris g-tubes. The library preparation was perfomred following the lambda control experiment protocol. Following this, the MinION was loaded according to Oxford Nanopores instructions.   Each run was implemented for 10 h according to the supplied ONT script. Live basecalling was performed, yielding 2000 reads and 11 million events. The accuracy of both runs was approximately 65 %, which is not good enough for sequencing of our amplicons. Possible reasons for this fact, could be the age of the flow cells as well as deviations from the standard protocol, normally using AMPure beads instead of our DNA Dynabeads from ThermoFisher. For this reason, another experiment using a newer flow cell will be implemented. In this experiment, we will use PCR products from supernatant from different timepoints of Dickinson-PACE, in order to investigate the behavior of the MinION sequencing in this case. Further knowledge about the sequencing should be acquired by using the ONT community. In analogy to the Bt toxin paper, it should be possible to implement a sequencing workflow, enabling a reliable basecalling accuracy. A scheme of this workflow is provided as a picture.

Analysis of transgenes
After Agrobacterium-mediated rice calli transformation, several hygromycin resistant rice lines were obtained, and their further molecular analysis were done. The genomic DNA of T0 transformants were extracted to do PCR amplifying HPT and Cre. Then PCR positive lines were selected to detect four foreign genes (PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT). The PCR results of some lines showed the expected bands of four genes were detected (Figure 3).
Figure 3   PCR assays of several transgenic rice lines. M, Marker 2K plus. CK+, positive control (plasmid pYLTAC380MF-BBPC). WT, negative control (wild-type rice cultivar HG1).
To detect expression levels of these four foreign genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis, total RNA of transgenic rice seeds were extracted and their cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA. The results of RT-PCR showed the expected bands of the four key genes for synthesizing astaxanthin in transgenic rice seeds (Figure 4).
Figure 4   RT-PCR analysis of expression levels of PSY, CrtI, BKY, and BHY genes in several transgenic rice. Rice OsActin1 was as an internal control. CK+, positive control (plasmid pYLTAC380MF-BBPC). WT, negative control (wild-type rice cultivar HG1).
These results of PCR and RT-PCR demonstrated that we successfully obtained transgenic rice with all of four stacking genes (PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT).
 
In summary, we successfully obtained transformants with all of transgenes in lab and detected obvious transcriptional activity in endosperm. These results indicated that our designed pathway was realizable in rice endosperm. To further confirm astaxanthin production, several analysis were carried out. The results were shown in Demonstrate page ."

Protocols
1.DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
Excise  the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean,  sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
Absorb  the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel  slice (tare with empty tube).
Add 3  volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
Resuspend  the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating  for 6-8 minutes). If low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3  minutes will do a lot of help to accelerate the solubilization.
Note: Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is fully dissolved.
Add  0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less  than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
Note: After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of yellow.
Place a Miniprep column into a 2ml microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from the step above into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.

Sucrose
Reasoning:
The concentrations of sucrose being tested are 0.5 M and 0.1 M. Hagiwara et al. (2009) found  the growth curves to show optimum biofilm at a 0.1 M concentration. E. coli biofilm formation  decreases at high osmolarity - sucrose is being used here to test osmolarity as a non-ionic solute.
Materials for sucrose stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
• 2 M sucrose stock solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight cultures in phosphate buffered media.
2. Add 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of
0.3% sucrose solution made in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 M.
3. Add 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of  1.5% sucrose in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final  concentration of 0.5 M.

The indicated bands have an expected band size of ~1500 bp. Colonies 1 and 2 from ligation 1 were picked for sequencing (with primer IG0013 ), where the sequence of both plasmids was further confirmed.
Transporting GFP into the vesicles
Introducing vesicle production is only the first step in transporting proteins into vesicles. It also requires translocation of the proteins to the periplasm. To achieve this we placed a TorA export tag in front of the protein and this fusion protein was transformed into the KEIO and WT strain, see overview Figure 41. Widefield microscope images were made to visualize whether the addition of the transport tag impaired the GFP structure and therefore its fluorescence. Additionally, an osmo-shock was performed to harvest the periplasmic fraction of the cell. After that, the plate-reader was used to determine the GFP levels in the periplasm and cytoplasm. This will tell us whether the the construct is functional thereby translocating the GFP into the periplasm.
Figure 41: Scheme of translocation. Scheme of plasmids and strains used in characterization of TorA-GFP.
We modeled the dynamics of the system to know at what time the concentration of GFP in the periplasm is maximal. For this modeling, we needed to know the OD curve of both the WT and KEIO strain. Due to the fact that we did not know the effect of TorA-GFP on the growth rate, we transformed the plasmid into the strains and measured the OD in the plate-reader. The experiment was performed with the growth rate protocol . In Figure 42, it is shown that the maximal OD is lower for the KEIO strain compared to the WT strain. Also, the growth rate of the KEIO strain in its exponential phase was smaller. With modeling we determined the maximal growth rate to be 1.4 per hour for WT and 0.9 per hour for KEIO.
Figure 42: OD curves. Measured OD curves of the (a) WT and (b) KEIO strain with TorA-GFP, measured in the plate-reader. The OD600 is put against time (hours).
To verify whether the addition of TorA tag to GFP did not impair the functionality of GFP, widefield images were taken with the widefield protocol . As shown in Figure "

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," managed to verify the splicing reaction of SspDnaX in the context of split mRFP. However, we were surprised by the low efficiency of the splicing reaction depicted on the Western Blot. Looking deeper in the original papers, we saw that also the authors did not archive higher amount of splicing product using SspDnaX [11]. The usage of split mRFP 168/169 failed as easy read-out of intein splicing, since the the non-splicing samples turned out to be brighter than the splicing construct. It could be due to sterically inhibition caused by the splicing reaction at position 168/169 compared to the flexible assembly by the mere proximity of the split halves. However the reconstitution of mRFP was clearly visible on the Western Blot (Figure 6). Instead, splicing of sfGFP seems to have failed. This can be attributed to the missing extein residues, which we omitted in order to avoid a large amino acid scar in front of the chromophore region. The reconstitution of mRFP is also visible in the samples that include both LOV- mutants and were irradiated by light, but not in the samples that were kept in darkness. However the right control, a LOV-mutant that is kept in the dark for 4 hours is missing. Therefore this experiment needs to be repeated – and we definitely will do so after Wiki freeze! Altogether the regulation of proteins by light is state of the art and a very important tool in molecular biology.

AITF Workshop 1
The first AITF conference of the 2011 iGEM season was held at the University of Calgary in May. The three iGEM teams from Alberta were present. It was an excellent opportunity for the different teams to meet each other and learn together. Dr Peter Facchini from the University of Calgary started off by showing us his synthetic biology program. He and his PhytoMetaSyn team are working on elucidating the pathway and thereby enzymes involved in the production of morphine and other medically relevant metabolites in the opium poppies.
During this conference we had the opportunity to discuss our nascent projects with 4 professionals who are very well respected in their respective fields. Dr Facchini went over the science behind our iGEM projects and was very helpful in pointing out the weaknesses in our scientific strategies and offered some practical solutions to them. Dr. Samantha Sutton from the Handel Group gave us pointers on how to work together as a group. Dr. Michael Mehta, the Dean of Arts from Thompson Rivers University and Lori Sheremeta, a lawyer from the National Institute for Nanotechnology, helped us by going over and scrutinizing the legal, ethical and social implications of our iGEM projects. They also discussed the ramifications of intellectual property with us and how it applied to our iGEM projects. Anne Marie Downey of Downey Norris & Associates gave us a lecture on effective communication techniques. In it, we were taught how to present effectively and confidently. She gave us useful tips on non-verbal communication and keeping our audience interested in our presentations. She finished off by telling us how to handle questions, especially sensitive ones, in a professional manner. The first AITF conference of 2011 proved to be an important and fun start to the iGEM season.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", due to time constraints, we were not able to test a range of different IPTG concentrations.
Figure 36: Analysed data of the DLS experiment. Vesicles size after induction of TolR (orange) and pET-Duet (blue) in the KEIO strain obtained by DLS measurements. The mean for each measurement was represented with dots and the width of the distribution with bars. The time points in hours is set against the size in nm.
As shown in previous experiments, both pET-Duet and TolR in KEIO seem to produce vesicles. To confirm that the objects measured by DLS are vesicles and not, for example, parts of the cell, we made negative stain Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images following the TEM protocol . We expected that vesicles have a different shape than the cell debris, namely spherical. Furthermore, when vesicles are big enough you should be able the see the lipid bilayer of the membrane.
Figure 37 shows PET-Duet in KEIO (a) and TolR in KEIO (b). Vesicles were identified in the images, indicating that the measured objects were not simply cell debris. As shown in the raw DLS data in Figure 35, the range of vesicules go up to approximately 70 d.nm. Due to the resolution limitations of the TEM, we could only visualize vesicles above the average size of 18 d.nm.
Figure 37: Transmission Electron Microscop (TEM) images of TolR (left) and pET-Duet (right) in the KEIO strain. The red arrows point to vesicles.
The DLS and TEM experiments do not provide any information about the concentration of produced vesicles. Therefore, vesicle concentration was determined through staining the DLS samples with the membrane dye FM4-64 and subsequent fluorescence measurements in a plate reader. The experiment followed the membrane staining protocol . In order to calculate the concentration of vesicles from the measured intensity, a calibration curve of synthetic liposomes was made. Figure 38 shows the following linear function which was fitted through the measured data: $I = 4.7865 \cdot C + 950.0159$. In this formula, $I$ is the intensity of the fluorescence in arbitrary units and $C$, the concentration of the liposomes in mg/µL.
In Figure 39 the concentration of vesicles is represented. It can be seen that little to no vesicles are produced in the wild type strain compared to the KEIO strain. Furthermore, the concentration of vesicles after growing overnight is much higher"
