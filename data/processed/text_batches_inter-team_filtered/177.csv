Introduction
Maths is Fun..and Useful Too!
Aims
In order to help analyze, construct and optimise the biochemical pathways in The Lung Ranger, we used a variety of mathematical tools to create algorithms and simulations. This allowed us to accelerate the development and testing of various project-driven  hypotheses.
Methodology
Mathematical modelling has played a significant role in the development of synthetic biology.  As an investigative tool, modelling  is  capable of abstracting complex systems and reducing them to their core components. Thus a quantitative understanding of the interaction between these core components can be generated, leading to  optimal system design and control.
In our project, we used a variety of mathematical tools with which to design and study our engineered signal transduction pathways.   As illustrated below, each of the approaches, ordinary differential equations (ODEs); stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and NetLogo, provided a different, but complementary understanding of the system.
Each modelling technique allows for the investigation of processes at different levels of observation. ODE allows for prediction as the population level. SSA takes account of low molecule numbers (intrinsic noise) and allows for single cell comparison and a better understanding of sub-population behaviour.  The NetLogo simulation tool affords single, intra-cellular resolution and provides the most visually accessible representation of the biochemistry under study. All codes are available  - just click on the appropriate links in the ""References"" section at the end of each modelling page.

A major limitation of aptamers in comparison with antibodies is their stability in vivo, where nucleic acids are rapidly degraded. Aptamers which have been used as therapeutic agents, for example, suffered from a half-life of 2 minutes [9] . This problem has, however, partially been overcome by using chemical modifications to the aptamers. An example of these modifications are Spiegelmers [8] . These oligonucleotides’ backbones contain L-Ribose instead of R-Ribose – “spiegel” means mirror. These mirrored aptamers are more stable in vivo, because they suffer less from degradation.
Aptamers in Biotechnology
Since aptamers can be easily modified chemically, they can be attached to numerous surfaces, enabling their way into a wide array of biosensors and drug delivery systems. Generally, the biosensors couple binding of the aptamer to a change in structure in the latter, which generates either a fluorescent or electrical signal. Aptamers have also found their way into drug delivery systems. A particular example of such a system is developed by Wu et al., featuring aptamers targeted at cancer cells with lipid tails. These aptamers could be used as building blocks of micelles, enabling efficient delivery of the micelles to cancerous cells [10] .
Aptamers in our Biosensor
Aptamers constitute the ideal sensor domain for our universal membrane sensor: they can be targeted at virtually any molecule, can easily be attached to the membrane using SPAAC chemistry and offer affinities similar to antibodies. Taking into account their remarkable stability and small size, they are unmatched by the traditional recognition elements of biotechnology, antibodies. An essential requirement for our system which limits the choice of aptamers is bifunctionality: the system relies on bringing two membrane proteins in close proximity by binding the ligand with two different moieties. Conceptually, this bifunctionality can be reached either through the use of dual aptamers or through the use of split aptamers.
Figure 1: Bifunctionality is required to bring the membrane proteins into close proximity.
Dual Aptamers
The first way in which bifunctionality can be reached is through the use of dual aptamers acting on different binding sites, called apitopes. A well-known example of a ligand for which dual aptamers are available is human thrombin. A drawback of the use of dual aptamers is that these are in general not available for small molecules and viruses, significantly reducing the available targets for the aptamers."

Over night culture was made on our wild type E. coli from freezing stock.  The agar plates with our transformated plasmids from Saturday showed colonies with different colors. Colony PCR on the colonies that seemed to have worked was made and run on gel. The lenghts from colony PCR products had the right lengths. There was also made plate streaking from the colonies used for the colony PCR.

Cellular Equations
Using the parameters found above, we can construct a series of ordinary differential equations which represent our biosensor network.
The system described by these equations can be represented diagramatically by SimBiology. The following illustration is a full visual representation of the regulatory network.
Results
The simulation was run with an initial ethylene concentration of 20 mM, over a time period of 1 hr. AmilCP concentrations rose to 581 nM at the end of this hour. Longer simulations produced higher concentrations, however this may not be representative as our model has not taken into account long term cell effects such as cell division, or the effect of high AmilCP concentration on cell life cycles.
The graphs below show the time course concentrations of each species, with species of similar concentrations being plotted on the separate axes.
Sensitivity Analysis
Compared to the gene regulation pathways existing in nature, our biosensor is quite simplistic. Nevertheless it has led to a model with a large number of parameters. However, not all of these parameters contribute equally to the overall output of the model.
Often it is useful to know which of these parameters have the greatest influences on the system because these parameters are the ones that should be targeted for any optimization or further study.
Essentially, this section seeks to answer the question “which of these numbers are important and which ones are not?”.
The sensitivity analysis is built into MATLAB SimBiology. The software uses complex-step approximatio to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to each individual parameter. The larger the change in output, the more impact that parameter has and thus the more sensitive our system is to the parameter of interest.
Two crucial results can be drawn from the sensitivity analysis:
1. A large portion of the parameters with estimated values are negligible. This includes dephosphorylation, dissociation, degradation and dilution.
2. AmilCP protein production is most sensitive to the following parameters in the table below.

I just completed my BSc degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary.  I am starting as a grad student in CPSC, under the supervision of Dr. Christian Jacob, working on modeling biological systems using Membrane Computing (MC). My previous research work was on evolution of discrete gene regulatory models and applying heuristic optimization methods toward more stable gene regulatory networks. My research interests are in evolutionary computation, biological modeling and medical sciences. I'll be working with the 2009 iGEM team to help model the Quorum-Coupled Bacteriocin Release system implemented by the wet-lab team using Membrane Computing.

I am going into  my second year of Bioinformatics in the Bachelors of Health Sciences program at the U of C. I am working on the computing and modeling aspects of iGEM. I will be working on the visualization of the Membrane Computing Project and I’m also helping to add some visual features to the model designed by Afshin. iGEM is a wonderful opportunity to gain a better understanding of cellular structures and gene expression, and since I am interested in cellular and molecular biology and computer programming, I was drawn into this project. I usually listen to music or socialize with my friends in my free time. Everyday I try to allocate some time to hang out with my family. I also play soccer. I am interested in travelling as well.

This is my second year as a member of the University of Calgary’s iGEM team. Last year, I was on the University of Calgary Wetware team and I had a blast! I had such a great time that with the help of Sonja, Dr. Jacob and Dr. Nygren, I initiated recruitment for our iGEM team thereby bolstering our ranks from 4 to 16 team members. As a fourth year biomedical student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program, I approach iGEM as an amazing opportunity to apply some of great biological theory that I have learnt to the design of my own biological systems.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," (the pBAD/AraC promoter) and one of the fifteen amplifiers. To obtain a mathematical description of the entire system, Cambridge used the following equations to describe the input/output response of these individual components.
The Cambridge 2009 modelling page develops these equations in more detail.
When these individual component models are strung together, the resulting model of the entire system has a sigmoidal shape. This means the response curve for the entire system can be fit to a Hill function, which is of the form
.
Note that 4 parameters are required to specify the response curve: increase in rate, basal rate, switch point, and Hill coefficient. These parameters need to be determined empirically, with the exception of the Hill coefficient, which we assume is equal to 2.
The detector and amplifier also each have the form of a Hill function, but of course each has its own set of parameters which will differ from the Hill parameters of the overall system.
4.0 EXTRACTING DATA
Ultimately we seek a numerical characterization of the amplifier part alone. Since we know its response curve has the form of a Hill function, we need only find its four Hill parameters. The following table summarizes the known and desired data.
If all the parameters other than the amplifier parameters are known, the model above together with the response curves of the amplifiers is enough information to extract the desired parameters. Explicitly solving the equations above for the amplifier parameters is difficult; instead, MATLAB's curve fitting toolbox will be used to find the parameters which, when combined with the known parameters and inserted into the equations for Cambridge's overall system, matches the empirical data obtained by Cambridge. This process must be repeated for each of the 15 amplifiers.
Unfortunately, not all the necessary parameters are known. Some were not measured by Cambridge (those in block 1), but can be found in the literature. However, the Hill parameters for the pBAD/AraC promoter are not known, and must be measured. To do this, an experiment is being designed to characterize this promoter in RPU, but has not yet been carried out.
1.1 Outreach and Synthetic Biology
The newness of synthetic biology means that much of the population is not even aware that it exists (see Awareness & Attitudes Study see link at the bottom of this section). Therefore, an important aspect of our outreach efforts is to introduce the topic of synthetic biology and show its potential. We also hope to give people the foundational information that they need in order to understand future scientific developments. This form of outreach will help to improve the scientific literacy of the general population.

Biologists have a finalistic speech. Just the fact of describing systems by their function is finalistic. Physics has still managed to break up with Finalism. We don't say that bodies fall because they are better off when they are down. Biology falls within a finality. Even when people talk about Darwinism, they have a finalistic speech. Yet organisms don't adapt by themselves to environment. The environment changes, some of them are adapted, the others not.  I wonder if we could maybe draw an epistemological comparison between Physics and Biology. Physical laws could for example be the equivalent of functions; the equivalent of an invariant could be a structure, the equivalent of a symmetry, maybe a kind of plasticity…

Human practice
In daily life, yogurt is often used as a flavor drink because of its better taste, easier nutritional absorption and better regulation of human intestinal bacteria situation. After fermentation, the fatty acids in yogurt increase twice, making yogurt easily digest and absorb as well as improving the utilization of nutrients. Yogurt can be produced by using fresh milk as raw materials, adding a certain proportion of sucrose, sterilization and cooling, then appending lactobacillus with its culture as well as kinds of dairy products which allow product to taste sweet and smooth. In the fermentation process, lactobacillus can also produce human nutrition containing a variety of vitamins, such as vitamins. Its nutritional value is better than fresh milk and various protein powders.
However, according to our review of the relevant articles, we found that many by-products are produced during the process of yogurt fermentation, including a representative-- lactate. In the process of yogurt fermentation, the production of lactate will have a certain inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria, but lactate is also an indispensable symbol of fermentation products. Therefore, the real-time monitor of lactate in the production of yogurt plays an important role that cannot be ignored, which can ensure the quality of yogurt fermentation.
Through referring to a large number of documents, we understood the actual production of yogurt in some cases, carefully thought and summed up the existing situation, and we provided our experimental plan.

The red curve decline over time but not the blue one, which means roGFP2-Orp1 protein is able                         to show the accumulation of ROS in our yeast.
Since we have proved the feasibility that the antioxidative ability of antioxidant can be                         measured by fluorescence probes. We can easily set up the relationship between our system and                         real antioxidative ability of antioxidant.
Detect antioxidants by engineering strain
After the whole system construction, we need to test the function of our system and then                         evaluate the effect of antioxidants through our system.
To detect the antioxidant capacity of antioxidants, we have selected three antioxidants,                         Vitamin C, Quercetin and Catechol, as our samples, and cultured engineered strain                         (Δyca1-yno1-roGFP2-Orp1) until the period with high ROS accumulation (24-36 h). Then the                         antioxidants were added into yeast culture and incubated for 30 minutes. The control group was                         treated with aseptic water and ethanol. The fluorescence intensity ratio (I488/I408 or                         I405/I488) of the reduction peak (488nm) and oxidation peak (405nm) was measured by Microplate                         Reader, and the antioxidant activity of antioxidants was characterized by that ratio change                         rate. And the emission wavelength is 510nm. The results are showed in Fig. 2.
Fig.2 Detect the Antioxidant Capability of Antioxidants (I405/I488)
Low                             fluorescence ratio (I488/405) means low intracellular ROS level.
Fig.3 Detect the Antioxidant Capability of Antioxidants (I488/I405)
High                             fluorescence ratio (I488/405) means high antioxidant capacity.
As Fig.2~3 shown, in 30 mins, group Catechol and group Quercetin both show a decreasing in                         I405/I488 ratio (Fig.2), which means that Quercetin and Catechol have antioxidant activity.                         Besides, the Quercetin treated group shows a faster decreasing in I405/I488 ratio than Catechol                         under the same condition of time. According to our modeling, this indicates that the Quercetin                         have more antioxidant activity than Catechol, which is consistent with CAA assay result.

""Beware varroa: Apicoli is guarding the beehive!""
Easter egg
Apis mellifera, the most efficient and widespread honey producing species, is heavily affected by the mite Varroa destructor.  This pathogen is actually one of the most important cause of death for domestic bees. Indeed, according to beekeepers, up to 50% of  the swarms can be lost every year because of this parasite, causing tremendous economic damages.

Percentage of hives disapearing every year in the US*
*INRA
70%
Honey production loss in France since 1995*
*UNAF

Our team is committed to preserving honeybees by limiting infection of beehives by these mites.  The aim of our project is to create a bacterium able to bait and eliminate the parasite using the  Synthetic Biology tools and philosophy. The engineered bacterium, named ApiColi, will be safely placed in a trap and will express alternatively an attractant molecule and a poison for the Varroa destructor, in agreement with the honeybee life cycle. Our trap will be sealed to avoid any contact of the microorganism with the bees and the environment. We hope that our concept will help to reduce the decrease in bee populations and its disastrous consequences.

Media Preparation
For all experiments  involving the bacterial biomass and experimentation, proper media is chosen to grow  the cells. Commonly,we use Lysogeny broth media for E. coli. The following is the media compositions and their  quantities.
Method:
1.Prepare the Lysogeny Broth (LB) liquid media (1 L) as indicated below:
+ Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
+ NaCl - 10 g
+ Yeast Extract - 5 g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
2.Prepare the Lysogeny Broth (LB) solid media (1 L) as indicated below:
+ Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
+ NaCl - 10 g
+ Yeast Extract - 5 g
+ Difco Agar - 15g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
3. Autoclaving
Autoclave at 121 °C for 60 minutes. After the media cooling down enough, antibiotics Ampicillin(100mg of Ampicillin per 1ml of the media) are added. At last the media are poured 15ml on each plate and become solid.Store the plate at 4℃ refrigerator.

So many people are in the lab now! Because so many of our small lab teams have transitioned to lab work, the “Yeast Parents”, or team in charge of maintaining the yeast and the lab, gave everyone a tour of the space to keep everything organized (and keep us all in line).
Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR. However, the team took this as a learning experience and practiced concentration math and master-mix-making. We are also going to begin a crowdfunding campaign to supplement the team funds when/if errors arise in the future.
Outreach is really cool! Three of us, plus our PI (of course), spoke to Martyn Smith, Managing Director of the Family Planning 2020 Secretariat, over the phone. He nearly gave us heart attacks when he offered to help us reach local agents familiar with the regulatory environments in the countries we wanted our project to extend to. Aside from the FP2020 call, two of our members have been diligently working on outreach at home. They’ve started to develop a game as an interactive way for high schoolers to join in when we present our project to them later this month.
After double checking that we were using the right volumes for our PCR reaction, we were able to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2. We then confirmed this by running it on a 1% agarose gel seen below.
Our over-the-weekend cultures had little growth after 24 hours, but showed adequate growth come Monday morning. After discussing this with other teammates, we found it was most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasmid isolation followed by a restriction digest to test the identity of our isolated plasmid. Our first digest was unsuccessful, which we hypothesized was because of the age of our enzyme sample. Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures. We also ran into several issues with budgeting time correctly in lab, which prompted us to change how we schedule our lab procedures to create as little “dead space” as possible.

What is the demographic of the diagnosed people? What kind of people are especially prone to infection? And why?
Michael Masika:
Mostly women and children. As a country and as a culture, children stay with mothers. Now itˋs the children that have running eyes, discharges, eventually this will attract flies, that might transmit the chlamydia. So if the child is on the back of the mother and there are flies all over, the face is not clean. What you expect is that the flies will also jump to the mother and they also jump to other children that are around the mother. The men are not there. They are not staying with the children. Thatˋs why women are more affected.
David Chinyanya:
Itˋs our culture, we try to educate the people, that the men can also take care of the children. Even if you drive back to where I come from you see, that itˋs the mother that are caring for the children. The men are just walking around, or the men just leave in the morning, they go somewhere and chat with their friends and come back. Another thing is the culture as well, that if there are only a few litres of water in the home, it will be given to the father, or to the man of the household, not the mother. They like to give it to the father to use that water, the others can do as well without it. One of the messages we are trying to develop is to change the mindset. Which is not easy, but itˋs really the mindset. We give priority to the fathers. Thatˋs a big challenge, as a country and you know, culture is not easy to change and it takes time and it takes a lot of advocacy and awareness which is an ongoing thing. Thatˋs the challenge that we have to meet. And perhaps, the other thing which we should also mention is the issue of illiteracy. In Malawi the illiteracy is very high among women. Itˋs something also cultural. For example two children, a boy and a girl, are raised in a family and both of them get selected to go to school, but the preference will go to the boy, and the girl will get married and taken care of by the man. This is highly entrenched in our culture. So if you are a man you are raised thinking that you have to take care of a woman"

As part of their iGEM 2014 project, Team University of Pennsylvania characterized a fascinating and underused organism: Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB-1), a bacterium that aligns with magnetic fields. By developing, testing, and optimizing protocols for its growth and transformation, and then making them easily accessible in a convenient Strain Spec Sheet, they tried to establish AMB-1 as an easily engineered organism.
The Penn University 2014 strain spec sheet
As part of their human practices, they contacted other iGEM teams participating that year to compile characterization and protocols data if they were working with unconventional organisms too. They designed a “biological chassis specification sheet” that contained necessary information and protocols for the successful growth and engineering of the organisms.
With very similar ideas and intentions, and much bigger ambition, we created an open source database of characterization and protocols data for unconventional chassis organisms. We improved on University of Pennsylvania Team’s idea of creating “biological chassis specification sheet” and turned it into a much bigger version.
The blueprint of the data collected for each chassis entry is as given below.

Genome sequence
We’ve tried to keep it compact yet comprehensive, taking feedback from the stakeholders, people who’ve worked with new chassis and filled data on the database.
In an effort to make our database a one-stop solution to working with chassis, we added tools that can help in working with the biochemical and genomics of the chassis. We plan to develop an assortment of tools to make it easier to work with a new chassis.
Currently, our biggest tool achievement has been the development of an interactive codon optimizer which can be used to manually edit the optimized sequence to remove restriction sites or reduce GC content, using a drop-down menu that shows codons that can be used to replace the current codon without changing the amino acid.
In the future, we plan to develop more chassis tools such as those for genome analysis and metabolic simulations.

Theoretical Maximum Beta-Carotene Flux
If we optimize beta-carotene solely, we will see no growth rate, this is infeasible in the lab, but this theoretical maximum production flux can help us decide if an organism is worth the effort to engineer it, if the theoretical maximum is too low, then we would not attempt using Y. lipolytica to produce beta-carotene at all. Luckily, it is not the case. Y. lipolytica shows excellent beta-carotene yield capacity.   These PHPPs are produced by setting the beta-carotene sink flux as the objective function.

DESCRIPTION
Compared to growth rate optimized PHPPs, the general changes are these: smaller optimal regions (smaller bright yellow area in Figures 13-15); more phase planes (Figures 17, 18, 21, 22) or steeper gradient of lines of optimality, leading to more equally divided areas for phase planes of opposite gradients (Figures 19, 23). The net change from growth rate optimized to production optimized PHPPs show less stability, meaning the production flux is more easily influenced by substrate uptake rates, and we have stricter requirements for oxygen and C substrate uptake rates to match up to stay on the line of optimality. We can take advantage of these trends, to design optimal chemostats or fed-b"

OVERVIEW
Our system is composed of four main biological components: bacteriophage, host bacteria, elastin-like-polymers (ELP), and a metal binding protein.
Together, the four components will work to sequester and remove metal ions from a solution.
BACTERIAL HOST
When considering a potential bacterial host that would be compatible with our system, the following criteria must be met.
I) The host can be parasitized by a bacteria-phage amenable to engineering.
II) The host can survive in high metal concentrations.
III) The host can resist temperature fluctuations and aggregation.
Chosen according to the criteria, we have decided to explore the host bacteria: Escherichia coli as our proof of concept as it is a well-studied model organism with defined methods of genetic manipulation and is easily accessible in our lab.
In real-life applications of our system, we will be using methanotrophic bacteria as they are one of the few natural organisms that can survive in the detrimental environment of tailings ponds. By using methanotrophic bacteria it also ensures a cost-efficient and sustainable system as the bacteria already naturally exists in the tailings pond. The additional benefit of working with E. coli is that results obtained in the system will inform in silico modelling, allowing us to design other phage systems for different organisms.
In summary, the choice of host defines numerous properties of the system in terms of energy input, phage production, and efficiency of removing the metal ions from the oil and mining tailings ponds. Our initial efforts with E. coli will inform our design of other host-phage systems, and alter the way in which our device works to capture and sequester ions in mining and oil tailings ponds.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Tar chemoreceptor mediates E. coli movement towards aspartate and maltose (attractant molecules). It undergoes conformational change upon attractant molecule binding, leading to inhibition of CheA protein autophosphorylation and subsequent CheY activity. This causes the flagellum facilitates the bacterium to swin towards attractant substance via opposite motor protein FliM rotation. On the other hand, CheA autophosphorylation would cause prominent rotation of motor protein to make tumbling effect.
LuxAB-eYFP Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) System
Basically, a molecule is excited to higher energy state when it absorbs a photon energy. This molecule relaxes back to ground state when the energy is emitted back to the environment or transferred into another molecule. FRET is a phenomenon in which non-radioactive energy is transferred from excited donor molecule to acceptor molecule via dipole-dipole interactions. Molecules involved in this phenomenon are called fluorophores as they emit fluorescence according to their respective emission spectrum after absorbing higher photon energy. LuxAB and eYFP are one of the most widely studied paired fluorophores. In this case, LuxAB is the donor fluorophore as it emits cyan colored light with relatively high energy (peak emission at 490 nm). eYFP serves as the acceptor fluorophore when in close contact with LuxAB, as it absorbs high energy from LuxAB that is overlapped with its own absorption spectrum and emits yellow colored light with lower energy (peak emission at 530 nm). To be utilized in macromolecules interaction studies, LuxAB and eYFP should be incorporated with the molecules of interest. When the molecules of interest are in contact, energy transfer between LuxAB and eYFP will happen and its efficiency can be measured with fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy method.

There wasn't much time for lab work left but we managed to do some preps and set the overnight digestions
Interlab Study
We inoculated cultures with the GFP gene in liquid cultures for the Interlab Study. The cultures were left to grow over night. We also prepared plates with kanamycin which we are going to use for 3A assembly of our promoters and effectors. We made a miniprep of another GFP culture from last week
Tuesday 14th
Interlab Study
We used the cultures we inoculated yesterday for making a miniprep. Just to be safe we had made two cultures and after figuring out the quirks of the nanodrop it turned out that one had a DNA concentration more than twice that of the other. We digested the minipreps and the promoters from the Interlab Study with Xba1, Spe1 and Pst1 to ligate them together in the next step. We checked if the digestion of GFP (Interlab Study) worked but we could not see any bands so we'll try again tomorrow with an Ethidium Bromide gel and use more DNA. We started the ligation of promoters to GFP anyway, transformed and let these cultures grow overnight.
Bifidobacter
We have checked the concentrations of preps from yesterday and they were really low! The diagnostic digests confirmed that there was no DNA in our preps. In the mean time we decided to do the gel extraction od Ptac and GFP we got from our other team members. We digested the Ptac with S and P and GFP with X and P and run it on the gel. The Ptac was there, but GFP wasn't.
Wednesday 15th
Interlab Study
We ran the same digestion as yesterday but this time with lots of DNA and a ton of Ethidium Bromide and it worked!!!
We could see the bands we expected in one of our samples (second well from the ladder). The other one seemed not to be digested. Now we are going to stick only to the good one. We transformed cells with the ligation from yesterday and let them grow overnight.
Mind the Gut: Promoters
We also started working on the promoters of our actual project Gad-A+RBS, Gad-A and PyeAr digested them and ligated them into a backbone with Cam resistance.

In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. And by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. And you can also see the figure below.
The channel capacity is defined as:\[C = \mathop {\sup }\limits_{{p_X}\left( x \right)} I\left( {X;Y} \right)\]
where the supremum is taken over all possible choices of ${p_X}\left( x \right)$.
After you know about all the concept above, now we are glad to tell you that you can easily follow us and find out many interesting and inspiring things in our project. Congratulations!
Protein Dimerization and Splitting Up
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied downstream responses and distinct cellular fates…
Previous researches have underlined the important advantages of dimerization, including differential regulation, specificity, facilitated proximity and so on. Wait, this cannot be the end of the list. What is the influence of dimerization in noise propagation? The question is hardly touched due to the difficulty in controlling experiment variables. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools to carry out experiments otherwise impossible in designed systems.
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
These are the thrilling challenges and opportunities we face in our program. We split up florescent protein and tune the affinity between them by adding intein sequence. When the two parts bind together, graceful blue light is emitted from EBFP2. These constructs mimic the effect of dimerization in living cells, and are under fine control because they can be induced by the drug Do"

     Found out that 2011 Peking team already did the idea, but was just simple, AND/OR circuit design.
     Additional  XOR gate design and building full adder circuit to make binary calculator (only processing addition) would be much advanced form compare to previous iGEM team
     Possible molecules for XOR gate : proteinA - Fc region of IgG, (His)6-nickel ion(II), etc..
     Two molecules used in XOR gate should be small enough to easily diffuse, able to bind one another, and promoter recognizing the molecules should exist.
     Use filter or other methods to prevent leakage of the molecules when they bound.

So the figure 10 verified that GFP is proportional to P(T(Bxb1)off) .

After we get experimental data(abscissa), we should corresponding to the ordinata to find out whether the trend in range, if within the range, it means our experiments are correct, otherwise it is necessary to continue the experiment to get correct data.
fugure12:The relationship between lg(kt) and lg(GFP)
We keep kt1(for Bxb1)and kt1(for FimE) the same, and vary them in the scope we used before. We find that the GFP output changes with kt1 and kt2 in a similar way compared to the independent gene circuits.
Figure13:The relationship between GFP and t.
Kt1=Kt2=1/(M*M*min) km(lac)=km(tet)=5e-5nM/min
Figure14: The relationship between GFP and t.
Kt1=Kt2=1e7/(M*M*min) km(lac)=km(tet)=100nM/min
The morphology of the reaction curve is not obviously affected by these two parameters.
Figure15:The relationship between lg(kt)and p(T(off))
Figure16:The relationship between lg(kt)and lg(P(T(off)))
The relationship of P(Toff) with kt is almost identical to that of GFP with kt. So we can conclude that GFP is proportional to P(Toff).(Here two kt and two P(Toff))s are both the same.
Figure17: The relationship between GFP and lg(km)
GFP level decerases as km increases, but saturates when km is too large or too small.But the reference value lies in the unsaturated scope. This indicates that the inhibition of transcription of Lacl and tetR activates the expression of GFP.

Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 7 testing. Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: Degrading the July 6 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, bleach, Tilex and Truly cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 6 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well of a microtiter plate. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Note: Before cultures were degraded using the different cleaners, Kieran had taken a sample of the biofilms and prepared a 5 mL tube of LB to culture the biofilm that would be ensured to grow.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.

27 September 2012,4 h to go!!!
The final lines of text are just typed into our wiki!
Now it is 4 o´clock in the morning of the 27th of August (CET) and our homepage including all our results of the approximately 130 lab days is finally finished. In order to celebrate this occasion we made some calculations: all in all, we collected approximately 3000 hours of lab work in which we could have- based on an average hourly wage of 10.85 € for master students - earned around 32520 €. We used and trashed approximately 3000 plastic petri dishes and let our E. coli strains grow on and in around 150 l LB-agar/broth.
Additionally all of us need new tires and brakes from driving up and down the “Faßberg” (the hill on which the MPI is positioned) by bike.
And as all of us are terribly tired now, we will go to bed. (Of cause not before we have raised our glasses, or better: bottles).
We wish all of you a beautiful morning, and hope to meet you in Amsterdam!!!

c. Large-scale chromosome modification
Although being gradually replaced by the more recent technology such as CRISPR/Cas system,                                     SSR has been employed to perform large scale DNA modifications (deletion, insertion,                                     and inversion), and is a handy tool for modeling diseases that are caused by chromosome                                     rearrangements. Compared to CRISPR technology, SSR does not rely on the organism’s ability                                     to repair double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination, and is therefore                                     particularly useful in organisms such as bacteria that have limited ability to repair                                     DSBs.

But what I like most about GenetiX and the other iGem groups is that they actually do something, they make sure their projects are heard of, and change for good the world we live in. Often we hear how we are destroying our world, but come to think about how many people try to change that; that's why I think iGem and GenetiX are such a good opportunity, not just for us, but for all the people who want to improve things.

I'm one of the developers of our wiki and webpage and I plan to keep learning more about technology and science for many years. Genetix has really helped me to develop skills in computer science and has made me even more curious than how I was at the very beginning, I know that this group will keep growing bigger and bigger so future generations on our high school can learn all of what we've learned on the team and even make an impact in the world.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#Improving Flip Flop_-_-_TEXT.html," We had two problems, (1) the strain had a F plasmid with a LacI inside and (2) we should check our strain and remove the resistance cassettes.
Firstly, we tried to achieve a strain without F plasmid and to get that we followed two different strategies: on the one hand, we set up a continuous culture eventually  checking if any bacteria had lost that plasmid (lost beta-galactosidase activity and proline auxotrophy); on the other hand, in parallel with that, we tried to obtain in another strain with the same deletions as we got weeks ago. Finally we achieved that by continous culture strategy. Secondly, after the strain had lost the F’ plasmid, we remove the resistance cassette and we checked our strain by PCR. Finally, we construct the controls (empty vector and improved flipflop without SspB) and we electroporated our bacteria with all the plasmids. The bacteria were ready to be tested!
During these weeks, we’ve been intensively proving our improved flip-flop with the fluorometer. We have studied the response of our flip-flop, changing from no induction to IPTG and temperature inductions, proving the basal measures without induction, the results of changing the induction, the duration of the temperature pulse to make the change stable and  studied a continuous temperature induction of the previously non-inducted improved bistable. These measurements were carried out in the same strain as the previous measurements of the basic flip-flop, which is not optimal as it expresses the Sspb adaptor protein and the RybB asRNA, being able to interfere in the expression.
The last week, finally having our new strain, we spent a whole day and night in the lab measuring the improved flip-flip stability, and change speed. It was a long sleepless night, but it was worth it: we got very useful results!

Saturday
Diellza is back. Since we ticked all the medal checkboxes, construct 2 is now officially under construction. Construt 2 assembly failed.
Sunday
Let's try to reassemble contruct 2. In the wet lab, Yutong is working on MelA and wiki. Alberto is in the lab characterising Gp2 and MelA plate reader. The final plate reader experiment for the library characterisation is done. Thomas is fine tuning the electrode stimulation experiment.  Lidia, Josh and Diellza are woking on the judging form, wet-lab wiki and protocols respectively. The bioengineers are analysing data and producing pretty figures.
Week 14 - 01/10/18
Monday
Big meeting with everyone . Lidia, Josh and Diellza joinied in via skype. The survivors on campus met in Tom Ouldridge's office. Rodrido was there as well.  This week is going to be intense. Many important deadlines ahead.  Also there is an issue with the part library: A1 construct did not show fluorescence in the plate reader experiment. This means that at the moment we don't have a sygmoid onto where to map the endpoit data of the other 48 constructs. This exeriment has to be urgently redone and it is now a high priority issue. Also in the priorirty list is creating a parts page on the registry and sending DNA to Boston
Tuesday
The wet lab team worked in Bessemer on plate reader and electrode fine tuning.                      At 6 pm we had iGEM Presentation with SynBIC and the Socio-Ethical Dialogue. We talked after Tom Ellis introduction to synthetic bioloy and John Collins on entrepreneurship. Approximately 80 undergatuates student were present. “E. coli is the ultimate capitalist. It basically evolved for fast growth and competition, not stability” [Tom Ellis]. Also Siwat memorably asked in front of the audience “does E. coli have morality” ? We still don’t have the answer to this question, but we are working on it. Feedback:
Wednesday
Everybody is working on the judging form. We received the PCB. Will and Luis started to assemble it. Unfortunately some critical components are arriving on Thursday. So we don’t think we can present it on the wiki. Perhaps we can do the big show at the presentation ? Alberto set up the pyo plate for the library.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," day where we learned a lot from the presenters and identified possible collaborations with the other teams.
Week 7 (June 12- June 16, 2017)
On Monday, June 12 Lalit and Sam visited Winston Churchill High School to present to Grade 11 students about Synthetic Biology (which we prepared for in Week 8).
We acquired new competent E. coli DH5α cells from Dr. Richard Moore and transformed them for the Interlab study. Finally, transformation was successful and there was colony growth of GFP cells. This supports the theory that there was something wrong with the cells that we were previously using. Therefore, for our work throughout the summer we will continue using the DH5α cells from Dr. Moore. Jacob and Sam used the new cells to successfully complete the laboratory component of the Interlab study this week.
Also, we isolated pSB1C3 from RFP E. coli Top10 for use in cloning our secretion inserts in the following weeks.
Week 8 (June 19- June 23, 2017)
To prepare ourselves for work with our IDT constructs, we performed various diagnostic tests with restriction enzymes. pSB1C3-RFP and -GFP were digested SpeI and EcoRI-HF, and confirmed on a 1% agarose gel. After some troubleshooting, we obtained two distinct bands on the gel, representing the pSB1C3 backbone and RFP/GFP insert. This indicates that these enzymes are functional and can be used on our IDT parts.
Outside of the lab, Jacob and Sam completed and submitted the online portion of the Interlab Study this week. Kaitlin and Lalit attended various meetings with other members of the team.
Week 9 (June 26- June 30, 2017)
The digested pSB1C3-RFP and -GFP from last week were run on a 3% low melting-point agarose gel and both the plasmid backbones and the RFP/GFP inserts were excised. Our T4 DNA Ligase was tested by ligating the GFP inserts to the RFP backbones, and the RFP inserts to the GFP backbones. As we expected, bacteria transformed with the GFP insert/RFP backbone grew green colonies and bacteria transformed with RFP insert/GFP backbone grew red colonies. This indicated that our T4 DNA Ligase functioned properly and can be used with our IDT parts.
Jacob and Sam tested out a new protocol for making chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells from Richard Moore, who is part of Dr."

Building Success - People Power!
A critical component of every company is the team that stands behind it. Here at FREDsense Technologies, we have a strong team making this possible. We have both a motivated group of founders with significant experience in both the technology and working together as well as a dedicated group of advisors with varied skills and experienece.
Ownership
The team is a critical component of any business and is therefore of critical importance to ensure our success within FREDsense.  FREDsense was born out of the Calgary 2012 iGEM project, which developed the initial ideas for the technology behind our toxin detecting device.  While the team was composed of over 30 students, six key players have joined together to develop this technology into a feasible business.  Because of the number of students and professors which were involved in the previous year's project, numerous tasks were assigned to determine our group's right to operate within the framework of the iGEM competition.  Our approach to IP protection, and how we have collected our intellectual property can be found in the IP section of the wiki .
Company Structure
The founding members have divided themselves into distinct roles based on experience and skills in order to achieve our goals. These include the roles of Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Executive Officer.

Round table ethics
We, the TU Delft 2009 team, pay some attention to ethics. One of our team members concentrates on this particular subject. In our opinion it is useful to have some ethical discussion within the team during discussion session. Therefore we discuss some ethical issues related to our work. Almost every week we discuss ‘the ethical question of the week’. In our opinion it is good when scientist are aware of the impact which their work might have on the society, therefore it is good to think about the ethical issues of our project as becoming scientists. The aim of the ethical question of the week is to have a discussion within the group in order to see how the individuals in our team think about certain subjects.
What is life? What is synthetic biology?
Week 31
What is life? What is synthetic biology?
What is life? There are two different theories about what life is in our group.  First: a system which is able to take up energy from its environment and creates order form chaos represents life. Second: a system which is able to reproduce, has a metabolism, evolutes and has an organization (order) and is able to survive in a specific environment represent live. This is amore biological point of view toward life.  During this discussion the interesting question arose: is a BioBrick life? The answers was, no a BioBrick does not represent life; it is part of an organism which is a live. So a Biobrick is part of life but it does not represent life by itself.
What is synthetic biology? Synthetic Biology is minimizing real biology. It is also intelligent evolution by rational engineering. Engineering is a very important aspect in Synthetic Biology, its applying engineering concepts in Biological concepts. We all do agree about this definition of synthetic Biology.

The Protein
Analysis
Analysis of Protein
Software
Analysis of the Mtd protein was conducted using our own 'Protein Calculator' software alongside PyMOL. The Protein Calculator allows users to see the potential effects of polymorphic nucleotides in their DNA library on the protein level. The PyMOL software allows users to upload, visualize, and modify molecules of interest in 3D. Together, these two programs allowed our team to locate variable amino acids in the Mtd, as well as predict the effects on binding affinity that the polymorphic nucleotides can have on the resulting protein.
Instructions to download and use our program are as follows. (Disclaimer! There are still several bugs in the Protein Calculator program that are still in the process of being fixed. The dropbox download link below will be updated with newer versions as the fixes are made.)
1) Click the link dropbox link below and download the files.
Step 1.
2) Your computer may display some type of warning- ignore the warning to download the program.
Step 2.
3) Extract the zip file into the directory/location of your choice.
Step 3.
4) Open Sequence.txt to enter the DNA sequence you wish to analyze. Be sure to keep Sequence.txt in the same directory as Protein Calculator.exe. Important: enter the sequence such that it is within an appropriate reading frame (number of base pairs must be multiple of 3), the nucleotides are in all capital letters, and entered in the 5' -> 3' direction.
Step 4.

Electrospinning
Another novel technique involves spinning fibres of polymers similar to those used in polymer anchoring tainted with cells into a nanofibre matrix (Close et. al., 2009). Stretching individual drops of the polymer cell solution by electrostatic means creates the fibres. Work by Salalha et. al. (2006), found that such method allows cell viability to remain for a three month period when stored below -20 degrees Celsius. Klein et. al. (2009) proved that this technique is successful in cell entrapment for use in bioremediation contexts, despite reduced cell activity.
Hydrogels
Many technologies take advantage of the ease of creation of hydrogel structures, such as gel beads, to render cells functionless for use in a biosensor capacity (Ahmed, 2015). As indicated by Flickinger et. al., (2007), the required thickness of these gels creates a high mass transfer resistance. In spite of this, the pores have thin walls and are macroscopic, increasing the risk of contamination incredibly. Despite work by Okamura and Ito (2001) to add crosslinking of molecules to this process, which increased the structural and mechanical integrity of hydrogels (Kopecek, 2007), they cannot be attached to other surfaces as would be required in this context (Flickinger et. al., (2007).
Latex
Flickinger et. al. (2007), presented a novel way to immobilize cells via the creation of a nanoporous latex biocoating. The method involves creating a mixture of latex enhanced with carbohydrate complexes and cells (50% v), and rolling it on any surface using a Meyer pull-down rolling system to a thickness of less than 100um. Upon setting, the presence of polymer particles allows for the formation of nanopores that will allow small micromolecules such as ethylene in, but will be too small to allow cells to permeate out. These nanopores also allow for nutrients to reach the cells to increase the shelf life of the coatings. The drying process results in desiccation of the cells such that they can no longer replicate, but can still retain protein/transcribing functions. The cells are thus permanently immobilised in the coating. Such method has a low capital cost, and is very resource efficient.

QUESTION(THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO ASK THE OTHER TEAMS):
WE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME OF MAKING PLASMID DNA. HOW IS YOUR WORK OF ASSEMBLY GOING ALONG? WHAT KIND OF METHOD DO YOU TAKE IF FAVORABLE?
One E.coli-one function theory. We make various systems by interaction of cell-cell communication. We keep one function in one E.coli. This means to make simple plasmid. The following is one example. We’d like to collect cadmium in water. Therefore we use two kinds o f E.coli. One catches C admium. The o ther a ttracts all E.coli b y using chemoattractant. Catches E.coli displays metallothionein a protein combines a heavy metal. Cadmium is a kind of heavy metal. The other synthesizes aspartic acid (Asp) one kind of chemoattractant. All E.coli gather in the E.coli synthesizes Asp. To use these E.coli, finally cadmium will be caught.
Plan for future steps: We’d like to apply many kinds of organisms synthesize by using chemoattractant, hormone and so on. And we’d like to pervade and develop this simple system.

Our team was established in November 2013 when iGEM 2013 has just finished. And we spent two w eeks got on well with each other, acquainting with iGEM and summarized projects done previously. In the winter vacation, we were asked to learn the introduction of synthetic biology, molecular biology and bacterial genetic engineering. Later, standardized experiment was organized in our lab, and we all enjoyed success. In March to May, brainstorming played an important part in our work along with some human practice activity, which was a tough time for us to think, design and discuss. And finally, time for experimenting in lab goes as today.

Samples were separated by 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-NoVLP polyclonal antibodies (rabbit) was used for the detection. A single clear band was observed at 58 kDa. 1. Protein size marker, 2. NoVLP
We observed a single band at 58 kDa. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the monomer of capsid protein VP1, which makes up NoVLP [13].  There were no clear indication of small peptides that could mean occurrence of degradation. Thus we used this for the next assay.
We then tested the functionality of scFv to bind to NoV. To this end, we prepared INPNC-His- and BclA-His-scFv expressing E. coli and incubated them with NoVLP. We then used low-speed centrifugation to recollect E. coli together with bound NoVLP, and removed the supernatants which should contain unbound NoVLP. We observed the cells with SEM (Fig12).

As shown clearly in the pictures, we observed a characteristic spherical objects in extremely close proximity to the cell surface of the INPNC-His-scFv expressing E. coli. We could not observe a similar phenomenon with BclA-His-scFv, presumably due to the cleavage in the cell (Fig8, lane BclA-His-scFv) and absence in the membrane fraction (Fig10 lane 4, see signals at 33 kDa). This spherical objects match size with the reported size of the recombinant NoVLP, which is from 40 to 100 nm [14]. Furthermore, as it matches in form with the spherical objects observed in samples only with NoVLP, we concluded this spherical object as the NoVLP, and concluded that the INPNC-His-scFv expressing E. coli bound to NoVLP successfully.

We decided to prioritize the assembly of one construct, the melanin construct, because black is the most commonly used ink colour. We designed a g-block to contain assembled promoter, RBS, melA and terminator parts, including the BioBrick prefix and suffix sequences. We first cloned that into the pJET plasmid using the ligation kit from Thermo-Fisher Scientific. We chose this method because this kit is very efficient and it would improve our chances of successful assembly. We did succeed in inserting the melA construct into pJET (Figure 1).
Figure 1. 1% agarose gel of melA_pJET digested with EcoRI and PstI. Plasmids 1 and 3 had the melA construct successfully insert into pJET without disruption of the cut sites.
We then proceeded through cloning methods to finally insert the melA expression construct into pSB1C3 for submission to the iGEM registry. Were able to generate two successful clones (Figure 2, melA_pSC1C3 5 and 6, boxed). One of these clones was sequence confirmed and submitted to the Parts Registry ( BBa_K2481108 ).

We transformed the melA_pJET plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) and attempted to overexpress the MelA tyrosinase (~54kDa) and produce the pigment melanin. Four colonies from the transformation were picked and used to produce pre-cultures, which were then used to incoulate test expression cultures. During the test expression, cultures were also supplied with CuSO4 and extra tyrosine, as tyrosine is the substrate for MelA and Cu2+ is a cofactor of the enzyme. Cultures were induced with IPTG at OD600 ~1 and a 1OD sample was taken (T0). Another 1OD sample was taken after the cultures were left"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 1906. .  The readers became aware of unsanitary practices in the American food industry. Sinclair was considered a whistleblower, having exposed the practices of the food industry. After the act of 1906, we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time, this concern became the driving force behind the development of pesticides, and to a certain extent, GMO. With the introduction of these solutions to food purity, a new and opposite response could quickly be observed in the public. With pesticides and GMO, the public quickly grew concerned that food would be unnatural, and thus we can observe what is known as a reverse halo effect Konnikova M. The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s. THE NEW YORKER. 2013. .  A reverse halo effect is defined by the unconscious creation of a negative assumption based on a positive evaluation. In this case, the positive evaluation, would be the ensured purity and health benefits of GMO foods, where the negative assumption would be the concerns for unnaturalness.
So we detect a tendency in the public to follow a reverse halo effect, which is most often associated with GMO foods. The problem we face today, is the continuation of this reverse halo effect, where the public would receive any GMO device negatively, simply by association to the word GMO. So how do we change this dynamic between GMO and the public?
The conclusion we reached was that in order to change a tendency in public opinion, it was important to educate the coming generations on the possibilities of GMO. Another important aspect seemed to be a general perception of GMO as an unnatural element that would harm both humans and nature alike. As such, we wanted to illustrate how GMO could be used, not to harm nature, but to help lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own PowerLeaf, to show them that this concept, which is considered to be unnatural, could actually be used to help nature.

The rate of transcript degradation is dependent upon transcript stability, which is in turn affected by a number of factors. Although we have introduced these genes on foreign plasmids, the mRNA half-life here is assumed to be that of the mRNA transcripts of the corresponding genes naturally present in E. coli.
The degradation rate, \(\zeta\), can be described as an exponential decay function of time mRNA half-life, \(h\):   $$\zeta = e^{ht}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\zeta}{\rightarrow} \varnothing$$
Translation
Each of the coding sequences in the transcript described above is preceded by an RBS sequence that determines the rate of translation of each protein. The relative RBS strengths determine the stoichiometry between the proteins involved within the cell. Translation also involves a number of players, including the ribosome and tRNAs, but as the kinetic parameters regarding the rate of translation available in literature do not distinguish between interactions between specific molecules, instead examining the overall rate of polypeptide production, our model also only considers the overall transformation. In addition, since we aim to control the expression level of each individual protein, we assign a unique translation rate for each gene  $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{1}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgA_{cyt}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{2}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgB_{cyt}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{3}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgC_{cyt}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{4}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgE_{cyt}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{5}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgF_{cyt}$$ $$mRNA \overset{\beta_{6}}{\rightarrow} mRNA + csgG_{cyt}$$
Periplasmic export
Although the ultimate destination of the csgA monomer is the extracellular space, not all of the other proteins involved in the pathway share the same fate. csgB and csgF do operate in the extracellular space, but csgC and csgE are chaperone proteins that remain in the periplasm, whereas csgG forms a channel in the outer membrane.
Regardless of their ultimate destination, all of the proteins must first be exported into the periplasm, since none remain in the cytoplasm. The mechanism by which this occurs is the Sec"

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," infected by the phage population, which explains the constant gradual increase observed in the phage population following its drastic increase around 1.25 hours and the appearance of the bacteria population to be zero.
Discussion
The gradual increase of phage populations proves that it is possible for our system to be sustainable. However, the extinction of the bacterial population (or, at least, the appearance of extinction, as the bacterial population is not actually zero but appears to be zero because at any moment, the presence of bacteria induces immediate infection and lysis) deviates from reality. The model suggests that the introduction of a very small amount of phage into a population of bacteria will cause the bacteria population to reach an equilibrium centered around zero. We do not believe this to be the case in real ecosystems. Hence, we carried out experiments where we collected real data on the interaction between bacteria and phage populations.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Figure 6a.
Figure 6b.
In one of our experiments, we added in the same amount to phages to different concentrations of bacteria cultures. In another of our experiments, we added in different concentrations of phages to the same concentration of bacteria. We monitored the change in the optical density of the cultures over 24 hours to investigate the influence of the initial concentrations of bacteria and phages on how the populations interact. Growth of bacteria cultures in the presence of phages. Figure 6a shows that different concentrations of phages have some influences on the growth curve of bacteria. For each group of bacteria, the highest concentration of phages results in the least amount of growth. (the lowest concentration at the end of data collection.) However, in no instances did the bacterial population perish completely. Similarly, as figure 6b shows, without the presence of phages, the bacteria population grows before reaching a carrying capacity, at which point the growth curve levels off. However, even in the presence of phages, similar growth curves can be observed. There is no sign that the presence of a phage populations causes the bacteria population to become extinct, which our previous models suggest. In fact, the culture with the same concentration of bacteria as the negative control (0.01OD) but with the presence of phages had a slightly higher concentration of bacteria at the end of data collection. Clearly, bacteria and phages can and do coexist. After obtaining these results, we proceeded to improve our model in hopes of explaining the coexistence of bacteria and phages.

The major upshot of this is that the world superpowers become ever more aware of the threat posed to them by bioterror, and as such spend increasingly vast sums of money protecting themselves from the predicted waves of biological weapons set to be coming there way any day. President Obama recently increased the US biodefence budget to $6.48 billion, spread across a number of governmental departments. These are examples of deliberate misuse of the science, but just as dangerous are the risks of unintentional contamination. There is simply no way to predict the effects of releasing a new bacterium, whether entirely or in part artificially synthesised into the natural environment. Whether the ‘environment’ in question is the human gut or a farmer’s field is of little consequence. Mutations will occur randomly - as nature intended - and the bacteria could develop any manner of resistance, virulence or other variation in genetic structure. The consequences of this are totally unpredictable but would inevitably have a detrimental effect on the environment and very possibly its inhabitants.

And so we must ask the question “Synthetic Biology, is it worth it?” The answer is most certainly no. Doing a simple cost-benefit analysis, the numbers simply don’t add upp, and t progress with the same high level of funding in this fledgling field could prove to be a huge bioerror. Of course there are clear applications which in time will be realised by Dynthetic Biology but in our present situation there are more pressing matters for which the money lavished on this new arena of science could be effectively put to use. Possibly it is too late however, and J. Craig Venter is at this moment thinking up future experiments and projects to even further push the limits of our knowledge and break through the social, economical and ethical boundaries placed in his way.

“It's kind of fun to do the impossible!” – Walt Disney
Edible coli is an innovative idea with a big potential to be put into practice as a food source in the future. Results indicate that our bacteria are expressing the self designed protein, which was a major part of the project. But  to complete the development of all our project ideas, and create a fully fledged Edible coli, the following  points must be fulfilled.
UPR (unfolded protein response) mechanisms must be studied further. A result from one of our Western Blot experiments showed a band that fits with the length of a protease, which means that  it might be expressed during the expression of our OneProt.
Transform OneProt into an odorfree strain. Further analysis of the growth of the bacteria, to be compared with the growth curve of wild type K12 MG1655 strain Escherichia coli expressing OneProt.
Isolate and purify Δ9 and Δ15 desaturases and transform them into Edible coli for ω3 and ω6 fatty acid synthesis.
Characterize and analyze the flavor improvements.
Transform cellulases into Edible coli, so the bacteria will be able to break down cellulose to glucose and use cellulose as a carbon source.
We thought about many other potentials of Edible coli. It would be great to design a bacteria that expresses"

Project Vibrio: Bacterial Codon Optimisation
What is codon usage?
One of the fascinating features of life is the universal genetic code.  In all known organisms, from bacteria to man, the same triplets of DNA bases code for the same amino acids.  However this does not mean that all species encode their genomes in exactly the same way.   The code is redundant: a number of triplets code for the same amino acid.  While all species are able to translate any sequence of DNA interchangeably, E. coli prefers to use certain triplets to code for certain amino acids which may be different to the ones we use.  This 'preference' is reflected in the levels of tRNA which match such a triplet.  In this project we resynthesised a number of genes de novo and thus were able to codon optimise them for expression in E. coli.
Improved translational speed
Starting with the DNA sequence of the Vibrio fischeri lux operon found on the NCBI database, we used a number of tools to replace the codons used with the most common codons found in the E.coli genome. To achieve optimal expression of the Lux operon in E.coli, we had the operon re-synthesized after optimising the usage of codons. This conserves the sequence of amino acids in the gene products, but improves the rate of translation, as more common tRNAs"

The iGEM Toronto team has come up with a novel approach to lab safety which takes the form of situational exercises giving users real accident simulation as opposed to the conventional method of reading safety manuals and writing follow-up quizzes. This method has been adapted from paramedic and lifeguarding training. We would be delighted to have you try these out and give us your feedback.

DnaQ926 - BBa_K1333108
Introduction
DnaQ is part of the DNA polymerase III and responsible for the proofreading activity of this complex. The dnaQ926 variant     loses this activity through mutation of two function essential amino acids inside the active site. The complete loss of proofreading as well as the resulting saturation of mismatch-repair makes dnaQ926 the single strongest mutator gene known (Fijalkowska und Schaaper 1996)  ( see her for more informations )
dnaQ926 is part of our genome wide mutator BBa_K2082117, but we also used it as a standalone mutator in BBa_K2082116. After initially     designing our genome wide mutator we looked for mutagensis gene already in the iGEM partsreg and found several candidates.     The most prominent one is iGEM SYSU-China 2014's dnaQ926 BBa_K1333108 .    Furthermore, we use iGEM Uchicago IGSB2014's emrR and dam in our large genome wide mutator.

The PHB extraction experiments have shown us that we are able to produce PHB with our parts. We decided to perform SDS PAGE experiments to verify that our proteins are being expressed. We performed SDS page on proteins samples that we extracted from overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pET29b(+) vector, pET29b(+) vector with phaCBA insert, and  pET29b(+) vector with phaCJ. The results of this initial SDS-PAGE is shown in the picture below.

TMMU-China,2017,Team:TMMU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the synthetic biology, we designed some letter cards. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attentions by showing its fun, following the idea of combining science and art.In the 2016 sports meeting in our university, our team organized a vivid propogation for synthetic biology to students, teachers and many doctors in our subordinary hospitals. We sent letter cards to them and encouraged them to synthesize their own works of art. Delightful, many people were willing to join us to make up a sentence with letter cards. To our suprise, there were two little girls showing great interest in it. With their imagination, they gave us much courage and inspiration.
We are inspired by the term 'Bio-brick'. Assuming that every letter card is a 'Bio-brick', we synthesize the letter cards into a sentence like constructing a plasmid from several 'Bio-bricks'. With limited letters, we can create unlimited sentences just like with limited 'Bio-bricks', we can create unlimited plasmids and realize unlimited kinds of functions. Constructing itself is funny and thought-provoking. And in the process of constructing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, these letter cards will be the carrier of the idea of synthetic biology and our wish to realize all the possibilities with 'Bio-bricks'.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
Nowadays many Chinese don't know what is transgenic technology, and some rumors from the Internet convince them that transgenosis is extremely harmful to human. As many Chinese don't have an objective understanding about transgenic technology, we think it's our duty to publicize correct concepts about it. It's also a good chance to popularize the definition of synthetic biology and gather resource from West China. Coming up with this idea when communicating with SCU_WestChina that hold a scientific exhibition, iGEM team SCU_WestChina contacted other teams involving SCU-China and UESTC_China to make an exhibition together about transgenic technology. We aimed to make the visitors understand what is transgenic technology and get some advice about our project from the visitors.
Eventually, SCU_WestChina got in touch with Chengdu Library successfully. Chengdu Library is a leading city center library in west China, receiving 1,010 million readers in 2016. After several conferences with other three teams, we chose ""genetic modification and health"" as the theme of the exhibition. And then we discussed the content of this exhibition and designed the posters together. The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment, biopharmaceuticals, disease detection"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"
USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis#m_-_-_TEXT.html," 1 and figure 2, we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine input. However, the strength of promoter 1 has no significant impact on the GFP maximal concentration. The heat-map shows that when nicotine input is lower than 3.5e-5 M, the GFP concentration is relative low and undetectable.
In experiment, we use microplate reader to detect the fluorescence intensity of GFP. So the specificity and threshold are restricted by the detection limit and specificity of the device in fact. To fit the real condition in experiment, we need to convert GFP concentration (nM) to fluorescence intensity (au). According to the work of 2016 William and Mary iGEM team, we can build up the function between GFP concentration and fluorescence intensity like this:
Equation 1 GFP concentration to relative intensity conversion
We define fluorescence intensity more than 100 a.u. as significant result because the data of our interlab shows that the basal fluorescence of medium is about 60 a.u. under the same excitation wavelength light. This requirement determines a detection limit of GFP concentration. The lowest of nicotine concentration to be detected is decided in turn:
Equation 2 GFP concentration detection limit
Figure 3 Relative intensity heat-map
Figure 4 Contour line of relative intensity
To get the value of fluorescence intensity of GFP, we transform the simulation data from GFP concentration (nM) to relative intensity (a.u.). Figure 3 shows the change tendency of GFP fluorescent intensity which is similar to the condition of GFP. To identify the boundary of relative intensity 100 a.u., we draw the contour line of 100 a.u. intensity. From the contour line (Figure 43), we find the when nicotine input is less than 1e-3.6 M, the relative intensity is lower than 100 a.u. and the result is not significant enough according to the criteria mentioned above.
In conclusion, the threshold of our sensing system is above 1e-3.6 M nicotine and the threshold does not strongly shift with the decline of promoter 1 strength.
Sensitivity analysis
Last section, we talk about the threshold of the sensing system which is related to the detection limit of sensing system. This part we want to analyze the response of GFP signal to different nicotine input. The nicotine input is set to be within [1e-4,1] M to cover the interval including no GFP response and strong GFP response. Because the interval we set is small, we define sensitivity according to the logarithmic nicotine concentration as the"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," important in biotechnology industry as it takes a long time and to develop a novel product or technology and, also, the cost of that development is extremely high. Thus, a patent prevents competitors from using the patented materials or methods for commercial reasons.
To be patentable your invention should be novel (it cannot be previously published), useful (have a known function) and non-obvious (e.g. obviously combining previously known elements to come to your invention would not work).
The invention can be machines, processes (e. g. therapeutic or diagnostic methods) or compositions of matter (e. g. artificial proteins or nucleic acids, transgenic organisms). However, you cannot patent a product of nature (naturally occurring genes, proteins or other materials), scientific processes or theorems.
2. The first thing you should consider is whether you really need a patent. That is because patents can be very expensive to write, submit, maintain and enforce it - up to hundreds thousand of dollars. Another aspect is that some technologies are not worth to be patented because as they can be “outgrown” quickly, become obsolete or could be used confidentially as a trade secret (for example, software).
However, a patent is a strong selling point for many investors, as they can later be used for licensing and collecting royalties by allowing other companies to use your invention.
We would strongly advise the future iGEM teams to contact their university IP Management Office. Most universities have established procedures and assistants to help you with filing a patent application and explore other opportunities for your invention commercialization.
Our university’s IP Office, together with our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific helped us a lot by defining the patent structure and clarifying specifications and claims of our invention.
3. If you have decided that you really do need a patent, you should then invest a lot of time in searching patents, scientific articles or conference abstracts that may have already described the thing you are trying to patent.
The patent process is expensive and you don’t want spend a lot of time and money for filing an application when there is a previous invention that could prevent your patent or make it extremely narrow.
Also, there always is a possibility that there was already a patent submitted that covers your patent, but did not receive commercial success. If this patent is expired, you can freely use the technology, but, on the other hand, there will be no ways to prevent others to do so as well.
By the way, it is worth to invest the time into the patent searches for a completely different reason as well - they can be a valuable source of knowledge on how to structure the claims and"

Introduction:
My name is Adam Liu, and I am going to be a 4th year EECS student in the fall. This summer I will be working as a member of Berkeley's computational team. With the success of Clotho last iGEM, we have a great foundation to build off of this year. Although there are still a few bugs to fix, we plan to pursue many new exciting projects to move Clotho forward. The team is much bigger than last year, so hopefully we will not be"

We worked all night and morning to research and rewrite the material, replacing all the information relating to Malaria with that relating to Zika. After multiple rough drafts and finalizations, we put the updated kit to action! Each team (Gaston, East, and Duke) hosted a Building with Biology Event where the materials were allocated to participants and discussion ensued. We used these events to gauge the level of awareness, and knowledge, the public currently has about Zika."

In making affected States aware of the unintentional movements, it is necessary to give details of any effects that the organism may  have upon human health.
This means that we must find a method by which we are able to track our bacteria, since, even though our Gene Guard module should prevent the spread of our engineered genes, the unauthorised movement of our organisms cannot be allowed.
This specifies that we have to have some significant scientific evidence for our system's safety before we can consider exporting it to a country that is affected by desertification. This means that we will need to carry out rigorous field tests here in the UK and make all of our data available to the importing government, so that they can reach an agreement independently of us.
The same article requires us to disclose any and all information on the organism in the event of such an uncontrolled spread, including any possible effects on human health. This means that we must also carry out extensive trials in order to categorise any adverse effects on human health.
3. Result
Looking at the legal aspects of preparing a GMO for release has given us an (at least preliminary) understanding of the issues that we need to take into account as we design our project. The precautionary principle outlined the need to prove that our technology is safe before we are able to release it, and this led us to the research that we did on the ecological aspects of our project. This was necessary in order to investigate the safety of our bacteria towards the soil environment. Further work would include a small scale soil test to attempt to uncover any factors that we may have previously overlooked. In addition, we have taken the need for safety testing into account in the development pipeline we have described on the Implementation page.

Establishment of New Human Practice
Here we present an outline of our workshop for the benefit of other collegiate iGEM teams reaching out to high school iGEM teams. We believe that formal collaborations between college and high school represent an innovative new approach to human practices with benefits for both the high school and collegiate teams. This was an effective way for us to engender excitement about both synthetic biology in high school level students as well as for our college students to demonstrate further mastery of the field of synthetic biology in general and their research topic specifically by creating presentations and activities designed for the high school level.
1.  Do an activity that will get the students up and moving. They sit behind a desk all day,You need to get them excited!
2.   Explain the point of the activity in a way they can relate.
3.  Show an interesting video to give them an explanation from another perspective.
4.  Do an experiment to give them hands on experience and a real-life example of your topic in action. This will also give the students a chance to see real culturing methods and use equipment. Be sure to give demonstrations of proper techniques and safety protocols.
5.  As the students finish the experiment, talk to them in small groups about their results. Why did they see those results? The students will be more willing to ask questions and explain what they know in a small group setting.
6.  Introduce the topic of synthetic biology with a short video or activity.
7.  Explain the aims of synthetic biology and compare synthetic biology to familiar concepts, like a circuit.
8.  Introduce iGEM, the aims behind the foundation, and the different levels of competition. Present exciting examples of iGEM projects from other high school or collegiate teams.
Be sure to keep you presentations exciting and stimulating to keep students interesting!
