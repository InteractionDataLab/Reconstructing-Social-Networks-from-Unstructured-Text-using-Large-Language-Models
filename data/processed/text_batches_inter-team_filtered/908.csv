Sonicell project introduces rapid cellular response to a combination of external stimuli like light, ultrasound or small molecules. Our system incorporates a        module for the enhanced sensitivity to ultrasound or other mechanical stimuli sensed by a calcium-dependent reporter. Furthermore we designed a module that can        combine several input signals in a novel signaling pathway/logic professing based on the collection of (split) orthogonal proteases. Those proteases can also cleave        the endoplasmic reticulum retention peptide segment, which results in a rapid secretion of proteins or peptides.
Our BioBrick submission, which consists of 52 parts, therefore represents a collection that covers the broad range the aforementioned tasks aimed to        function in mammalian cells, however many should also function in other types of a chassis. All the favorite parts and a large majority of the rest were successfully tested in mammal cells. The parts can be divided into 4 collections based on their function:
the collection of mechano- and ultrasound-sensing parts ,
the collection of orthogonal split and whole proteases with their reporters ,
the collection of parts for logic functions and
the collection of parts for protease-triggered protein secretion .

Modelling
On this page we will be using a range of modelling techniques in order to attempt to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the star peptide. Firstly, we shall aim to probabilistically determine the shape and structure of the star peptide. Using this stochastic model, we can estimate the diffusion time constant between arms of the star peptide via Brownian motion. Then, we will aim to compare the average diffusion time between star peptide arms with the average collision time of a normal solution and develop a relationship for the efficiency of the star peptide. This in turn will then be applied to the mevalonate pathway. Furthermore, as part of our collaboration with the National University of Singapore iGEM Team , we asked them to develop a simple diffusion simulator. This simulator will assist in gauging the behaviour of molecules surrounding the star peptides.
Characterisation of the Star Peptide
In this section we aim to develop a probabilistic model of the length of each arm of the star peptide, based on the number of amino acids in each arm. Obviously there will be complex interactions between the amino acids which will create a very unique protein structure. In order to simplify this protein folding problem, we will model the star peptide arms as self-avoiding random walks on a periodic lattice. There are a number of assumptions involved that will affect the accuracy of this model:
Static Flexibility
This refers to a random distribution of the bonds connecting amino acids. However, it is highly likely that neighbouring amino acids will sterically interact with one another to make the joining bond deterministic. Despite this, presence of these short-range correlations does not alter the basic random walk character of the chain statistics, it will simply affect the step size. This is because over a range of amino acids, the bonds will eventually become uncorrelated.
Define
$N_{seg}$: The number of amino acids in a segment, where bonds between segments are random
$a$: The length of each segment
$r_i$: The length of arm i, defined as the Euclidean distance from the centre of the star peptide to the end of the final amino acid of arm $i$
Dynamic Flexibility
The bonds between segments vary over time
Self-avoiding random walk

However, our main problem is still the system design which is that the concentration of Carbon Monoxide which will be the inducer of the operon. Also, another problem is that we have to renew the host bacteria regularly.

Background:
In April 2013, human infections with a novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus emerged in China. The laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported from 13 provinces/municipalities in eastern mainland China, Hong Kong, and Special Administrative Region of China.[1] It has caused serious concerns for public health throughout the world. However, there is presently no effective treatment, and an A (H7N9) H7 subtype influenza vaccine is not available. More specifically, as of 28 January 2014, the case fatality rate of all confirmed cases is 22%, but many cases are still hospitalized. Of all cases, 67% were male. The median age of reported cases is 58 years and that of fatal cases is 66 years.[2] As with other types of influenza viruses, vaccination shall be considered to be the most effective measure to control the pandemic of the disease. However, most experts believe that there would be great difficulty in providing adequate supplies of a vaccine if the virus were to develop into a pandemic. Even with extensive antigenic drift and vaccine manufacturing capacity, the global public health community is concerned with the effectiveness of the traditional vaccines, particularly in persons older than 65 years.[3] Besides, biosafety-level 3 (BSL-3) containment facilities should be equipped to manufacture such vaccines. In order to address these obstacles, new strategies for rapid production of H7N9 influenza vaccines are a priority for pandemic preparedness. Influenza VLPs are produced by a self-assembly process when matrix protein 1 (M1), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are co-expressed VLPs.[4] These VLPs are similar to infectious virions in the morphological and structural features, yet are non-infectious particles and have advantages in safety and manufacturing.[5]

Week of July 2nd: Understanding Eugene Code and Generating Permutations
Monday, 7/2: I continued looking into Eugene, and reviewed the Optimus Primer code from last year.  I'm anticipating getting into the nitty-gritty details of the coding soon, but understanding the primer designer code is proving to be difficult.  The importance of commenting code cannot be understated right now.
Tuesday, 7/3: Started working today on the rules and definitions needed to create a Level 1 module.  This should be really interesting since I'm not familiar with C# nor Java nor Eugene yet.  But I'm learning, even if the curve is rather steep...
Wednesday, 7/4: Happy 4th of July!  Kim, Kara, and I saw ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".  There was a very cool tree visualization in one of the scenes that could totally be applied to our troubleshooting tree.  It's interested how a lot of the things mentioned are already feasible in the field of HCI.  Even better? ""Cross-species genetics""... synthetic biology?
Thursday, 7/5: Finished the Level1 module rules for Eugene.  I'm fiddling around with the C# code for displaying the permutations by referencing the primer designer code we were working with last year, but having some difficulties.  I think Casey and I might need to sit down and figure out what exactly is happening before I have a mental breakdown...
Friday, 7/6: I sat down with Casey and slowly got introduced to the C# code for the Eugene module. We ran simulated data through Eugene and were able to make to print the codes in the command window.   I talked to Ernst; the Eugene code will be updated soon, and we can view the sample code later, since it seems we need examples of Eugene in use.  Next step: work on figuring out how product/permute works in the Eugene code.
To do for next week: Start parsing real data for feeding into the C# code, get Eugene to work, contact more PIs/post-grads/grads/profs for interviews on troubleshooting, start working on things for L2 module and primer designer with the background info Traci gave us, and contact other iGEM teams for observations/participation.

Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto_-_-_TEXT.html," gene parts that are necessarily additive. Consequently, apart from using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. Production of n-butanol and lycopene in metabolically engineered E. coli has needed strategic knockouts of genes to direct carbon flux in the metabolic pathways towards the more economically valuable compounds: see Alper (2005) and Atsumi (2008).
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterised the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the BioBrick registry because they do not conform to the BioBrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," fifth year in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies but must of all I am passionate about biology and all its applications. People talk a lot of the progress on phones or computers but it is really amazing what we can do now with just bacteria and designed DNA molecules. That's why I have done iGEM. Furthermore, iGEM kicks you out of your classic lab work to give you an opportunity to design your own experiment. Indeed, during the summer, my big job was to search, adapt, work on and sometimes create protocols for the characterization of our modified curli and also for its chelating power. That makes iGEM a really funny and creative experience. Finally, the best part, the summer lab work allowed me to dance and sing during experiments...Oh that explains why we had a rainy summer !!
Chloé Marquet--Jouve (INSA)
I am a fourth year student at INSA de Lyon, in the biochemistry and biotechnologies department. I discovered the iGEM competition last year, during the European Jamboree in Lyon and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I wanted to join the iGEM team in order to work in a multidisciplinary environment on an project which is combining biology and technology into a product. First of all, I have loved working with all of my fellows. I’ve learnt a lot from each of them, and enjoy all these moments spent together, during this summer : cheering each other in the bad times as partying in the good ones. During my leisure time, I play soccer on the INSA team, that’s why I’ve particularly enjoyed our cloning-and-world-cup nights :)
Yang Zhang (INSA)
Typical Chinese guy with a super power of mental calculation. Don't like to sing or any kind of physical activities. Problem is, this guy is also crazy about biology. So if you see him working in front of a messy lab bench without saying a word all day long, don't be surprised. What else you should know, let me think, let me think...Oh right, he has also written the script of the project presentation video. So I guess he's also a prestige guy. Isn't that annoying?

Social Media
When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu, Sina and so on.
Our holistic propaganda was promoted by professional media, mass media and social media. Via professional media, led by Biodiscover, Antpedia and Biosns, our promotion has reached a great number of professional groups of over 5 million people. Meanwhile, we also required our sponsors that the propaganda would be promoted to all of their customers, ensuring professional groups are included. Moreover, we promoted our project to ordinary people by mass media led by Tencent, which is the biggest news portal of Chinese internet. As statistics from Iresearch shows, up to October 2013, Chinese user coverage of Tencent had reached 89.73%. As for social media, people get access to our holistic by Wechat（with over 650 million users）and Sina microblog（with about 143.8 million monthly active users）. Our news about exhibition was delivered by many 公众号 and retweeted by official Micro-blogs of many enterprise, including a listed company named Guangdong Teamtop Information Technology Co., Ltd.
Here are screenshots and links of the news as follows.
The following media all have completely reported this activity. Only with their help can iGEM, synthetic biology and how we respond to bacterial drug resistance with synthetic biology be showed to public. We express our sincere thanks tothese media for their contribution to popularize synthetic biology.

Ethics Safety
A team is defined by two criteria: its members and the way it articulates itself. Come discover the characteristics of our team…
Team Strategy
Several elements are crucial for the development of an innovative project:
- the concept,
- the theoretical development that enables the building of a prototype,
- the experimental development that enables the validation of the prototype,
- the providing of technical and material needs,
- the foreseeing of ethical and social problems brought by the project,
In this aim, we have structured our team as follows:
A management team, with experience in the development of innovative projects and a full vision on how to deal with them.
A R&D team to validate the theoretical and experimental concept.
A communication team to meet the internal and external needs of the project.

Once colony PCR has been run, one then runs the products on a gel to determine if bands appear at the predicted lengths, indicating whether 1) PCR was successful and whether 2) the transformation was successful.  If the bands match up with expectations, one then sends both the PCR product and the original primers to a sequencing company to sequence the part.
Have to check to see whether the URA, LEU, and TRP (and HIS) genes are in close proximity to each other in the yeast genome.
We found some primers that, while not listed on all of the vector maps, are indeed present on pRS304*, pRS305, and pRS306 flanking the multiple cloning site, and thus the inserted part.  Originally we considered simply using these .  Instead, we consider it.  However, this will only work if the sequence of the vectors are different from each other.  Another consideration to keep in mind is that for extremely large expected PCR products (greater than 5 kbp?)
Checked the replates from two days ago.  All had wonderfully isolated colonies.  Gorgeous streaks.  These transformations were:
Double:
Z0277 + pRS306
nullA + Z0637
nullA + Z0739.
Single:
Z0411 on ZaZar
Z0412 on ZaZar
pRS304* on LaLar
Z0421 on LaLar
Triple:
Z0412 + LexA - tag + DD25
Z0421 + pRS305 + Z0637
Browsing through the fridge, it was discovered that the following parts will require replating as well:
nullR (Z0411) + pRS306 (contaminated, requires trp-, ura-)
ZifA (Z0267) + LexA rpt (DD25), not enough isolated colonies, could be useful in the place of nullA + LexA rpt
LexA (Z0279) + LexA rpt (DD25) (contaminated, requires leu-, ura-)
GliA (Z0277) + GliA rpt (Z0739), an old plate that will be used in the future for testing (requires leu-, ura-)

Failed Reads
Another reoccuring theme was the issues with ”failed” reads. A failed read consitutes a failed characterization of the base passing through the pores, effectively discarding it. What this means is that whatever came through the pore was actually not cDNA but something foreign.
Even though some progress was made creating read-data that passed, the amount of data as well as the issue with consistency in form of duplicate or triplicate sequencing runs made it deemed as not significant enough to carry over to the bioinformatics.

Interview: Mojica
Interview conclusions were:
Mojica agrees that with the automation which Printeria offers the experimental error can be reduced. However, he warned us about the importance of being aware of the decisions to make, even if a device such Printeria is able to do all the process by itself.
To avoid the user lack of awareness, we decided to develop a Simulation tool, so the user could simulate the experiments in silico. Thus, this functionality  provides the user with a quantitative, mathematical description to ensure the rational decision making.
He believes that, from the education point of view, the automation is detrimental to the observation. He also pointed out the necessity of training the teaching stuff, as they are not often used to SynBio.
In order to ensure the students understanding of the biology that is behind each step, we decided to develop a Printeria basic user-guide. Moreover, we implemented recipes in our software tool. Recipes are already pre-defined experiments that include an easy ID name such as “pink colour”, so in this way the most basic user can understand what he/she is printing and so the biological reason of the final result.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," us to spread the interest for pollution prevention, and sensibilize students to the iGEM competition.
In addition to this iGEM week, we went to the Unniversité Pierre & Marie Curie (UPMC) do a presentation to undergraduate students about iGEM and our project, in collaboration with the UPMC iGEM team. This presentation was the occasion to do a team collaboration within our project as well as having the opportunity to popularise iGEM to new science students.
We also organised one of the most successful event of the year with the realisation of the European Experience with the help of another iGEM Evry team. This event was a European jamboree for all the European teams and we were proud to organise it from scratch to its completion as one of our most successful side poroject. We focused on the exchange between all the attendants, being with a full morning of presentations for each team on their stand to other curious iGEMers or with conferences about synthetic biology and its stakes with the exceptional participation of the iGEM funder Mr. Rettberg.
Of course, we did not stop to this quite exceptional event, and we participated to a French conference in the biology field called the “festival vivant” which gathers professionals of the biology field and who are presenting and talking about the potential of bioeconomics, the place of new genetic techniques in ecosystems studies, or the question of the ethical use of biodesign. This event allowed us to meet a large range of people who were visiting the event and we could play a role in the popularization of the iGEM competition and synthetic biology to the public by setting up and holding an exhibition stand about Quantifly. We had the opportunity to meet non-professional people as well as people that were scientists but were not related to the synthetic biology field and we could use this
occasion to explain all the scientific details as rigorously as possible in order to have them understand a project that was at first not accessible to them because of the lack of knowledge in a particular area of work. This was the occasion to render a proper information about the Quantifly project in the objective of transmit precise scientific knowledge to any person in order to make them able to understand this project.
As well as exhibition events and students presentations and talks, we thought another way to synthesize and transmit the concept of our project to the largest number of people, which is the creation of a mobile game application. This project was held by our informatics team, and their objective was to create a fun game where the concept of detecting"
Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Upon binding of a ligand to the Tar receptor, CheA becomes inactivated, leading to a decrease of the BRET signal. Importantly, the signal can be readily measured by using an affordable bioluminescence assay.
Detection of a range of ligands
DeTaXion will ultimately make use of ligand binding domains from different surface receptors, and further modify the ligand specificity of these domains based on prediction using binding-affinity prediction software such as Haddock. Within the scope of this project however, we test the possibility of swapping ligand binding domains to change the type of ligand detected. We fused the Tar ligand binding domain (LBD) to the two-component copper sensitive (CusS) receptor (BBa_K2736109 ). This new hybrid receptor protein detects aspartate instead of copper, and serves as a proof of concept for the ability to create hybrid receptors by exchange of LBDs from two different receptors. The functionality of the fusion protein was verified by using the downstream CusS pathway.
When a ligand specific for the LBD is bound to the receptor, a signal is transduced to the response regulator protein (CusR) which binds to and activates a copper sensitive promoter. Normally, the CusR promoter activates genes involved in copper resistance protecting the bacterium against this potentially harmful transition metal.
In this experiment, the promoter region was coupled to a red fluorescent protein (RFP) sequence. Thus, when aspartate is bound to the receptor, CusR is activated, and the downstream promoter and RFP are transcribed. This way, the expression of RFP serves as an indicator for a functional Tar-CusS receptor. RFP was used as indicator as it is easily measured using fluorescent light microscopy. The custom receptor was ordered at Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)(BBa_K2736109 ) while the CusR promotor (BBa_K608003 ) and RFP  (BBa_K516032 ) were transformed from the iGEM biobrick kit.
Fine tuning of sensor sensitivity
Jos van der Vosse (TNO) suggested quantifiable measurements.  We  therefore decided to implement an additional feature into our biosensor, facilitating the measurement of multiple ranges of concentrations. This method is based on the methylation state of the Tar receptor, which influences its sensitivity to ligands.
In the unmethylated state, the receptor transduces the ligand binding signal to an inactivated pathway (Figure 4A and 4B). Upon receptor methylation, the conformational change required to trans"

Abstract: Based on the observations at intervals of several days, and the photos of the plaque in the process of E. coli and Bdellovibrio group’s growth in the same dish taken at a high resolution for experimental, we use of the image processing functions of Matlab to simplify the statistics and calculate the relative quantities of the two bacteria at the observation time in the dish. The results also verify whether the experimental results conform to the classical S-shaped curve, and estimate the bacterial growth rate in every moment, in order to analyze the bacterial growth’s features under the conditions of the experiments. Key words: Bacterial growth   High resolution photos  Image processing  S-shaped curve fitting.    1.1 The classical model of the flora growth Under normal circumstances, a growth curve can be obtained with the time as abscissa and the logarithmic of the number of viable cells as ordinate. The curve shows the four periods of the bacterial growth and reproduction: the lag period, the logarithmic period, the stable period, the decline period. The lag period is the transient process the bacteria adapt to the new environment after being inoculated to the medium. In this period, the curve is flat"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

This paper also looked at different ways to optimize H2S production. • Something happened over a decade (particularly, see 1995 paper by Erika Barrett analyzing the phs sequence), because by 1999 a study from UC Berkeley, in Keasling lab, had the actual structural genes!

Our project Synsketch is functional and available as a web-app. Visit us SynSketch
Best Education & public engagement
Did the team demonstrate an innovative educational synthetic biology tool/activity?
SKLBC-GDSYZX has developed a synthetic tool called Synsketch, which can help iGEMers design standardized genetic circuits and get better understanding of the experimental principle. The most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts. A brief introduction will emerge if the mouse moves over a part on the genetic circuit. And users can view the detailed information about it by double-clicking the part. Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by one. And the data base, the iGEM official website, is of great authentic credibility. So we carry out a series of educational activities which are based on Synsketch to help promote synthetic biology. Now we are focus on developing Synsketch into an advanced education system.
SKLBC-GDSYZX has carried out many online and offline promotional activities. We cooperate with our school, Guangdong Experimental High School and some other educational organizations to popularize synthetic biology. Our Synsketch education system teaches high school students and university students knowledge about synthetic biology through offline meetings, tutorials and TEDx lectures, which established a dialogue about synthetic biology between our team and the public.
How much did the team accomplish through their HP efforts?
SKLBC-GDSYZX has successfully held several educational activities ( offline meetings, tutorials and TEDx lectures) by now. For example, on May.29th in 2015, we took part in the Science Festival in Guangdong Experimental High School. We divided in two groups so as to popularize iGEM in two different ways. One group focused on creating a pack of cards which was based on synthetic knowledge. We aimed to popularize iGEM as well as teach people some basic knowledge about synthetic. Except cards, we also held a prize-giving quiz. The other group focused on shooting a micro video that introduced some interesting knowledge about biology.

Jonas Kondratavičius
I came from Lithuania to study BSc in Molecular Biology in York last year. I like it in here and I love the birds around the campus although sometimes I feel unexplainable void within myself as there are no pink pelicans in here. My part in the team was cloning, if you have any queries or need some help, contact me at jk798@york.ac.uk.
Ivan Gyulev
My name is Ivan and I just finished my Second Year of studying Genetics at York. I represent Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Language School “Plovdiv” along with my good friend Nik whose biography you can find somewhere lying around. My interests in Biology are varied and numerous. Participating in iGEM and acquiring knowledge in Synthetic Biology has given me yet another perspective on the magnificent science that is the study of life. Among other topics, I am also interested in Evolutionary Developmental Biology. In the future, I wish to explore the intersections of those two disciplines and many more. My interests and hobbies outside the lab include sports like cycling, rowing and weightlifting, and the trademark activity of my hometown – just relaxing.
Ricardo Cañavate del Pino
My name is Ricardo and I am currently studying Biochemistry at the University of York. I am originally from Spain and I am keen on fashion, marketing and botanics. I would like to lead my career into lab research (epidemics, virology and mycorrhiza are my favourite topics at the moment). Feel free to contact me at rcdp501@york.ac.uk

The dominant items can be clearly seen from figure 10. The term 1 and term 4 of equation (12) take the vast majority of the sum of absolute values. Term 2 is very little and term 3 die out as time goes on. Thus, we only retain term 1 and term 4 in our equation.
x(t) = \alpha {{\bf{v}}_1}\exp \mu t + \beta {{\bf{v}}_4}\exp  - {\gamma _P}t\quad(14)
Term 1 is the equilibrium sector of protein expression, at which state the production rate and degradation rate of mRNA, peptide chain and protein are equal. Term 4 is the degradation sector. It cannot be ignored because the lifetime of protein is rather stable that mRNA and peptide chain. Now, the two dominant sectors are extracted.
General Solution
Note that equations (11) to (14) hold only under constant growth rate condition. It can be expected that equilibrium sector and the degradation sector will still be the dominant ones when parameters are time-dependent.
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         {{\rm{n}}(t)}\\                         {P(t)}                         \end{array}} \right) = \alpha (t)\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         {({\gamma _M} + \mu (t))({\gamma _P} + \mu (t))({\gamma _P} + {k_m} + \mu (t))}\\                         {PoPS(t) \cdot RiPS(t) \cdot {k_m}}                         \end{array}} \right) + \beta (t)\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         0\\                         1                         \end{array}} \right)\quad(15)
$\alpha (t)$ and $\beta (t)$ are unique for any given time t, because the two vectors are linear independent. From equation (13) and (15), we can express the situation at time t+dt in two ways:
\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         {{\rm{n}}(t + dt)}\\                         {P(t + dt)}                         \end{array}} \right) = \alpha (t + dt)\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         {({\gamma _M} + \mu (t + dt))({\gamma _P}"

Scientific Background of our Sporobeads
Sporobeads are Bacillus subtilis spores modified so that they can be used as a platform for individual protein display. The aim of this module is to create these spores that display fusion proteins on their surface. There are several different proteins forming the spore coat layers of B. subtilis spores (Fig. 1). The outermost layer, the so-called spore crust, is composed of two proteins, CotZ and CgeA ( Imamura et al., 2011 ). This is why we used these two crust proteins to create functional fusion proteins to be expressed on our Sporobeads.
Fig. 1: Composition of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat ( McKenney et al., 2010 & Imamura et al., 2011 )
Crust Protein Genes Organization
The gene cgeA is located in the cgeABCDE cluster and is expressed from its own promoter PcgeA. The cluster cotVWXYZ contains the gene cotZ which is cotranscribed with cotY and expressed from the promoter PcotYZ. Another promoter of this cluster, PcotV, is responsible for the transcription of the other three genes (Fig. 2). Those three promoters were evaluated with the lux reporter genes (pSBBs3C-luxABCDE) to analyze their strength and the time point of their activation (visit later DATA page). Based on this data, two of the three promoters could be used for expression of spore crust fusion proteins.

One way in which they are trying to tackle this problem is through patient education, however this has only shown limited efficacy so far. When treatment is stopped, the parasite has a chance to recover as it wasn’t fully eliminated from the host and therefore can continue to spread. As previously highlighted Cristian Vallediares also focused on this and spoke about how many people stop taking the treatment. Several stakeholders have highlighted the importance of ensuring that any new medicines or vaccines must ensure patient compliance. Our L.lactis vaccine has the capabilities to be given in a capsule formulation which is easy to use and appealing for the patients.
One key issue which we identified in our discussions with stakeholders was that education is a factor in the spread of the disease. Our team tried to think of ways to tackle this problem. Having spoke to both officials in our university in Ireland and the National University of Honduras, we decided to organise the collection and donation of old, unwanted or unused equipment and consumables from our university. We organised transportation of the equipment with Fyffes.
Some of the equipment or consumables that we donated includes:
Fluoroskan Ascent plate reader
Incubator

The importance of education was apparent throughout the summer. We as a team learned a tremendous amount from molecular biology techniques to designing animations. Our outreach activities proved to be the most rewarding, having interacted with school children from the ages of 11 to 17, we learned about the impact that education has from a teacher’s perspective. Whether it was witnessing a student’s reactions to painting fluorescent bacteria or learning about their ideas on GMOs, we quickly started to appreciate the effect that education can have. In this regard, we wanted to do more, we wanted to foster interest in synthetic biology in people who might otherwise never learn about it. Not only did we aim to foster scientific curiosity, we hoped that by improving the scientific education in the largest university in Honduras that it could have a positive impact on local communities and down the"

Figure 2: Widefield and fluorescence images of silicatein with silicic acid, INP-silicatein with silicic acid and OmpA-silicatein without silicic acid (negative control) at one-third of the maximum excitation energy. Of the widefield and fluorescence images an overlay was made to show the colocalization of fluorescence with the cells.
From figures 1 and 2 we can see that the strain transformed with OmpA-silicatein clearly has a different output from the negative control (figure 1). The fluorescence of this sample is only localized at the cells. This might mean that the Rhodamine 123 has stained these cells and therefore the OmpA-silicatein cells could have the polysilicate layer around their membranes. We cannot distinguish a clear difference between silicatein, INP-silicatein and the negative control (figure 2). The entire medium is fluorescent, which causes overexposure of the camera at high excitation intensity. This might mean that the Rhodamine 123 is not specifically located at the cell walls, but still dissolved in the medium.
Because the cells were analyzed at different excitation energies, so different camera settings, it is impossible to draw a conclusion from solely the images. Therefore, we analyzed the pictures using ImageJ. We normalized the fluorescence intensity of the cells by the fluorescence intensity of the background. With this method, we are able to compare the fluorescence intensities of the cells, despite the different camera settings. The results of this calculation are shown in figure 3.
Figure 3: The fluorescence intensity of our silicatein-strains, relative to the fluorescence of the medium. Fluorescence intensity was measured with ImageJ and normalized over the intensity of the medium (background intensity)
In figure 3 we see that the fluorescence intensity of the OmpA-silicatein strain is significantly higher than for the the silicatein and INP-silicatein strains. The silicatein and INP-silicatein strains have a fluorescence intensity comparable to the intensity of the medium (the background intensity). The negative controls (no silicic acid added, measured at two intensities) have the same output as silicatein and INP-silicatein. Therefore, we can conclude that these strains are not able to synthesize a polysilicate layer. However, we can conclude that the E. coli strain transformed with the OmpA-silicatein plasmid is successfully able"

Feasibility
Interview of Prof. Liu Xingzhong
Our team went to the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science at 10 am on August 4th, consulting Professor Liu Xingzhong about our program in terms of feasibility and operation. He studies the prevention and control of plant parasitic nematode with parasitic fungi. Through this visit, we learned more about plant parasitic nematodes from a scientific perspective with the advice of Professor Liu. In the meantime, we improved our experiment and focused on the solutions to the most pressing scientific problems, to make the program more feasible.
Fig. 3 Interviewing Prof.Liu
Fig. 4 Differences in verification experiment of limonene attractivity to nematodes (a. before  b.after )
We introduced our experimental design and scheme to professor Liu and posed some questions we had met in the process of communication, especially in allusion to the protocols of detecting whether nematodes can be attracted by our attractant or not. Initially, we followed the protocol mentioned by Olivia Margiel [6] that divides the NGM culture medium into four parts, of which the opposite two were parallel controlled so that we could set up two experimental groups and two control groups on one plate. However, professor Liu Xingzhong figured out that there may be some deficiency in this protocol, with which he put forward several improvement proposals. With his suggestion, we changed the method to dividing the NGM medium into two parts equally to serve as experimental group and control group respectively.
Besides，we improved our experimental design in later experiment with the proposal of professor Liu, which in turn, helped us figure out the problem of non-ideal laboratory outcome in former experiments and lay a foundation to the later experiments which turned out to have good results.
Apart from the communication in protocols, processor Liu introduced us his research work as well, from which he made a estimation to our project. He highly affirmed it, considering our project of value in both scientific research and practical application. He suggested us proceed from the reality and he was expecting to see our project moving to the actual"

Image Processing
After running the metering portion of your chip, pictures need to be taken before and after the oil has dispensed all the liquid from the metering section. An image processing software, such as ImageJ is then used to analyze how much liquid was metered and how much was actually pushed.
To analyze the amount of metered liquid, first set the scale for ImageJ in units of microns. Then, using the Rectangle selection tool, draw a rectangle encapsulating the first metered liquid section. This can be seen below:
Using the rectangle select tool in ImageJ to trace the amount of black liquid metered. The area of this rectangle will then be measured using the ""Measure"" tool. Using the area of this rectangle and the depth of the corresponding section, volume of metered liquid can be calculated.
Then, using the measurement tool calculate the area in microns of the metered section. To find the volume of this metered section, use the following formula:
\[Volume Metered (\mu L)=Area(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth(\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{ 10^{9} \mu m^{3}})\]
Repeat this process for each individual metering sections, summing them together as follows to find the total metered volume:
\[Total Volume Metered (\mu L)=\sum_{i}^{n}Area_{i}(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth_{i} (\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{10^{9} \mu m^{3} } )\]
To analyze the amount volume of liquid dispensed, perform the same analysis as before on the image taken after all of the liquid has been displaced by the mineral oil.
\[Volume Dispensed (\mu L)=Area(\mu m^{2}) \times Depth(\mu m) \times (\frac{1.00 \mu L}{ 10^{9} \mu m^{3}})\]
Accuracy Calculation
The metering accuracy can be calculated using the following formula:
\[Percent Accuracy = \frac{Volume Metered(\mu L)}{Volume Dispensed(\mu L)} \times 100\]
The metering error can be calculated using the following formula:
\[Error (\mu L)= Volume Metered(\mu L) - Volume Dispensed(\mu L)\]
If there is a significant error in metering, this suggests that there was either a milling inaccuracy or a leak at a channel and/or valve during the pushing process.

In the beginning of the project I did a lot of fundraising and budgeting to make sure that the financial side of the project was taken care of. That followed by many hours spent on coding the CollabSeeker. I have also taken care of the visual part of our project, designing our wiki, posters etc. And finally, thanks to the InterLab study I did not have to spend the whole summer staring at my laptop!
I joined iGEM because I enjoy learning new things, and that's what iGEM is all about!

I joined iGEM to learn more about biology and lab work. I also wanted to participate in a project that incorporated in itself multifarious activities, such as fundraising, business development, research, lab work, modeling and programming.
My main contribution was helping to gather funds for the team and I can proudly say that we managed to do it well. Simultaneously, I was involved in human practices and public outreach. I also got to do some lab work and was in charge of the Interlab study. I would say in iGEM I learned to be more patient and rediscovered the meaning of perseverance.

Concluding, the CINDY Seq method is outstanding in rapid and simple detection. However, the key of success depends on the integration and implementation of CINDY Seq. With the current technology available, the product is not yet available for household use and should thus come with a service. The outcomes of our value proposition, market analysis and SWOT analysis show that the method will have high potential to be commercialized and that the IP position is strong due to the pending patent. This is further supported by the interest we have received from the industry.

Circuit Design Brainstorming
We spent the day coming up with various mechanisms to express a desired gene in the presence of ROS and heat. Once expressed properly, we would like our marker gene of choice to be expressed constitutively. Following are four proposed mechanisms. The mechanism we have decided to try is the fourth mechanism, which we have named the ""SuperFlp Mechanism."" Below is a diagram.
Basic FLp Recombinase Mechanism: A DNA section that is transcribed normally in the presence of ROS, but there is nothing important downstream. When heated, the promoter inverts (5' to 3' as well as switching strands), leading to transcription in the opposite direction, which contains our desired marker.
IRES Mechanism: The promoter on the strand is ROS activated, but the mRNA lacks a Shine Dalgarno sequence. The SD sequence will be inserted by a heat-activated internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the proper position to result in translation of the marker protein.
Riboswitch Mechanism: The presence of ROS leads to translation of protein A. Protein A is required for translation of the desired mRNA coding for the marker. The mRNA starts with a heat-activated riboswitch flanked by LoxP sites and followed by the Cre protein. So, when activated by heat, the heat-sensitive riboswitch will be eliminated, allowing constituent translation. The Cre sequence is followed by a duplicate sequence for protein A.
SuperFlp Mechanism: (Method of choice) An ROS transcription factor is followed by a riboswitch and a Flp recombinase. In the presence of both ROS and heat, the recombinase is expressed, flipping non-local promoter to the desired position. The big question is whether the Flp recombinase's work will be undone by time or the same Flp recombinase. If the recombination is permanent, the E. Coli will continue to express the desired marker even when no longer in the presence of ROS or heat.

After visiting, We knew that FHB caused by F. graminearum has been a serious disease in Jiangyan district for over a decade. Losses are estimated to be in the millions of RMB annually.
We also gathered information and data on the Fusarium head blight to assist us with machine learning and software.
Workflow of our method
In this method, we first choose ＇小麦赤霉病＇(＇Wheat Scab＇in Chinese) as the key word which will be put into the biggest Chinses search engine -- Baidu. Then we use web spider to get what the search engine returns. And we process the above text, by using natural language processing techniques including but not limited to Chinese word segmentation, word embedding and so on, We will get ＇Relevant Word List＇ and a picture which is called ＇Word Cloud＇ based on ＇Relevant Word List＇.
Word Cloud
iolarge the font is, the higher the word frequency is. From this picture, we can acquire some useful information, For example, ＇长江流域＇(＇Yangtze River Basin＇in chinese ) may imply us that most of the wheat scabs occur in the Yangtze River Basin. Ahd,＇甲基硫霉灵＇(＇Methyl Thiophanate ＇in Chinese) may represent a chemical that can treat wheat scab. All in all, we can acquire some useful information, even we didn't major in Biology before. At the same time, we do another basic work to find ‘Similar Word List’ and build a knowledge graph.
We acquire alomost 20,000 entities from one of the biggest Chinese input meth ods -- Sogou, and then we put them into the biggest Chinese encyclopedia --BaiduBaike which is similar with Wikipedia . In this way, we can get large volume text and then process it by using natural language processing techniques as well. we use word2vec which was developed by Google in 2012 and word segmentation to train a model. We finally get ＇Similar Word List＇, and top 10 words in ＇Similar Word List＇,which are similar with scab and relevant to wheat, are put into BaiduBaike to acquire information"

What we show in our project is only the tip of thewhole iceberg. More possible applications of halorhodopin could benefit notonly synthetic biology but also the human society. Here we propose several moreadvanced applications of halorhodopsin.
Halorhodopsin could facilitate light detection andlight-coupled inter-cell signal transduction. Light signal could be convertedto intracellular chloride level signal, which thus induces Pgaddownstream genes. The target genes could be constructed to accelerate thesynthesis pathway of quorum sensing signals, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones(AHL)1. As a result,one clone of bacteria could be designed as light detector, amplifying andconverting light signal to quorum signal to cooperate with other clones ofbacteria.
Moreover, halorhodopsin is not the only channel thatcouples light to pump ions. There are other ion channels from retinylideneprotein family sharing similar sequences and structures but pumping other ionsusing light, such as bacteriorhodopsin pumping proton ions out of cells2 andchannelrhodopsin non-specifically pumping cations into cells3. Combining pHsensitive promoter4 with bacteriorhodopsinand osmolality sensitive promoters (OmpF, developed by iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei in2008) with channelrhodopsin,  the light-coupled expression platform can beextended to more accurate and more complex regulation, which facilitatesbacteria being more programmable by computer.
Together with channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin alsoenables water desalination utilizing solar energy. Sea water desalination haslong been attractive and difficult to implement efficiently. E. coli which can express halorhodopsinand channelrhodopsin could be one promising way to solve this problem. It ispossible to drive E. coli to capturevarious ions (mainly sodium ions, potassium ions and chloride ions) in seawater and move these ions away by controlling the movement of E. coli. By this means sea water couldbe desalinated for drinking, irrigation or other daily usage.
In conclusion, halorhodopsin could fulfill the needof utilizing light as"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,", buciclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. Since herpes simplex virus TK is able to phosphorylate guanosine analogues, it has been widely tested as a successful suicide gene in combination with ganciclovir, especially for the treatment of cancers and various virus infections, but also as a kill-switch in various iGEM-projects [7] .
Freiburg 2010 has first implemented the fusion protein of HSVTK since it conveys higher toxicity results. Plain HSVTK has only limited kinase activity on guanosine nucleosides. To compare GCV to thymidine, it is 500-fold more catalytic active in the case of thymidine than GCV. The specific mutant 30 of HSVTK attributes besides the fusion with mGMK to an even higher improvement in toxicity. For iGEM, it may be also of great interest to take the mouse GMK since it is soluble in E. coli in comparison to its human analogue [8] .
After successful transfection of mGMK-TK30 fusion protein the following incubation with one of the mentioned guanosine analogues leads initially to monophosphorylation followed by di- and trimethylation by cellular kinases. The trimethylated state is obviously the active form of the prodrugs [9] . Triphosphorylated guanosine analogs like GCV can be incorporated into nascent DNA and lead to inhibition of DNA replication. This leads to cell death [10] .
The Bystander Effect
Toxicity of guanosine analogues on non-targeted cells was also taken into account. The effect of, for instance, GCV on HSV-negative cells seems to be an in vitro result for experiments where cultured cells contained at least 10% HSV-TK-positive cells. Researches address to this phenomenon as the “Bystander Effect”. It is assumed that the bystander effect is based on apoptotic cell death. Apoptotic vesicles of genetically modified cells are known to be phagocytized by nearby, unmodified cells. This could be proved by inhibition of apoptotic vesicle transfer [11] .
The reason for selecting HSV-TK in combination with GCV is a result of its high specificity for the guanosine analogue compared to thymidine kinases [12] . At the end, this specificity leads to directed cell death.
In the future case of implanting printed tissues into a patient, the bystander effect supports biosafety. Like it is in the case with tumor cells, we assume that our printed"

Engineering Open House (EOH)
UIUC iGEM was proud to present an exhibit at the 92nd annual 2012 Engineering Open House, or EOH. Over two sunny days on March 9 and 10, iGEM presented one of over 230 exhibits as part of one of the country’s largest science fairs.
Our exhibit on synthetic biology and the manipulation of DNA fit perfectly with the event’s theme, “Dream, Design, Discover.” At our booth we explained what DNA was to school children and then amazed them by allowing them to extract their own DNA via salt water and rubbing alcohol!
We explained the amazing uses of biobricks by displaying plates with drawings colored by E. Coli transformed with YFP, GFP, and mCherry.
We also discussed the safety and ethics of such genetic manipulations with parents and professors who stopped by our station.

Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#wolfcoli#System_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Then, they introduced a light sensor from a cyanobacterium into E. coli.  The response regulator of phytochrome does not directly regulate gene expression, so they fused a cyanobacterial photoreceptor from Cph1 to an E. coli intracellular histidine kinase domain and response-regulator from EnvZ–OmpR.  Moreover, Cph1–EnvZ chimaeras were then activated by introduction of two phycocyanobilin-biosynthesis genes that convert heme into phycocyanobilin.
In weak red light condition, Cph1–EnvZ chimeras are activated. EnvZ is autophosphorylated and passes phosphoryl group intramolecularly to OmpR.  Then, phosphorylated OmpR binds to OmpC promoter and activates the transcription of the downstream gene. In strong red light condition, Cph1–EnvZ chimaeras are not activated. EnvZ is dephosphorylated, and thus phosphorylation of OmpR doesn’t occur.  Then, OmpR can’t bind to OmpC promoter, Therefore, the transcription of the downstream gene doesn’t occur.
The important point in this system is, light intensity determines expression of the ratio of phosphorylated OmpR.
Band-detect network
Band-detect network exhibits transient gene expression in response to concentration of chemical signals [2].  Previously, USTC(2008) attempted to build this circuit and registered parts for this circuit[3].
According to Basu’s group paper, LuxR, an AHL-dependent transcriptional regulator was used. LuxR activates the expression of cI and LacIM1.  LacIM1 shows weaker repression than LacIWT because it has a lower affinity to lac promoter (Fig. 4-3-5).
Figure 4-3-5.Band-detect network
Figure 4-3-6.Band-detect network
・High concentration of AHL(Fig. 4-3-6a) results in high levels of cI and LacIM1 and repression of GFP.
・At low concentration of AHL(Fig. 4-3-6b),  Lac IM1 and cI are expressed only at basal levels. This enables the expression of a LacIWT, again resulting in GFP repression.
・At intermediate concentration of AHL (Fig. 4-3-6c), this results in moderate levels of cI and LacIM1. However, because the repression efficiency of cI is significantly higher than that of LacIM1, cI"

Krieg im Brutkasten der Biotechnik
An Killerbakterien basteln und Beutezüge simulieren: Die Ferienarbeit von Elitestudenten aus Heidelberg soll jetzt in Amerika am MIT gekrönt werden. Ein Laborbesuch.    Wenn es stimmt, dass der Begriff ""Elite"" inzwischen seinen Beigeschmack an den Hochschulen dieses Landes verwirkt hat, dann könnte es sein, dass das gleiche Kunststück bald mit der Gentechnik gelingt. Erfolg scheint auch hier das Rezept zu sein. Und der ist einer Gruppe von sechzehn Heidelberger Studenten regelrecht auf den jugendlichen Leib geschneidert. Sie sind auserwählte Undergraduates - Studienanfänger also, die schon in den ersten Semestern den Jargon der Postdocs pflegen, deren Ehrgeiz nicht erst entflammt werden muss und die sich deshalb auch ganz ungeniert mit Gleichaltrigen in Harvard, Cambridge und Tokio messen wollen.    In wenigen Wochen wird es so weit sein. Dann nehmen sie hoffentlich auf ihrem Flug zum Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) an der amerikanischen Ostküste mit, was einer Doktorandengruppe zur"

Degradation:
In the degradation part of our project, we introduce a gene coding for an enzyme called microcystinase (MlrA) into yeast cells. Microcystinase is produced in certain gram-negative bacteria and it linearizes microcystins, making them significantly less toxic (Bourne, 1996). We will have three variants of the enzyme to optimize its expression in yeast cells. The hypothesized localisation of the variants are shown in Figure 1.
“ Both the detection and degradation are implemented with the help of modified baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ”
Background
Cyanobacteria and microcystin-LR
In late summers every year, blooms of blue-green algae start to appear in lakes in many places over the world, including in Finland. Blue-green algae are photosynthetic, nitrogen fixing bacteria that live in waters and soil. Especially in the late summer, the eutrophication of lakes provides perfect conditions for cyanobacteria to reproduce exponentially. Even though cyanobacteria are important for the ecosystem because they produce oxygen and fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, they also pose health risks to humans and animals, as well as problems for water industries.
Cyanobacteria can cause skin irritation, nausea, headache, vomiting and even death (WHO, 2003). Cases of human death caused by water contaminated with cyanobacteria have been reported; for example in 1996, over 50 haemolysis patients died due to cyanobacterial toxin contaminated dialysis water (Welgamage, 2012). Each year in Finland, pets die from drinking water contaminated by cyanobacteria. The cyanobacteria also pose a problem for water purification plants, since they need to get rid of any possible contaminants in the water. This also results in significant costs, as plants have to have proper filtration systems. In 2014, around half a million people were left without pure water for two days as a water purification plant in the US was contaminated with cyanobacteria (Plumer, 2014).
These health risks and problems are mainly due to the toxins produced by the cyanobacteria. These toxins, also known as cyanotoxins, can be classified as neurotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatoxins, endotoxins and hepatotoxins.
There are two different kind of hepatotoxins: micro"

UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," up with Sichuan Science and Technology Museum and UESTC-China and organized a ‘Gene Go’ iGEM Day to provide a good opportunity for children to know iGEM. This iGEM Day was so welcomed by children that after the event was released on the online platform of the Sichuan Science and Technology Museum, we received applications from more than 350 families from the registration channel on the first day. At the show case, the number of parents and children who came to the event exceeded 1,000, and everyone was very enthusiastic.
A series of activities
We designed a series of activities such as leaf bookmark making, cell structure fabrication, gene card playing and microscope observation to allow children to participated on their own. During bookmark period, the children showed great enthusiasm and had a great time. Parents were attracted by this fun activity and made leaf bookmarks with their children. After the explanation, the iGEM team members took out the plasticine of various colors and patiently taught the children to make ""organelles"". In the process, the children have a clear understanding of the structure of the cells. After the children made the cells with plasticine, we took the children to observe the real cells with a microscope. The children observed a variety of sliced cells and adjusted the microscope with their own hands. After having fun with real instruments, children’s interest in biology is even stronger. The children understood the tools and approximate processes required for synthetic biology in the gene card game and expressed their strong interest in synthetic biology.
“Cellulose Go”
We organized a vivid children stage show “Cellulose Go”. The story is based on the project of UESTC-China and introduces the relationship between cellulose and lignin and the purpose of their project. After the performance, the host asked the children different questions bases on the drama. The children raised their hands and answered, and a little girl could even accurately tell our lines. Through the wonderful performances and simple explanations of the actors, the children not only gained happiness, but also increased their biological knowledge.
1st iGEM Festival in UESTC
For the pre-iGEMers which is high school students and undergraduates, they’ve already acquired some knowledge of synthetic biology and have heard of iGEM. What we should do is to introduce more details to them and invite them to join us. So we decided to held the 1st iGEM Festival in UESTC and designed two parts, one is game stage and the other is iGEM introduction.
Game stage
We designed 2 games with the combination of iGEM and"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", a list of submitted parts with part numbers, descriptions and links, the medal achieved, and any awards and nominations. Each project was tagged with all relevant keywords, in line with Purdue’s aim of creating a user-friendly, searchable database.
Purdue conducted a continuous culture of a kill switch that the 2015 Purdue team created but never submitted, and sent us the results of their experiment to give us a broader view of the reliability of kill switches, beyond our current scope of KillerRed and KillerOrange.
They followed a continuous culture protocol written by Dan, in which they took the OD of the continuous culture every morning and evening, adding a new flask to return the OD to 0.05 each time to continue the culture. For each day of week 1, and every other day for the weeks following that, they would prepare a glycerol stock of a sample of the culture, then test it in an appropriate way for their kill switch to test if it was still functional, and to what degree it was still functioning. Purdue said once they had substituted out LB broth for yeast YPD media, the protocol was straightforward and easy to follow.
Parts:Glasgow
We collaborated with Glasgow iGEM 2016 to test the efficiency of the T7 Promoter we were using to construct the KillerRed, KillerOrange and Lysozyme kill switches. We new that it was leaky and we speculated that it was reducing the efficiency of our project but we needed proof that the leakiness of the promoter could affect our project. In return they gave us a DH5α.Z1 strain in the hopes it would improve the efficiency of our promoter. After subsequent testing we were unable to express our KillerRed and KillerOrange proteins in this strain. This is the report they sent us for the test of the T7 promoter:
KillerRed and KillerOrange Promoter Efficiency Experiment
Methods
First, we transformed the plasmids for testing promoter efficiency into the E. coli strain DH5α.Z1:
J04450 (RFP with a lac-repressible promoter) in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerRed in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerOrange in pSB1C3
Next, we set up 5ml LB broth overnight cultures in boiling tubes with loose caps at 37°C shaking at 225rpm of:
DH5α, no plasmid

Our Achievements in Boston
GOLD
We did our best to present our hard work and amazing project to the whole iGEM community and of course the judges.
After months of hard work, our efforts paid off. We can proudly announce that we won the GOLD MEDAL!
Nominations
Not only did we win the gold medal but we were also nominated for the Best New Basic Part and the Best Wiki!
We want to thank everyone who made it possible for us to go to Boston and to be part of the iGEM experience!
Achievements
Most important achievements
Knockdown
We designed several shRNAs for a HIF1A knockdown and successfully generated three stable HIF1A knockdown HEK293T cell lines and one stable HIF1A knockdown Jurkat cell line. Additionally we could show that the shRNA does not affect the transiently reintroduced HIF1A in HEK293T cells.
Kill Switch
As a key part of our Integrated Human Practice, we achieved an improvement in safety of our CARTELTM T cells. By stably expressing herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase, we achieved the specific elimination of modified cells via administration of ganciclovir.
Stable Cell Lines
Stable cell lines for promoter characterization, knockdown of HIF1A and a kill switch were generated via lentiviral transduction and sorted by FACS .
Promoter Characterization
We constructed and tested the activation of the promoters CRE, CTLA4 and HRE by acidity, VEGF and hypoxia, respectively. Responsiveness to these inputs was characterized in Jurkat, HEK293T and CHO-K1 cell lines.
Requirements for a Gold Medal
Integrated Human Practice
The goal of CARTELTM is to create a safer immune-based therapy. Hearing many concerns about the safety of our project and conducting a survey , we integrated further safety precautions. The survey also confirmed the importance and the need for immunotherapies, which have potential to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. We successfully tested a construct containing a thymidine kinase which makes our T cells sensitive to ganciclovir induced apoptosis. We went over a realistic embedment"
Utah_State,2013,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," spider silk protein that was approximately 25.4 kDa in size. The parts that were submitted to the registry by Utah State in 2012 are RFC 23 compatible which allows for protein fusions, hence the addition of RFC 23 compatible AMPs to spider silk protein at the C or N terminal would be highly desirable.
The spider silk generator (BBa_K844016) created by Utah State in 2012 was able to produce proteins of 25.4 kDa. An increase of spider silk subunit repeats at the genetic level would enable a larger (and therefore ‘stronger’ fiber) to be produced. This year we proposed to double the number of spider silk repeat units to 8 and attach AMPs to either the C or N terminal ends of the spider silk. The purification of this antimicrobial functionalized silk would be performed with a 10x His-Tag fused to the spider silk, at the opposite terminus as the AMP. The possibility of ""masking"" the properties of the AMP were taken into account with our genetic design, which is why we did not create this fusion protein with the AMP located in between the spider silk and 10x His-Tag proteins. The figures below demonstrate the design of antimicrobial functionalized spider silk.
All constructs were assembled (with RFC 23 standards) in pSB1C3 an E. coli as the chassis. AMP amino acid sequences were first back translated to obtain DNA sequences. In all cases a methionine (atg) had to be added. These DNA sequences were then codon optimized for expression in E. coli using the Life Technologies GeneArt ® software program. Sequences were verified not to contain any illegal restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,and PstI). AMPs were designed with RFC 23 under consideration to allow for protein fusions. In this project protein fusions were important for AMPs to be purified with 10x His Tag, GFP, and also to allow AMPs to be fused to spider silk.

Examples of Misuse of Terminology:
For Composite Parts:
PartID: BBa_S04055
PartName: Synthetic lacYZ operon
This part is functional and responsible for the production of LacY     and LacZ proteins. This part partially fits the definition for “composite     part” but actually should be a protein generator as it fits fully to     the definition of “protein generators”.
For Protein Generators:
PartID: BBa_J45299
PartName: PchA & PchB enzyme generator
The part which is illustrated above actually fits the definition     for “composite part” but in part registry it is classified as protein     generator. This part can be functional but it needs a promoter. Even     though this part is not functional and is not capable of producing protein,     part registry assigns this product as protein generator. We suggest     that all parts in the registry, which are composed of more than one     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.
For Reporters:
PartID: BBa_J04451
PartName: RFP Coding Device with an LVA tag
This functional part is classified as “Reporter” in the parts registry     database. It is very clear that this part fits the same description     as Protein Generator in Biobrick part registry standards. Although,     this part has specific and known functional role, characterizing this     part as a reporter is unnecessary and contributes to the level of complexity     of information provided. Instead, we suggest that this part should be     classified as “protein generator” and related detailed information about     the specific function of this part, should be provided in the part information     page.
In conclusion, as mentioned above we tried to reorganize and normalize     the information about parts which is provided in part registry for 2010     in order to develop our algorithm for the BioGuide application. During     this process, we encountered some inconsistencies and misuses of the     terminology being used and also inadequacies about the information provided     about parts. First of all, we claim that a standard nomenclature should     be constituted for future use in the field of synthetic biology. Based     on the information gathered according to new nomenclature a professional     database should be constructed to address the needs of synthetic biology.     This will enable easy information exchange and exhibition globally.     Secondly, although there are enough information about parts exists on     parts registry database, the information which is provided"

Survey for iGEM TecCEM
The iGEM TecCEM 2016 team reached out to iGEM Concordia to ask if we were interested in collaborating with them by completing their survey. The two main focuses of the survey were self-medication and nosocomial infections. Members of iGEM Concordia completed the survey and gained some useful knowledge by doing so. We learned that a nosocomial infection is a microbial infection gained through medical equipment. For example,such an infection can be caused by the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii. TecCEM iGEM 2016 is working on a project that aims to prevent proliferation of Acinetobacter baumannii. Link to the survey"

Wiki:
Lisa started on reading articles and hasn´t decided which topic she wants to write about. I signed up for repressors in Juliets wiki sheet.
15. sep. 2010 Annemi
Today we have run PCR´s to amplify the promoter region and the repressor region. We used 2µL of Sebastiens Salmonella DNA number 143 as template. (See the lab book for further detail on the procedure)
The program used to amplify the small fragments (ca. 100 bp) are called IGEM TD 100BP
For the larger fragments we used Sebastiens program: SebFC
The products are run on a gel (3-2-1)
We made transformations with the plasmids pSLD20 and pSLD22 in the DH5α. The cells are plated out on AMP-plates (20µL and 200µL)
13-09-2010 Maya (repressor group)
Today me and Anastasiya did O/N cultures of the biobricks that we transformed last week. Tomorrow we need to do a miniprep on all of these plasmids, and also prepare some glycerol stocks. We made double of the O/N so there should be enough if you want each group to have their own sets of purify plasmids.
If the primers arrive tomorrow you should also resuspend them, organize them in a ""repressor group"" box and make dilutions.
I've started on another A3-sheet describing the construction of the three different setups in parallel. Maybe you can continue on that or improve it. The purpose of the sheet is to make it easier for us to see which things should be run in parallel. In that way we can do all the PCRs at the same time and so on.
If you have time Lisa, you can continue on the CLC files. I'll try to finish mine today.
I also think we should find out who is going to write what on the wiki, as I think our group should write about the gifsy1 and gifsy2 promoters, the repressors and the antirepressors.

iGEM community
A fundamental idea in the iGEM society is to increase knowledge within the field of synthetic biology as well as sharing this knowledge with other students and scientists internationally. The participants of iGEM will in the future end up as scientist or in the industry, and hopefully retain the sportsmanship that exist within the iGEM community and spread it even further. By focusing on iGEM community in our Human Practices, we hope to raise awareness of the importance of sharing one's knowledge, both for solidarity reasons as well as making the research more accessible. One example of how we reached out to the iGEM community is our ongoing collaboration with team Czech Republic. We also participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, and shared thoughts and ideas with other nordic iGEM teams.
Our friends in Team Czech Republic
During the course of the summer we have been in contact with first time iGEM participants, team Czech Republic. They initially contacted us because they were interested in our previous project (iGEM 2014 Team Gothenburg), which brought to our attention the fact that their project was similar to the detection part we had designed. Due to those similarities we believed that it would be beneficial for everyone if we could help each other out through the duration of the summer. Our contact has mainly been through e-mail and Skype and the collaboration encompassed different parts of our projects. We helped them out by giving some general advice concerning the competition for instance where to find the free parts we get from the competition and also providing them with our survey so they received something for their Human Practices. In return, they have been helping us with some simulations of the detection system and the modeling people from both teams have been talking to each other during the summer as well. We are very pleased that we got this opportunity to get in contact with another team! It has been really nice and we are all looking forward to meet the Czech Republic"

K2020000
– subtilisin E gene, optimized for E. coli codon usage The gene of this BioBrick can be used to express subtilisin E, which is an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins, in Escherichia coli. To use this part a suitable leader sequence has to be placed in front as the sequence of this BioBrick does not contain a start codon. Its sequence was originally obtained from a wild type Bacillus subtilis but was codon optimized for E. coli. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page and in the section of the related BioBrick K2020002 .
K2020001
– subtilisin E gene, optimized for E. coli codon usage, with leader sequence pelB This composite part consists of the leader sequence pelB ( BBa_J32015 ) and the subtilisin E gene ( K2020000 ) from our first BioBrick. It can be used to express subtilisin E in Escherichia coli and simultaneously secret the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Subtilisin E is an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins. To generate a functional coding sequence that can be expressed in E. coli the leader sequence pelB, which begins with a start codon, was placed in front of the subtilisin E gene. Caused to subtilisin E’s partly toxicity for E. coli, this BioBrick should be cloned into an expression system with an inducible promoter. This should hinder the organism in the expression of the protease during its growing period. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E. Hence, we exchange the promoter against BBa_R"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumor action_-_-_TEXT.html," apoptosis induction after p53wt electroporation.
Back to top
Results [1,2]
Each cell population, which represents different time range of the monitoring, has been subjected to an annexin V assay at the instant looked for. Unfortunately, a wrong dilution of the annexin buffer caused the death of each cell population during the test. Even if results were convincing for the monitoring at +24h, +30h and +48h by simple comparison between the control and the test population in the microscope (figure 1), we could not confirm it by cytometric analysis.
Figure 1 : cells morphology with or without p53 wild-type incorporation
Because we could only start DU-145 culture at the beginning of October, the two weeks needed to reach the necessary confluence did not let us to try a second experiment.
However, several studies showed that to bring p53 wild type into tumor mutated cells launch the apoptosis process. It is notably the case of the study leaded by Chunlin Yang in 1995, who was working, like us, on mutated p53 prostatic cancer cells (Tsu-pr1). The p53 wild type were not transfected by electroporation but by infecting tumor cells by non replicatives adenoviruses containing p53wt (AdCMV.p53). 48 hours after the infection of a tumor population with AdCMV.p53, a high expression of p53 is correlated with an important rate of cell death. If control populations (non-infected cells and cells infected with adenovirus containing lacZ gene, AdCMV.NLSßgal) show a similar and healthy morphology, condensation and cell detachment are observed in p53 infected population. To check if the death process followed by cells correspond to the apoptotic way, a migration on agar gel of their genome has been realized.
Figure 2 : Electrophoresis on agar gel of isolated non-infected DNA cells (a), infected by AdCMV.NLSßgal (b) and AdCMV.p53 (c).
Infected by AdCMV.p53, cells show multiple bands (laddering pattern) while non-infected cells or AdCMV.NLSßgal infected cells show a unique one at high molecular weight. These results indicate that the cell induced by p53 wild type is from apoptotic origin by the genome fragmentation observation, consequence to the CAD (Caspase Activated DNase) activity, a specific endonuclease of the apoptotic process.
A MTT test allowed to quantify the effect induced by the p53 wild type expression into"

Origin of our project
✔ In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.
✔ Both these gases also have detrimental effects on the environment and  our team plans to combat this catastrophic effect by reducing the amount of the NOx and SOx gases ejected through the exhaust vents. For this we have engineered nrfA gene (codes for nitrite reductase) in E.Coli to convert NOx to NH3 (Clarke et al;2008) and for SOx reduction we will incorporate cysI(sulfite reductase) that converts SO2 to H2S (Growth Yields and Growth Rates of. Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Marburg) growing on Hydrogen plus Sulfate and Hydrogen plus Thiosulfate as the Sole Energy Sources, Arch. Microbiol. 117, 209-214 [1978]) and sqr (sulfide quinone reductase) to convert H2S to S. In order to realize the whole sulfur metabolism pathway, we use several bioinformatics web sites such as KEGG and NCBI. We anticipate that the use of genetically engineered bacterium would subside the efficiency of existing chemical methods.
Milestones of the project
• Engineered a plasmid that expresses the nitrite reductase enzyme (nrfA) under a constitutive promoter for high and unregulated rate of expression. We obtained the nrfA coding biobrick from previous iGEM project of Team KENT. The new biobrick we made expresses nrfA which would convert the NOx to ammonia.
• Engineereed a plasmid that would express the Sulfite reductase (cys"

- Transformed cell selection: Transformed cells were spread on LB agar with chloramphenicol (when using pSB1C3 vector) or LB agar with carbenicillin, Xgal and IPTG. Following overnight incubation at 37°C white colonies were chosen (rather than red colonies from pSB1C3-RFP vector or blue colonies from pGEM vector) and subcultured on plates containing the same medium.
- Miniprepping: Subcultures were used to set up overnight liquid cultures in 2,5 ml of LB. Miniprepping was performed using either the OpenWetWare protocol Cfrench:minipreps1 or standarised QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit. Minipreps were then restriction digested and run on a gel.
- Sequencing: size confirmed minipreps were then sent for sequencing at the University of Edinburgh GenePool.
Results
NapC
- Throughout the summer we have managed to clone the napC gene from E coli ( BBa_K917003 ). We have inserted the gene into the standard BioBrick vector pSB1C3 and submitted it to the parts Registry. We have then linked the napC gene to the lac promoter ( BBa_K917012 ) to characterise its functionality.

Lanes 3, 4 = pSB1C3-Plac-lacZ'-napC, clones 1 and 2, digested with XbaI-PstI. Clone 2 looks as expected, clone 1 has an unexpected band around 0.6 kb.
MtrA
- We also managed to obtain the mtrA gene ( BBa_K917008 ) of S. oneidensis and cloned it into the pSB1C3 plasmid.

The obtained mtrA gene contains an internal PstI site which needs to be mutated out prior to submission and use.
CymA
We have managed to clone the cymA gene ( BBa_K917009 ) from S. oneidensis. We have tested the gene for internal restriction sites and linked the cymA gene to the lac promoter ( BBa_K917014 ) to characterise its functionality.

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a tail that will become the overhang and a polymerase that is able to perform uracil-insertion.
We are using the non-commercial polymerase X7, designed by Morten Nørholm [5].
Optional - If the method was used to insert genes into a backbone, with it's own resistance marker, the PCR product were treated with DpnI to digest the template DNA from the PCR reaction.
USER-reaction: Digesting the linearized PCR fragment with Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent (USER) enzyme removes the uracil-insertions. This will produce the required overhangs with the sequence and the length of your wish.
Transformation: The mix is immediately transformed into competent E. coli cells. The plasmid assembles itself by base pairing between the complementary overhangs and ligation is done by E.coli itself.
Advantages to USER cloning
You only need one enzyme
You don't need any ligation reaction
Seamless assembly
Directional
Multiple fragment in one reaction - also in eukaryotes [6].
