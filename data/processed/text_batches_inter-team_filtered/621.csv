Sigma factors recognition
Our program has a correctness rate of 56% in recognition various types of sigma factors. We ran our program with 100 various promoters sequences whose types have already been confirmed experimentally. And we've recognized 56 of them correctly. Specifically, as for sigma 70 promoters, which are the most prevalent, the recogtion correctness rate has reached 92%. The results are showed below.

TFBS Location
We then tested the reliability of our software regarding TFBS location and results show that the correct site prediction rate is 64%. We used the sigma70 promoter sequences with annotated -35 and -10 region provided by RegulonDB to test the correct prediction rate of the binding site of a specific transcription. We input 89 sigma70 promoter sequences and ran our program to precisely locate the sigma factor binding site.
The test results are as follows. The numbers represent the site of actual-35 motif, the actual spacer length, the predicted site and predicted spacer length respectively.

Promoter strength correlation & experiments
To testify our prediction of promoter strength, our team has done a considerable amount of lab work. First, we located the -10 region of the pBAD promoter (BBa _K206000) and accordingly mutated the -10 region into BBa _K1070002, BBa _K1070003, the sequences of these promoters are given bellow (-10 regions are highlighted):

The PCR was set up by poking one colony on the plate: 2014P3:W19O (pBad), vortexing that in 200uL of water. 20uL of this was put into a PCR tube along with 2.5uL each of the forward and reverse 1 in 10 dilution pBad primers.  A ligation was set up overnight, left in the PCR machine at 16 degrees celcius. We ligated the HSP cut with KpnI and XhoI (conc: 16.4ng/uL) into the input backbone (UV+phage activator, conc: 11.5ng/uL). We used 0.65uL of HSP, 4.3uL of input backbone, 12uL water, 2uL ligase buffer, and 1uL T4 ligase.      7/3/14:  The pBad promoter was purified. I eluted with 30uL. Then it was nanodropped, and the results were 33.8ng/uL. The purified piece was run on a 1.5% gel which only had one band right around 150bp as expected (2uL of PCR product was run.)  The pBad promoter was digested with KpnI and XhoI for one hour. 3uL of buffer, 1uL of each enzyme, and 25uL of pBad (845ng).   The pBad promoter was ligated with the input backbone (pACYC184+phage activator.) 0.2uL pBad was used, 4.3uL input backbone, 2uL buffer, 1uL ligase, and 12.5uL water for a total of 20uL.  HSP that was ligated into the input backbone was transformed with NEB 5alpha compotent cells onto two chlor 50ug/mL plates. Their protocol was used, which is the same as ""General Transformation Protocol"" excpet it heat shocks for 30 seconds, uses 950uL of SOC, and when it incubates at 37 for one hour, it is done on a shaker platform. The same protocol was used to co-transform HSP+pACYC184 colonies 1 and 3 with GFP+pBR322 onto chlor(50ug/mL) amp plates.

2) Analysis of midi-prep DNA
a) Quantifying the DNA
The midi-prep DNA, which was now stored in two Eppendorf tubes, was then analysed using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer to check for DNA. The concentrations of DNA in the 2 Eppendorf tubes were as follows:
Eppendorf tube 1 = 118.9ng/ul
Eppendorf tube 2 = 100.7ng/ul
In total, that means we have 219.6ng/ul of plasmid DNA. In the 40ul of solution that means we have 8.784 micrograms of DNA in total. This is sufficient for Bacillus subtilis transformations.
b) Digesting the midi-preps
A sample of the midi-prep DNA was then digested with BamHI and HindIII restirction enzymes. The contents of the digest reaction were as follows:
10ul of midi-prep DNA
1ul of FastDigest HindIII restriction enzyme
1ul of FastDigest BamHI restriction enzyme
2ul of FastDigest 10x restriction buffer
6ul of sterile distilled water
The digests were allowed to run for 1 hour under 37ºC incubation (regulated by water bath)
c) DNA gel electrophoresis
The digested midi-prep sample was then run on agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis - this sample was accompanied by DNA samples from the Sporulation team. The electrophoresis was allowed to commence for 30 minutes under 80 volts to yield the following GelDoc photograph:
The sample that our team is interested in is the single sample on the right hand side. This gel photograph shows two clear faults making analysis very difficult and almost impossible:
The DNA HindIII ladder has either degraded or has been made up incorrectly.
The desired clarity of the bands has not been reached.
In light of this unsuccessful DNA gel electrophoresis procedure, the Metal Sensing team will have to carry out this task tomorrow with a different DNA ladder and with better-made gel.
3) Bacillus subtilis transformations
Due to the unsuccessful DNA gel electrophoresis, we are unable to determine whether the midi-prep DNA is really the cotC BioBrick held inside the pMUTIN4 plasmid. Because of this we will have to postpone the Bacillus subtilis transformations until tomorrow. The overnight cultures, which were set up yesterday, were discarded and fresh overn"

Introduction
We approached cellulose production and modification with several key questions: Which conditions produce the greatest yields? When should we induce over-production? How efficient will our functionalised cellulose be? We performed in-silico experiments, informed by our wet-lab work, to study growth, cellulose synthesis and the activity of our biomaterial. The results were integrated back into our experiments to enhance the production and function of our biomaterial.
Induction Model
ATCC53582 is capable of inducible high yielding bacterial cellulose production controlled by IPTG concentrations. This model predicts the optimal time of inducing cellulose production during bacterial population growth in order to maximise yields.

CBD Kinetics Model
The kinetics of attaching cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) to cellulose can be modelled using differential equations. This model calculates the time required for a specified percentage of binding sites on bacterial cellulose to be saturated given an initial concentration of available CBDs.

Nutrient Diffusion Simulations
This approach simulates the growth and maintenance of cell population under satisfied nutrient condition as well as taking individual cell motility into consideration and attempting to capture the decision making and orienting processes of each cell.

BioHackspace Model
The collaboration is dedicated to provide London BioHackspace iGEM Team an easy approach to simulate the 3D shape of their bacterial cellulose (BC) sculpture.

Nutrition and Plasmid vs genome
Integration of stable extracellular DNA released from E. coli into B. subtilis genome vector by culture mix method.
Nutrition: Rather than the nutrient gradient, we could just spray nutrients on the wall and when bacterial population increases, the nutrient levels would decrease activating a promoter which would activate sporulation.
Bacillus subtilis spores
Alan and Da
Sporulation in Bacillus is governed by SpoOA that in turns activates over 100 genes involved in sporulation.
DNA replication have been linked to sporulation and is controlled by the AAA+ replication initiator protein DnaA. If there is disturbance in DNA replication, then DnaA will activate the sda gene encoding the sporulation inhibitor protein Sda.DnaA was shown to act as a positive regulator of sda transcription when DNA replication is perturbed. Thus,under conditions of replication stress, the Sda checkpoint prevents cells from initiating sporulation.
During each cell cycle the checkpoint protein Sda couples the initiation of DNA replication with the initiation of sporulation. Sda serves as a genetic timer that allows a window of opportunity toward the end of each replication cycle for Spo0A;P to reach the levels required to initiate sporulation, thus ensuring that a cell enters the sporulation pathway when it contains the correct copy number and has completed DNA replication and repair. Disruption of the coordination of replication and sporulation leads to an increase in the frequency of spores with more than one chromosome and a reduction in spore viability.
Therefore trageting or controlling Sda level maybe the key to obtaining high amount of spores, but at the same time running into the risks of low spores viability.
The paper, Bacillus subtilis spore coats in the drop box describle the process of sporulatuion with diagrams and various porteins involved.
Takes about 8h from the time of initiation of sporulation to complete spore formation.
Bacillus subtilis life cycle
Alan and Da
Low nutrient availability leads to low level of DnaA in the cells, therefore no chromosome replication. DnaA can also be regulated  by Soj in Bacillus.
The bacterial cell cycle is divided into three stages: the period between division (cell ‘birth’) and the initiation of chromosome replication (known as the B period); the period required for replication (known as the C period); and the time between the end of replication and completion of division (known as the D period.)

Summary
We analyzed the questionaires the students filled after the lectures, and obtained crucial information about their opinions and intention. Guided by the questionaire, we wrote a report to apply for a specific funding for iGEM-HS in Beijing and began to guide three students from the SHSBNU towards their future participation in iGEM competition.
Questionaire Analysis
In order to more about what high school students thought of Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and our lectures, as well as what supports do they want to get from us, we made a questionaire. After the lectures, 53 students (24 male and 29 female) out of all the audience filled our questionaire.
Questionaire. (Chinese Version)
Questionaire. (English Version)
Figure 13. Questionaires.
The datas are of great help. According to Question 1 and Question 4 in the questionaire, we recognized that over three-fifths of students have not heard of Synthetic Biology and over nine-tenths of students have not heard of iGEM competition before our lectures. Therefore it is extremely necessary for us to popularize the concept of SB as well as iGEM before any other actions. What makes us impressed is nealy 60% of students attended desire to take part in the iGEM competition, according to Question 6, which means our lectures of SB and iGEM did attract most of students' interests and enables us to fulfill our goal to guide them towards future participation in iGEM.
Question 1
Question 4
Question 6
Figure 14. Question Analysis for Question 1, 4 and 6
Furthermore, based on the analyses we made it clear what we should do next. As we could see from the datas, there are 40% of students who are not willing to participate iGEM in the future; actually, only a few of them are not interested in SB or the iGEM, so we decided to analysize the reasons behind. According to Quesion 7, out of all the possible reasons ""Having little academic support"" and ""No funding"" are the most important. In addition, when we managed to find out what supports do students who desire to participate iGEM need,"

Results of Steady State Analysis
Figure 25. Effect of steady state EPO concentration in plasma on the steady state red blood cell count. The blue vertical line indicates the neocytolysis trigger, when EPO drops below 9.8 mU/ml. The black vertical line indicates the EPO level where neocytolysis reaches its maximum rate. Below this EPO level, the neocytolysis level stays a 0.1/day. The red horizontal line indicates the red blood cell count above which the risk of stroke due to blood clots becomes prevalent. The stroke risk occurs at a steady state EPO concentration of 18.3 mU/ml.
When the EPO feedback loop is incorporated, the time dependent model converged to an EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml, just above the neocytolysis trigger. In the steady state model, the red blood cell count is 24.72 trillion total circulating cells at an EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml. The error between the steady state model and the estimated count by Lichtman et al. 2005 of 24.98 trillion  is 1.05%. Due to the large range of red blood cell counts and the low error between the model steady state and the expected average, the model parameters were not optimized to exactly match the expected red blood cell count.
Supplementary Results: Effect of Population Mesh Density on Steady State RBC Population
The density of the population mesh determines how many mesh points each day is split into. A mesh density of 10 means there are 10 points per day (\(\Delta t = \Delta \mu = \) 0.1 days), while a mesh density of 100 means there are 100 points per day (\(\Delta t = \Delta \mu = \) 0.01 days).

Gas was filled at the rate of Rs. 50/Kg. Despite government distribution of free gas connection, most of them did not register and it was attributed to the lack of address proof. On being asked about the government scheme Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, they said that the number of people using wood as fuel has fallen a lot. It was found that nearby government toilets charged Rs. 5 for one instance and it was even unknown whether the ones collecting money are instructed to do so or not.
We told the people about the issues with using wood as fuel, about the breathing problems it can lead to in a long run and also about the pollutants released in the environment as a consequence of such practices. Also we told them about the problems with open defecation since it leads to mixing of toxic substances and harmful bacteria with the underground water resources.

L. lactis has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human disease (Recombinant L. lactis secreting IL-10 for the treatment of Crohn disease, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729872). In the iGEM competition, the 2014 Groningen University- Netherlands team engineered L. lactis to detect burn wound bacteria pathogens S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and to secret antimicrobial peptides and biofilm-dissolving proteins to fight against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections at the site of burn wounds. They also created a smart bandage to contain the engineered L. lactis. The 2015 Utah State University-USA team created phage resistant L. lactis by integrating reporter system and kill switch that can be applied in cheese industry. The 2015 Concordia University-Canada team tried to develop a protein scaffold that can be customized and used by synthetic biologists to perform various tasks.
L. lactis is the first LAB whose genome was fully sequenced. It is easy to be manipulated with many cloning and expression tools, including the nisin controlled expression (NICE) system, the Cre-lox system, the single stranded DNA recombineering method and so on. Among them, the NICE system is the most widely used protein expression system for L. lactis. (Figure 3) It is based on the control of strong nisin inducible promoters (PnisA or PnisZ) and the cognate signal transduction NisKR two-component system. The integration of the nisKR genes downstream of the pepN gene of the international prototype MG1363 yielded the L. lactis NZ9000 strain. Since then, L. lactis NZ9000 has been distributed to laboratories worldwide and has become the “laboratory workhorse” for protein expression and has been used in many physiological studies.
Figure 3 The nisin controlled expression (NICE) system
However, few efforts have been made to improve L. lactis NZ9000 to be a better synthetic biology chassis. Firstly, easy selection and efficient device knocked-in system  have not been established in NZ9000 currently. Secondly, because the NICE system inducer nisin is also a food grade antibacterial peptide, the intolerance of NZ9000 to high levels of nisin concentration compromises the gene expression efficiency. Thirdly, to make proteins of interest function at different places, secretion"

In this project, the ΔI-CM Intein sequence was designed according to [Wood DW et al., 1999] and codon-optimized for E. coli to yield <partinfo>BBa_K300004</partinfo>. This part was designed as an internal domain (prefix and suffix compatible with Silver standard) in order to enable protein coding sequence assemblies to generate the desired synthetic self-cleavable affinity tags for protein purification.
Thus, it is possible to create an engineered protein purification system that uses the tag construct and relies on Intein self-cleaving capabilities. Fig.24 shows a generic purification tag, composed by Phasins and Intein, as an example.
Figure 24: Generic purification system.
Protein purification takes place as follows:
1. Affinity tag (and consequently fused protein) binding to PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (Fig.25).
Figure 25: In vivo binding activity.
2. Cells lysis.
3. Recovery of the fused protein, bound with PHA granules, by centrifugation.
4. Elution in the supernatant of the target protein by Intein cleavage through a pH or heat stimulus (Fig.26).

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#violacein_-_-_TEXT.html," A shows faster production of violacein in cultures containing DNA program. Figure B shows quantification of violacein in samples taken after 24 hours of incubation. The highest yield of violacein production was determined in the culture containing a DNA program. The production was increased 6-fold in comparison to the culture without a DNA program. A significant improvement in comparison to the culture with the scrambled program is also striking, which implies that a correct arrangement of enzymes on the DNA program is important for the progress of the reaction. The experiment was repeated more than three times with similar results.
These results fully confirm the idea of DNA-guided biosynthetic assembly and its usefulness for the improvement of the biosynthetic flux. In addition to the anticipated improvement of the yield, we were very pleased to observe significant suppression of the side products (deoxychromoviridans and deoxyviolacein), which probably also contributed to the increase of the final yield of violacein.
Although the theoretical increase of  the speed inthe biosynthetic pathway composed of a five reactions, the final yield depends on many different factors, including the rate limiting step, availability of the  cofactors,  the initial substrate - tryptophane, etc. We did not have time to perform any optimizations with respect to strains, growth media, temperature etc., therefore the maximum yield of violacein production could be significantly higher. However the experiment was repeated more than three times with similar results.

York,2017,Team:York#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Regression values (y axis) show that TP-Maltose performs worse than TP-Glucose. Hblend-Glucose greatly out performs Hblend-Maltose, but is comparable to TP-Maltose.
Figure 8: Hblend test plate 1. Mean growth rates here show that the growth rate for Hblend-Glucose is much greater than TP or Hblend-Maltose. TP-Maltose outperforms our Home blend recipe.
A T-test was conducted for TP.Maltose and Hblend.Maltose. T-test (Degrees of Freedom = 48, p = 8.82 x 10-10). This indicates significant difference between media types.
Figure 9: Hblend test plate 2. Regression values (y axis), as in figure 7, show that TP and Hblend-Maltose are out performed by Hblend-Glucose.
Figure 10: Hblend test plate 2. Mean growth rates here show Hblend-Glucose out performs TP or Hblend-Maltose with no difference between the latter pair in terms of growth.
A T-test was conducted for the second plate. T-test (D.o.F. = 48, p = 0.058255). For the second plate, no statistical significance between media types was indicated.
Results: Overall, Hblend performs unremarkably when compared to TP media. Despite having much higher micronutrients, Hblend does not perform as well as we hypothesised. Some data collected indicates that a longer run time may have had an effect, but it is unlikely that this would lead to major improvements over the TP media. The problem seems to be the uptake or metabolism of maltose. Conditioning our organisms to grow on maltose may improve growth rates in a co-culture. However, such a limitation may work to the advantage of the co-culture. A key problem to consider was the greatly divergent growth rates between C. reinhardtii and the LW06 E. coli strain. This reduced growth with maltose as the carbon source may provide a sufficient rate limiter on the growth of LW06 to avoid complete culture saturation with the E. coli in future co-cultures.

2.1.3 Appropriate backbone: BBa_J04450
Finally, BBa_J04450 was chosen as original backbone.
This iGEM part enables users to produce the reporter mRFP1, a fluorophore which is an engineered mutant of red fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata. Its reporter is LacI sensitive and can be induced with IPTG.
Figure 9: Map of BBa_J04450, furnished by iGEM parts website
2.2 Insertion of the probe
Our first detector was delivered by Integrated DNA Technologies (figure 10A).
The probe is amplified by PCR, digested with EcoR1 to remove the primers and delimit  the probe with the proper sites, and finally inserted in J04450 plasmid.
All the following experiments have been made on this probe, inserted thanks to EcoR1 site.
Nevertheless, the official detector part sent to iGEM carries a second version of the probe (figure 10B), which has been inserted between EcoR1 and Xba1. The first reason is that insertion between two different restriction sites is much easier (the problem of self-ligation is avoided). Secondly, insertion between EcoR1 and Xba1 allows the compatibility with RFC10 , the most used way of insertion inside biobrick.
Second probe functioning is supposed to be the same than first version though.

2.2.1 First attempt: mass ratio
Cloning with an unique enzyme is quite difficult. Indeed, the vector tends to self-ligate, preventing then the insertion of the probe. To avoid self-ligation, the vector was dephosphorylated (“Rapid & dephos Ligation” kit from Roche industry). Then, the probe was inserted with a mass ratio insert:vector of 3:1, and ligate thanks to T4 DNA Ligase.

The method to detect the β-galactosidase activity can also be applied to detect the enzymatic activity of the b-xylosidase in cell free crude extract of B. subtilis (Lindner et al., 1994). To detect b-xylosidase activity, ONPG has to be replaced by PNPX.
Determination of alpha-amylase activity
The amyE gene, encoding the a-amylase can be used to integrate promoter-reporter gene fusions into the chromosome of B. subtilis . Integration occurs by double-homologous recombination via the 5’- and 3’- ends that are flanking the promoter-reporter gene fusion in plasmids pAC5, pAC6 and pAC7 (Martin-Verstraete at al., 1994; Stülke et al., 1997; Weinrauch et al., 1991). The integration of the promoter-reporter gene fusion results in the inactivation of the amyE gene and the lack of a-amylase activity. As the functionality of the amyE gene can easily be determined by monitoring the activity of the a-amylase, the lack of this enzymatic activity is a good indication for the correct integration of the promoter-reporter gene fusion. B. subtilis transformants that did not integrate the promoter-reporter gene fusion by double-homologous recombination (unstable integration) or not at all are still capable of producing α-amylase.
For detecting a-amylase activity, the transformants and a positive control (wild type strain 168) have to be streaked on agar plates containing starch. amyE-positive strains, which synthesis α-amylase hydrolyse the starch and the bacteria are surrounded by a halo when the starch has been stained with Lugol solution. amyE-negative strains do not hydrolyse starch and show no halo formation.
The Material
5x Lugol (Iodine/K Iodide) solution
Starch medium agar plates
The Procedure
Take single colonies of the B. subtilis transformants and a positive control, and propagate the cells on a line on top of the starch plate. Incubate the plates over night at 37°C.
Dilute the Lugol solution to 1-fold and add 5 ml of the solution on the plate.
The amyE positive bacteria form a halo while those with a disrupted amyE gene should not form a halo.

Part  1. Selection of acid tolerance component ( msmK )
    The key point of this part is selecting the gene related to anti-acid characteristic. Because the mechanism of acid resistance is complicated, and genes are connected to each other, it is hard to  confirm the most significant gene.      Gnomic mutagenesis and high throughout screening are carried out to obtain anti-acid mutant strains with significant higher survival rate under specific acid environment (pH 4.0 ,5h). Then analyze the diff-genes data between mutant strain and parent strain on pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 respectively. A dimensionality reduction model is established and five possible acid-resistant genes are obtained. Finally, with experiment verification and pathway analysis, msmK gene is shown to be the key anti-acid gene.

    The dose of DES for chemical mutagenesis was 0.5% (v·v-1), the treatment was 30 min, and the mortality rate was 85.3%. Under the condition of pH 5.0, two acid-resistant strains were screened from 20,000 strains, respectively. L. lactis WH101 and L. lactis WH102.
    UV mutagenesis
    The UV mutagenesis conditions were UV lamp power of 15 W, irradiation time of 50 s, irradiation distance of 30 cm, and lethality rate of 92.1%. Under the condition of pH 5.0, the acid-resistant strain L. lactis WH103 was screened from 15000 strains.

Eugene - July 9, 2013
Weekly meeting with Ernst and Diana
We brought up some problems we were having with specifying fusion sites in Eugene: how an AE device must go before an EF, and an EF before an FG and so on. The format in which the parts are inputted into the Clotho 2.0 Database has annotations for the fusion sites. So each version of part (J23100_AB, J23100_EB, J23100_FB) must be inputted separately, but the rules must be able to pick which one can fit that particular transcriptional unit. Instead of digging into the sequence property of the parts, we decided to add two extra properties: FSLeft and FSRight, to help match up promoters and terminators in separate but consecutive transcriptional units.
Eugene - July 16, 2013
Weekly meeting with Ernst and Diana
Upon completing and reviewing the scripts we generated for the pRepLib and the Inverters, we found out that the Eugene Rule Engine is not quite able to handle the high volume of possibilites presented by the large libraries we were pulling from with several rules. Ernst has been working on the next version of Eugene which will incorporate a more efficient rule engine. When that is available, he will let us know to try our scripts again. Diana also has shown us some of the progress she has made on the Eugene documentation page. We were very pleased with the professional layout and easy to navigate sections.

The expression of perchlorate dismutase
For the expression of our Pcr construct, we chose to use the iGEM submission vector PSB1C3. Using the Golden Gate ligation method, a single restriction enzyme, BsaI, was used to assemble the gBlocks in the correct order. The BsaI sites, when cut by the restriction enzyme, leave non-complimentary non-palindromic ends. Due to this, the pieces of our construct would anneal in the orientation that we desired: LacIq, PcrA, and PcrA/B.
Transformation of Pcr
The first attempted transformation into DH5α E. coli was unsuccessful. Using a chemical transformation protocol, we were unable to successfully incorporate our plasmid into the competent cells, producing no colony growth on our plates. In discussion with the UAlberta iGEM team, they suggested to try two different things: an electroporation protocol for the transformation of our plasmid into competent cells as well as to use DH10B E. coli as our chassis. In one of our many collaboration efforts with the UAlberta team, they aided us in preforming an electroporation on both DH5 and DH10B E. coli. Fortunately, this transformation yielded colonies for both chassis, albeit only a few.
Future Steps
To validate the effectiveness of our part, a screening test involving perchlorate would be conducted. As we found out in our research from last year, chlorite is more toxic than perchlorate, even at extremely small concentrations. In other words, it is easier for E. coli to survive in perchlorate than in chlorite. The contrast in toxicity can be used to determine whether our construct was successfully incorporated into our plasmid. We would do this by plating the E. coli that contains our plasmid onto plates that contain the threshold amount of perchlorate along with growth media, which is around 0.1 M. If our part works, the bacteria would produce perchlorate reductase and would convert the perchlorate on the plate into chlorite. Due to chlorite’s toxicity, it"

What we have done insofar is focused on two-cell oscillation. Quorum-sensing oscillator is not simply a matter of expansion in magnitude, but a matter of robustness in allowing difference of each individual cell. Moreover, we test the adjustment of phase and amplitude of oscillation in this part.
As we all know, no two things in this world are the same, so do cells. The major difference of individual cell that we take into considerations is twofold:
●Each cell's activity of promoter is varied, so each cell has different rate to generate AHL.
●The initial amount of AHL may be disproportionally distributed among cells.
The rate of generating AHL is closely related to parameter m and n. Therefore, we introduce randomness to both parameters by letting them obey normal distribution, that is:
m(i)= μ1+N(0,σ1);
n(i)= μ2+N(0,σ2);
μ1 and μ2 are the average ability of generating 30C6HSL and 3012CHSL, and normal distribution--(0,σ)--describes the fluctuations of AHL generating rate in individual cell. We then expanded our equations from 2 cells to a population of cells. Each cell share a mutual environment in which we assume that AHL in environment is proportionally distributed.
Figure 16 100 Cells Varied in parameter m and n
The figures indicate that our system can oscillate synchronically being able to tolerate differences among a population of cells. Furthermore, the figures prove that different ability of generating AHLs of cells have nothing to do with the period and phase of the oscillation. We can also see that the oscillation amplitude of each cell is to a greater extent varied when the Variance of interruption is enlarged.
Moreover, we test whether the oscillation is dependent on initial distribution of AHL by changing the initial amount drastically by letting them follow uniform distribution. That is:
Initial(i)= U(0,20);
The results would give evidence to prove that our system can start to oscillate synchronically given variant initial starting numbers.
Based on this distribution restraining the initial AHL concentration in each cell, we simulated out a figure as follows.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then"
Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 15 shows an average 3-fold reduction of fluorescence from S. aureus biofilms when they were cultivated in presence of the bacterial lysate of an induced culture of BL-21 E. coli transformed with  BBa_K2616001.
However, we performed those experiments several times, and the results were not always as concluding. This variability is very likely due to a bias linked to the different approaches used for supernatant removal and washes. When using the flicking approach, we damaged the biofilms. Therefore, we removed planktonic cells by micropipeting. This variability is often encountered when using this protocol, even in Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo's laboratory.
Crystal violet staining
Since fluorescence measurements were not satisfying enough, we tried to improve our methods for quantifying biofilm formation. Thus, we began staining biofilms by Crystal violet 0.1% and measuring absorbance at 570 nm. Again, the results were very heterogeneous between our different experiments, and between the different protocols.
We tried to compare our protocol within the Institut Pasteur, but also outside of it. This was the occasion to collaborate with another iGEM team, namely the team WPI Worcester, who was also working on biofilm disruption. We decided to exchange our protocols. The results of this comparative experiment are shown in Figure 16.
Figure 16: Measurement of the absorbance at 570 nm of S. aureus biofilms after 0.1% crystal violet staining. We compared the washing protocols of our team (in red) with the one of WPI Worcester team (in blue). All biofilms were cultivated with varying concentrations of cell lysate supernatant from a BL21(DE3) E. coli culture induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for RIP peptide production. LS = Lysis Supernatant from the induced BL21(DE3)E. coli culture. NI=Non Induced. Every measurement was done eight times and the bars show the average measured absorbance.
We show that our method gave lower biofilm retention than WPI Worcester's. However, even if we obtained higher retention values with theirs, we still met the same variability, as seen by the error bars. This may be related to the use of various solvents, namely ethanol and acetone in our method, and acetic acid in their case. Mechanically, we applied the same steps in our first approach. Since there was no improvement, we switched to pipetting and then finally back to full tray washing again. Both protocols can be found here .

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal#October_-_-_TEXT.html," a statement on how much more riboflavin our strain produces, because from this method we can´t know if the relation between the amount of vitamin B2 and the peak-area is linear. Nevertheless, it is obvious that riboflavin was overexpressed in a remarkable quantity.
It is although important to notice that the green curve in figures 7 and 8 represents the high concentrated riboflavin standard. A look at Figure 8 and the relative intensities given on the Y-axis, illustrates how much more efficient KRX+<bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> in M9-D5 produces riboflavin compared to KRX+<bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart> in  the wrong M9 and especially compared to wild type KRX.
Biosafety
One day before we pre cultured our bacteria in 5mM D-alanine and glucose medium. After growing we took 10mL of each pre culture and centrifuged the cells for 3 minutes by 6000xg, discarded the supernatant and resuspended the cells in 4mL distilled water. We washed the cells three times. We executed the characterization of araC by cultivation (200rpm) in shaking flasks with different carbon sources (glucose for the first time). We cultivated the different biosafety systems for measuring how the specific product building rate looks like in M9 medium with different carbon sources. As mentioned before, we used GFP instead of Barnase for characterisation. We sampled in regulary intervals to measure the absorbance and the fluorescence.
We tried to insert the Barnase into the second parts (behind the different promoters), but couldn't achive it in the short time.

Using Polymath, we can get the different signal of GFP in different concentration of Arabinose-AraC.
Figure 1 The respond of GFP in different concentration of Arabinose-AraC. Range 0.13 μM~10μM
We can see that different concentration of Arabinose-AraC will affect the maximum amount of GFP production. We also can see that they reach maximum signal at the same time at approximate 60 minute.
Figure 2 The respond of GFP in different concentration of Arabinose-AraC. Range 6000 μM~130000μM
In high concentration of arabinose, we can see that all the line will overlap. The signal of GFP isn’t changing.
Conclusion:
Assume that we want to make a difference in our system, the amount of arabinose shouldn’t be too large, and the interval should be too large either. Because pBAD system is very sensitive to arabinose, a trivial change can result in drastic impact. And we found out that the system would reach equilibrium at approximately 60 mins. So we learned that the kill switch would be activated after 1 hour. So the sampling point interval can be roughly 1 hour.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," results in a system of 92 ODEs (5 for Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, 84 for the cleavage/repair of each site with 0-1 mismatches in the first 8 PAM-proximal nucleotides, 1 for the average cleavage repair of the other 29 062 sites, and 2 for the evolution of Ntotal[on-target site] and NGOI), easily solvable by MATLAB’s ode15s function. The form of the ODEs is set up in the “CRISPRsim.m” file. Another file, “stopevent.m”, allows the simulation to be ended when all copies of the chloroplast genome have been transformed. The completed code can be found in the download link at the top of the page, including a sample file “tests.m” for running the sensitivity analyses mentioned in the next section.
RESULTS & DISCUSSIONS
Initial simulations were run assuming that precisely 1 copy of each cassette (the “driver” and gene of interest) had been inserted into the chloroplast. The number of plasmids inserted into the chloroplast will vary, and future teams may want to build on this section by describing the numbers of cassettes likely to enter the cell by various transformation methods probabilistically. However, if one of the cassettes does not enter the chloroplast at all, a homoplasmic transformation will never occur, so one of each plasmid represents a “worst case scenario” situation for homoplasmy timescales in a cell which will eventually transform.
As mentioned above, initial simulation used a parameter of 0.00027 min-1 for Cas9 translation rate, yielding an estimate of 36h15m for homoplasmy. This was out of line with our estimates based on personal correspondence with several sources for Cas9 cleavage timescales, and so we updated this parameter to 0.0057min-1, which decreased the expected time to 7h5m, more in line with our expectations. This is less than even C. reinhardtii’s shortest possible cell division time, showing homoplasmy to be achievable in a single generation using Cas9. This is a significant improvement on current chloroplast transformation methods, which can take months to reliably achieve homoplasmy.

Cloning:
Our cloning strategy was to replace the “Tinsel” chromophore gene cassette contained in the host plasmid CPB-38-441,with the G-Blocks for Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-) using the compatible BsaI sticky-ends located at the ends of our G-Blocks and the Tinsel gene cassette as shown in Figure 2 below. When transformed and plated, we expected that  ligation mixtures containing equal molar concentrations of  digested G-Block and plasmid would produce an equal number of white colonies (Cld-containing plasmids) and purple colonies (Tinsel containing plasmids)in the presence of kanamycin. We also plated transformations that contained either no DNA or the host plasmid CPB-38-441. The absence of colonies on the former would verify that resulting colonies are not due to contamination. The presence of purple colonies on the latter would demonstrate that the lack of colonies on either Cld plate was not due to failed transformation but rather a problem upstream in the cloning procedure.
The plating results are shown below (Figure 2). As expected white and purple colonies were present for both Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-) ligations. The observation that no colonies were detected on the “No DNA"" control showed that these colonies were not contaminants but derived from the DNA that we added intentionally. The presence of purple colonies on the positive control plate showed that the transformation procedure was functional.  We observed, however, that on our recombinant DNA plates, there were fewer white colonies than purple colonies. Our supervisor suggested that this may be because of partially synthesized G-Block DNA that is missing the terminal BsaI sites.
Figure 2.
Shown above are the  expected fragments resulting from the BsaI digestion of the Cld G-Blocks and the CPB-38-441 plasmid. Both G-Blocks and plasmid have compatible stick-ends that assure their replacement with the Tinsel cassette in the correct orientation and at single copy.
Figure 3. The schematic on the left display the two possible ligation products (gene replacement with Cld and Tinsel re-ligation). Images on the right show kanamycin LB agar plates for the “No DNA” negative control (-)ctrl, the host plasmid control [(+)ctrl], the Cld(-SP) ligation and the Cld(+SP) (bottom right).

Overview
Carboxysome Purification
An easy mechanism for the purification of reengineered microcompartments is essential for good results in our in vitro channeling system.   We have designed a novel methodology for the purification of assembled and functional Carboxysomes. This technique is based on traditional extraction methods like the sucrose gradient centrifugation and new procedures like biotinylation of proteins and isolation by interaction with streptavidin- coated magnetic beads.
INTRODUCTION
Our project is based on the ability of Carboxysome to retain its metabolic properties in vitro. Also,  it has an easy purification. This feature can be personalized or standarized with an industrial production goal and it could give high yield of your protein complex If it is needed.
In order to achieve this aim, we thought about different approaches:
1) Sucrose gradient centrifugation
From literature, we know that Carboxysomes can be purified using traditional methods such as sucrose gradient centrifugation (1) .  In this reported protocol, the cells are disrupted by sonication and after that they are centrifuged and resuspended with different buffers in several steps.  The carboxysome-enriched solution is loaded onto 10 to 50% (wt/vol) linear sucrose density gradients. Consequently, the prominent band near the middle can be isolated and should contain the carboxysome structures.
Employing this protocol, the proteins obtained are separated according to size and density, the specificity of this technique is not high enough and it is most likely submitted to human error.
2) Magnetic Carboxysome
During 2011, the Dundee iGEM team worked with Pdu, another published bacterial microcompartment.
In general, they tried to make Pdu magnetic for bioremediation processes. This strategy looked for an easy way of recover a modified microorganism. To achieve this, they attached bacterioferritin (Bfr) from Escherichia"

General questions about the game
About the enigmas:
Do you understand what a biobrick is?
Do you understand what is DNA and what it is composed of?
Do you understand what is a restriction enzyme?
Do you understand what is a chiral molecule?
Do you understand what is a biosensor?
Do you know what is a flagellum?
Do you understand the use of a hood in biology?
Do you understand what is synthetic biology?
Questions about the enigma
One of our goals when creating our Escape Game was to make it completely open-source and customizable for everyone to use. Therefore we are publishing a full guide explaining all of the enigmas as well as the game setup. It is really easy to reproduce, and only requires a limited budget due to the use of DIY equipments. Furthermore, we collaborated with the Valencia UPV iGEM team, and had them test our Escape Game. They presented the game to 20 adults between 18 and 23 years old, with basic knowledge of biology, and got great feedback! Thanks to our collaboration, we were able to ensure the transferability of the game.
Here is the link to reproduce EscapeTheLab!
We created a map of the game, with a short description of all of the enigmas, to get a visual representation of the Escape Game.

OLS Canmore
To increase a feeling of unity and to create connections between communities in Alberta, our team decided to collaborate with the OLS Canmore high school team.
After first reaching out to their team, we arranged a Skype conference to discuss areas that we could potentially collaborate in. We eventually decided that our team could help out with Canmore’s lab work on their construct to test out a part they have had troubles with. More specifically, we will be helping to confirm that the cells contain the correct part by performing some gene sequencing. Our team will also be searching for enzyme production.
While our team does this, Canmore agreed to send out the survey that we mentioned before, in order to gain a wider range of responses from it. They will also be looking into the ethical and moral side of bacteria entering the body for us.
As a way to work together on our projects, we decided to create a Google doc between the two teams where we give each other feedback and ask questions about the two projects.  Learning from this advice and critique, and applying it will allow both teams to further their projects in a better way. For example, Canmore’s team asked for more specific details on how our team plans to administer the snake venom in our project. This question made us realize that when explaining our project, we need to specifically address the exact way that the venom will be applied in our construct in order for people outside of our team to understand. Their team also wondered whether snake venom had been used previously in a clinical setting for blood coagulation. Their curiosity for this led our team to research more into this matter. Ultimately, we found out that a team of researchers at Rice University in the US have created a new hydrogel infused with snake venom that is used for blood coagulation, but still has to go through years of testing before it will be approved to be used on humans(http://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-hydrogel-made-from-snake-venom-stops-bleeding-in-"

A knockout of POT1 would enable utilizing the Pex7 import for proteins of interest, which cannot be tagged at the C-terminus with pts1, without having unintended import of other enzymes.
Genomic integration of our novel Pex5 import receptor
After testing our new Pex5 import systems, which is completely orthogonal to the natural import, the next step would be to replace the endogenous system with our artificial import system. Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance (Figure 4). Afterwards the plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain which was created by our collaboration partner Aachen (double knockout strain Pex5 & Pex7).
Figure 4: Design of integration plasmid for integrating our orthogonal Pex5 import receptor.
Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance
The resulting yeast strain allows full control over the peroxisomal matrix proteome, by replacing the whole protein import machinery, which is the first step for creating our artificial compartment.
Outlook
Besides the genome engineering approaches, which were performed in our project one could think of more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering. A final goal could be a “minimal peroxisome”, which contains only the proteins that are required for the biogenesis of the peroxisome and import of proteins and metabolites. On the one hand peroxisomal pathways could be redirected to cytosol or other organelles and one the other hand endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment by changing the protein localization signal in the yeast genome with help of the Cas9 system. All these strategies would allow tremendous improvements for metabolic engineering applications by creating an artificial compartment, which can be rational designed and customized for specific metabolic pathways.
Optogenetic enhancements
Optogenetics provide a useful tool for controlling cellular processes with high spatial and temporal precision. These include the expression of certain genes as well as the interaction or separation of two proteins. As many of our toolbox’s aspects benefit from precise control, we wanted to include optogenetics as a way of increasing its variability. Our plans included optogenetically controlled protein import, control of compartment size and number, and control of product secretion.
Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups: cont"

The transformation (now BBa_K1913005 in pSB4K5) yielded green (and some white) colonies. Taq colony PCR indicated that all tested green colonies contain an insert of the correct insert. Selected 3 green colonies for overnight growth and subsequent plasmid isolation with the Thermo Fisher kit for plasmid isolation. The plasmids were sent for GATC lightrun tube sanger sequencing.

Subpopulation testing
96 colonies from the transformed subpopulation plasmid were re streaked on one agar plate in a structured way.
Figure 3. Close-up picture of culture plate with colonies containing the subpopulation two-operon plasmid (including the RBS library). The blue circled and (faintly) red circled colonies were selected to be used in separate plate reader experiments.
We started a preliminary plate reader experiment with 95 of the subpopulation plasmid containing colonies. The plate was grown in LB with Arabinose overnight at 20℃ while shaking overnight. Glucose was added to 2 g/L to each well. We then measured OD600 and RFP fluorescence.
The data from this experiment show that the majority of the colonies display roughly the same pattern of mRFP production during growth after Glucose addition. Roughly 4 hours after Glucose addition an increase in fluorescence/OD600 is seen for almost all colonies.
We chose to further analyze a selection of the colonies that either showed a unique response or represented a general response found in many colonies. For these colonies we compared the development of mRFP activity between samples grown in only LB with the selection antibiotic, on the same medium with L-Arabinose and on medium with L-Arabinose and Glucose.
According to our expectation, glucose repression should lead to a subset of cells starting to produce substantial levels of mRFP. Therefore, addition of glucose should increase the total mRFP activity in the population. This is not clearly found in our results, but the development of mRFP activity in colonies B6, C10, E11 and H9 preliminarily suggests an increase in fluorescence in samples with Glucose starting after approximately 11 hours relative to the samples lacking Glucose.
Up to now, we only described experiments that measure the population-wide response in mRFP activity. Of course, subpopulations could only really be observed when fluorescence is assessed for individual cells."

Also, it is relevant to mention that E. amylovora counts with four virulence factors, which play an important role in its pathogenicity. The first two are the injectisome and the secretion of exopolysaccharides (EPS), both produced via quorum sensing. The other two factors, biofilm formation, and motility are regulated by the concentration of C-di-GMP. As a solution to this problem, we propose the use of synthetic biology to attack these virulence factors, this proposal will be thoroughly explained in the detailed project description.
Detailed Project Description
The four virulence factors of Erwinia amylovora mentioned before play an important role in its phytopathogenicity, giving it the necessary qualities to become an important threat to the agricultural sector. Our project objective is to dismiss the Fire Blight problem by inhibiting the quorum sensing, biofilm formation and motility of E. amylovora, consequently stopping its virulence. With the help of genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and the iGEM registry, our proposal involves the use of three genes: aiiA, yhjH, and epsE. These genes encode for different enzymes that will inhibit the virulence factors.
During the quorum sensing process of some Gram-negative bacteria (as is the case for E. amylovora), communicating molecules called AHLs (acyl-homoserine lactones) are used. These molecules regulate the expression and synthesis of two key EPS, amylovoran and levan (Molina et al., 2005). The aiiA gene encodes for the autoinducer inactivation enzyme A, better known as N-Acyl homoserine lactonase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates the AHLs, thus provoking the degradation of the communication signals. When the quorum sensing is interrupted, inhibition of the injectisome and EPS expression is expected as a consequence. At the same time, the AHLs inhibition is expected to impact directly in the T3SS. This supposition is based on the recurrent reports that had established a relation between this virulent system and the quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri. Nevertheless, it is still unknown how it will affect on E. amylovora but this can be considered as an opportunity for better characterization of the aiiA gene
Concerning C-di-GMP there we found that it"

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," overhang are complementary and can be ligated together. Each silk monomer was modified via pcr to have one of these overhangs at the 5’ end of the sequence and another at the 3’ end of the sequence.  One version of our silk monomer had an A overhang at the 5’ end and a B overhang at the 3’ end, which we called (5’)AB(3’).  Another version was (5’)BC(3’), and the final version was (5’)CA(3’).  We therefore end up with 3 versions of the same silk monomer.   Making these modifications for all of our different types of silk monomers potentially gives us the ability to assemble a hybrid silk gene composed of different monomers in a matter of hours.  Following restriction digestion of all our monomers  with BsaI  to create the sticky ends, each silk monomer would be able to ligate to the preceding piece due to the complementing 4bp on their ends.  For example, if we wished to ligate a MaSp 2 monomer to a (5’)BC(3’)MaSp1 monomer, we would simply add a  (5’)CA(3’) MaSp2.   With the 3 subsets of MaSP1 and MaSP2, we could eventually program gene sequence of desired physical properties with various ratios and orders of each monomer type.
A key aspect of ICA is that the gene to be assembled is fixed to a solid support as it is being ligated together.  Streptavidin beads act as the solid support in this case.  Conjugating our gene to the beads therefore necessitates an “initiator oligo”, a biotynilated  sequence that contains both the biobrick prefix as well as one of the A,B, or C overhangs at its 3’ end.  An advantage of fixing our growing sequence to the beads is that it allows us to remove all traces of the previous ligation in a “wash” step before adding the next silk monomer to the growing gene.
Fig. 4: Immobilization of the initiator to magnetic beads. Figure from Briggs, et al. [5]
When dealing with repetitive sequences, regular assembly techniques would give products of various lengths due to the uncontrolled ligation among pieces. Another powerful aspect of ICA is that it increases the frequency of producing a full-length sequence that we intend to build. This is achieved by adding capping oligos that ligate to a chain where"

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," 20 days of residue generated in the metropolitan zone of Guadalajara city and up to this date its has doubled. The problem with bagasse is that it is a fibrous organic material but when it is not managed correctly (which happens most of the time) it produces toxic leachates that pollutes soil and water changing their properties and causing bad odors and  proliferation of damaging fauna such as mosquitos (Ramos, 2017).
To corroborate the issue and validate our project we have visited several Tequila producing industries including El tequileño, Camarena, Saro, Tequilera El Olvido and El triángulo, all of them producing Tequila in Jalisco, the state we live in. Jalisco has a lot of small Tequila producers that help to the economy of the towns and the country. They told us how bagasse was a problem for them: they had a lot of bagasse taking up a lot of volume, and it represented a contamination problem for the community due to toxic leakages and mosquito proliferation. Usually the disposal is problematic and they have to pay to get rid of the huge quantities.
We’ve also learned how Tequila is produced.
Plastics on the other hand:
Researchers have found 750,000 microplastic/km^2  in the garbage patch and marine life is plagued by them. Since plastic is not biodegraded it attracts toxins and heavy metals as it travel the seas.
It has also been found that 40% of the world’s oceans are “gyres”,  which are formed when plastic is accumulated in powerful rotating spirals (Monks, 2016).
Compromising biodiversity in  México...
Phocoena sinus (vaquita marina/marine cow) is an endemic mexican species. Fishing their nutrition source (shrimp and some fish species) is one of the main causes for their almost extinction (only 30 are left). The Mexican government is planning on making massive efforts for saving the species; however, after putting it on a sanctuary and achieving the population increase, releasing the species into a contaminated sea, and considering the large percentage of mammals with plastic components in the stomach (Center for Biological Diversity, n.d.), …might seem a bit counterproductive.
Annually 95% of the value of plastic packaging material worth $80-120 billion is lost to the economy. This is especially alarming considering that plastic packaging is, in it’s majority, a single-use product, and becomes even more alarming when the disposal is not properly made and ends up in large bodies of water, affecting the"

We expressed the protein B and C of methane monoxygenase encoeded from mmo B and mmo C genes in protein expression host E.coli BL21 strain. We planned to characterize the proteins in their theoretical molecular weights by SDS-PAGE analysis. However due to technical problems in gel formation we lost samples that we could not reached the data.   We planned another part on kit plate distributions to check works or not. The bacteriophage 21 lysis casette S, R, and Rz (PVJ4) (BBa_K124003). This part was designed by 2008 iGEM Brown team which induces lysis in E.coli bacteria. We ligated this part with ROSE regulated GFP generator  to induce the lysis of bacteria at 42C. Apart from this ligate, we ligated lysis casette with plac promoter and lacZ expressing gene to observe the blue colonies on plates. However we could not observe any blue colony on plates.
Fun & Learn
Flashmob!
In order to reach more people from several age groups, we have organized a flashmob activity which is related with our project -in molecular level-. (A flashmob is an activity done by a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place , perform an unusual and sometimes seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, artistic expression. Flashmob activities are organized via telecommunications , social media , or viral emails ).One of our group member who is also a member of Flashmob society in Ankara helped us for arrangements. We use flashmob activity in order to explain what our project is and  to increase the public awareness about Synthetic Biology and especially about our project. Flashmob event took place at  one of the biggest shopping malls in Ankara where people often strolled around.  Afterwards, we had interviewed with people who watched  our sketch and informed people about nearly limitless capabilities of synthetic biology.  Indeed we prepared handouts that contains interesting statistical data about methane and its side effects, also information about iGEM and about our project.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body, hair growing on the patches may also turn white1.
Population surveys have shown that Vitiligo patients first outbreak is seen before the age of 20 in 50 % of the cases, and 70-80 before the age of 30. So it is relatively uncommon with Vitiligo outbreaks in mid-age. Both sexes in adults and children are affected in equal weights; however studies have showed that females contact doctors in a larger number due to greater psychological and social impact2.
At first, vitiligo can be thought of as a minor disorder, however the effect on patient’s self-esteem and social interactions can be devastating, especially in patients with darker pigmented skin where the white patches can be more visible. There are two distinguished large sub-sets of vitiligo, called focal/segmental vitiligo and non-segmental vitiligo. The former is characterized by few numbers of small lesions while the second form by an asymmetric distribution of the skin surface. Non-segmental vitiligo is correlated to all generalized, symmetrical forms. The course of the outbreak of the disease is unpredictable with phases of stabilized depigmentation. White vitiligo patches that are in an enlarging manner or the development of new lesions are classified as in an active form of disease3.
Currently three major hypotheses of vitiligo have been proposed. The neural hypothesis implicates an accumulation of a neurochemical substance in the form of a toxin from nerve endings. This damages melanocytes and thus decreases melanin production. The biochemical hypothesis suggests an accumulation of toxic molecules from the synthesis of melanin in melanocytes, the breakdown of antioxidant molecules, and the build-up of large amounts of reactive molecules in pigment cells. Additionally, an autoimmune response in vitiligo patients has been proposed. Studies have demonstrated that vitiligo patients have developed antibodies and an activated immune system destructive against the body’s own pigment cells. Other possible causes of vitiligo have been suggested, including impaired melanocyte migration and/or development3.
It might be that the mentioned factors act independently or together to result in the same effect, which is the disappearance of melanocytes from the skin3.
Our research is divided up into two areas, which are long and short time effect on the skin. The long term research is focusing on both the biochemical and autoimmune hypothesis, which is to result in a repigmentation of white skin patches after a longer time period of treatment. The complementary short term research is based on repigmenting the affected patches in the similar effect of make"
MIT,2008,Team:MIT_-_-_TEXT.html,"TG262 is known to be able to replicate in strains of Lactobacillus. Dr. Chris French was very helpful and graciously supplied us with this plasmid. Working extensively with this plasmid with all of our strains of bacteria, we were unable to successfully transform pTG262 into Lactobacillus, and we have concluded that it is our opinion that pTG262 cannot be electroporated into Lactobacillus delbruckii. We have added characterization to this part's main page and user review page, here .
p1025-This sequence codes for a short peptide, found to competitively inhibit binding of S.mutans to the tooth surface (CG et al.; Nature Biotechnol. 1999). S.mutans takes in sugars and secretes lactic acid, causing dental cavities, so introduction of this peptide into the mouth prevents colonies. This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Models
Competitive Binding Model
This model shows that p1025 inhibits binding of s. mutans to the salivary receptors on the tooth surface. p1025 serves as the competitive peptide inhibitor of bacterial adhesion in this model. Our team is the first to not only invent a tooth binding assay but characterize p1025 as a competitive inhibitor.

HUMAN PRACTICE
It is our bounden duty to protect the environment, so that we design this project to treat some of the common pollution problems in our daily life. It’s a vital part of our human practice that we need to understand how severe the pollution is around us. We collected samples by on-the-spot investigation. First, we collected some soil near our school and Guangzhou Steel New Town. Then we went to The Pearl River near Zhujiang New Town, Donghe Surge and Dongpu to take some water samples.During the sampling,we used Five-spot sampling which we learnt at classes to collect the samples.
We went to visit a sewage treatment work. There, we understood the way to dispose the living garbage and the heavy metal garbage in our city. We really walked into disposal site so that we understood how the device processed, how to make the waste water clean and how a process flow is used in industry at present.  They usually use physical sedimentation and chemical decomposition to deal with heavy metal pollution. This treatment is time-consuming, expensive and even less efficient.
We also communicated with other team except interviewing the experts and professors. During the free time between experiments, we communicated with other IGEM teams such as SYSU-CHINA and SCAU-CHINA. Team SYSU-CHINA taught us how to use our plasmids Ppic9k better. We learned something we never met in high school, too. We knew how to make our wiki more beautiful by using knowledge about art design and some skills of using PS, AI and so on from Team SCAU-CHINA.
We helped another IGEM team, GZHS-UNITE, transform a gene named NS1-GFP. They also help to do our research.
In order to understand what attitudes people have, towards our project and the heavy metal pollution in the area where they live. We sent out questionnaires which we designed. We have both online questionnaires and offline questionnaires. With the help of the internet, we have 5900 questionnaires inquestionnaires in 9 provinces. Only through the survey could we learn that people think what is the most critical element of the biological heavy metal pollution"

Genetic Circuit
Elaboration
This is the genetic circuit for Module 3.  Thermally induced genome deletion  is kicked off when the temperature is increased to 42°C.
This construct has two main components. The first component controls the production of restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI.  The second component ensures the production of Dam methylase, which protects the DNA.
Protein production and encapsulation occurs at 28°C. In addition, protein cI857 is produced constitutively at 28°C. It represses the lambda cI promoter, inhibiting restriction enzyme production. The production of Dam methylase protects the E. coli DNA, preventing basal levels of restriction enzyme from causing premature cell death.
When sufficient protein is being produced and encapsulation is complete, the temperature will be increased to 42°C. This results in the denaturing of the cI857 repressor.  This activates the pLambda promoter and restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will be produced. Dam methylase will be insufficient to protect the E. coli DNA from being cut and genome deletion would occur. This causes cell death and destruction of possible pathogenicity from E. coli.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Bio club at UC San Diego. They felt that iGEM was only open to a few due to budgetary constraints, and this was hurting the overall interest for synthetic biology research at our school despite being home to significant researchers such as Dr. Jeff Hasty and Dr. Trey Ideker. Thus, we wanted to implement a long - term vision for sustainable synthetic biology research for interested undergraduate and graduate students.
Design and Dialogue: After speaking with several faculty members in the Bioengineering Department, a major donor for our project, as well as the officers for the Synthetic Biology Club, we saw a demonstrated, unmet need for an accessible space for students and members of the community involved in synthetic biology and learn about research. A large number of students in the Biology and Bioengineering Department echoed the idea that it is increasingly challenging to find lab space in which students can explore their own research interests. There are many clubs and organizations in the greater San Diego area that could utilize a space to host workshops and teach students about synthetic biology.
Thus, we decided to come up with a “wetlab incubator” space where students can design experiments, get departmental approval, and conduct research under the watch of a graduate student or post-doc. To help inform our vision, we spoke with Pengfei Gu, a member of the San Diego DIYBio community, about key points of concern, and the EH&S officer at our school. Based on their feedback, we have suggested the following proposal and are currently gathering student and faculty support before submitting our idea to the Chancellor’s Office.
Reflection: The idea for a Hackerspace came about naturally and intuitively as our team discussed activities for public engagement. There was an obvious need for a creative and accessible space within the synthetic biology community at UCSD and we knew this was something that our campus was ready to embrace. The next step was talking to members of the DIY Biology community and reaching out to resources on campus. At a meetup with biotech industry professionals and UCSD Bioengineering undergraduates, we got the opportunity to speak to Iman Famili of Sinopia Biosciences who gave us very positive feedback on our idea and agreed that this would be of use to the growing synthetic biology community in San Diego. We are fortunate to live in a hub of interest for life sciences, and with that the positive initiatives to support learning in the sciences. For example, we drew inspiration from the La Jolla Public Library Bio Lab and our mayor who was a major proponent of this project, as well as SD Wet Lab member Derek Schaeffer who hosts bioinformatic workshops every month at UCSD."

The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2. Then the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA equilibration buffer . The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA elution buffer step elution from 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) with a length of 50 mL, to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol) with a length of 60 mL, to 80 % (equates to 400 mM imidazol) with a length of  40 mL and finally to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) with a length of 80 mL. This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 2 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the ECOL elution is shown in Figure 2:

Démarche expérimentale
Dans le cadre du design des gènes du bactériophage recombinant nous avons décidé de fusionner la base de penton de l’adénovirus 5 avec la protéine D du phage lambda. L’extraction de la protéine D à partir du génome du bactériophage Lambda a été menée par réaction de polymérisation en chaine (PCR) avec plusieurs paires de primers. La même stratégie a été prise pour l’extraction de la base de penton de l’adénovirus 5 qui a été extraite d’un plasmide codant pour le virus gracieusement donné par le Dr. Karim Benihoud (UMR8121, CNRS/IGR, Villejuif, France).
Après la formation de la protéine de fusion, celle-ci est introduite dans un plasmide BioBrick. Le plasmide contient une résistance contre un antibiotique pour la confirmation de la transfection du phage recombiné dans la bactérie. Ainsi qu’un gène rapporteur tel que la GFP avec un promoteur eucaryote, le CMV du Simian virus 40 (SV40), pour confirmer la transfection dans les cellules eucaryotes.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set"

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human#Containment_-_-_TEXT.html," ground interactions and soil microbial ecology. They both advised us that while it may be more obvious to use naturally occurring soil bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli is less likely to survive in soil and may ensure better containment. Dr Alexandru Milcu pointed out that this is especially important considering that very high auxin secretion may skew plant populations. While this is not an issue in areas where the ecosystem is already badly affected, spread to other ecosystems, especially via spores, is a big issue. Dr Robert Griffiths also advised us that while engineering naturally occurring soil bacteria might lead to better persistence and cause our project to be more efficient, containment would be more easily achieved by using bacteria that do not normally occur in soil such as E. coli as they are more likely to be outcompeted.
These arguments caused us to pin-point our chassis choice on B. subtilis, a natural spore-forming bacterium that naturally occurs in soil and E. coli. We initially codon-optimised our genes for both of these species. At the first human practices panel, we thoroughly discussed the advantages and disadvantages associated with both chassis choices (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Advantages and disadvantages of possible AuxIn chassis
3. Result Containment and possible contamination of other areas is a very big human practices issue. With B. subtilis as our chassis we would never be able to ensure complete containment. On the other hand, enveloping E. coli in a seed coat is mostly  a mechanical issue that we should be able to overcome. We therefore chose to use E coli as the chassis for AuxIn.
Containment vs. bacterial survival
1. Goal One of the main problems associated with using an E. coli (lab) strain as our chassis is its presumed inability to survive in soil for a long time due to harsh competition in the rhizosphere. Although E. coli have been shown to be able to survive in soil for significant amounts of time (more than 130 days in the case of the pathogenic strain O175, as shown by Maule, 2000 (3)), the ability to survive even in manure sludge varies greatly between different strains (4). We want our bacteria to survive in the soil and retain their plasmids for long enough to carry out their function but we also don't want the GM modified bacteria to become established.
2. Action To investigate the survival of lab strains of E. coli in soil, we set up a separate experiment. This experiment was started by our work experience student Kiran and carried on by us after he left"

High Purity Chitosan (Degree of acetylation: ≤90 %)
Our process is designed to produce 25kg per month of high purity Chitosan, making a total of 300kg per year during a second phase. That means we would be entering the market with 4.71% of market share, serving as supplier of high purity Chitosan for research purposes like cell therapy, tissue engineering, wound dressings, implant coatings and therapeutic agent delivery systems. Our process will consume the waste of the shrimp industry and the dairy industry (Zhang, et al., 2010).
Market structure in Mexico and rivalry among competitors is defined by the following forces:
Low threat of new entrants: high tech knowledge and facilities are not easily available in Mexico. Biological processes can be patented and protected for 10 years.
Low bargaining power of buyers: Chitosan is not easily available and distributors enjoy high margins on this product due to the few options customers have on hand.
Medium threat of substitute products or services: some Chitosan applications can be substituted with other medical excipients, other pesticides, chemical flocculants and antibacterial.
Low bargaining power of suppliers: there are few shrimp suppliers who can supply a ton per month of waste, but they are happy to lower the cost on waste elimination. Moreover our process is designed to work with any crustaceous shell waste.
The biggest competitor is giant distributor Sigma Aldrich, who markets low, medium and high purity Chitosan from suppliers all over the world through its online store. However, Sigma Aldrich runs out of stock frequently and has long wait periods for its customers.
Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.

Summary
The buffer and RNAse solutions needed for genomic preparations
Today Goksel did a restriction digest of our plasmid backbone (pSB1AT3) cutting out the mCherry coding sequence. This will prepare the backbone for the PCR products of ara, sac and sspb, which we intend to build as a construct within this plasmid. The sample was run on a gel and, using the transilluminator, the correct band was cut out of the gel. This can be purified tomorrow.
Today we also did a Genomic DNA prep for E.coli. We need this for our PCR reaction in order to get the sspb degradation controller protein. We used the gram negative protocol provided in the kit. Yesterday we set up 2 ON cultures for DH5alpha E.coli:

Modelling
For modelling our engineers (Lucy Barnett, Emily Ingham and Caleb Parikh) looked into the questions that we wanted to know about our device that we didn’t have time to find out with experiments. In the respect of investigating the bacterial growth response, we wanted to know what sort of time we would be expecting to wait for different starting inoculums of bacteria. Some meeting with advisor were arranged to discuss which would be the simplest and most effective way to answer this question. Some simple in lab experiments began, and a simple linear model was constructed to estimate the time it would take growth to be noticed depending on the initial inoculum.

Figure 10. Here you see the lognormal distribution of the 19 parameters in the quorum sensing system.  The red line indicates the mean of the parameter.
With these lognormal distributions and the accessory confidence intervals the best parameter sets could be chosen.
In a later stage, to get the desired response, the quorum sensing system and the subpopulation system were combined. As shown in Figure 8, you can see how we think to generate different cell populations. With this extended part we try to generate a system which predicts the behavior of the subpopulations. In figure 9 you can see the increasing RFP over time after many cell divisions, indicating an increasing cell population.
Click the button to see the equations!
Conclusion
Quorum sensing ensures that the toxin is only produced when the density of  bacteria is high enough, thus standardising the amount of toxin produced by the bacteria  population. The subpopulation system was coupled to the quorum sensing system.   Together, quorum sensing and formation of subpopulations allow   bacteria to produce waves of toxin.
Different parameters in the quorum sensing system elicit different GFP   responses. However, we can not expect to be able to make genetically identical cells with varying values for these parameters With the subpopulation system we may be able to predict which RBSs of the library have the highest chance to successfully create subpopulations. The library  can be tested and used in further research.
Optogenetic Kill Switch Model
One important aspect of our project is the biocontainment of BeeT to the hive, preventing it from spreading into the environment. In collaboration with the wet-lab, we designed an optogenetic kill switch based on the blue light sensing pDusk and pDawn systems as described by Ohlendorf et al 1 . The cell death is inflicted by the mazEF toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. The latter functions by the antitoxin (mazE) preventing the toxin (mazF) from cleaving mRNAs which ultimately kills the cell. With the underlying biology of the system in mind, we used synthetic bioengineering principles to mathematically describe our design and explore the dynamics of the system.
Our results show that we have a working mathematical model which describes the data of Ohlendorf et al 1 . With this model, we now know where to look for the relative kinetic rates in"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

This pictures sows the chromoprotins after their first heating step at 55 °C for 30 minutes. Same order as above picture. A color change is not seen after this temperature step.
After 30 minutes of 60 degrees C
This picture shows the chromoproteins after the 60 °C time step for 30 minutes. Same order as above. CP has changed from pink to purple after this temperature step. Also the bottom row which are the chromoproteins that originally did not have color now have gained the color they should have had in culture. This is an interesting observation and result and could give rise to a way to gain color in chromoproteins even if they do not have color in an initial liquid culture.
After 30 minutes at 65 degrees C
This picture shows the chromoproteins after the 65 °C time step for 30 minutes. Same order as above. CP has darkened in its purple color. The bottom row has intensified in color to the color that the original cultures were expected to grow to. This reveals that with some added heat sometimes the cultures can gain color even if they did not originally have it.
After 30 minutes at 70 degrees C
This picture shows the chromoproteins after the 70 °C time step for 30 minutes. Same order as above. CP has continued to darken in color but no other changes in the other chromoproteins are seen.
After 30 minutes at 75 degrees C
This picture shows the chromoproteins after the 75 °C time step for 30 minutes. Same order as above."

In the middle of the summer, when we were all busy working in the lab, our lab vacuum manifold, needed to extract DNA from bacteria, stopped working smoothly. This was delaying our progress, often resulting in bad yields. Yet, it was taking a long time to get replaced. One of our team members, Erik Ersland, had the idea of making a DIY vacuum manifold, which he did under $15, making it a useful and practical idea for other teams to use.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," be used for medical purposes, 24 percent of the Turkish participants disagreed, whereas 3 percent disagreed in the Swedish poll. This result can most likely be attributed towards the general scepticism towards GMO that the Turkish participants showed. Swedish participants did not agree that GMO products should be labeled, in contrast to the Turkish poll where 93 percent agreed that GMO products should be labeled as such. This further illustrates the mistrust that the Turkish participants showed towards GMO products
The mistrust may be due to a low availability of good information regarding GMO, clear information on how it works and what the risks with the technology can be. Since the participants in the Swedish poll consisted mostly of university graduates, which does not represent the majority of the population, their positivity may not reflect the true opinion of the general population. From a Swedish perspective, it is quite clear that the opinions of the general population is not as high as the poll might indicate.
Fig 1. Results for question ""Do you want to know more about GMO and genetic engineering?""
Both nations did however show great interest in the field of GMOs and genetic engineering. 80 percent or more were interested in learning more about this field. A prudent strategy for both nations could be to include more information of the basics of genetics and biology in the lower levels of education to increase the level of understanding for life and biological processes.
Further collaborations
To further diversify the speculative design part of our project we collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of southern Denmark . One of their teammates Rikke Friis Bentzon helped contribute one of the stories that was part of the speculative design part of our integrated HP . Furthermore we also participated in a 3 day human practices seminar set up by the danish iGEM team “CosmoCrops” from Copenhagen University. The weekend consisted of ethical discussions and seminars as well as lectures on presentation technique and patenting. iGEM representative Ana Sifuentes also held a lecture that helped prepare us for the Jamboree.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," transformations were inefficient, as blue colonies on each plate suggest that an excess of template was contained in the transformation mix.
A ccdB PCR screening of pRB12 was positive but transformation in DH5alpha, TOP10 and OneShot ccdb survival cells showed that the ccdB gene is unfunctional. In the following, all the insert from pDONR was used including a promoter and the ccdA gene.
Also we used a two plasmid strategy to test every possible combination of engineered indigoidine synthetases and the respective PPTases. We worked with indC on pSB1C3 and the PPTases on separate pSK3K3 derived plasmids.
Week 15
Indigoidine Production – Testing PPTases
pRB3 contains indC and sfp and results in a blue phenotype after tranformation of E. coli MG1655, BAP1 and TOP10. pRB4-10 plasmids code for different combinations of either indigoidine synthetase indC or bpsA and the PPTase sfp, svp, svp (pMM65) or entD. Transformation of E. coli TOP10 showed that all combinations result in indigoidine production. This week we validated these plasmids using colony PCR screenings and Sanger sequencing (GATC-biotech, Konstanz).
The PCR screening was inconclusive but sequencing results showed that all combinations of indC or bpsA with sfp, svp, svp (pMM65) or entD have been assembled correctly.
These results are remarkable since entD was previously described as an inefficient activator of indigoidine synthetases (Takahashi 2007). In the following week we prepared separate PPTase plasmids for co-transformation with engineered versions of indC. Also, we included the delC PPTase from D. acidovorans SPH-1, which is the PPTase involved in delftibactin synthesis.
Week 16
T-Domain Shuffling – PPTase Plasmids
This week we wanted to prepare plasmids for the T-Domain exchange experiments. We assembled four plasmids pRB15-18, each containing one PPTase on the pSB3K3-backbone with a kanamycine resistance. These plasmids should be used for co-transformations with the engineered indigoidine synthetase indC on a pSB1C3 plasmid pRB19 with a chlor"

Dmytro Mayilo
Dima is a Master student in Molecular Biosciences with the major in Molecular and Cellular Biology, here in Heidelberg.  The topic of his Bachelor thesis, which he completed in National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv was production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific to FGFR-1.  Before applying to iGEM he thought it would be mainly focused on lab work, however it turned out to be amazingly interesting adventure, where everyone worked side by side to achieve the goal.
