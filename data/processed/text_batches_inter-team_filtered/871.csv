Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html,"R and RepVP123(587KO). The producer cells were harvested with the culture supernatant and subjected to four cycles of freeze and thaw cell lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes and concentrated in a VivaSpin VS2002 (Sartorius Stedem) with a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off to two milliliters and washed three to five times with 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6. The cell lysates were incubated with 250 units of Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove contaminant genomic DNA and loaded on an ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) equipped with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions (500 µl) around the void volume containing viral particles were collected and used in a sandwich ELISA. 96 well plates were coated with 200 ng Cetuximab (Imclone/Merck/Bristol-Myers Squibb). Detection was performed using the monoclonal antibody A20 (kindly provided by PD Dr. J. Kleinschmidt, DKFZ Heidelberg) that was biotinylated using a Biotinylation kit (Dojindo, Japan) and Streptavidin-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich). The HRP presence was detected by the conversion of the substrate ABTS at 405 nm. The average of the non-template controls (NTC) was subtracted from the sample data.
Results and Discussion:
A: Sandwich-ELISA scheme for the detection of Z34C-presenting viral particles. Immobilization is achieved by binding a IgG molecule. Intact viral capsids can be specifically bound by the biotinylated A20 antibody which can be detected by Strepavidin-HRP
B: ELISA using the principle described in A for loop insertion samples obtained by gel filtration chromatography of 453- and 587-Z34C particles. Undiluted and 10-fold diluted samples were employed
C: ELISA signals obtained by absorbance measurements from B at 405 nm, undiluted samples
D: ELISA signals obtained by absorbance measurements from B at 405 nm, diluted samples
Three samples of different viral particles with insertions of the antibody-binding motif Z34C were successfully purified by the gel filtration chromatography. The fractions around the void volume were subsequently used in two different sandwich ELISAs. The first one aims at the detection of the particle’s ability to bind IgG-antib"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Overview
Fluorescence is a commonly used method for detecting and quantitating gene expression. The InterLab study aims to create a more uniform way of measuring fluorescence so that results from different labs can be compared. The results in this study will be collated with all other results for the InterLab study by iGEM HQ. From the results, it is seen that J23101 is the strongest promoter followed by J23106 and J23117 being the weakest, and B0034 is the stronger of the two ribosome binding sites with J364100 being the weaker. Additionally, we chose to investigate how commercial DH5α Escherichia coli derivatives and dimerization of plasmids can affect gene expression, full methodology and results for this can be seen on the Measurement page.
Introduction
The InterLab study has been run by iGEM for the past 4 years. It aims to make science more replicable by creating more standardised methods that can be used by any research group with any equipment so that results can be more easily compared. This year the target of the study was to make a more standardised protocol for measuring fluorescence.
For the purpose of the InterLab study, 6 test devices were used, there were J364000 , J364001 , J364002 , J364003 , J364004 and J364005 .
Each device contained one of three different promoters, and one of two different ribosome binding sites upstream of a gene for green fluorescent protein (E0040) and two terminators (B0010 and B0012). The promoters used in the study were"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP Silver Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," academics working in the humanities and social sciences, and completing our own engagement and research, we have taken a journey through science communication and considered how this can help the success of our project!
North-East Big Bang Fair
In July, we attended the North East Big Bang Fair- a large and exciting science fair. Over 2000 students and teachers attended, and we got the opportunity to talk to everyone about synthetic biology, iGEM, and our project! We had a few different activities to get the students and teachers involved with synthetic biology… ‘Build your own Biosensor’ is an interactive activity we developed to get the students thinking about synthetic biology independently. Many of the students did not know what a biosensor was, so this was also a good way to introduce the function and purpose of biosensors in an understandable and relatable way. We asked the students to think about what they would like to sense (an input), and how this would be detected (an output). There were lots of fun and creative responses!
We also had many great conversations with both school pupils and teachers, based around 4 main questions that we posed…
What is synthetic biology?
What do you think synthetic biology can achieve?
How does the current curriculum tackle synthetic biology, and how would you change science teaching if you could?
How do you engage with science outside of the classroom?
It was great to spread awareness of synthetic biology among the next generation of scientists, and even give teachers ideas for how they could introduce synthetic biology teaching into their lessons!
Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines
As a culmination of our research into science communication, we have complied a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology to the public. These guidelines can be used for different purposes, including: to advise scientists when communicating about their work to the press; to guide in how to present to the public; and to help iGEM teams writing up their work! The guidelines start with some more general points to consider when you start to communicate synthetic biology. They also make use of the information we gained during the corpus linguistics research to suggest some more specific linguistic features to consider when communicating synthetic biology. Read the guidlines here: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?

Safety
Synthetic biology has the potential to impact many areas of society.     Synthetic biologists may use artificial molecules to reproduce emergent     behavior from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial     life or seeking interchangeable biological parts to assemble them into     devices and systems that function in a manner not found in nature (Benner     and Sismour 2005, Endy 2005, Heinemann and Panke 2006, Luisi 2007, Serrano     2007).There is possibility of causing intentional or accidental harm     to humans, agriculture or the environment. While deliberate damage is     dealt with under the heading biosecurity, the potential unintended consequences     have to be considered under the term biosafety. As a software developer"

Then a blot dot was done on the strips with β-lactamase primary antibody and an hrp conjugated secondary antibody. This assay demonstrated that the TALEs can capture DNA.
Figure 17. Figure on the left: For the dual TALE lanes TALEB fused to a K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ) was blotted on a nitrocellulose strip. Subsequently the strips were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer. The strips were then washed and soaked in a solution containing [A] and [B] on the same plasmid( BBa_K1189006 ). The strips were then washed again with TALE binding buffer and soaked in a solution containing TALEA+β-lac ( BBa_K1189031 ). Then a blot dot was done on the strips with β-lactamase primary antibody and an hrp conjugated secondary antibody. In negative 1 the strip was not soaked in the DNA solution. In Negative 2, the strip was not soaked in TALEA+β-lac solution. For positive controls, TALEA+βlac was blotted on the strip at the beginning instead of TALEB+K coil. The figure on the right shows the result of the densitometery we performed on the dot blot assay.
In order to demonstrate that we can successfully capture target DNA with two TALEs we did a capture TALE assay. TALE B was incubated with DNA containing target sites for TALE A and TALE B and blotted on nitrocellulose. After blocking and washing, TALE A β-lactamase fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) was added to the nitrocellulose strips. The strips were transferred into a 96 well plate to which a benzylpenicillin substrate solution with phenol red was added. If the TALE A β-lactamase fusion bound to the target site for TALE A then the solution will change colour from pink to clear. If TALE A β-lactamase fusion was not present, the solution will remain pink.  We can show that the first four samples which have TALE B with DNA for TALE A and TALE B show a colour change indicating that we are successfully capturing the target DNA and reporting it. Furthermore we can also show that when we add non-specific DNA we do not see a colour change demonstrating that we can successfully capture only specific DNA"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also"

Microbiome Analysis
Our group’s initial goal was to characterize the microbiome of emergency medical vehicles utilizing a next-generation sequencing approach with cutting-edge hardware and software from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. In order to execute this, we developed our own sampling pipeline as well as created a new method for amplifying and preparing DNA for sequencing from environmental samples. Our sample preparation pipeline was successful and we were able to successfully amplify and isolate ribosomal RNA from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes using universal gene primers.
Figure 1: 1% agarose gel demonstrating amplification of 16S and 18S rDNA from various samples obtained from emergency medical vehicles as well as control samples. A clear amplification is seen using these universal primers.
The samples were then barcoded, and specific adapters were ligated on to enable nanopore sequencing. The sequencing data confirmed that our approach isolated and amplified genomic DNA from a wide array of bacterial species. Included in this list of species are several pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, these data are outlined below.
Table I: List of bacterial species identified within emergency medical vehicles obtained utilizing next-generation sequencing.
The sequencing approach taken was unique and allowed for identification of species which are not readily culturable. Importantly, some bacterial species including those in the Legionella genus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1] may not be detected using routine bacterial culturing. However, utilizing next-generation sequencing, identification of these microbes in emergency medical vehicles and in the environment at large would be possible. Additionally, we were able to identify distinct bacterial species from our sampling locations not obtained in our technical control, indicating that the presence of these microbes is not an experimental artifact.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html,"F system, homologues of all sequences would be taken from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as they have identical functions but contain fewer illegal restriction sites.
However, BCAM0227 was proving problematic. It was so large (3000+bp), and had so many illegal restriction sites, it would have taken the full ten weeks to QuikChange™  them out! We decided to send it for synthetic sequencing by Dundee Cell Products in two separate parts. We hoped this would allow us to successfully ligate the two pieces together into one without mistakes.
Week 1
The team are all together! Work begins…
We began organizing our raw materials, setting up overnight cultures of our vectors (pSB1C3 for BioBricks, and our supervisor’s own pUniprom for experiments) and obtaining gDNA from P. aeruginosa, X. campestris and B. cenocepacia from Drs Robert Ryan and Shi-Qi An from the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life sciences at the University of Dundee By the end of the week we had cloned pqsR and PpqsA into pSB1C3, phew!
As for the dry-lab, the first week consisted mostly of reading papers and harassing Gillian, our mathematical biologist, for definitions of all the bio-jargon. In fact, most of our early discussions about modelling our systems consisted of furrowed brows from both sides, and questions such as “a differential what?” and “Uhhh, transcriptional whatnow?”
Week 2
In order to test our biological sensors we decided to clone them into pUniprom, a high copy-number plasmid which has a large and varied multiple cloning site downstream of a strong, constitutive promoter: Ptat.  In order to arrange our sequences in such a way that there would be no leakage of our reporter, we had to employ a bit of cloning trickery by inserting our sensing and responding fragments in opposite orientations. This involved cloning them into separate fragments and then flipping them round into pUniprom. And so to the bench we went!
Now that the plan for the plasmid was in place, we began to enter all the information onto Netlogo to model how the system would behave in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous PQS.
Week 3
While members of the team continued to work on building the PQS sensor, we also got started on planning and constructing the DSF sensor. From this point onwards we decided to use GFP rather than m"
DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#IP and Synthetic Biology_-_-_TEXT.html," in perpetuity was required to continue paying fees even though nearly the same formulation was used by competitors for no fee.  Another example is a company whose agreement to pay a reduced licensing fee for a longer duration than the patent was struck down.
The biggest take away here is that if you want or need to engage in IP agreements, it is imperative to have good lawyers.
IP related to iGEM
We dug into the terms of the Biobrick Public Agreement, and found that this is an agreement similar to the GPL (a software license for free software), but with a slightly different implementation because biotechnology is protected by patents, not by copyright.  Also, the BPA does not include a viral clause like the GPL does (which states that if I modify your software that is covered by the GPL, then my new modified version must also be covered by the GPL).
The BPA states that a user who uses a part from the Parts Registry agrees to provide proper attribution to whoever submitted it, and additionally agrees to respect biological safety practices and applicable laws.  Someone who contributes a part to the BPA agrees to ""not to assert any existing or future intellectual property rights"" (such as demand licensing fees) against any user of the part that they contributed.  This means that Biobricks will remain free for anyone to use, and doing so will not carry any risk of drawing a patent infringement lawsuit.  Parts that are submitted to the Parts Registry may be under patent, but the above terms will still apply -- if you submitted a patented Biobrick to the parts registry, you would not be able to charge a licensing fee to any user of your part from the registry (though you are free to have other licensing agreements with other parties).
We assume that we have agreed to the BPA when we signed up for an iGEM and Parts Registry account, but we were not able to find this information on the iGEM website.  This information is also not available on the distribution plates, and it does not seem to be available in the help information available in the parts registry .  We would recommend that iGEM make this information more visible since knowing the legal terms under which we are using parts from the registry is important.
Background: Myriad Genetics Ruling Summary
Myriad Genetics manufactures a genetic test for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which relies on detecting cDNA.  They held a patent that granted them exclusive right to use and generate derivatives of these genes.  This patent was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ), who held that genes should not be patentable.

As with other questionnaire responses, more of the same rumors were mentioned- specifically, that birth control can cause cancer or infertility. Uganda is a heavily Catholic country and the Catholic church doesn't support birth control use, so we need to consider this for the development and distribution of our product in stigmatized areas.
Joy Women's Group
❮ ❯
The Joy Women’s Group is located in Western Uganda in the Nyamwamba Division of the Kasese Municipality. One of their group’s objectives is to promote nutrition, health, and hygienic practices in the community. All 25 of their group members wanted to participate in our research. According to participants, their community generally supports the use of contraceptives. Their community has access to contraception through a government healthcare facility known as Naigobya HC III. Naigobya HC III provides family planning services, maternal care, prenatal care, and post-natal care. Read More >> Through this facility, locals may receive injections or pills as birth control. Similar to other Ugandan groups, however, treatment at this facility is expensive. The Joy Women’s Group also presented rumors similar to what we heard from other groups. Their information is invaluable, and our team is very thankful for their participation.
Kabwe Rural Women Development Association (KARWODA)
Through the recommendation of Kabugho Beatrace from KUWA, we met Masika Annet of the Kabwe Rural Women Development Association (KARWODA). Beatrace informed Annet that we were looking for more information about birth control methods and/or family planning programs already in practice, and she told us that “most birth control methods are sold in hospitals, drug shops, and clinics but are inaccessible”. She emphasized that even though options are available, most are far too expensive for the average woman to afford. Read More >> Many women also fear dangerous side effects such as blocked oviducts and bleeding. Instead, women revert to condom use which is often accompanied by public shaming if they are seen carrying condoms out of a shop. Shame plays a large part, it seems, in deterring these women from using birth control. As a result, women partake in unprotected sex which results in unwanted pregnancies and STDs. We hope that our discrete birth control method will allow women to practice safe family planning methods without shame.

The concentration of Nickel (NiCl2) in the medium that the cells can tolerate according to Rodrigue et al. (2005) before inhibiting growth is 4 μ M for the strain lacking rcnA, 10 μM in the wildtype and up to 100-fold more in a strain with a multicopy gene.

Assumption 1: Once there is nickel in the medium, RcnR will not interfere in the pump regulation. This because there will be large concentrations of metal, so we can assume that RcnR will always be bound to a molecule of nickel and it will therefore be unable to suppress the transcription of rcnA; the noise that the few RcnR free molecules can cause, will be indistinguishable from normal behaviour of the pump.
Assumption  2: Any decrease in the concentration of AHL is due to aiiA. It is  believed that the natural degradation of this molecule is irrelevant in the time  scale analysis. Either way, a process will not be distinguishable from  the other and even when the first is estimated, it would not be very  informative for the analysis, so we intend to  take this assumption as  true.
Assumption 3: The transcription of cI* depends solely on the concentration of AHL. LuxR is not a limiting step, ie, it is in a constant concentration and in sufficient amount to always be ready to associate with AHL. Only to simplify the analysis, at least for our first approach.
Initial outline:
(v1) AHL0
(v2) aiiA + AHL -> aiiA
(v3) AHL + LuxR -> cI*

Washington-Software,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Future_-_-_TEXT.html,"Below are some of the features that we would include in version 2.0 of BioBrick-A-Bot. We will discuss each feature in detail.
Fully automated calibration using color sensors
Automatic  Interpolation of Physical Location of each well
GUI (Graphical User Interface) to generate DNA Assembly Programs
Batch Scheduling Option with Timing
Additon of a third LegoRoboBrick, called MU (Movement Utility)
Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves synchronization
Support User Defined LegoRoboBricks
Support pipetting between individual tubes and 96-well plates
Support pipetting between two 96-well plates
Support pipetting of 12 tips simultaneously
Fully automated calibration using color sensors
In the current version, the calibration of the ALPHA is semi-automated. During the calibration process, the robot positions the pipette head above 3 well position: A1, H1 and A9. The user then fine-tuned the 3 known positions by adjusting the NXT brick menu.  An improvement of this process would be to use color sensor to detect the grid positions of A1, H1 and A9. We could use color dots or color lines to indicate these positions, and during the calibration phase, the pipette head will move until the sensors detect the pre-specified dots or lines.
Automatic  Interpolation of Physical Location of each well
From the 3 well positions A1, H1 and A9, we will use interpolation to compute the physical location of all the 96 wells. Note that the 96 well plate may not be perfectly horizontal, so the most accurate method would be to interpolate in 3 dimensions. We will need to detect the x, y, and z coordinates of the 3 calibration wells.
GUI to generate DNA Assembly Programs (On PC)
Version 2.0 will have a menu-driven GUI to generate , for example,  the following DNA Assembly Segment.
Move A1, Aspirate
Move D9, Dispense, Clean
Move B1, Aspirate
Move A9, Dispense Clean
The user will be shown the picture of a 96 well plate, and the use can click on well location and select actions. We will also have actions with higher granularity, for example
Transfer A1, D9
Transfer B1, A9
will be equivalent to the 4 statements above.  All the user need to do is to click on icons and select menu options, and the DNA assembly program statements will be generated automatically.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," the MedTech Product Realisation Studio. Thank you for allowing us free use of the fabrication and electronics equipment such as the 3D printers, laser cutter, and soldering irons.
Mr. MUHAMMED Abdurrahiem bin Abdul lent us 10 Arduino Unos so that we could commence our work immediately, instead of simply waiting idly for our own orders to arrive. Miss TAN Annie gave us food for body and soul, while Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin supplied us with his personal brand of sardonic humour and acrylic glue in equal measure. Additionally, we inherited a set of legendary ball bearings from Mr. Brian Shohei TEO. These 4 ancient (much like their original owner) bearings were salvaged from the flying machine he created as part of his undergraduate dissertation, the Phoenix. Both this set of ball bearings and his oft macabre, perpetually facetious jokes helped motivate our hardware team greatly. But most importantly, all of these people were kind.
Mr. SAJJAD Ali introduced us to Russian culture, provided intellectual stimulation, and also lent us acrylic glue. If you’re noticing a theme here, it’s because our life was in pieces and unfortunately we needed acrylic glue in industrial quantities. Not to drink and thus end our misery, but to make our cuvettes watertight. This was accomplished once Mr Jonathan AMBROSE lent us his Acrifix cement, for which we are eternally grateful. The hardware team has no comment on whether we still need to pull ourselves together.
PART 13: MISCELLANEOUS
We thank Mr. TAN Kang Lek, Clarence for generously lending us his prized Pentax K-1 Mark II and tripod, often on very short notice.
We would like the sincerely apologize if we have inadvertently missed anyone out.
HEAR OUR STORY
We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.

Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB BBa_J32015 , the newly created BioBrick K2020000 and the terminator BBa_B0010 like the expression system itself. The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation between the pro-peptide and the subtilisin E gene was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TGG, which codes for tryptophan, so tyrosine was exchanged against tryptophan at the connection site of pro-peptide and subtilisin E gene. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.
Figure 6: Skim milk plates assay. Cells containing the empty backbone (1) in comparison to either cells producing the native protease (2), cells with the SDM 1-modified (3) and the SDM 3-modified expression system (4) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
The empty backbone didn't cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ) but also for the SDM 3 modified expression system. As SDM 3 had been executed to exchange tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a proteolytic activity could be assumed caused by the clearance observed. Contrary to our former beliefs"

On all searches you can limit the maximum number of results to reduce the runtime and cancel further search at a given point. To filter for special original bases at the position of the substitution char, enter the desired letters into the text field “Preferred Substitutions”. Multiple letters are possible, what leads to the usual value of “ACGT”, if this software is used to analyze the existence of unnatural bases in a DNA molecule. The search with this setting returns only enzyme groups, where at least one enzyme for any of the natural base at the substitution base position is able to cut the double strand of DNA. One example is shown in Figure 8, which shows also the four enzymes used in our M.A.X. experiment .    The last text field is made of bigger sequences. The whole database is checked for having recognition sequences as substrings in this sequence. This is useful, if you already have a sequence of interest and want to find enzyme groups, which are able to cut within or next to this sequence.
Figure 7: Graphical User Interface of M.A.X.
Figure 8: Enzyme group cutting for any base
Shows an entry of the extended sequence and the    four restriction enzymes used in our wet lab prove using the M.A.X. system. If the unnatural base stays at the position of the char    ""#"", then none of the four enzymes can cut. Otherwise, for any mutation which lead to a substituiton to A, C, G, or T, one of the    four displayed enzymes cuts the DNA strand.

These D. rad strains have been used to oxidize toluene, which is then metabolized and eventually forms insoluble polymers. These insoluble polymers precipitate out of and can then be easily removed from the waste solution3.
The other major bioremediation strategy, heavy metal remediation, is used in the clean up of radioactive metals such as mercury, chromium and uranium. One way to achieve heavy metal remediation is to insert an enzyme into D. rad, giving D. rad the ability to reduce and diminish the toxicity of a particular metal. (merA), which coverts mercury to a less volatile and dangerous oxidation state2, has been expressed in D. rad and used in such applications. PhoN, a nonspecific acid phospatase, has also been expressed in D. rad and has been used to precipitate radioactive uranium at nuclear weapon production sites1.
Recognizing D. rad as the greatest terrestrial organism for resistance to environmental stressors, our NYC iGEM team is looking to identify and add to the knowledge of key stress-resistance genes in D. rad. Ultimately, our goal is to create a bacteria with the capacity to withstand the harsh environment of Mars, enabling terraforming in order to sustain future human colonization.

Our pre-experiment training lasted for two days, and we went into the lab to do our own molecular cloning and editing engineering bacteria, which is a pleasant process basically but seemed to be a departure from what we were supposed to be doing. Rigorous experimental procedures and rigorous laboratory entry requirements do not exist in the way as expected. There is not systematic training on the use of experimental equipment and instruments, and some precautions are not so clear. We have learned the basic operation, as long as a set of detailed experimental scheme can be made experimental results, such a low threshold, those high school students like us are provided convenience, but also to the malicious people to take advantage of it? With such concerns, we conducted the experiment with ease under the supervision of our teacher.
But we know that not everyone is.
There is no denying that synthetic biology will bring great benefits to mankind such as clean energy, targeted drugs and efficient vaccine production. The synthesis of new chemicals, purification of the environment and good crops with various characteristics. Although the main applications of synthetic biology are still in their infancy, some applications are expected to enter the market within a few years. Emerging products will also create more jobs and hopefully create new industries. At the same time, however, synthetic biology may also pose risks in public health, ecological environment and biological protection, such as inestimable adverse effects on human health, potential impacts of accidental release of synthetic microorganisms, misuse or abuse of synthetic life, etc. The release of synthetic life into the environment, either intentionally or unintentionally, has an extremely significant and inestimable and irreparable impact on human health, ecology and public health. The town does not take synthetic life for granted. Many scientists claim that researchers can control the risks posed by synthetic life, and that self-discipline is sufficient without the need for outside scrutiny. However, even if the oil extraction technology is simple relatively and has been used for decades, oil tanker leakage will still occur, causing great harm to coastal residents and ecology. In the same way, the potential risks of synthetic life technologies are not something scientists can simply avoid through technology and self-disc"

Newspaper LE TEMPS interview & article
Mr Fabien Goubet, journalist from ""Le Temps"", a local newspaper, came to EPFL to interview us and learn about our project. We discussed iGEM, synthetic biology, and our project.
Later in the day, he interviewed Mr Bent Stumpe, Danish electronic engineer, inventor of the Touchscreen at the CERN for the control room of the Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator; and Mr Rolf Heuer, director of CERN, and talked to them about our project. This is what they said:
« They absolutely must persevere in their work. I am convinced that the screen of the future will combine electronics and biology. »
Bent Stumpe - Inventor of the touchscreen
« It is a fascinating project, with curious and creative students. If I were them, I would pursue this work, regardless of the outcome of the competition. Who knows what it could lead to one day ? It reminds me of the early days of the touchscreen. When engineers from CERN designed it for control systems of the accelerators in the 1970s, who would have thought that years later, a similar technology would be invented and become as commonly used? »
Rolf Heuer - Director of CERN

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data. The underlying reason making modeling so difficult is that the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur through different mechanisms. Based on this. we are always seeking feasible ways to implement our automatic modeling idea. The automatic does not mean modeling without any information provided, but however, there indeed exists a minimal data set to enable the automation.
Similar to C++ programming language, we introduce templates to allow generic description of species and reactions of a certain pattern. It is essential to implement our automatic modeling idea since
to share the same
Automatic modeling of biological system, Similar reactions happen for similar reasons. For example, the repression of pTetR promoter by TetR dimer can happen on many different DNA molecules with pTetR, regardless of what other biobricks is constructed on the DNA. With this thought, we add the part of Substituent , which can replace inactive parts of Species in Reactions , making it more general, and actually turning it into a reaction template. Having substituent, a pTetR TetR binding reaction is re-interpreted as the binding reaction of ANY DNA with pTetR(Figure 2) with ANY protein with TetR-dimer binding site. Modeling with templates allows us to describe reactions of new complex even without rewrite the reactions and species in database.
Figure 2: Template of pTetR DNA
Automatic Modeling Database Language
We use a database to store all the information we need in modeling. In order to realize automatic modeling, we construct the database in unified format and make it machine-readable. Every component of database has its specified attributes and values, which makes the format of the database a unique yet standard database language. We call it MoDeL : Modeling Database Language by picking out characters from three words. MoDeL is based on XML language, which makes it flexible and extensible. For more specifications of MoDeL, click here .

Rice iGEM - Humans of synbio
We loved the idea of sharing personal experiences within synthetic biology and ageing and wanted to collaborate with RICE iGEM.
Inspired by Humans of New York, RICE iGEM had the fantastic idea to do the same for all of us synthetic biologists working around the world.
It provided a great platform to open up about why we, and in particular teammate Abbie, are taking part in iGEM and what motivates us to be involved with synthetic biology.
After discussing the Humans of synbio questions, we saw the potential to spread the synthetic biology message globally. we were featured on their Instagram and Facebook pages. We hope this will open up a dialogue between teams but also with the public and will become something that future iGEM teams get involved with.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

I did another PCR with pBAD, BADZ1 and BADZ where I used miniprep 2, to check if these templates also seem to be switched. The PCR products needs to be run on a gel - they are probably still in the PCR machine.
I did a colony PCR on 3 colonies from each of the transformations. Check the picture in the lab-book. I didnt have time. The first lane is ladder, the next 5 is Patricks, and the next 15 are ours. I think I forgot to write that the last 3 lanes contain a PCR of the ""no insert"".
We should change the colony PCR strategy to Annemi's boiling strategy, as this turned out to be quite succesful.
Finally I did a PCR clean-up of the PCR products from the PCR with miniprep 1 as template - products still need to be run on gel, and maybe they are ready for digestion :)
21-09-2010 - Patrick - Terminator group
Today the lab work was ran almost parallel with good success with the repressor group, Lisa and I had a rather successful day. To start off with, the PCR's in the morning.. WORKED!! Those were both from the repressor group and terminator group.
I continued to work on the digestions needed for our construct and did the following ones:
GFP(rbs): E+S
pSB1C3: E+P
pBAD: E+S
pSB4A5: E+P
pSB1A3: E+P
Gels were ran firstly on the PCR's in the morning and turned out successful (both repressor and terminator groups have the gel pictures in their lab books).
The second gel made contained the above mentioned digestions as well as Lisa's colony PCR's. From the gel its hard to evaluate the outcome of the digestions as they were made on pcr products, but non the less bands were visible for all 5 of the digestions run with matching bp sizes. The other 15 bands were repressor groups colony pcr's (both repressor and terminator groups have the gel pictures in their lab books).

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"R forms a complex with 3OC6HSL and then activates         downstream promoter, pLuxR (BBa_R0062).
After the activation of pLuxR promoter, LuxI protein (BBa_C0061) then expresses. LuxI is an autoinducer synthetase         which catalyzes 3OC6HSL from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in cell. The entire part from pTetR to LuxI generates         a positive feedback loop, because it increases the concentration of 3OC6HSL/LuxR complex and hence induces pLuxR more strongly. The 3OC6HSL molecule can also diffuse back to the extracellular environment and affect the nearby         cells.
With its positive feedback loop, the sensing module is able to convert from signal receiver into signal emitter whenever         it receives 3OC6HSL molecule. Thus, it is expected to increase the efficiency of activation in a targeted environment.
Potential Issue
The issue that previous iGEM team encountered (See experience in BBa_F2620) is the leakiness of pLuxR promoter             (BBa_R0062). It is a situation when there is little expression of gene even without initial activation of AHL.             This time we improved by adding sequences of antisense RNA Binding regions and antisense RNA in which their interaction             can inhibit the translation of excess mRNA.
First, the antisense RNA Binding Region (ABR) is placed right before our targeted Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS),             which is upstream to the LuxI (BBa_C0061) and GFP (BBa_E0040). Second, the antisense RNA is placed downstream             the positive feedback loop and its reporter together with a medium strength promoter, pLuxL (BBa_R0063).
The antisense RNA we use has two important characteristics that will help reduce leakiness. Firstly, it comprises               of sequence that is complementary to the sequence of mRNA of ABR. The affiliation of antisense RNA to the complementary               ABR prevents ribosome from binding to the mRNA of the targeted RBS. Secondly, it has a Hfq binding site, which               is suspected to recruit RNase to degrade the targeted RNA chain. (Wagner, 2009)(Hoynes-O’Connor & Moon, 2016).               In consequence, translation of LuxI:GFP mRNA will be reduced, and so will the leakiness of pLuxR.

Results:The image below shows a 3.5% Agarose Gel of an Analytical Restriction Enzyme Digest for Expt 7.3. The high agarose concentration of the gel was intended to slow the progression of DNA fragments to enable us to detect the small inserts of BBa_J23119 and BBa_B0034. The table below indicates the expected sizes of BioBricks and Plasmid Backbones. Accordingly, we used a the smallest available ladder, with fragments ranging from 25bp to 500bp. At the top of the gel it is possible to see the large fragments we detected on a 1000bp gel in Expt 7.3 Week 7. However, we had expected this gel to also demonstrate the BBa_J23119 insert (35bp) corresponding to letter A in Lane 1, and the BBa_B0034 insert, corresponding to letter B in Lane 3. No product was found. As expected, there was no product measurable against the 25bp ladder for the uncut plasmids in Lane 2 and Lane 4.

What our user-defined in vitro diagnostic device can do:
1. It would be more efficiently to research how to find more in one detection. This is where our design originated – enzyme logical gates. Such gates can inform users of changes in multiple physiological indicators and make judgments about whether they are sick. By contrast, traditional detection methods require different sensors to detect different substances in sample, which requires a lot of precious time. We believe that the parallel processing capability of logic gates fits well with the high time requirements of Point of Care Testing, and it is expected to explore new possibilities in the field of first aid.
2. How to make our enzymes recycled? That’s a little bit hard but also a little excited to answer. The Curli Fiber, was first recognized as the invasion tool for bacteria, which firstly reconstructed by Harvard-iGEM 2014 as artificial biofilm, may help us out. This year, we use curli fibers with enhanced nanogold particles to covalently fix our enzyme complex on our electrode, which theoretically makes our electrode able to be recycle. And since it can be recycled, we can probably change the traditional detective methods or even lead a revolutionary among IVD.
• Keep in touch and continue our cooperation!
Above is the very first communication between ZJU-China and Acon-Biotech. Later, through frequent conversations, we even get more detailed information.
We summarize these feedbacks into serval points of view and list the corresponded adjustments to our projects.
Part I.
“Time matters.  Time matters to personal experience.  Time matters to human life.”
Frequent communications with Mrs. Juan Cui made us realize that the time required for detection determines whether our products are practical. To develop our product and focus on the concrete perspectives, we mainly focus on the optimization of the product response time. Especially in first aid, a one-minute delay can lead to irreversible consequences. After many rounds of brainstorming, we realized that instead of sticking to shorten the time required for a single test, we can splice our enzymes complex in-vitro with the help of Spycatcher-Spytag systems (there are other 2 orthogonal catcher-tag systems). And theoretically, this enzyme complex system can shorten the distances between each enzyme, which means this form of enzyme complex can couple cluster of enzymes’ reactions. This enzyme complex is relatively stable so that it can be applied on in vitro diagnosis.
Part II.
“Technology Transferring lies shortcut for nobody but for the explorers and man of perseverance.”

We could demonstrate, that the fluorescence signal was restricted to the Peptidosome - standing in line with the results obtained in the well scan experiments. This was the final proof that the bacteria are encapsulated in the Peptidosomes and are fully trapped.
The Growth of B. subtilis in Peptidosomes
After we checked the functionality of reporters in Peptidosomes, we were also interested to observe growth of B. subtilis while encapsulated. Since the Peptidosomes should be liquid-filled and allow the exchange of molecules, B. subtilis should be able to grow. To demonstrate this, we loaded Peptidosome with a known amount of bacteria and plated them on agar plates after different time periods of incubation at 37°C. These plates were then incubated overnight and we documented the colony numbers on the next day (Table 1). We expected to observe an increase of the colony forming units in correlation of longer incubation times. Peptidosomes plated after 0 hours represent the starting bacterial concentration, as these Peptidosomes were plated on agar plates immediately after their generation.

As observed on the results, the number of colonies in the plates increased after 3.5 h of incubation, when compared to the starting bacterial concentration (0 hours). After 7 hours it was not possible to count the amount of colonies, cause B. subtilis formed a lawn. This clearly showed that B. subtilis was fully capable to grow inside of the Peptidosome cages. Thus, Peptidosomes are indeed suitable for the establishment of bacterial cultures.
Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy
To fully investigate how B. subtilis is encapsulated in the Peptidosomes, we performed Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo-SEM). By doing so, we should get inside if the surface of the Peptidosome is also covered by bacterial cells.

The Chemwiki suggests that the concentration of fluorescent proteins is proportional to the fluorescence signal, if only a fraction of the excitation energy is absorbed, which is the case for our project. Consequently, the last equation shows that this coefficient will only scale the total area, and therefore can be omitted.
Side-note concerning the ‘concentration of light’: light is specified as photons per second. For a laser of energy \(W\) the Max-Planck law states \(W=nE = nhv \Rightarrow n = \frac W {hv}\) for the wave frequency \(v\).
In a time series experiment, we found the reaction time for protein expression of pGal-Luciferase to take \(7-8h\). Therefore, we conducted experiments for determining the the steady-state expression levels for different galactose concentrations. Unfortunately"

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," Tuners and to design and describe new pigments that future iGEM teams can reproduce.
Manipulation of Pigment operons
The carotenoid and violacein operons are able to produce more than one pigment each.  This gives future iGEM teams the opportunity to manipulate these operons.  For example, with the carotenoid system, there is the potential to change red to orange.  Inducible colour change has particular application to our dipstick prototype.  If the bacteria in each well constitutively expressed orange pigment, this would be an indication that the bacteria were alive.  The change from red to orange would be induced by the pollutant.  As for violacein, colour logic could be used to detect combinations of pollutants:
The Distant Future - potential for colour
In the Colours Future workshop (organised by Daisy Ginsburg and James King from the Royal College of Art) we concentrated on our various pigments, considering how the ability to exploit pigments from the natural world--not just from bacteria, but from plants and animals--might affect the world we live in. What if pigments are used as reporters for applications beyond bacterial biosensors?  What if we harnessed natural pigments and used them to artificially colour the world, even ourselves?  What ramifications might these leaps and bounds have? We divided these considerations into four main groups:
Products
Both bacterial pigments and synthetic biology in general has the potential to be used to create many different products and technologies. Crispian, Alan and Caitlin explored the use of synthetic biology in a range of products from childrens toys to commencial food-colouring. This would create issues of property and patents; if the biobrick for colour is in an open source registry, would this create problems for people hopeing to patent a certain colour, or a gene for a colour? Megan and Mike took this to an extreme with a sketch from a world where the colour orange was patented, and it's use under strict control.
Services
Along with new technologies, comes the creation of new services, providing jobs that previously did not exist. Working with synthetic biology tools and products could become an industry in itself, with a unique skill-set. As the design of devices reaches higher levels of abstraction, the concept becomes more available for different industries to use, and provides new ways to consider the workings in biological cells. In view of our colours, we imagined a future where pigments from the natural world were in high demand, creating the job of 'colour-hunter', people looking for the brightest and best colours,"

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#ResultsTest_-_-_TEXT.html," delivery of  plasmid DNA, single-stranded modified RNA and double-stranded modified RNA to mammalian cells through both lipofection and nucleofection.
(1) Delivery of Plasmid DNA to Mammalian Cells
Through the Gateway method, we have assembled many promoter-gene constructs as detailed on our Parts Page. After construction of the plasmid, we deliver the plasmid DNA to Mammalian Cells through the use of transient transfection, lipofection with Lipofectamine 2000 reage
Images of eYFp/mKate transfection from Confocal
This figure shows HEK293 cells which were transiently transfected with Hef1A:eYFP and Hef1A:mKate using Lipofectamine 2000. Equimole amounts of DNA were delivered, 500 ng total per 1.65 uL of reagent. Images were taken on a Zeiss microscope at 10X.
(2) Delivery of 2'-O-Me RNA to Mammalian Cells
For the purpose of our experiments, RNA oligos with chemical modifications that confer significant overall stability and  increase in Tm is necessary to prevent spontaneous dissociation and rapid degradation by nucleases under in vivo conditions. One form of chemically modified RNA, 2’O-Methyl RNA, is a naturally occurring and nontoxic RNA variant found in mammalian ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. These modified oligos are in most respects similar to RNA, but the 2' O-Methyl modification increases overall stability as the -OH functional group at the 2' position is replaced with a -OMe group, which can't perform cleavage of the RNA backbone. In addition to significant nuclease stability, the modification seem to confer increases in Tm, which minimizes the chance of the RNA strands dissociating upon introduction to a cellular environment. (CITATION NEEDED!)
Therefore, we need the ability to deliver 2’-O-Methyl RNA to mammalian cells.
The movie below shows HEK293 cells expressing constitutive eYFP with a 2'-O-Methyl RNA strand labeled with ROX (5-carboxy-x-rhodamine) on the 3' end. As time passes, the complex/vesicles are uptaken by the cell, releasing their payload resulting in whole cell fluorescence. Each frame is 5 minutes, movie encompasses 200 minutes in 9 seconds.

Reproducibility is the main concern with many science based innovations and our hope is that with the DNA Origami library, we are able to cut down on time and resources spent troubleshooting with DNA origami construction, so that innovators can dedicate their energy innovating with DNA origami rather than making DNA origami. Our hope is that from this open source frame work, innovations with DNA origami can come about similar to how dNANO is an innovation in nano circuitry stemming off of DNA origami. However, with many innovations come the issue of ownership and intellectual property.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property is described as any product, invention that has come about from the creative process and has the ability to be protected by a patent, copyright, trademark or any other form of legislative protection. With our novel innovation in DNA origami, dNANO, we wanted to know more about the legislation that is out there to ensure that any innovations from our open source initiative can be made ours. We consulted TEC Edmonton, a startup incubator for more information in regards to IP rights in determining what is protected under Canadian patent law. A patent is a method of protecting inventions in which the inventor discloses the details of the creation to the level of detail where another individual can replicate the device in place for exclusive rights to that invention for set amount of time. In Canada and the United States that time is 20 years. According to TEC, in order for an invention to be patentable it must demonstrate 3 attributes:
Novelty- Is this invention/application the first of its kind?
Usefulness- Does this invention show some sort of utility?
Non obviousness- The invention must improve on existing technology that is not obvious. For example, one cannot patent a series of lightbulbs since it does not deviate enough from the base invention being the lightbulb.
Things that can be patented are concepts, inventions and applications of other products. In every patent is a state of claims made by the inventor, so long as there is enough evidence to demonstrate what is claimed in the patent then it has the potential to be patented. By doing so the patentee is claiming their creation is reasonably enabled. The team broke down the DNA origami aspect into three individual components: the template strand, the staple strands and the final structure which all can be patented.
As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This"

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Non-antibiotic-Markers#Sucrose-Hydrolase_-_-_TEXT.html," selectable marker is that more time is required for the growth of the cscA cells on sucrose plates (we incubated them overnight at 37°C+4 days at room temperature, but they might have grown faster had we left them in the incubator).
Figure 5: Cells transformed with cscA ( BBa_K917000 ) (bottom row) as well as control cells (top row) were spread on LB plate, minimal plate with sucrose, minimal plate with glucose and minimal plate with no sugars, straight after transformation (without preselection on chloramphenicol).  Neither the cscA nor the control cells grow on minimal media with no sugars and grew well on LB and minimal plate with glucose. However, cscA cells are growing on minimal media with sucrose while the control cells are not.
Liquid Cultures
In order to better quantify our results, we have decided to grow our transformants in liquid media and measure OD after overnight incubation. We set up bottles with the same media as we have used for the plates (LB, M9 minimal medium with no sugars, M9 with 1% glucose and M9 with 1% sucrose), inoculated them with cscA or control transformants grown overnight and incubated them overnight before measuring OD. The results can be seen in Figure 6 below.
Figure 6: Comparison of growth between cells containing the sucrose hydrolase (cscA) selectable marker and control. LB and M9 glucose were used as positive controls, M9 with no sugars was used as a negative control.
Citrobacter xylitol selection marker strategy
In addition to E. coli, we were also working with the organism Citrobacter freundii over summer.
Unfortunately, we could not test our sucrose hydrolase selection system in this organism, as it can already degrade sucrose naturally. We have therefore devised the concept for an alternative sugar selection system that could be used in Citrobacter freundii. This sugar selection system is based on the sugar alcohol xylitol – our Citrobacter freundii sugar use experiments show that it cannot grow on this sugar as a sole carbon source, so it seems to be an ideal candidate for selectable marker design.
As some organisms can use and degrade xylitol, we have found an enzyme, called
xylitol dehydrogenase , which oxidizes xylitol to xylulose. This gene can be found in (for example) the gram negative rod Gluconobacter oxydans which is also friendly to humans, as it is not"

Ran PCR with newly extracted D. rad DNA. Hopeful for success.
Sent successful E. coli biobrick samples for Sanger sequencing.
Mini-prepped second inoculations from unsuccessful transformations.  Attempted new DNA extraction technique on D. rad to obtain enough DNA to run successful PCRs. Nanodrop results to follow.
Ran PCR with new D. rad DNA. Continues to be unsuccessful. We will attempt a new method of extracting D. rad DNA.  Received Sanger sequencing results back for our transformed E. coli biobrick samples. Multiple successful gene insertions! Transformed the unsuccessful one again in hopes of obtaining a colony with our inserted radioresistant gene.  Looking to verify that RBS's successfully ligated into pSB1A10 before we add in our successful biobricks. Digested plasmids with EcoR1 and Pst1. Will run a 2% gel and low voltage to attempt to see the 15bp RBS's with their overhangs on the gel.  Identification of RBS on the 2% gel unsuccessful.
Preparing glycerol stocks of all strains that were successfully transformed with verified biobricks.
Growing up large quantities of plasmid containing RBS so we can insert a promoter upstream and our gene of interest downstream.
Also trying to use primers that amplify only the biobrick region of the plasmid, to try to avoid the need to grow up large colonies for every part - if we can amplify just the biobrick region we will be able to ligate the pieces we need directly into the plasm"

1.Antibiotics resistance.
Early in 1945, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, warned that bacteria would finally be resistant to drugs. An increasing number of antibiotics including penicillin are found to lose their effectiveness because of drug resistance, the result of which is lack of effective ways to defeat bacteria in the future [1]. For example, Staphylococcus aureus become less sensitive to penicillin, one of beta-lactam antibiotics, for the acquiring of a penicillin binding-protein. Even worse, all the beta-lactam antibiotics are useless to Staphylococcus aureus infection for the same resistant mechanism. And the strains acquiring the resistance were termed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). According to the ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE Global Report on Surveillance of World Health Organization in 2014, community-acquired MRSA has increased greatly in several countries over the past decade. The report showed that MRSA proportions had exceeded 20% in all WHO regions, and even 80% in some areas [1]. Tuberculosis(TB) is a widespread, fatal, infectious disease. Its resistance appears soon after introduction of antibiotics, and has developed to multi-drug resistance(MDR). It’s estimated that, on global level, there are 3.6% new tuberculosis cases with multi-drug resistance [1]. (figure1)'Traditional Arabic'
Figure1: Proportion of new TB case with multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) worldwide [1].
There are some ways to fight against the antibiotic resistance, such as restricted politics [1]. As a researcher"

THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Our team had the opportunity of receiving a tour of the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Lethbridge. This plant was built in the early 1900s and it is a biological nutrient facility, which makes it belong to the top five percent of all the treatment plants in the world. The plant removes phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (pollution), as well as works to reduces fecal and total coliform. The wastewater treatment plant is licensed under the Alberta Government which ensures that certain rules and obligations must be met. Our team had a tour of the plant led by Duane Guzzi, the Process Coordinator of the wastewater treatment plant. During the tour we learned valuable information that would help us for the success of our project. As our project deals with the extraction of metals from tailings ponds, going to a wastewater treatment plant was beneficial as we learned the procedures and methods they take to remove chemicals from water and make it safe for rivers.
The Wastewater Treatment Plant is licensed under the Alberta Government, which ensures that certain rules and obligations must be met.  During the tour, we learned about the procedures and methods that are taken to remove chemicals from water and make it safe for release. Surprisingly, we discovered a few similarities between our system and the plant’s operations. The plant processes bacteria in order for it to form into flocks and create a netting; then, it sinks to the bottom of the tank and is subsequently able to be removed easily.
Our project is very similar to this process, as we use phages that have inducible precipitation, to allow for easy removal after metal ion capture. This tour also provided us with valuable knowledge on how we can integrate our system into the plant. Mr. Guzzi told us that our project could be integrated into the secondary clarifiers, to remove the metals that are contained within the wastewater. If our project was integrated into the secondary clarifiers, the metals that are contained in the wastewater could be removed before moving on to ultraviolet disinfection, where the microorganisms that are left in the water are disrupted and unable to reproduce and cause harm."
Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#Testtext_-_-_TEXT.html," tract [17] ) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.
Figure 2) Ein anderer Titel
Ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung... etc
Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in [5] ). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested in vivo. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well [6] and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters [7] and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements [8] , but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength [9] , [10] .
In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several ""domains"". The core promoter is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in [11] ). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as ""enhancers"" and ""silencers"". A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity [5] .

I. Overview
After setting our goal to decompose synthetic dye with laccases, we sought to find out more information of biological sewage treatment and practical problems that required to be addressed. We also wanted to find out how our project could be applied to real world sewage treatment, and what change should we make to improve our project.
Therefore, we visited Hanghua sewage plant（World Trade Center, Beijing, China). Hanghua sewage plant was experienced in using biology method to decompose pollutant while they also had used other ways, including chemical and physical methods. Mr. Li, the manager of the sewage plant, told us lots of information we needed.
II. Silver
During the interview, we found out the situation of each current methods.
a. Chemical and Physical Methods
First of all, we learned that their previous chemical and physical techniques such as active carbon adsorption and oxidation method, and being expensive in cost for both methods, the sewage plant had to switched to biological treatment.
b. Biological Method
Hanghua sewage plant mainly used integrated sewage treatment device, in which a critical step was to add bacteria to decompose pollutant. Specially engineered bacteria were able to reproduce rapidly in sewage water, and this allowed the factory to process waste water with relatively lower financial requirement.
However, the bacteria used in sewage treatment may release toxic gases such as H2S. The plant had to turn on the ventilation system periodically, which consumed large amount of electric power and produced loud noise. As time went by, the advantage of lower cost is offsetted by electricity bills and the higher payment for their workers working under unfriendly environment.
In traditional biological treatment method, bacteria are usually injected into waste water directly, floating, growing, as well as continuously being removed by the outflow. The dynamic balance of bacteria concentration might be broken by increasing the total flow of sewage water. Under extreme circumstances, growth rate of bacteria might be overwhelmed by the loss rate through outflow. Moreover, workers in the sewage treatment plant told us, due to wear and tear since 2003 and other undiscovered problems, the total ability of sewage treatment had dropped 40%.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," our community you should go every year and get tested? Sorry, but I don’t know if that is gonna happen. I think realistically it is gonna be directed from a program. It is not gonna come from the people themselves. It would honestly be nice to have a chlamydia test in the clinic. Not just for trachoma but also for sexually transmitted disease. I am not saying that it wouldn’t be useful, but in terms of like actually eliminating trachoma, I don’t know how much that would help. […] Even if you were an individual who went to the clinic, you wouldn’t be able to afford the azithromycine. It would be way to expensive for you. You could go for tetracycline, that you could afford I guess.
Daniel C.:
But is it that expensive? I mean, antibiotics are pretty cheap.
Dr. Keenan:
It is not available. It is unavailable in basically all countries that have trachoma. The only way for it to be available is through Pfizer’s donation.
Daniel C.:
But I mean that is more or less the government's fault, right? They could just import it.
Dr. Keenan:
Well, it is expensive. I mean it is just that people can not afford it. Trachoma happens at really poor places. People…they can’t afford lots of things. The government provides some medicines for free but it doesn’t make sense for them to provide azithromycine. It is just more expensive than domoxin or something like that.
Dominika:
You explained that there are many kids younger than 9 who get infected with chlamydia. Do you have an idea what’s the reason for that?
Dr. Keenan:
Well it is probably that there is some immunity that happens. In generally there is bad immunity for chlamydia and you get infected lots and lots of times but probably over the time you develop some sort of immunity. So even when you are exposed to chlamydia you won’t get the infection. And kids are just very active and they have their fingers in their eyes all the time, they play with other kids and they are not careful with their personal hygiene. They are much more likely to eat dirty and have chlamydia on their cloths and their fingers and faces and that is basically the source of transmission to other kids they are playing with.
Kai:
Do you have any idea why trachoma is such a big problem especially in Ethiopia?
Dr. Keenan:
No, actually people really don’t know why. I"

Improved part from Virginia 2017: BBa_K2272019
The two parts from iGEM13 DTU-Denmark, BBa_K1067002 and BBa_K1067004 , are protein coding sequences extracted from the genome of Nitrosomonas europaea that code for nitrification enzymes: hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and cytochrome cycA&X. The homolog developed by DTU-Denmark used what we believed to be an improper coding sequence for a one of the subunits, HAO-B.  HAO-B is a putative protein, that at the time may not have been believed to be significant.  However, after reviewing the sequence registered in the BLAST database, we believed that HAO-B played a fundamental role in the mechanism of HAO. Since the two parts work hand in hand to nitrify ammonium, we improved the parts from DTU-Denmark by combining the two parts, inserting conditionally inducible promoters, and using signal peptides to transport the enzymes to their designated location in the cell."

Hypotheses
The following hypotheses have been made for this model.
we just need LacI concentration for surfactant production and not Sfp and AbrB concentration because there is a proportional link between them. If there are LacI proteins produced, there will be also Sfp and AbrB proteins.
we assumed that there will be no degradation of IPTG due to its high stability[4] and no metabolism of Xylose in our condition[5].
we are aware of LacI[6] and XylR[7] dimerisation as fundamental functional unit but they are not taken into account in this model.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," and most believe there is regulation needed to prevent this. 34% does not see this possibility as a real thread and think either that there is sufficient regulation already, or just does not fear this at all. It is hard to say whether new regulations can overcome the unforeseeable problems that come with synthetic biology. An issue in respect to safety is the emergence of DIY biology, which can increase the risk of errors significantly.
Most people acknowledge the risk of synthetic biology principles being used for terrorist purposes, but in contrast to the previous question, there are much more people that think new regulation will not be the answer, mostly because they have the feeling that if terrorist want to use synthetic biology as a means to their own ends, they will find a way of doing that anyway. Nevertheless the plurality of the group believes that enforcing additional policies can minimize this risk.
Synthetic biologists are generally careful. Only a very small group can be described as optimistic and fearless, whereas the plurality would conduct additional research to minimize any risks. Moreover, the majority thinks that the public is even more fearful and risk-averse than researchers are. They believe that the public first wants proof that a certain project is safe, before pursuing any goals. Furthermore, the influence of communication between researchers and the public on risk assessment is important.
How does the synthetic biology community thinks about life, what values they give to it, what does it means to them, and to what extend can it be explained (reduced) in terms of science? To a certain extend, these questions should make the reader aware that they are working with living systems with a certain worth but and make them think about how research may effect the value or perception of life. The ultimate way of applying the reductionist approach could well explain life, consequently have certain implications. Whether this point will ever be reached is doubtful. What is the scientific opinion? If research proves that life is reducible and independent of any non-materialistic properties, then most participants would believe this. Conceivably, a large plurality of the group does not believe that God has a hand in life.
In contrast to the previous question, the statement saying that life is holy/scared is answered more diversely. The group that rejects the statement is equally big as the group that embraces it. Even though the majority of the group does not think that God has a hand in life, the believe that life is holy/sacred is still very much divided, which indicates that there is not a necessary relation between the existence of a God and sacred or holy properties of life.
Although many people think that the reductionist approach can reveal the properties"

If these don’t work I have plenty of stuff left over from my low-melt that I’m very certain of, so I can go back to this point later if needs be. I then transformed my ligated plasmids into DH5α and plated them on LB+CAM plates overnight according to the protocol.
June 5, 2014
--CS-- Today I did the colony PCR of my transformed bacteria. I then ran a gel of the PCR products. My gels looked like this:
Image on left is gel including DNA ladder, the 8 selected norB colonies, another DNA ladder, and the first 4 selected nosZ colonies. Image on right is gel including DNA ladder, the 8 selected norC colonies, another DNA ladder, and the last 4 selected nosZ colonies.
Based on the gene lengths (norB is 1400 bp, norC is 440 bp, and nosZ is 1910 bp), it appears that my norC gene worked well but I’m not really sure on the other ones. I will talk to Dr. Grose about it next week. I also streaked out plates with the colonies that I had picked for PCR and put those in the 37°C incubator.
Week of June 14th
June 10, 2014
--JR--Looked at iGEM webpage, tried to figure out some code things….
--CS-- So I talked to Dr. Grose about my colony PCR results and since there were some solid bands for norB and nosZ but the bands were not in the spot they are supposed to be (both appear to be shorter than they should be), I did another colony PCR with the DNA from the colonies. This time I used the pSB1C3 forward and reverse primers (307 and 308) to check since those primers are known to work and the primers appeared to have caused the problem with my PCR (there was a laddering pattern observed in the gel, suggesting that the binding wasn’t very good). I then ran the PCR products on a gel. My gels looked like this, with 4 DNA ladders spread throughout the 8 selected norB colonies, 7 of the selected nosZ colonies, and a norC positive control from a previous experiment that had worked properly:
All of these bands are for rather short sequences, suggesting that the pSB1C3 vectors closed in on themselves instead of adding the genes like we hoped they would during the incubation. I used CIP during the"
SCUT-FSE-CHINA,2017,Team:SCUT-FSE-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," our team attended Asia-Pacific conference held by team NCTU-Formosa About 20 teams participated in the conference. During this conference, we learnt about plenty of exciting ideas and got so much useful help.
This year is our first time participating in iGEM, so we attach great importance to this conference. We started preparing for our presentation one month before this conference. On Aug 2nd, We presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our project design. Most importantly, in the Q&A section, the questions raised by other teams referred not only about the project design, but also extended to consideration about safety issues, which gave us a lot of inspiration.
In addition, this conference has played an important role in deepening the friendship between us and other teams. We communicated with each other and learnt from each other.
Conference of China iGEMer Community
Time：August 26th-28th    Location：SCUT
We took part in the CCiC held by FAFU-China in Fujian. Over 300 iGEMers from about 50 teams from all around the country participated in the conference. Special guests including Prof. King L. Chow from HKUST, Prof. Kenneth A. Oye from MIT and Dr. Luping Xu, the deputy director of Open FIESTA, and so on, made splendid and inspiring speeches about the relation between their jobs and synthetic biology.
All of the teams presented their projects and discussed with each other. We greatly enlarged our horizons by sharing ideas with other teams and we felt inspired about the questions they raised in the Q&A part. One of the audiences asked how do we ensure the undesired bacteria would not survive with the nitrogen and phosphorus provided by our robust E.coli. For this concern, we have designed an experiment that introducing other bacteria into the medium and have them grown together with our engineering bacteria to test its function. Some teams mentioned that they sometimes suffered from the failure of the experiments because of the phage infection, so we conducted surveys among the iGEM teams to investigate the severity of bacterial contamination and phage infection in their labs and other relative problems. See our SURVEY results here .
We were excited to find that some of the team projects have relationship with ours to some extent, so we exchanged our ideas more deeply with the hope of building up collaboration with each other.
