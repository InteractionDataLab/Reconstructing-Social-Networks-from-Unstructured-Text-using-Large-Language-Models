TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," to avoid transport of the germs to the global water circuit. Usage in open basins must be excluded. For the security of populace, the bacteria should have certain features which prevent viability outside of determined laboratory conditions. It makes sense to convert the energy generating metabolism to ethylene glycol. In nature, this substance occurs in small quantities only, so the risk of unintended spread is minimized.  The accumulation of Catechol in the defecator holds another minor security risk. As mentioned before, it must be guaranteed that the water is completely cleaned of Catechol. This can be accomplished by heating the water to 80° Celsius. Catechol boils at this temperature and could be extracted by condensation.  In plants built for the extraction from waste, this risk is rated lower, still the Catechol must be removed properly from the nutrition medium.
d) Aspects of economy
It is often the aspects of economy, not sustainability, which determine whether technologies establish on the market or not. Considering the processing from PET waste to Catechol, it seems that both aspects are reconciled. An economic incentive is the immense accretion of non-recyclable PET to Catechol, so investors for plants with appropriate safety standards should easily be found. As opposed to defecators, here the input of PET and thus the expected profit is known, so a precise calculation is easy.  In economic use, the patents have to be regarded, for example those on the most effective Cutinase by the Henkel company. Otherwise, the requested enzyme might be developed by selective evolution and would be patent-free. It still has to be clarified whether the research unit can apply for a patent for the newly designed bacterium and thus preserve turnover rights.  Anyhow, given the approval for use of the bacteria, the plant would be profitable. Compared to chemical methods, it can operate with milder requirements. The crude material as well as ingredients for the cultural medium is quite cheap. At this time, the bacteria can only degrade new, pure PET, but it is presumably only a matter of time until methods are developed to process old PET and filter additives like Bisphenol A.  As long as non-recyclable PET is available, profitability is ensured. Possibly the price of PET would increase, so eventually there will be an incentive to filter it from the sea.   To cleanse the global oceans on that account would be a way of reason through profit.
e) Aspects of legality
Apart from the patent rights mentioned before, approvals have to be obtained before a plant can be built"

Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," and translated, which enables part 3 to work, thus transcribe more GFP mRNAs. And these GFP mRNAs can also be used to active more part 2.
Experiment & Result
Firstly, we need to construct three parts of the gene circuit:
Part 1: T7 promoter + toehold triggered by miR144 + GFP + T7 terminator
For part 1, we want to add the toehold triggered by miR-144 to the upstream region of the GFP coding sequence. We used gene2oligo to design many short single-strand DNA and then conducted LCR and second PCR to synthesis our part 1. (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1700000:Design)
Part 2: T7 promoter + toehold triggered by GFP mRNA + T3 RNA polymerase + T7 terminator
We can obtained T3 RNAP sequence from BBa_K346000 in iGEM distribution. This part was much larger than part 1, so LCR could be inconvenient and expensive. So we used assembly PCR method to add T7 promotor, toehold triggered by GFP mRNA and T7 terminator to the gene. (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1700001:Design)
Part 3: T3 promoter + RBS + GFP + terminator
Part 3 consisted of a GFP generator and a T3 promoter. GFP together with RBS and terminator was got from BBa_E0840 from iGEM distribution. Then we again used assembly PCR to add T3 promotor to the gene.
Secondly, we linked the 3 parts in order into one plasmid – pSB1C1. We designed primers which helped add BsaI cutting site to the parts and the backbone of the plasmid. BsaI site in the parts was mutated by overlap PCR. Then we used Golden Gate assembly to link the three parts and the plasmid together.
Finally, we want to apply our experiment to the cell free system and make the freeze-drying paper and use the paper to test saliva for diagnosing esophagus cancer. We are really sorry that we didn’t finish this part because our time is limited and so we didn’t have time to do it.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Although nowadays it is easy to find any information you seek for, there is also a great problem of society's disinformation. Scientific community is rather closed and rarely present its work to audiences not related with science. As a consequence, society's beliefs are formed by low quality online newspapers and other unreliable sources, often providing readers with inaccurate information.
As a team of young scientists, working with synthetic biology and genetic engineering, we are concerned about society‘s attitude towards life sciences. As a survey, conducted in collaboration with Aachen iGEM team , showed, Lithuania’s society is poorly informed about the field, therefore, also rather critical. We seek to enlighten society and foster scientific culture as well as encourage young audiences to pursue careers in science. We also believe that establishing the dialogue between science and society is the main fuel for scientific progress. Science should benefit the society, therefore, it is important for scientists to know society's needs and worries and for society to clearly understand the benefits new technologies and inventions can offer as well as get closer with the field to have more trust in it. It was very important for us to reach as many people as possible, so a great variety of activities, suited for a wide age spectrum, were organised.
First of all, we drew our attention to the future generation. In order to get in touch, we contacted 11 schools and held lessons there. In the theoretical part of these events, we explained to high school students, what synthetic biology is and how scientific work looks like. We also tried our best to familiarize them with the scientific atmosphere by letting to try how automatic pipettes work. We also organised a competition for school students, providing a prize of tours around most innovative life sciences centres in Lithuania. We did not forget younger students as well. For this reason, we conducted few workshops for primary school students at 'Children's university' and 'The Centre for Child Development'. During these activities, we were encouraging students to imagine, what project would they do, if they were participating in iGEM. Their ideas and imagination were helpful for us by reminding to keep dreaming about the 'impossible'.

5.1 Definition of Genetic Circuit
A Genetic Circuit is a biological unit which could achieve specific function(s). In Parts Registry, we found that some submitted parts can already be a functional unit. However, we consider that those parts (which contain a series of Biobricks) have disorganized the Parts Registry and we expect to DEVELOP a standard to solve the problem. The definition of Genetic Circuit can be summarized as following points:
A Genetic Circuit is composed of genetic Coding-frames.
A Coding-frame is strictly defined as a combination of various biobricks. It MUST contains four types of component: Promoter, RBS, Coding sequence, Terminator (If a component hasn’t been registered in Parts Registry, at least it should be modularized and standardized). Essentially, a Coding-frame is a DNA sequence.
Different Coding-frames can influence each other with expressing various molecular signals. They can also be stimulated by the surrounding factors (physical, biological, chemical, etc.). In other words, Different Coding-frames can set up a logical regular system (Such as an AND-gate relation). Therefore, a Genetic Circuit possesses outer and inner logical relations. This is what the Part Registry can’t record.
Each Genetic Circuit should be given some labels that we can sort it into the Mind Road of the Bio-miao platform.

A Genetic Circuit consists of Coding-frames. A Coding-frame consist of four types of biobrick in the correct order: Promoter, RBS, coding sequence, terminator. Each component should have an individual number in Parts Registry. If not, the submitter should state how you modularized and standardized it.
5.3 Description of the Genetic Circuit
The Description of a Genetic Circuit should contain following information:
The function or purpose of the Circuit and how does it work.
All the components of your Circuit. [Coding-frames and the biobricks information]
The Circuit Diagram.
5.4 The Categorization of Genetic Circuit
We plan to sort all the circuit according to the practical function it can do. Then the Mind Road will dynamically generate a series of bubbles that contains all the submitted circuits. What submitter need to do is to write some labels that can precisely describe the potential function"

Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CIlam)2, (tetR)2 and (lacI)4. The internal binding strength of (tetR)2 dimer and (CIlam)2 dimer are stronger than that of (lacI)4 tetramer. more details

Week 17 (09/10 – 09/16)
The first marble pieces with synthetic black crust came out from the crustonator, and they were beautiful! This means that they needed a treatment, so we immediately spread on them our reducing bacteria. And we kept on with the applications on the other marble pieces of course, discovering that our system worked! We were so happy for that, we could start to think about a patent…
I finally finished all the exams, I felt so free! But a hard work is waiting for me in the lab, because a lot of pages have to be written and uploaded on the web site. So I passed most of the time at the pc, even if I found the time to go with Anna and Guzz and meet a nice marble cutter/artist and his brother who is a geologist. These were two very interesting meetings, from which we learned a lot of interesting things; and it was a beautiful occasion to see the place of work of an artist (what a mess!).
The degree is closer and closer, and panic is in the air! But we always needed Jason to go on with the site, so we kept on exploiting him. While Jason is adding this section about him and Giacomo he realizes they have been so overwhelmed they didn't even write these last few weeks of the Notebook, he thanks who kindly did this for them. He also remembers he forgot to add to the diary about the exams he did this summer.
Week 18 and 19 (09/17 – 09/26)
Amsterdam is too close and we have to do a lot of work! So we passed the last days stuck in front of our PCs and Macs without eating and sleeping. We had to find the time to finish the web site, draw the posters, finish the applications on statues, think about the activity with the Natural Sciences Museum and organize the Researcher’s night. And we could not forget the presentation and the speech… It was a very hard work, and at the end we were dead tired… But full of enthusiasm to fly to Amsterdam! Boston is waiting for us, guys!

Overview
As part of our sequence verification method, we need a means to quickly and accessibly classify sequenced DNA as natural EPO genes, artificial EPO genes, or other DNA. We created a software tool in R, an open-source programming language that can be augmented with packages that are convenient for working with genomic data ( R core team, 2015 ). The tool can perform the classification for any gene based on comparison of the input sequence to a custom database. Our database contains natural sequences with variations corresponding to misreads, and artificial sequences with codon mutations around exon-exon junctions. Natural genes do not have exon-exon junctions, which allows their distinction from artificial DNA. Our tool calculates alignment scores, based on which an input sequence (fasta file or typed sequence) is classified using the k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm ( Torgo et al., 2010 ). The database accommodates every new artificial EPO DNA that is analyzed. In this way, evolved EPO gene doping sequences update the database resulting in ever-increasing accuracy. The second branch of software we developed is able to find a minimal set of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to detect the plethora of variations that can be made to a gene. The repository to our software can be found here .
Figure 1. Schematic of our software tools. The input is a DNA sequence received from our targeted sequencing step, which is classified using our sequence classification tool. If it is classified as gene doping and not in our doping sequence database yet, we add it to this database. If the sequence codes for a new amino acid sequence that other sequences in the database do not code for, it is passed on to the gRNA generation tool. Passing the sequences from the sequence classification tool to the gRNA generation tool is not yet automated, so this step is indicated with a dotted arrow.
Our software tool has two main goals:
Distinguish gene doping sequences from endogenous DNA.
Design a minimal set of gRNAs to most efficiently detect the high amount of variance that can be present in gene doping genes.
The tool we developed meets these goals and has the following features:
Our tool can currently tell apart more than 80% of gene doping sequences from any other DNA.*
Our tool allows us to reduce the required guide RNAs to detect gene doping from 10104 to only 12 guide RNAs.

A cPCR of the colonies with the MinC protein with the Sce VME intein showed that the gene for the intein was present in the cells that were supposed to carry it! A small victory, perhaps, but it shows that the Gibson assembly works, contrary to out experiences with the positive control. A site directed mutagenesis must be performed on the gene to convert an internal lysine into a phenylalanine, which has been shown to make the intein temperature sensitive. The primers for this reaction have been eluted, but we are still waiting for a plasmid stock of the minC-intein plasmid. By the way, the MinC protein was chosen because it can be used as a kill switch and has the necessary sequence (G-C) that the intein uses for self excision.
There are two distinct bands on the RFP PCR, one at the correct length, the other much lower. Seems like a perfect chance for gel extraction. Several other products were also generated today, but there are still two essential parts, that of YFP and that of the new arabinose promoter, which have not yet been successfully PCR'd.
The cPCR on the DszA colonies gave no result. This may have been due to an unoptimized Taq protocol,and might be worth repeating.

The Gibson assembled parts using unpurified PCR products did not work. I think it was because of the extra salts, etc that would be present in the PCR mix. As a note, make sure to somehow purify your PCR product before doing a Gibson assembly!
There were many colonies on the 6I ligation heat shock (but not electroshock) plate. However, there were of insufficient size to work with, so they were left to grow for another day (or 2, considering how the power will be out on the 18th).
The plans for the metA construct induction were further discussed. Overnight colonies will be made of the construct and a negative control, then they will be diluted in 1 in 100 LB, allowed to grow to 0.4 OD, induced with 0.1 mM new IPTG, and harvested at a certain OD following this, then run on an SDS PAGE. This will test to see if the IPTG really would stimulate the production of the metA gene. The negative controls were not in place yet. Four potential constructs have been grown up overnight, and are labeled 1-4 on tape in the right section of the left shaker. Is there some label on the"

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"symbolized by delay elements). Consequently, this editing would allow the next DNA frame to be written to (symbolized with AND gates) after a set period of time. However, we suspected from the beginning that we would observe something much less digital in our biological circuit.
Figure 12: Logic diagram for recording circuit
To address this timing concern, we incorporated our base editor equations into a larger model. Instead of just mutating one piece of DNA, we assumed that the first mutation would open up the next DNA frame to be modified, that the second mutation would open up the next, and so on. By pretending that the DNA was essentially transformed into another species, we could then track the strength of each reading frame over time. While not entirely predicative of the final readout (the decay time of the stimulus gRNA plays a large role in exactly how many mutations get written where), if the frame shift timing was extremely nonlinear and messy, then the final readout would almost certainly be as well.
We made use of the BioNetGen ode simulation method (which in turn makes use of the cvode library of ODE solvers) and suite of visualization tools to generate our estimations. Our initial circuit design was simulated over the course of 20,000 minutes (~14 days), with results pictured below:
Figure 13: Bionetgen simulation run with a single gRNA. Targets can be written to as soon as the previous one has been mutated. Comparison to CAMERA experiment shown in the top right.
Comparing to a similar experiment conducted in the DOMINO paper, these predictions seem to be accurate. While in some cases it would be plausible to use these predictions as way to classify our readouts (for example A%  of target 1, B% of target 2 corresponds to time point T), we worried that the signal to noise ratio would be too small to distinguish timepoints across a large section of the recording window.
In order to more clearly differentiate between timepoints, we needed a way to convert our signal into something more digital. One way to do this would be to prevent the next DNA frame from being written to until the first was sufficiently edited. Therefore we decided to use two alternating gRNA’s (see our design page for more details) to mutate our targets. Installing and tuning the period of our own oscillatory circuit  inside the bacteria was clearly impractical given the our project’s time constraints, so we needed a straightforward and effective way of creating oscillations externally. After reading about the effectiveness of  blue light mediated promoters/repressors studied by Jayaraman et al., we decided to utilize"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the recovery would take place inside the shaker. After overnight incubation at 37 degree, the Positive Control and Negative Control plates contained numerous colonies. I initially though that the other plates did not contain any colony, but Traci took a look at them and realized that one of the plate (Bba_E0240 + Bba_I14033) contained small colonies. Meanwhile, plates that were made with more concentration of cells (~2 mL) had more visible colonies on it. So Traci told me and Kyle to transform some ligation reactions into 3 and 4 mL of pelleted cells, respectively. I did that with Vanessa's overnight ligation of YFP Composite + pCat (Bba_E0430 + Bba_I14033) and my quick ligation of GFP Composite + R2000. The results were still unreliable as only the latter had colonies, but at least something worked.
I prepared plasmid preps for the Bba R2000_E0240 and Bba I14033_E0240, then incubate them inside the 37 degree shaker overnight. I found out on the next morning that the plasmid preps were not as opaque as usual. They were at most 60-70% cloudy-looking, signifying that the bacterial amplification in this LB broth liquid culture was not optimal. When I did nanodrop quantification on the plasmid obtained from my plates (the first eight), Kyle's (the next four) and Vanessa's (the last one), the obtained values seemed smaller than our other plasmids.

Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies, the cost of drugs needs to be abridged if we expect to apply the updating research to clinical treatment, which may indicate the direction of our future work.
At the same time, we are very moved to see that, Ms. Guo, who was suffering from cancer, still concerned about the promotion of cancer therapy. Indeed, there exists criminals who exaggerate the new therapies with excessive or false propaganda, thus hampered the promotion of new therapies. We should also keep working to support the promotion of tumor therapy and the elimination of false advertising.

Team NJU-China tried to introduce synthetic biology to people through various ways. This year, NJU-China planned to arouse adolescents’ interest towards this new field of science by organizing lectures for high school students. After the discussion, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory. Through these activities, we successfully presented the basic information about iGEM and synthetic biology to the youth.
Figure 13. Our instructor is introducing our lab to high school students
On Aug 20th, we held a lecture to the participants of a biology summer camp held by Nanjing University, who were high school students from all over China. The presentation consisted of an introduction of iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. Most students showed strong interests in our project and iGEM. The aim of the lecture was to let students have better understanding of the applications and benefits of synthetic biology. We believe that giving presentation about iGEM to high school students, we, college students as well as iGEMers, can inspire them to think deeper about how synthetic biology can change our lives. After the talk, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory where our experiments were taken.

Modelling
Mario modelled the light kill switch which, he got advice of how to do dynamic modeling by his supervisors Emma and Rob. Remco modelled the interaction between the BeeT, Varroa, and Bees to investigate how BeeT would spread through the hive and affect the mite and bee population. His teammate Ronald explained to Remco how to use R and also helped him with bash related problems he encountered in the process. His supervisors Rob and Emma gave him advice.
Angelina modelled the quorum sensing subpopulation system. Her teammates Remco and Ronald helped her with some of the problems. Her supervisor Rob gave her advice on how to make the model and Ronald worked on the metabolic modelling and an in vitro toxicity assay, he got help from his teammate Thomas when he went into the lab. He was supervised by Maarten Reijnders.
Human Practice
Carina is our Captain Human Practice, Carina forms the Human Practice team with Linea and Belwina. As one of the first things they did was get in contact with Beekeepers association in Wageningen (NBV). Together with them we tried to think of a solution for the dying bees. We have a collaboration with Synenergene where an application scenario was generated. A movie about synthetic biology has been made for the RIVM. We also had a collaboration with the Design Academy Eindhoven, where Thieu Custers made our product design.
Wiki Construction
Lisa is the Wiki Captain, together with Ronald, Remco and Tianhe the design of the wiki was made. We got advice from the Rik van Rosmalen on making the Wiki. Lisa made all the illustrations herself and together with the guys did most of the programming work. Every team member worked hard to get his/her personal pages on the wiki.
Finances
With Angelina as our Treasurer, the finances were managed together with Jaccoline for the crowdfunding. For the crowdfunding we got help from Arianne van Ballegooij, she told us how we could sell ourselves the best. Mario looked for the plane tickets and accommodation. As a team we searched for sponsors and got advice from our supervisors, specialists at the university and previous iGEM team members. We searched all together for sponsors, we asked the previous Wageningen UR team which companies they would recommend us to approach.

Loop Insertion
Modification of the Viral Capsid of the AAV2 using Viral Bricks
For therapeutical applications in human gene transfer, the broad tropism for heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has to be knocked-out and a novel tropism has to be inserted. This retargeting can be achieved either by insertion of functional motifs into the two major surface exposed loops or by fusion of these motifs to the N-terminus of the viral coat proteins. The graphic on the right shows parts of the three-dimensional structure of a viral coat protein. The parts of the loop regions that are coded in the ViralBricks are shown in purple for the 453 loop and in blue for the 587 loop.
Three-dimensional representation of the AAV2 showing the amino acids of the 453 and 587 loops that are coded by the corresponding Viral Bricks.
Cloning of Viral Bricks into capsid coding parts
In order to make loop insertions more convenient the following restriction sites were inserted into all capsid coding parts and already existing restriction sites were removed from the constructs. The choice of these restriction sites was reasoned by enzyme performance, buffer compatibilities and the number of existing restriction sites that had to be removed at other positions. All restriction endonucleases were purchased from NEB.
His-Affinity tag
Schematic figure of His-affinity Tag insertion into the viral capsid
The insertion of a His-Affinity Tag into the exposed major surface loops of the viral vectors allows their specific affinity purification employing e.g. Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. This purification method was tested using the cell culture lysate of transfected AAV-293 cells that were either grown in"

I downgraded to Python 2.5, and was able to get all of the modules to install and work properly.  I was finally able to generate a graph via Python in conjunction with Graphviz!!  I also experimented more with Cytoscape, another graphing program that we could use.  However, Cytoscape does not appear to be compatible with Python at the moment.  We probably will not be using Cytoscape.

During our project we get in contact with different persons on several events. For example we supported pupils during their practice week in the lab and helped them with their exhibition. In the Center for Biotechnology we gave a radio interview about the theme ""Leben leben"". This year Bielefeld celebrated its 800th anniversary year. We had a stand at the NRW-day in the city and supervised some experiments with the children and their parents at this day. In addition we organized experiments for the pupils academy at the university. Together with support of the Athena Instituut we will develop application scenarios and based on this technomoral scenarios by participating at the SYNENERGENE project. In august we organized a wiki meeting with some members of the iGEM-Team Hannover where we explained the basics of HTML and the wiki.

Primers to generate fragments for yeast assembly were made using the
NEBuilder for Gibson assembly, with 40 bp overlap between fragments. PCR was performed as usual ( see the protocol ), fragments were checked by gel electrophoresis and PCR products were purified using the PCR cleanup kit from Zymo.
Homemade heat-shock competent S. cerevisiae cells were incubated at RT for 10 minutes prior to mixing with ~400 ng of each PCR product and 100 µg sheared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma Aldrich). 700 µL of 1x LiAc/ 40% PEG-3350/ 1x TE was mixed in and solutions were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. Next, 88 µL DMSO was added, samples were mixed and heat shocked at 42°C for 7 minutes. Cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, washed with 1 ml 1x TE, resuspended in 100 µL 1x TE and plated on YPD plates. Plates were incubated over the weekend at 30°C.
To isolate the DNA from possible correct clones, a modified miniprep protocol was followed.
Colonies were inoculated in 1.5 ml YPD medium and grown overnight while shaking at 30°C. Cells were harvested in a microcentrifuge (13000 rpm, 5 minutes) and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µL STET buffer. To lyse the cells, they were disrupted in a bead beater, another 100 µL STET was added and samples were boiled for 3 minutes in a heat block. Samples were spinned down again in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were used to proceed with miniprep as usual (hyperlink). This gave fairly low plasmid yields (~30 ng/ µL), but enough to do PCR and transform into E. coli.
Correct construction of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR and sequencing.

London University Collaborations
Westminster: This year the UCL iGEM Bioprocess Team paid a visit to Godfrey Kyazze, a Lecturer in Bioprocess Technology at University of Westminster. He is involved in water science research, using microbial fuel cells to produce electricity upon the degradation of azo dyes by bacterial cells. We greatly appreciated the opportunity to speak to him about his research, go into the lab and see some real examples of fuel cell modules. Through the visit, the team has certainly gained a valuable perspective on the potential application of azo dye degradation, not only for environmental remediation, but also for the production of energy.
King's College London: We took in Bez Karkaria, a KCL student, as a fully integrated member of our team, in the hope that he will spread the skills and knowledge he has acquired alongside us to KCL, and form an iGEM team there next year.
Birkbeck: We met with the nascent Birkbeck iGEM team, who plan to enter the competition next year, and advised them on how to construct their project, how to conduct public engagement and policy work and what to focus on in the wet and dry labs.
Linden Gledhill
Linden Gledhill is a scientist inspired to art. Like us, he uses the tools of science, in his case advanced microscopy and high speed equipment to break down the physical work at different spatial and temporal scales. We noticed his pictures of azo dye crystals on flickr and contacted him over a potential collaboration. After contacting him over azo dye photos, discussing possible experiments we could carry out (LCMS, azo dye auxotrophy) and ending our conversation on discussing zombies and a ferrofluidic attack on humanity, we got him on board to help us. He kindly offered us to use his pictures and videos of azo dyes crystallisation both in our website and exhibition. IN addition to the possible ways of using his images  he gave us advice on how to make them ourselves, with the dyes we were decolourizing in the lab. We exposed a video at out UncolourmeCurious event using some footage he sent us of the crystallisation. Unfortunately we weren't able to use the pictures on the website due to the mandatory Creative Common policy of the iGEM website.
It was nevertheless very interesting to have some perspectives from a scientist and artist"

The confirmed construct was transfected into two mammalian cells, HEK293FT and HepG2 cell lines. GFP signal of the construct was compared with pEGF-N1 plasmid that contains constitutive CMV promoter. However, no GFP signal could be detected.
Since FABP1 promoter contained illegal restriction sites for BioBrick submission, we conducted multi site-directed mutagenesis to elimitate EcoRI and PstI from the coding sequence. (see Mutagenesis protocol 1,2 and 3 ).
The FABP1 promoter was to be characterized by over-expression of EGFP reporter in the presence of high fatty acid concentration in the medium1. However, no EGFP signal could be detected.
After several attempts of site-mutagenesis of promoter in FABP1 – EGFP – BBa_J176171 construct, we found that the plasmid degrades at a high temperature. We tested heat sensitivity of the plasmid BBa_J176171 and found that the plasmid degrades at denaturation step (95 °C) of polymerase chain reaction. Then, we took an alternative experiment by cloning FABP1 promoter into pBlueScript KS(+). Due to time constrain, two mutagenesis attempts were taken but both of them were not successful.
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) Promoter
We planned to clone  PPAR-alpha promoter from human genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We designed three sets of primers in upstream and downstream of promoter sequence, for different polymerases and referencing on Pineda Torra team’s experiment2. In addition, polymerase chain reaction was conducted at different temperatures, primer concentrations and buffers. However, none of the primers could successfully clone the PPAR-alpha promoter.

In order to do so, we will further characterize and optimize the project started by the Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team that focused on converting toxins in the tailings ponds into compounds that cells can metabolize. To optimize the system, we will introduce additional enzymes that will improve the efficiency of degradation and increase the degradation capabilities of the current toxin-degrading enzyme, based on our metabolic flux analysis. Further optimization will be performed by isolating the new two-enzyme system in compartments that will prevent their interaction with other naturally occurring systems and allow for their isolation and application to the tailings ponds.
(2) Our aim is to use enzymes already present in nature for removing the heavy metals found in tailings ponds by for example, magnetic nanoparticle formation. We will do this by working with the enzyme submitted by the Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team and optimizing its production conditions to allow for maximal removal of toxic heavy metals.
(3) Our aim is to rapidly form sediment composed of the fine clay particles found in the tailings ponds by using the natural properties of bacterial cells to form aggregates. The engineered bacterial cell will have the properties required to attach to and form sediment with the fine clay particles found in the tailings ponds. This system will allow for rapid clay particle removal from the tailings ponds by increasing the rate of sedimentation of the clay particles by adding biomass and aggregations in situ or in a treatment facility.
(4)    Our aim is to produce an environmentally safe tailings pond clean up kit by ensuring all components do not contain the GMO’s DNA, which could potentially have an adverse affect on the environment. We will achieve this by including a naturally occurring enzyme within the bacterial cells that will degrade the DNA when triggered. This property will make the kit environmentally safe by ensuring that the potentially harmful GMO’s DNA will not reach the environment and risk contamination.

iGEM Germany Action Day for Synthetic Biology
Background Information
Fig. 1: German iGEM logo
At a conference in Berlin organized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research all German iGEM Teams decided to take part in a Germany-wide ""Action Day"" on August 25th. The idea was to attract attention to iGEM and synthetic biology in Germany. The iGEM teams worked together to put this idea into practice. We wrote a press release for all teams that was published in several newspapers all over the country.
Each iGEM Team organized a kind of ""SynBio Action"" in its hometown on August 25th. We had an information booth in the city of Munich that we shared with the other Munich iGEM team (LMU). During the day, we informed people about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Although many people in Germany are critical about genetic engineering, they were really interested in iGEM and our project, mainly because it deals with beer. Yet many people argued that they do not support genetically modified food. They are afraid of eating it because they do not know if it interferes with their body functions.
However, we organized a poster, information materials and handouts to explain the basics of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Almost everybody liked the idea of iGEM and that we are so ambitious to take part in it. Especially the transparency of this competition and the concept of standardization"

When all components are on hand, the membrane should be sandwiched between the two frames. The two electrodes should then be jammed between the frames and the shells, along with some wire for tapping the electrodes. After that, the nuts on the threaded rods should be tightly fastened, to make sure the fuel cell is airproof.
Media and carbon sources
As explained previously , E. coli have to respire under anaerobic conditions in order for the microbial fuel cell to work. This can prove to be problematic when using media such as LB , because in the absence of oxygen the bacteria might use the available carbon source for fermentation. To prevent this, the different strains which were tested in the fuel cell were cultivated in M9 minimal medium . After consulting Dr. Falk Harnisch concerning the fermentation problem, we decided to supplement the M9 medium with different carbon sources to test how this affects bacterial growth under anaerobic conditions. The goal of this experiment was to find a carbon source which is well suited for anaerobic respiration, but cannot be used for fermentation by the bacteria.
Tests were carried out with glucose, glycerol and acetate. The amount of substrate supplemented into the medium was adjusted, so that the amount of carbon atoms was the same for each culture. The concentrations were 5.0 g/L for glucose, 5.1 g/L for glycerol and 6.8 g/L for acetate. In all cultivation experiments, two biological replica of every strain and substrate combination were prepared and each sample was diluted and measured twice. Anaerobic cultivations were conducted in 30 mL test tubes with rubber lids. Samples were taken by piercing the lid with a syringe. For aerobic cultivations shaker flasks were used. The strains tested were the KRX wild type and the KRX carrying oprF under control of the T7 promoter ( BBa_K1172502 ) strain. The latter overexpresses large porin proteins when induced with rhamnose. Induction was carried out with 4,2 mL/L of a 240 g/L rhamnose solution 1 hour after inoculation. All cultures were inoculated with an optical density of 0.22. Temperature was kept at 37°C during cultivation.

As such, we have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by using RBSes of different strength and mutated luxR promoters (lux pr). They are working on builting up a database for a series of mutation sites and RBSes corresponding to different steady-state cell densities. An artificial neural network will be built to model and predict the cell density of an E. coli population. This work can serve as a foundation for future advances involving fermentation industry and information processing.
Regulation with Light
WHU, Gold medal, Advance to Championship
Their project focuses on constructing colorful E.coli, which includes two parts. They plan to construct two systems consisting of several strains of E.coli: one produces different pigments due to the change of time, and the other produces different pigments with the change of position.
In the first part, the strain of E.coli works as an oscillator which can yield different kinds of pigment periodically with the help of a signal transformation system.
In the second part, They came up with the idea of “colorful E.film”. In hope to create a colorful film, They will construct three E.coli strains which can produce and secrete three primary colors respectively in the presence of the three primary lights.
UC Davis, gold medal
They set out to develop a quick, easy process for the expansion of basic parts into a part families. Our method employs a suped-up mutagenic PCR protocol that uses standard VF2 and VR primers and materials most iGEM teams already have on hand. They chose to prototype this process by creating a part family from the LacI promoter BBa_R0010, and to mutate GFP to visually assess our ability to create functional protein mutants.we have a functioning part family generation process and seven well-characterized LacI promoter mutants and eight GFP mutants (two of which have been lovingly named Orange-Mutated Green Fluorescent Protein or [OMGfp] 1 and 2) which await further characterization.

Events:
- We first build a simple biochemical model for comparison of FPP production in cytoplasm and YAO based on the model for mevalonate pathway of British Columbia 2011 IGEM team.
- This model shows that our YAO is efficient. However, it is inaccurate. Many of the Michaelis-Menten equation need to be modified.

- Junjie Zhang
Aug. 6th - Aug. 13th
Events:
- We want to model the transport of proteins with signal peptide into YAO through our artificial transport system.
- We read papers about the mechanism of protein recognition and import of TOC system, and write equations for this process.(Reddick, Dynamics of the Toc GTPases: Modulation by Nucleotides and Transit Peptides Reveal a Mechanism for Chloroplast Protein Import) However, we can't find detail information about TIC system.
- Moreover, we found that the import of protein was mainly driven by HSP protein inside mitochondria or chloroplast, which already have mature mathmatical models.(J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

After modeling AladDNA, these are the most important features that characterize our genetically engineered machine:
It is controlled by two consecutive inputs, each of both can be blue or red light, and their combination results in different outputs.
When both inputs are of the same color, it is better to consider them as a single long input, avoiding pauses in the induction and dark intermediate periods.
When first and second input differ in color, recombinases action is the key element in order to activate the second input. The efficiency of the whole process is affected by the time required by these enzymes to inactivate the production of the second level that was not activated.
Massive amounts of gene copies result in high levels of basal expression which are enough to produce both recombinases, that cut alternatives of the second level.
Multiple production pathways are possible with simultaneous inputs and sequences with more than two input elements.
Input sequences that achieve maximum results for the production of each output are:
Alpha input sequence
Beta input sequence
Gamma input sequence
Omega input sequence

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#SpiderColi#Notepad_-_-_TEXT.html,"Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” is going to help us with a valuable gift: a plasmid to secrete ADF-3 in salmonella. With this plasmid we can obtain the sequence of the spider silk protein ADF-3.
April 2-8, 2012
We transformed the backbone pSB1K3, so that we could amplify it when our primers arrive. Later we made and ordered the primers for our next experiment: basically the same constructs as before (GFP Reporter Plasmid) but with ADF-3 instead of sfGFP.
Ulises met with Dr. Angélica Fierro, and she accepted to be our advisor in protein modeling! Besides, we contacted Cheryl Hayashi, a well-known scientist that works with spider silk (she even spoke at TED!) [link: http://www.ted.com/talks/cheryl_hayashi_the_magnificence_of_spider_silk.html ]
We asked her if she could send us the genetic sequences EF595245 and EF595246, but later we knew that those parts are not compatible with our purposes. They are fosmids and the silk sequence is only a small portion of those clones.  The fosmids are low copy number and difficult to propagate. Then, it´s  better to work with ADF-3.
Additionally, we wrote to Dr. Sang Yup Lee, author of one of the paper “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”. They produced and spun into fiber a 284.9 kDa recombinant protein of the spider Nephila clavipes in E. Coli, and we asked if he could send us his spider silk protein. Unfortunately, we didn´t receive an answer. April 9-15, 2012  The School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile makes every year a fair of entrepreneurship and technological innovation called Ingenia. The deanship of the Faculty of Engineering is so interested in us that wants that we form part in a conversation table to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. We will have also our own stand in the fair! On Wednesday the whole team had a meeting with Professor Rodrigo Guitérrez, and our advisors Dr. Fernán Federici (Postdoc student at Cambridge) and Dr. Mónica Vásquez (specialist in cyanobacteria). We presented them our projects and advances.  They suggested that we:  Must"

In our project, the reference circuit is important for our data analysis and more accurate data are required for quantitative measurement of our regulatory element. JNFLS helped us to measure the fluorescence intensity of GFP and mCherry in the reference circuit using flow cytometry and plate reader. What's more, in accordance with our protocol, they suggested us to measure the fluorescence when the OD was up to 0.45, which solved our confusion of sampling time.
Figure 4. The fluorescence of GFP measured by flow cytometry
Figure 5. The fluorescence of mCherry measured by plate reader
All the data is from the reference circuit. OUC-0 is without induction, OUC-1,OUC-2,OUC-3 is three biological repetition. GFP means the positive control. CKN is the negative control.

Saving the World
""Cellulose is the most abundant form of fixed carbon, with 100,000,000,000 tons produced in cell walls by plants each year"" (Wilson, 2008) Nowadys the world-wide food shortage is engulfing the entire world, pushing food price to a new high point.  A research from Lester R. Brown (April 16,2008) disscusses about the importance of our life. It is not only about the economy, but also to overburden the environment which concerns to the human future.
Engineer a biobrick to convert cellulose to starch will be one of the most sufficient ways to solve this problem and it becomes our project aim. There are two kind of gene which can convert cellulose to glucose and convert glucose to starch. This study is focus on making the conversion possible in E.coli. However, the applications of starch will be about 2 aspects which depend on the quality. One is uing for biofuel produce and the other will be supplied as human and animal food.

University of Göttingen, Germany.
We come from different countries: Germany, China, Iran, Lebanon,      India and Mexico. The group formed when the team of 2013 gave a      presentation of their work and how they did in the Jamboree (they      won the award for the best presentation in the overgrad division at      the World Championship).
OUR PROJECT
Questions it raises : Is it possible to select a short peptide with     affinity towards fungal surface proteins out     of a short peptide library?
We intend to develop a fast screening technique for different     invasive fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans     and Aspergillus nidulans.
The idea is to tag the invasive fungal cells with a special protein     marker that allows an easy detection of fungi. By modifying the     protein marker with a proper signal molecule, we will be able to     accomplish a fast and direct elimination of invasive fungi.
We want to prove the principle that it’s possible to obtain short     peptides with affinity towards a protein of interest through a highthroughput     screening method. The proteins of interest in our project     are fungal surface proteins, but they can be any other protein, such     as tumor markers or other pathogenic microorganism surface     proteins.
We also want to develop a diagnostic tool with those peptides.     Here, our methodology is straightforward and it is mainly a proofof-     principle: we will tag a GFP marker and check for fluorescence.     However, if this is successful, in the long term and after other sorts     of chemical modifications, these peptides can be further applied     as diagnostic and even therapeutic tools.
We are running for the Health and Medicine track.

La thérapie génique et ses problématiques [1,3]
La thérapie génique fait face à plusieurs problématiques qui réduisent son efficacité chez l’Homme :
- identifier les mutations responsables de la maladie,
- identifier les gènes sains,
- délivrer le gène médicament à la cellule cible,
- optimiser l’expression du gène médicament.
Identifier le gène que l’on va cibler nécessite de répondre à plusieurs questions : quel est le gène que l’on retrouve dans les voies de signalisation de la maladie ? Ce gène est il exprimé au début, ou en phase finale de l’expression de la maladie ? Il se peut en effet, que l’inhibition du gène cible ne soit pas suffisante pour inhiber l’expression de la maladie.
Ainsi, pour le traitement du cancer, les gènes cibles ainsi que les stratégies sont nombreuses : le suppresseur de tumeur p53, l’inhibition d’oncogènes avec des oligonucléotides anti-sens, l’utilisation de ribozymes et de siRNA.
En effet, le cancer peut être le résultat d’un dommage de l’ADN du aux carcinogènes ou peut apparaitre spontanément lors de la réplication de l’ADN. L’incapacité à corriger cette erreur à cause d’une mutation des gènes de réparation ou l’absence de gènes de contrôle du cycle cellulaire peut donner à la cellule un avantage de croissance. Ce sont alors ces gènes qui vont constituer les meilleures cibles de la thérapie génique dans le traitement du cancer.

Entrepreneurship and innovation are celebrated                     in TIF, as many leading companies and promising startups display their                     innovative products and technological advancements. We had the opportunity                     to participate in this year’s TIF and present our work to decades of                     visitors every day. In addition, we came in contact with numerous                     entrepreneurs, company representatives and people from the industry. This                     allowed to establish a dialog with stakeholders, investigating possible                     applications of our project beyond the lab.
Education And Public Engagement
We focused our Public Engagement activities on communicating science across                     different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds through a plethora of                     activities. Within the framework of our multifaceted outreach efforts, we                     addressed students spanning from elementary school to university level.                     Additionally, we participated in the OUC-iGEM Team Collaboration,                     translating a synthetic biology comic book in our language, so that we                     could provide an accessible and comprehensive visualisation of the                     molecular mechanisms and engineering principles underlying synthetic                     biology.

Introduction
Throughout our journey in the iGEM competition we gained valuable feedback                     on various aspects of our project. We seeked for guidance and feedback from                     experts of their field and stakeholders. Through their advice and                     contribution, we improved our project’s design and broadened its possible                     applications.
Project Design and Modeling
As we came into communication with many scientists to inform them about our                     project for this year’s iGEM Competition, we got some responses that shaped                     our final project design.

Modelling
What we learnt from the PUR degradation model:
The model assisted the design of enzyme assays, in particular:
The toxicity of the PUR degradation product, Ethylene glycol was taken into account in the modelling and it successfully determined the maximum tolerance of the system.
Ethylene glycol toxicity assays were carried out in the wet lab and were designed according to the results from our model.
What we learnt from the P(3HB) synthesis model:
Scanning concentration of pha B and sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the concentration of pha B would increase the production rate of P(3HB) in our engineered 'E.coli'.
Simulations showed that the constitutive promoter J23104 could lead to a higher expression of pha B than the native promoter. As a result the Wet lab team designed and built BBa_K1149051 , which significantly increased bioplastic production.
Results from the metabolic model suggested that the synthesis of P(3HB) would be accompanied by a drop of ATP over time and hence allowed us to identify potential limitations of our engineered system. This is important for the Industrial Implementation of our system.

Introduction
The efficiencies for polyurethane (PUR) degradation and ethylene glycol production are important for the performance of our system. We built a mathematical and deterministic model that is based on MATLAB extension Simbiology for polyurethane degradation.

Analysis and Discussion of Non-Founder Interviews
Table 7: Most Prominent Reasons for Not Founding a Business
Lack of Knowledge Exchange with Industry Members
Lack of Entrepreneurial Advising
Lack of time
Lack of motivation and interest
Project was not competitive/viable
Studies Got in the Way
From these interviews it is clear that there are similarities and differences among the non-founding teams. In general, the teams had a lack of knowledge exchange and consulting with mentors. If there was industry consultation, it was primarily in the form of sponsorship. Furthermore, teams had hardly any entrepreneurial consulting and many of the teams did not even consider a business, either due to not having the skills or experience, a marketable product, time and motivation, and/or the encouragement to further their project/consider a business. A common theme was the lack of time due to the need to finish academics or continue into a research-oriented position.
One notable difference among the non-founding teams was the amount of funding and resources. Some teams had quite a lot of funding/resources while others had to get by with less. They also had mixed responses regarding the quality/quantity of academic mentors.
In general, it seems that the teams varied on funding/resources/academic mentorship but were very similar in lacking knowledge exchange with industry experts and entrepreneurship mentors. A definite theme was having a lack of time and motivation with academics in the way.
The non-Founders provided very interesting ideas to encourage entrepreneurship in biotech, including 1) increasing interaction and knowledge exchange with industry members 2) providing incentive for business creation, including a) inviting investors/accelerators/incubators to iGEM, b) creating an entrepreneurship track, c) providing job opportunities with industry members, d) encouraging entrepreneurship in the life sciences, 3) encouraging iGEM participants to solve a real-world problem/seek market opportunities and 4) establish more incubators that provide the resources and advising for people to realize their projects. These suggestions will be further discussed further in the “Suggestions and Conclusion” section later on.

Z1.Imm: MG1655 Z1 cells transformed with the antitoxin plasmid ( BBa_K914001 inside pSB3C5 ). MG1655 Z1 contain the Z1 cassette (lacR tetR SpR), which allows us to induce the production of the immunity protein under control of the pLac promoter with IPTG.
Protocol
Grow cells in liquid culture containing the appropriate antibiotic
Add IPTG (0.1mM) to appropriate liquid cultures after 2 hours (OD ~0.2)
Wash cells containing antibiotics/IPTG and re-suspend in plain LB
Plate 10 uL of 0.1 OD lawn cells from liquid culture on plain LB plates or IPTG plates
Spot 5 uL of saturated Colicin E2 cells from liquid culture on plates
Incubate plates overnight
Results
Col E2 cells do not generate a ZOI in cells containing the antitoxin plasmid, in both induced and un-induced cells. However, Col E2 cells do produce a ZOI in vulnerable MG1655 cells as indicated by red arrows below.
Interpretation
These results indicate that our antitoxin plasmid indeed confers immunity to sensitive cells, however, immunity is not dependent on IPTG induction. This is not completely surprising given that the immunity protein has an incredibly high affinity for the activity protein and that pLac is known to be leaky. Even a small concentration of immunity protein could protect un-induced cells against the DNase activity of the colicin activity protein.
Quantitative Characterization of the Antitoxin Plasmid
We characterized the plasmid pLac + ColE2 immunity gene ( BBa_K914001 inside pSB3C5 ) by testing the response of the cells when we mix them with colicin producing cells in various concentration with also various concentration of IPTG as the inducer of pLac. We counted the number of surviving colonies to see the effectiveness of the immunity protein in protecting the cells from the colicin activity protein.

Missouri S&T hosts an annual Earth Day celebration, inviting Rolla community and on campus organizations. Our members introduced children to a bit of cave ecology and a more in depth understanding of White Nose Syndrome. Parents and children from the Rolla community alike were able to understand the relevance WNS has to cave ecology and the potential effects, due to its rapid spread in Missouri, it may have on their own lives if it is not stopped. We also got to speak with them about ways they can help prevent its spread. Lastly, we had a stalagmite themed ring toss that children could play.

NCTU Annual Biotechnology Fair
     At this year’s biotechnology fair in NCTU, we presented our project to future NCTU biotechnology majors to get them interested in synthetic biology. Every year, the event is held a few months before school starts as a way   to give incoming students a glimpse at the many different paths available in the field. Of course, synthetic biology is all about collaboration between different fields, and all of our non-biology major teammates shared how other fields, such as nanotechnology and engineering, could work together with biology to achieve great things.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html,", crtB, crtI, crtY and crtZ should result in the production of zeaxanthin. (see scheme below).
Figure 2: Scheme of desired outcome of the carotenoid biosynthesis with two distinct DNA programs.
One of the reasons why carotenoid biosynthesis pathway represented a challenge for us was putative membrane localisation of at least a few enzymes of the pathway. The literature does not provide the answer to this question. Membrane localization of some enzymes would mean that some enzymes are in a way already compartmentalized in the cell, but we nevertheless expected some improvement using DNA guided assembly. Another question regarding the membrane localization of the enzymes was whether they will retain their activity if fused to zinc finger domain, as additional domain at the N-terminus could disturb their membrane association.
Cloning strategy
As the sum of lengths of genes coding for chimeric enzymes for carotenoid biosynthesis is almost 9 kbp, we decided to clone them into two separate plasmids with different antibiotic resistance. We cloned the first three genes (Jazz::crtE, Blues::crtB, Zif268::crtI) into a vector with kanamycin resistance (pSB4K5) and the last three (PSBII::crtY, ZnfHivC::crtO and crtZ::Gli1) into a vector with chloramphenicol resistance (pSB4C5).
To faciliate the cloning process we designed our chimeric enzymes with zinc finger domain N-terminal to the enzymes. The genes for enzymes  from The Registry include both start and stop codon, which meant we could directly fuse them to C-terminus of our synthetic zinc finger domains which do not have stop codon.
We chose a linker olygopeptide of 10 amino acids, consisting of Gly and Ser residues to connect zinc fingers and enzymes, because it enables the flexibility and has also been used for similar purposes before. DNA program encoding the sequence of chimeric enzymes was introduced into bacteria on the third plasmid.
Figure 3: Scheme of the cloning strategy for carotenoid biosynthesis based on DNA-guided pathway assembly.
Results
Biosynthesis of zeaxanthin
We demonstrated that enzyme crtZ can produce zeaxanthin from beta carotene by inserting the gene, coding for this enzyme, behind the beta carotene-operon, submitted to Registry of parts by teams from previous years. This extends the verified carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in E.coli available in the Registry for an"

Biological Modules: Input
For the input, we needed a signal that could easily represents ""ON"" and ""OFF"" states. Light came as a natural solution because it is easily switchable to ""ON"" and ""OFF"" states and color can be varied to represent several inputs (A and B).
In the final E. calculus design, each light sensor will promote the transcription of a specific recombinase (TP901 for the red sensor and Bxb1 for the blue sensor).
Blue light system
General principle
The blue light sensor uses the couple YF1-FixJ/FixK2 promoter. This setup was already used by the iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden team and also described in the litterature ( Andreas Möglich et al. 2009. Design and Signaling Mechanism of Light-Regulated Histidine Kinases. ). YF1 is the fusion of the LOV protein with an histidine kinase. In the absence of light, YF1 can activate FixJ (phosphorylaion) which in return activates the PfixK2 promoter. In the presence of a 480 nm wavelength light, YF1 can no longer phosphorylate FixJ leading to extinction of the PfixK2"

Technical Implementation Plan
In order to realize our first generation product, there are several key steps that need to be taken on the research and development front. As such, we have created a detailed Implementation plan describing these necessary milestones. A condensed version can be seen below. Here we list the major technical milestones that need to be completed. These points are listed in order of priority with the earliest described experiments being most critical in evaluating the commercial potential of our technology. As such, the order represents the relative risk of each experiment, with the most high-risk experiments first, where failure to achieve good results could significantly impact the time and cost estimates for the research and development.
Final characterization of our first generation sensing organism.
Transferring our electrochemical system into P. fluorescens.
Transitioning our first product into the final prototyping stages.
Further screening for future generation products.
Further multiplexing of our electrochemical system.
Responding to Technological Change
The current technology has been carefully designed in order to easily facilitate the production of next generation products. FREDsense’s unique sensing platform is easily adaptable to monitor a plethora of different compounds of interest using different engineered bacterial strains. Second generation products are being developed including detector products specific to unique classes of chemicals including naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons. As these are specific compounds of interest for many oil sands-related processes, detectors capable of monitoring them with specificity are sought-after. These detectors will make use of FREDsense’s novel generation one sensing platform coupled with newly developed bacterial strains. Being able to directly build upon the existing platform will help ensure FREDsense’s new products can be designed quickly and efficiently so as to have a quicker entry to market than generation one products.
With the introduction of more specific and diverse sensors, this will lead the way for multiple-output detector systems. These will include detectors that can monitor multiple different classes of compounds such as combinations of naphthenic acids, hydrocarbons and  general toxins simultaneously. As many locations would require monitoring of a variety of compounds of interest at one sampling time, these second generation sensors will allow one water sample to be taken in order to monitor that sample for several toxins. This will allow for quicker sample extraction and faster results. Again, these products will make use of the generation one electrochemical sensing platform with new engineered bacterial strains.
As with generation one, all later generation products will  include integrated controls as well as the speed and reliability of the generation one sensing platform.  The modular design of FREDsense’s technology will allow the company to adapt quickly and"
