UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"

Localizing proteins of a pathway together will decrease cross-talk with other systems and concentrate the proteins of interest in close proximity. Lumazine synthase (LS) from Aquifex aeolicus forms icosahedral microcompartment (MC) assemblies of 60 or 180 monomeric units that self assemble and are capable of isolating proteins from their local environment11. As shown in previously published work, the LS protein has been mutated so that the interior of the MC is negatively charged, and the Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team has submitted the mutated LS gene to the parts registry11. A negatively charged interior allows for preferential compartmentalization of positively charged molecules, which can easily be engineered through the addition of a poly-arginine tag to a target protein11. The poly-arginine C- and N-terminal tags have also been submitted to the registry by the Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team. Recent work on LS using directed evolution to optimize the interior surface of the MC created a new variant of LS that allows for the increased loading capacity of the MC12. It has been found that this LS variant can successfully encapsulate toxic compounds within E. coli cells without nonspecific association of contaminants or target molecules to the exterior of the MC12. This LS variant will be advantageous for selective compartmentalization of larger or multiple target proteins involved in catechol degradation. Compartmentalization will also allow for the introduction of pathways that may contain toxic intermediates to the chassis, while keeping them separate from the chassis’ other processes.
Removal of aqueous heavy metals
Decontamination of (2) heavy metals found in the tailings ponds can be performed by the Mms6 protein found in Magnetospirillum magneticum that produces nanoparticles13,14. Mms6 can facilitate the removal of iron from tailings ponds water through the formation of symmetric octahedral iron crystal nanoparticles15. The production of nanoparticles from soluble heavy metals will effectively remove the heavy metals from the tailings ponds with subsequent removal of the magnetic nanoparticles using simple methods such as a magnet13. Previous work done by the Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team on the Mms6 protein demonstrated that the expression of Mms6 induced low cell growth rates and low expression levels, indicating that the protein is toxic to the E. coli chassis16. A method to circumvent the toxic protein problem for the chassis is to have the protein secreted from the cell to prevent accumulation within the cell.

According to the above mechanism, we make the two e-oscillators pass the parameters and affect each other. In terms of the transfer function, with the enhancement of the light intensity, the expression of lacI will reduce, which is proportional to the other e-oscillator’s light intensity. It means that the illumination intensity of e-oscillator 2 will decrease and the corresponding lacI will increase. Then lacI will also be inversely linked to the e-oscillator 1. With the circulation and regulation, the two e-oscillator will be coupled or synchronized gradually.
To achieve the process of coupling or synchronization, we write programs in MATLAB and get the simulation result shown in video 1.
video 1. Simulation result of virtual-virtual coupling.
Mixed-reality of physics
In the second stage, LED lamp controlled by single-chip replace the fluorescence released by E.coli. Based on the virtual-virtual coupling, LED will glow following one of the e-oscillators simulated above as the physical real part, while the other e-oscillator will be the virtual part.
Through a camera, intensity of LED will be transfer to computer and affect the e-oscillator. The returned value of e-oscillator will also be passed to the physical real part by single-chip. With the interaction, the two parts will get coupled in the end. The details of connecting device are specified in our Interface Hardware part.
Figure 4. The complete design of physical device.
We program scripts in Python with an embedded code in MATLAB(You can click here to download the codes). And then we put the LED lamp and camera in dark place and run the program. We get the simulation result in Video 2.

Oscillator 1 is the dynamic trajectory of e-oscillator in computer, while Oscillator 2 represents the state of LED. The blue square in the upper right corner is the light intensity image of LED observed by camera(we only read the B values of RGB). As you can see, the brightness of blue changes following the interaction. Besides, the small box in the upper left corner shows the facade of LED lamp, which is manually shot by us in dark environment. From the oscillation images, we can find that the virtual part and the physical real part get synchronized gradually.

We were able to achieve germination rates as low as <1 in 4.6x109 spores in our triple mutant B43. Other mutants also showed extremely reduced germination ability. A table of germination rates of our mutants and all of the other spectacular results can be found on our results page . Our single mutants were not checked in the germination assay. The double and triple mutants tested showed mixed results, with some unable to germinate, and others maintaining low germination abilities. Our quadruple mutants demonstrated no ability to germinate, even in several separate germination assays.
Despite this success, safety was a top priority for this project. In the event that some small percentage of spores retained the ability to germinate, the Suicideswitch subproject (below) prevents outgrowth into viable vegetative cells.

Lab Hardware: Privilege for Few
For several brazilian laboratories and researchers it's very difficult to afford good  Lab equipment because they are very expensive. Moreover, when an acquired equipment breaks, it can not be quickly or easily repaired without the company's assistance. Lack of autonomy often yield a sense of inferiority that strongly feed and make us whirl around a vicious loop of dependence. Rather than be a mutual relationship between academy and companies, these last ones not only charge high prices for equipment repair, but they also delay delivering support.
Along with the iGEM project’s development we deal with a limited access to essential equipment to molecular biology techniques like centrifuges, electrophoresis systems and transilluminators. It was very difficult to plan our experiments in advance due to the restricted access to some laboratories, since most equipment at USP are responsibility of different professors and researchers.
What did we do to change this?
The Transilluminator ""Tabajara""
A transilluminator and photodocumentation system! Tabajara is a fictional company, created by a brazilian comedy group whose mote is "" Your problems are over!"" They became famous for being incredibly creative and innovative. However, a crucial difference between us and them is that our product both exists and is useful in many contexts!
Image 1- Transilluminator Tabajara as an UV transilluminator system
Image 2- Transilluminator Tabajara as photodocumentation system, with a set of filters
Image 3- Cellphone picture of a GelRed stained gel DNA electrophoresis with our system
However, we could not find an optimal filter, both for allowing mostly the UV to reach our gel, and blocking the background light  after the DNA fluorescence. We didn't characterize it thoroughly, but only cellphones with really good cameras and bands with high concentrations of DNA could be seen. A new design, with epi-illumination instead of transillumination might solve those issues, but again we did not have time to explore it thoroughly. Finally, even though some commercial light filters are suitable for the tasks, we are still looking for more affordable options, as it is important to us that this product is accessible for as many people as possible.  Nevertheless, the fact that it worked at least in some situations it was per se a"

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins as a potential  alternative to classical antibiotic treatment.
Since biologicals (biopharmaceuticals) often have the problem of being targeted by the immune system through the prescence of specifc anti-drug anitbodies (ADA), we performed our deimmunizaton workflow BERT on a construct of the iGEM team Paris-Bettencourt. A low immunogenicity would be crucial for the application of AMP/scaffolding protein constructs, since in this case binding of ADAs  to the protein would most likely severely impair the self-assembly properties to large complexes.  Moreover, this was also a ""blind test"" for our deimmunization tool, since we applied the steps on a protein which was completely unknown to us. Had we solely focused on our own botulinum toxin shuttle with the aim of optimizing the steps of the workflow, there would have been the risk of losing the general applicability of the workflow on arbitrary proteins.
A further important aspect of this collaboration, was the validation of the structural integrity of the fusion protein we used in our deimmunization workflow. In this external validation we investigated the influence of the AMP on the tertiary structure of the scaffolding protein using MD simulations. Since we have access to the required hardware to run prolonged MD simulation, we were able to share our expertise on this subject and our computational capabilities with the iGEM Team Paris-Bettencourt. Furthermore since both our teams were using MD simulations to model the structure of the proteins in our projects, this collaboration allowed us to exchange knowledge about this topic and help us in the almost never ending process of troubleshooting while simulating complex biological problems.
For the application of our deimmunization workflow BERT on an AMP/scaffold protein, Paris-Bettencourt provided us with the sequences of their proteins. We focused our approach on a ovispirin/l-fucose Mutarotase fusion protein, for multiple reasons. Firstly, this protein has very prominent clusters of epitopes for the three most prevalent MHC class II alleles in central Europe (DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*15:01), which allows for very effective reduction in the number of immune epitopes. Secondly, we were able to find many closely and distantly related proteins, leading to an excellent identification of highly conversed residues by our tool, which are in turn avoided in the mutagenesis process. Lastly this fusion protein is of smaller size, which allowed us to include longer MD simulations in our tight schedule for simulation on our hardware.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," traits that are not essential for the applied growth conditions. The reporters we will be expressing inside the cell will not be essential for cell survival and thus will be lost, hence the key will no longer be functional. The second option, storing freeze dried cells inside a sealed capsule, allows ‘semi’ long term storage with very little phenotypic change and no need for nutrients. In addition, they are very quickly activated when properly mixedwith recovery medium and nutrients.
When the cells are revived, their reporter levels will need to be measured to ascertain the key’s identity. This brings into question how fast and accurately this process can and should occur. When cells are freeze dried, any proteins are also locked; after revival, there will be residual amounts of the reporter present in approximately the correct proportions. Although these signals are present and representative, they will be low and not optimal, after 4 hours the cells will have grown substantially to produce an appropriate level of reporter to measure. With the experiment described below we show that freeze drying cells is a reliable and reproducible way to store the Key. coli cells.
How
The cells were freeze dried in accordance with a protocol we devised, for further details click here . To summarise, colonies of our bacteria were grown overnight to produce a batch of our specimen. New media was inoculated with our bacteria and grown for 24 hours, with OD600nm absorbance and fluorescence intensity at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hour timepoints. Just before the bacteria enter the stationary growth phase, a 1 ml sample was taken for freeze drying. The cells were  washed twice with water  before resuspending the cells in a 10% sterile sucrose solution.The sucrose solution acts as our cryo-protectant, therefore the cell resuspension was incubated for 5 minutes on the becnh to allow the sucrose to build up inside the cell. Subsequently, the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at -200°C and placed on dry ice. After all samples were frozen, the tube lids were pierced and placed in a chilled vacuum chamber overnight to remove all present moisture
Results
The results presented in figure 1 show that the two promoters, SP4 and WP1, are clearly distinct from each other at every stage of revival and storage time. This information is important as we will need to calibrate the thresholds for identification accordingly. The data also shows that storing the cells for two weeks at different temperatures has no to little effect on the reporter expression.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2017,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", it is estimated that around 600,000 lives and $90 billion US dollars are lost due to influenza A viruses (2). The existing form of influenza viruses genome is segmented antisense RNA. Influenza A can be subtyped according to the types of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein on the virus surface (above figure). NA protein can cleave terminal sialic acid residue and promote virion release (3). Since there are 18 types of HA and 11 types of NA, there are 198 possible subtypes. Different influenza A subtypes possess different properties. For example, the mortality rate of infection by the subtypes H5N1 and H7N9 is much higher than that of H1N1.
Avian influenza
In this project, we aim to construct a set of artificial RNA biosensors to detect different influenza A viral genes, including the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. We consulted local medical experts and found that there is an urgent need for a fast and on-site subtyping method for Avian influenza compared with other subtypes in Hong Kong.
Avian influenza are influenza A viruses adapted to birds, which can be classified into high pathogenicity (HP) or low pathogenicity (LP). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) are originally intransmittable among human, but later inherited pathogenic property from other influenza A viruses through reassortment (3). For example, both pathogenic properties of H5N1 and H7N9 are suspected to be inherited from H9N2 (3). Since Hong Kong is a stopover point of migrating birds (4), the chance of avian flu outbreak in Hong Kong is much higher than in other places. Together with the fact that Hong Kong is a highly populated city with great passenger throughput per day, any outbreak of avian flu in Hong Kong may easily cause pandemic.
Therefore, we focused on constructing biosensors for subtyping the notorious Avian influenza. Among the subtypes, subtypes H5N1 and H7N9 are the most urgent subtypes that require need method to diagnose.
H5N1: A notorious flu
H5N1 is the most notorious and highly pathogenic avian influenza. The first epidemic outbreak of H5N1 in humans happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The flu was then spread to the entire Asia. According to the World Health Organization, there were 859 confirmed human cases since 2003 which killed 453 people with a mortality"

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#construction_-_-_TEXT.html," MET25 repressable promoter with binding sites, hoping to construct a limiter circuit in which we can set the threshold by varying the input concentration of methionine.
Fluorescent Tagging of Transcription Factors
We received our library of transcription factors as fusion proteins tagged with the mCherry fluorescent domain.  As we wish to keep track of the concentration of a number of different elements in our network, we elected to construct repressors bearing the cyan fluorescent protein CFP, which can be distinguished from the mCherry fluorescence from the other repressors and the YFP fluorescent reporter that we use as an output.  We removed the fluorescence from our activator, as we can infer its concentration from the level of input.  With CFP on the tau repressor and mCherry on alpha and R (both under the same promoter), we hope to get a solid understanding of the dynamics of each element of our system given varying levels of induction and different thresholds.
Yeast Integration
In order to easily test many variations on the limiter circuit, we ligated variations on each element onto the same pRS30x series integrative vector.  Thus, we can create a strain bearing the A, alpha, R, and YFP reporter, and later ligate in a variety of threshold-setting tau constructs to test their effects.  As of press time, we have generated the library of yeast constructs and are ready to transform our limiter.  We hope to get some results in time for the Jamboree.

Hi everyone"
Marburg,2016,Team:Marburg#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," 10 dimensional vector that requires 23 constant parameters \(k\). The parameters                 have been chosen to be in accordance with biological processes. Amongst others, they were taken from [7] . For the notation of concentrations, we use the letters                 and spared the square brackets.
This kill switch is the starting point for other network topologies that have been studied. These are:
Parallel (OR) regulation
Serial regulation
Parallel (AND) regulation
(b) Parallel (OR) Regulation
While the previous kill switch consists of a serial cascade, another generic topology is two parallel cascades regulating the same toxin. These two                 cascades regulate the promoter in a OR gate manner: The toxin’s promoter is repressed if one inducer is present.
Each cascade consists of the BNU China 2014 kill switch explained above. We take a step further from specific biological substances to abstract substances                 that behave like their biological equivalences: IPTG becomes I, lacI (LacI) becomes aa/ab (Aa/Ab), cI (CI) becomes ba/bb (Ba/Bb) and finally mazF (MazF)                 becomes c (C). This way, we focused on the topology of the kill switches. The topology can be found in figure 3.
Figure 3. The Parallel (OR) topology.
This topology is captured by a 19 dimensional concentration vector that requires 42 parameters \(k\). Since the overall mutation probability depends on the number                 of parameters, this kill switch is not comparable to the original BNU China 2014 kill switch. For that reason, we introduce a longer cascade in the following                 that is comparable to this Parallel (OR) regulation.
(c) Serial Regulation
This serial kill switch introduces two chained BNU China 2014 kill switches (figure 2b). That feature increases the number of parameters to 39. Therefore,                 it is comparable to the Parallel (OR) kill switch.
Figure 4. The serial topology.
(d) Parallel (AND) Regulation
The last kill switch is similar to the Parallel (OR) topology. It differs in the sense that the two branches are now connected by an AND gate: Both regulating                 branches must be active in order to repress the toxin’s promoter. Each branch is equivalent to the BNU China 2014 kill switch. The number of parameters is 41                 and the concentration vector is 18 dimensional. Therefore, it is also comparable to the kill switches (b) and (c).

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#RNASeq_-_-_TEXT.html," Bacteria were grown in triplets under three different conditions: 1g (control), 0.37g (Martian gravity) and 0g (microgravity). The 1g controls were placed in the same stove, next to the RPM, to accurately mimic the conditions under which the 0.37g and 0g experiments were grown. Lighting conditions in the stove were near constant. Throughout this report, the 0.37g treatment is referred to as 0.4g for brevity.
RNA isolation
After growth, colonies on the LB agar plates were quickly dissolved by pipetting 2ml LB on the plates. RNA was then isolated after mixing 1ml of dissolved culture with 2ml RNAprotect, both according to Qiagen protocol. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Nanodrop photospectrometer. Care was taken to avoid RNase activity.
Sequencing
Isolated RNA was stored at -80°C and sent to BaseClear for RNAseq high-throughput sequencing. Samples were treated with rRNA depletion to filter out the expectedly large amounts of (uninteresting) ribosomal RNA.
Alignment
The resulting reads per sample (~3GB per library) were aligned to a reference BW25113 genome available from the NCBI, 2 using Rockhopper software. 3 For compatibility purposes, the genome feature file was converted to .ptt using gbk2ptt software. 4 Rockhopper aligns all sequenced RNA fragments to the genome and then counts the number of aligned sequences per gene, yielding raw count data. In total, reads were aligned to 7784 (predicted) RNAs.
Normalisation
Since raw counts are poorly comparable between and within samples, as discussed in Dillies et al. (2012), various normalization techniques are available. The most common method for normalization is reads per kilobase million (RPKM), which accounts for differences in gene length that is expected to positively correlate with read count. Though still widely used, RPKM values have on multiple occasions been reported to be biased and are deferred to other methods. 5 We used the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM), described in Robinson et al. (2010a) to normalize samples, while also accounting for total library size of each sample. 6 This technique was among the preferred methods in Dillies et al. (2012).
Statistical Analysis
Reads are count data, which can be assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. However, due to the many unknown sources of variance within and between samples, these"

Results
We successfully completed 2 main projects in the time we spent from January to September.
First we created a circuit within E. Coli that senses 3 different products that cancer cells produce in abundance: reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased temperatures, and lactate.
Second, we created a library of thermosensors react to different temperatures along different time steps.
Circuit
Our circuit has been constructed and is currently under testing.
Thermosensor Library
After doing multiple genetic screens using error-prone polymerase, we identified, out of thousands of different colonies, 11 mutant thermosensors that function in different, more useful ways than the wild type thermosensor (TSA). TSA is a thermosensor that slowly unfolds when the temperature changes from 30°C to 35°C. The 11 thermosensors we chose are unique because they unfold at a higher, narrower temperature range. Most of them only responded at a temperature somewhere in between 35°C and 37°C. Below we present data obtained by doing beta-galactosidase assays, which reports, in Miller units, the enzyme activity of each thermosensor at 3 different temperatures: 30°C, 35°C, and 37°C.

International Questionnaire
  This year is not only CGU_Taiwan very first time participating iGEM, also the very first collaboration around the globe. The survey was translated into six version of questionnaire,Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, French, Portuguese, German, English, the iGEM teams has help us to collect the data from their place to live.We are Organizer of this survey.
  From the question, food product is the most us unacceptable for people to be choose. The reason may cause by the unknown of risk that genetically modified food bright out. The unclear messages make people afraid of this kind of product. Thus, we need to tell them the widen usage nowadays. There is nothing to be scare because it already became part of our life. Of course, after understanding it, it’s their choices to have GMO as food or not. But before that, it’s our duty to make sure people know how synthetic biology has gradually changed our lives.
Also, from the survey we found out that the problem of not knowing oral cancer well enough is worldwide.
The best therapy of cancer isn’t medical treatments but prevention. How can people prevent it from happening, since they don’t know much about oral cancer? Therefore, our project included health education to raise the awareness and desire to change the circumstance.
There are people enjoy chewing betel nuts, but do they fully understand the risks of doing so? We doubt it. So the future of oral cancer health education we would like to go directly them and show them the potential problem so that they can decide whether to quite it or not.
This large scale survey told us how people think about synthetic biology and oral cancer. We can see our project in worldwide angle and start to change the world little by little.

4. Biobrick for bioremediation exctracted from JM110 (2)
After extraction, the samples were digested with EcoRI and PstI to check fragment's size of Essential Biobrick and Biorremediation Biobrick. For this we used the following system for enzymatic digestion:
The digestion took 2 hours at 37°C. We applied the total volume of each sample in agarose gel 0.8%.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick not digested.
2. Bioremediation Biobrick digested with EcoRI and PstI
3. Essential Biobrick not digested.
4. Essential Biobrick digested with EcoRI and PstI.
5-6-7-8. Plasmids did not show a good extraction
Hurray!!!  The digestion released fragments. It proves the viability of our beloved biobricks! Bioremediation Biobrick has  1.823  base  pairs and Essential Biobrick has 1.234 base pairs,that’s why BB_Biorremediation sits above BB_Essential in the gel. =)
We have also analyzed samples 5-6-7-8 that wasn't digested or showed partial digestion (Either didn't present digestion or partial digestion).

But there are two problems for us to solve. On one hand, MTB are anaerobic, it means they are hard to be cultured. On the other hand, it is difficult to modify them. So, we were aiming to construct a magnetosome expression system in E.coli to solve those problems. According to a paper in Nature nanotechonlogy , we confirmed that transferring four related operons can make other bacteria magnetotactic [8] .
Finally, we co-transferred all the vectors we constructed to make E.coli produce magnetosomes carrying laccase. The special magnetosomes would be used into our EBFC to improve the electron transfer efficiency!

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," a bad affinity. The time scale for the events in the cell is limited to 20 minutes, because after 20 minutes it is assumed that the cell divides:
Figure 1: (A) Beta-lactamase concentration in periplasm for optimal, moderate and bad affinity. (B) Beta-lactamase concentration in periplasm for an optimal, a moderate and a bad affinity. (C) Growth curves for optimal, moderate and bad affinity.
In figure 1 (A) the beta-lactamase concentrations in the periplasm for the 3 affinities are shown.  In the first 200 seconds the beta-lactamase concentration does not rise very strongly, because the products for the bacterial two hybrid complex (B2H) must firstly be produced. When enough products for the B2H complex are present, the probability for the formation of the B2H complex gets high and the reporter gene, here the beta-lactamase gene, is often transcribed. Thus the production of beta-lactamase rises.
After 20 minutes the strain with the optimal affinity comprises a significantly higher beta-lactamase concentration than the other two strains.  Furthermore, the beta-lactamase curve resembling moderate affinity has an observable higher end concentration than the strain equipped with the bad affinity. These results are as assumed, because the change in affinity for the two components of the B2H complex causes a particular expression of the reporter gene, here beta-lactamase.  When the bacterial two hybrid complex dissociates quickly, the expression of the reporter gene is lower (bad affinity) than in the case of a more stable complex (moderate or optimal affinity).
In comparison to the beta-lactamase curves, figure 1 (B) shows the active ampicillin concentrations for the different affinities in the periplasm. For the first 200 seconds, the ampicillin concentration for all affinities extremely rises, because the beta-lactamase concentration is too low at this time and thus the probability for an encounter of beta-lactamase and ampicillin is low. After around 200 seconds the beta-lactamase starts to significantly deactivate ampicillin and the active ampicillin concentration falls. All ampicillin curves have a very strong decline, due to the fact that beta-lactamase is highly active.
As a result our program computes a final concentration of active ampicillin of 1.2682 * 10-6 M for optimal affinity, 2.3616 * 10-6"

The iGEM Experience: One of the best scientific experience that I have had. I feel that I am part of something huge in terms of scientific development. I am learning a lot from the instructors, advisors and my colleagues in the lab respect to biotechnology. As a biology student am trying to understand life through evolution and how life works in his multiple forms. With the iGEM experience I am starting to see life with another perspective under the umbrella of synthetic biology, that is trying to figure it out how to  desing and modify biological systems into a standard way. Richard Feynman said ‘What I cannot create, I do not understand.’  this became one of the slogans of us, as biological engineering. Now I have a better way to understand life with the synergy between Biology  and engineered. The iGEM program made me a pioneer in this new scientific discipline in my country and I really want to keep working in this field.
Research Interests: Life understanding through evolution is my passion. I am an undergraduate student in Biology oriented in microbiology. I have been working those few years with the biology of the fungus growing ants as intern in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Here in the department of behavior and evolution I start my travel into scientific research, studying how ants interact with microorganisms, how ants work against diseases, evolution of profilactic behaviors in the fungus growing ants, simbiosis, antagonism, co-evolution, bacterias, fungus, antibiotics, ecology are terms with that I have been familiarized. The development of engineered biology became one of my interest when I was studying microbial genetics, the manipulation of DNA brings to us a full knowledge of how life works and I am really interested to be involved of this kind of investigations.  Now with iGEM, the Synthetic Biology appears to me as one step further of biology engineering and I am doing a complete diving in biotechnology techniques with the aim to learn how to design and modify biological systems. I will keep studying and working in this field because it leads us to the full application of biology as a substance.

My education was in mechanical engineering (course 2) at MIT. I then lived in Tokyo for three years, getting a Masters degree in mechanical engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. I spent my career in software development in quantitative finance and consumer web sites.
I have lived in Panama for a year. I read about the iGEM contest in February. When I learned that in addition to world famous universities some small schools participate, I thought ""I am going to try to organize a team from Panama!""
Sara Pinzon
I did my PhD at Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum, London in Molecular systematics and evolution of insects. I came back to Panama at the beginning of 2010 to apply all the techniques and methodologies I learned in the UK.
I was very pleased when Oris Sanjur and members of SENACYT (Panamanian Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation) invited me to be one of the instructors of the first Panamanian team to participate in iGEM. I trust this is a great opportunity for young panamanian students to develop and improve their skills and learn from colleagues from all around the world.

I obtained my doctoral degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in Spain. After living in beautiful Andalucía I moved to Florida for my first postdoc position and then moved on to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the Washington, DC area for a much longer second postdoctoral position. I moved back to my country two years ago and when SENACYT asked for my institution, INDICASAT, to help the team, I was asked if I could take charge of the team work in our lab. It has been great to see the independent thinking, great enthusiasm, and pride the students have shown facing the fact that they will be making it possible for our country, Panama, to be in the iGEM contest for the first time in our incipient scientific history.

Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#TheSwitchDesignedTALregulators_-_-_TEXT.html," we tested the ability of TAL regulators to function in cells of amphibians. We selected a reporter plasmid with mCitrine under the operator for TAL VP16 activator in the presence and absence of the TAL activator. Only cells of animals transfected with both plasmids exhibited fluorescence, which was absent in cells transfected only with reporter. It is exciting to see fluorescent tadpoles that were transfected with functional TAL activator and a reporter, which demonstrates that TAL activator is not deleterious for the development of the animal.
Figure 9. TAL-based transcriptional activator is active in a multicellular organism. Reporter plasmid (10x[TALA] pMIN mCitrine, BBa_K782029 ) was injected into Xenopus laevis embryo (2.3 nl of plasmid at concentration 100 ng/µl) in the presence or absence of a plasmid with TAL activator (pCMV-TALAVP16, BBa_K782065 ). Fluorescence of mCitrin and rhodamine, which was used with plasmid for injection control was observed 1 and 3 days after introduction of plasmids under the microscope as described https://2012.igem.org/Team:Evry/Protocols .
Our joint results obtained in collaboration with Evry team (thank you froggies) thus demonstrate that TAL-based logic can be used also in the whole animal, which could be used as an excellent model to study complex synthetic regulatory devices in the multicellular environment.

Cellulose Synthase (Cesa) Project
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.

Introduction
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.
Background
Cellulose is produced in both the primary and secondary plant cell walls. Research has shown that secondary cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes produce greater quantities of cellulose than those located in the primary cell wall. (1) Additionally, research indicates the possibility of a hybrid plant cell wall through the ability to exchange promoters for cellulose synthase genes. An intricate protein complex in nature, research of cellulose synthase is continually ongoing. Due to the limited amount of definitive information known about the complex, the synthesis of a hybrid plant cell wall would provide verification of standing hypotheses and valuable novel information.

Method
To assemble our construct, we isolated the CesA 1 Promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana by extracting the genomic DNA and using PCR amplification. The CesA 4, 7, and 8 genes were obtained from cDNA via the Arabidopsis Biological"

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"-cell PCR with the TEF primers on W303a and W303alpha- got a band at the expected 500bp!
Unfortunately, also got extraneous product at ~100bp.  This must be from primer-primer interactions.
Tried varying the annealing temp and adding adjuvants, but nothing helped.
Ran the remainder of the a and alpha reactions on a gel and extracted the 500bp band.  Bad concentration- around 7 ng/ul.  This might be enough for ligation.
PCR purified
Cataloged all of the yeast transformations in a file called ""Yeast Catalogue""
They are now organized in the fridge according to which system of factors they belong to, and whether they are double or triple transformations.  Ones with the repressable reporters were sent to the back of the fridge without desert and were not catalogued.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Leicester,2013,Team:Leicester#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the null hypothesis (There is no correlation between the RFP plates and limonene biobrick/shipping vector) was rejected.
In conclusion, it seems that the stats tests cannot detect limonene expression too! Hence the correlation between the RFP (control plates) and the limonene biobrick plates. This suggests either a fault in the limonene biobrick or a disfunctional promoter. Unfortunately due to time constraint we were unable to run further testing to determinate the cause of the lack of limonene synthesis.
Re-purposing
Expanded polystyrene is widely used as insulation in the construction industry. In some applications the insulation is required to be flame retardant, which is achieved by incorporating halogenated hydrocarbons – an environmental pollutant. DNA has been shown to be flame-retardant ; however it is very expensive to produce. We proposed to build a genetically engineered machine to cheaply generate DNA for incorporation into flame retardant polystyrene.
Firstly, experiments were carried out to show that polystyrene is indeed highly flammable (video below).
igem polystyrene (no) from Quezia Toe on Vimeo .
We then designed experiments to determine if coating polystyrene with DNA could change its fire retardancy in comparison to a non-coated polystyrene block. Herring sperm DNA was used at a concentration of 13.4 mg/ml. Mechanical processes such as sonification and hydrodynamic shearing were used to make the DNA more spreadable.
Initial combustion tests were carried out using DNA-coated paper-thin strips of polystyrene which were compared with water-coated polystyrene strips shown in the video below.
iGEM combustion from Quezia Toe on Vimeo
It is evident from the video that the addition of DNA aided the flammability of the polystyrene. These results were not as expected; hence we decided to carry out a second test by modifying experimental conditions.
The second test was carried out using blocks of polystyrene instead of paper-thin strips. This time around DNA was incorporated into the block instead of being spread on it.  This new  video recording (below) brought to our attention the possibility that the polystyrene we were using might in fact be coated in HBCD. It was later confirmed that the polystyrene sugar supplied to us was in fact incorporated in HBCD.

At this time a few members from our group were at the Biological Weapons Convention in  Geneva. We designed new primers for the target meningitis site, and for the homologous flanking sequences. One large sequence (3kb) used as our mock target DNA, and two smaller flanking regions (1kb each) that will be ligated to the repressor operon. LacZ and the Pxyl+comK sequences are being BioBricked. The lacZ currently in the registry (found here ) is of poor quality and not available beyond the 2012 iGEM distribution plates. Pxyl+comK will allow for other teams to create super-competent B. subtilis cells. Although technically it isn’t increased competency, rather, it is competency that is induced by xylose.
Week 12: Aug 11 - 15
Most synthesized sequences have arrived, preparing to ligate reporter coding sequences to the synthesized genes and use them with the standard BioBrick vector plasmids. Since we have had a lot of trouble ligating the small RBS parts, we will be using the reporter genes as the genes for the repressors - all that is necessary is a constitutive promoter, we only need to make sure that there will be no overlap with the repressor/operators innately in B. subtilis. The promoter/operator/repressors C1-434, C2-P22, and C1-lambda originate from bacteriophages and so we do not expect activity in B. subtilis. Conversely, lacI is a common gene and according to our searches it exists in both B. subtilis and E. coli
Week 13: Aug 18 - 22
We continued working on assembling our reporter with the synthesized promoter/regulatory constructs. RFP is being used for now because it is readily available and familiar, but lacZ will be used as soon as it is available in BioBrick form. We are also planning on ligating the repressors to the synthesized constructs - we have not been able to assemble the repressor genes manually due to poor success with cloning the RBS.
We also worked on our collaboration with Colombia - developing and testing a “homebrew” method of making competent cells using reagents and equipment available outside of a laboratory. We will first attempt to use tap, bottled, and distilled water with calcium added via over-the-counter supplements.

Microfluidics 101
One of the limitations we identified early on in our project was the lack of concise and clear information about microfluidics for researchers in Synthetic Biology. Using the iGEM poll we were able to confirm this suspicion and understand what the synbio community wanted us to design for them.
As a result, the first stage of MARS is increasing the understanding of microfluidics. Under this section we have included a brief introduction to microfluidics as a whole and an explanation of how our continuous flow devices function. A primitive guide has also been included so researchers can identify and understand the function of each element on their chips. This guide can also be used in conjunction with the software tool 3Duf in order to design your own chip, or to adapt and iterate on our designs in the MARS Repository.

Introduction to Microfluidics
What is Microfluidics?
Microfluidics is the manipulation of microliter volumes of liquid in order to perform scientific experiments. This is performed on devices called microfluidic chips that can be made of polycarbonate, glass or silicone.
What is a Microfluidic Chip?
A continuous flow microfluidic chip typically consists of three layers: a flow layer and control layer with a flexible layer of PDMS between them. There are many other types of microfluidics such as digital or paper which operate using different mechanisms, however we will focus on continuous flow chips as this is the type utilized by MARS.
Control Layer
Material: Polycarbonate
The Control layer of a microfluidic is used to actuate the flexible PDMS layer in order to manipulate fluid flow through the flow layer. For example, by actuating a syringe attached to the control layer, a valve can be opened.
PDMS Layer
Material: Polydimethylsiloxane
The PDMS layer of a microfluidic lies between the flow and control layers. This flexible membrane allows for a seal to be created between the two polycarbonate layers. PDMS can be actuated to manipulate fluid flow in valved designs.

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#3G_-_-_TEXT.html," and DNA ligase seals the bases together.
In 3G, the homologous regions between the vector and the transcriptional unit are the UNSs. To assemble a circuit with multiple transcriptional units, the first fragment should have UNS 1 on its 5’ end and the last fragment should have UNS 10 on its 3’ end. Adjacent fragments should have overlapping UNSs. For instance, the first transcriptional unit may begin with UNS 1 and end with UNS 3. The second transcriptional unit then begins with UNS 3 and ends with UNS 10. The UNS 1 on the first transcriptional unit will anneal to the UNS 1 on the vector. The UNS 3 sequences will anneal to each other, connecting the two units. Finally, the UNS 10 on the second unit will anneal to the UNS 10 on the vector, creating a circular plasmid. Of course, these steps are actually happening simultaneously, but they are outlined in this way for clarity.
Figure 5: Gibson stage of 3G: Transcriptional units attach to the backbone at UNS 1 and UNS 10 and to each other at UNS 3
Advantages
Modularity
3G assembly offers a variety of benefits that are specifically useful for iGEM teams. This system allows for remarkable modularity at multiple levels. During the Golden Gate stage, different variants of the same part can be added to the tube to produce a variety of transcriptional units. For example, if you do not know how strong an RBS will make your circuit perform optimally, you can try several types in one reaction, then screen your circuits for the output you want. The best performing circuit can then be sequenced. For a more detailed description, see here .
Figure 6: Modularity: RBS variants of the same circuit
The modularity of 3G assembly can also be seen at the Gibson stage, during which different transcriptional units can be easily combined. Once a transcriptional unit has been made, it can be combined with any other transcriptional unit with compatible UNSs. So, a unit flanked with UNS 1 and UNS 3 can be combined with any unit flanked with UNS 3 and UNS 5, and additionally any unit flanked with UNS 5 and UNS 10. Together, these units can go on any UNS compatible backbone. Up to six transcriptional units can be combined on to a vector at once.

Unit Test
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. What’s more, the game Foldit is used to give children a vivid model of protein. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chiao Tung University from July 31st to August 4th 2017. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.
Science and Technology Exhibition
We held a Synthetic Biology exhibition in Hefei science museum, which is the largest off-campus science class. This exhibition attracts thousands of citizens including innocent pupils, high school students and their parents. And our team coordinated with team USTC and provide a flood of synthetic knowledge to the visitors.
We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could learn knowledge while having fun.

Penn,2011,Team:Penn#notebook#_-_-_TEXT.html," the email that Jordan sent us)
How long did the luminometer measure the gaussia: 10 seconds (that’s how long the light shines) *and it may be that the camera is not sensitive enough..if we can use a higher objective, we will be able to better detect
Take an image, turn the camera off, then turn it back on after everything has equilibrated.  We have to use the light to find the cells? Turn off the light for 10 minutes to let everything reequilibrate/go back to normal, then add the gaussia and begin running the camera
*Other idea; look at cells initially using red light so that nothing is activated/stimulated, then when actually ready to record/measure/add gaussia, use blue light (480nm).  Use a filter on the microscope light.  If this doesn’t work that well then you have a justification for using the CatCH mutagenesis
We need cells with CHR2 and aequorin for the transfection
Concern: gaussia light is so much longer lasting and stronger that it might block out the light that is emitted by the cells. We will have to play with the stoichiometry for the cotransfection to try to figure out the best way for showing the second glowing of the cells after the CHR2 have taken up the calcium.  A perfect cotransfection is not possible the first time, but we can at least try to find thresholds and work from there
Coelenterazine needs to be characterized TOMORROW. We need to do better with planning because Jordan is very busy and it is difficult for him to leave what he is doing to help us.
@2:45PM Jordan and Mike are going to work together on characterization using the microscope in Chen Lab.
The most accurate way to count the # of cells that you have is to image cells on a microscope, and count the # of cells in a region of the plate, and magnify this by the total area of the plate. This is better than the hemocytometer?
Original calculations can be used to make approximate additions of media etc. based on the confluency of the cells.
iGaussia is a little bit dimmer than regular gaussia, but do we know if the renilla luciferase is a lot brighter? We’re going to contact Dan to see if there is a CMV-renilla plasmid available (or see if addgene has that too)
some people in Chen lab are doing dual luciferase assays (we just don’t know if we need to clone it out or"

i Publishing of group members
After a few information meetings held by the principle investigators and the                     instructors the 2016’ LiU iGEM Team was set.
Team registration
i Lecture about arsenic poisoning
To find inspiration for our project we had a lecture in arsenic poisoning and                     protein aggregation with one of the principal investigators of our project. We                     all were very excited about the topic of the lecture but we decided that it                     would be difficult to make a iGEM project about it.
April
i Lecture about algae
Further on we had a lecture about algae and why the biodiesel production from                     algae is not economically sustainable with the Assistant Professor Johan                     Edquist. It did not take long until we all were agreed that we wanted to work                     with algae in the 2016’ iGEM project.
i Project design
To make more biomass out of algae we investigated different methods and                     promoters, but in an early state is was clear that we wanted to work with                     CRISPR/Cas9 and a light inducible promoter called SORLIP.
i Project plan development
When we had a project design we planned the time we had before the Giant                     Jamboree, this to be able to make the best we could of the time we had. The                     project plan was a draft of this timeline.

This event is hosted by the team who held the best                     presentation the previous year according to the NiC jury. The 2016’s conference                     was arranged by Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. This was a perfect opportunity                    "

Bioreactor design
As stated in the introduction, our project is an attempt to modify E coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.  To learn more about the existing biotech infrastructure in India, we decided to visit some biotech parks in India and explore the feasibility and applicability of our idea.

Overview
With the advent of rDNA technology in the late 1970s, medicine, agriculture and several other areas underwent a quantum leap and from that point, progress only hastened, from one only one recombinant pharmaceutical  approved for human use (insulin) in 1982 to one hundred and fifty-one FDA approved protein based recombinant pharmaceuticals by 2009 [1] . Despite being in high demand (due to the fact that most recombinant products produced on an industrial scale are therapies for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes), recombinant products are expensive due to several factors like long and expensive development time, high failure rate (~80%) of the products developed, manufacturing costs requiring expensive technologies and processes (bioreactors, column chromatography, sterile conditions, etc) and the involvement of skilled labor on both the manufacturing and the healthcare provider’s side [2] . Treatments with these pharmaceuticals can cost from around 10,000 to 100,000 € per year for a single patient[2]. As scientists and engineers, it seems obvious that our contribution can be most easily and effectively be made at the level of manufacturing costs; to try to bring down the cost of these life-saving products.
Bioreactor design
We realized that manufacturing units use expensive and energy expensive machinery [3] . Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way"

CSU_CHINA,2018,Team:CSU CHINA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," with. At the same time, we gave our leaflets and tri-fold-pages to them and try best to explain how important it is to know those kinds of knowledge. Below are some pictures of our partners with their “special” hats.
The communication between us is very harmonious and joyful. The store owners are very supportive of our activities, and also put our CSU_CHINA flyer on the cashier so that the guests can notice it and have access to know our projects (the flyer has a QR code). The youth street cleaners also asked us some questions about liver cancer, passionately and lovely, although their level of education is relatively low. After our members told the staffs of the property company about the contents of our project and the purpose of the flash mob, they provided us with the venue, speakers, microphones, etc. for free. Thanks to their help, “Working molecule” was plain sailing.
Sina Weibo has always been a very popular app in China. So, we took the form of live broadcast on Weibo in this event, making more viewers who can't come to the site can see what we are doing. In addition to the normal action, the hosts of the live broadcast also interviewed the heads of various parts of CSU_CHINA to explain to the audience the mechanism and significance of our project. According to later statistics, our live broadcast scored 5,215 views and did a further spread of the influence of iGEM's culture and team. When the host asked team leader about our project, he explained: “The goal of our team is to develop a sensitive system to specifically kill liver cancer cells via genetic circuits, by using the combination of liver cancer-specific promoters and miRNAs.”
In addition, the dancers, hosts, etc. of the event, except 10 members of CSU_CHINA, the rest of all are all volunteers who were willing to participate. They don't ask for a return, learning our project gratis and explaining it to more people. This is what is meant by presenting our project as a one-stop service. From the property company that provides the venue, to the volunteers who act as the event sponsors; From offline flyers, to online live broadcasts; From one-way explanations, to feedback questionnaires, everything is complete. CSU-CHINA considers that HUMAN PRACTICE should be able to enable people to join, regardless of the way; or the role to join, and fully experience the project. This form greatly reduces the barrier to entry, enabling people with low academic qualifications and cross-disciplinary knowledge to have a chance understanding biosynthesis."
UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," underlying goals which make them more likely to spend, for instance, fifteen minutes talking to you about genetic engineering. This can be a polarizing effect—only people who feel strongly one way or another want to take the time to share their reactions. However, in our data, we found that many respondents did not feel strongly, or felt that they had insufficient information to make a choice in favor or against certain precision agriculture practices.
Another issue is that randomization is hard to achieve. This is especially the case in internet based surveys. Sometimes one of my Facebook friends will post a survey to their page asking for responses for a class. Though this information may be subjectively useful, it is only going to reach the demographic of her friends, which may or may not be the target population. This is part of the reason why our team selected to study Farmer’s Markets—not only were they demonstrably food conscious which makes them the population at issue with regard to food labelling standards, but also this was a self-selecting population—everyone who we could ask fits the parameters of the people we seek to ask. A survey posted to Facebook friends when one is trying to, for instance, gain information about a broader group than just one’s friends, is a flawed design.
Finally, small sample sizes can eschew results. The lower limit to find statistically significant data tends to be around thirty responses. Barring other flaws that can prejudice data, simply having too few responses can make your survey inadequate for finding statistically meaningful work. Between our survey data and the data generated through our collaboration with UC Santa Cruz directed by their Principle Investigator Chase Armer, we collected almost fifty responses. While statistical results from this are not quite as dynamic as they might be with a larger sample size, like Consumer Reports 2015 survey data on shoppers’ “naturalness” in food concerns, we also recorded other comments given by the respondents, offering a broader range of feedback and supplying more context for their opinions on naturalness.
Now you are ready to go forth and conduct a meaningful and ethically sound survey to answer the novel public opinion questions that your pioneering research conjures up!

It is possible that different schemes may correspond to one expected genetic function. In order to pick out the most feasible circuit design, we weighed many contributing factors to relieve the wet-lab cells of heavy burden and tried our best to eliminate the chances of cross talk and coupling. Fitness score is introduced into our software to measure the applicability and functionality of designed gene circuits. Many synthetic biologists have introduced similar scores to rank functional gene circuits. Our fitness score combines several types of scores to give a comprehensive and reasonable evaluation. Different scores put different emphasis on genetic regulatory processes which can also be influenced by different experimental environments. As a result, using a set of scoring standards, rather than only single one of them, to evaluate different properties of a gene circuit is undoubtedly a better approach to ranking gene circuits.
2.Gene network: See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit
Function:
A simple click on ""Gene network"" button will lead you to another tab where the detailed structure of your designed gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal substances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition and activation in or between Boolean gates.
Details:
As the scale of gene circuits grows larger, the difficulty of construction and measurement can be extremely formidable. Under the circumstances, it cannot be emphasized more to understand the internal substances and mechanisms. When the Boolean gates are combined together, the performance of the integrated system may not be as good as expected, even if the property of each Boolean gate is well understood. In contrast to the design of modern engineering disciplines which are always predictable and have a solid basis of accurate theories, synthetic biology may fall into the consistent process of trial-and-error. Huge cost of repeated experiments therefore becomes one of the constraints for biologists to further standardize Biobricks and devices. Therefore, our software is elaborately designed to provide a platform where biologists can design large-scale gene circuit before realizing them in laboratories.
3.Simulation: Get concentration-time simulation results
Function:
Given a designed gene circuit, such as a simple serial circuit composed of an AND gate and an OR gate, you can use our default parameters and change initial concentration of reactants to get simulation results.
If you want to get different results, you just need to change system parameters such as the rate of reactions, namely, to fill constants into the dialog boxes on our canvas.
What's more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of"

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

Microtiter Plate Assay for ring-shaped, curli dependent biofilm formation using differently tagged CsgA proteins
Background
The bacteria that we engineered for the project are capable of producing curli proteins after induction with L-rhamnose. We assessed whether our CsgA-producing bacteria can make a ring-shaped biofilm by adapting the protocol from Zhou et al. (2013) using crystal violet for dying the biofilm-making bacteria. However, now we would like to know if the cells that we engineered to have a special affinity for different surfaces can also make biofilms. For that reason, we repeated the assay with crystal violet for the different strains that produce CsgA but contained in a different plasmid.
Methodology
In the experiment, our CsgA-producing strain of E. coli is induced at a high (0.5% w/v), low (0.2% w/v) and no (0% w/v) concentration of L-rhamnose. Furthermore, csgA-deficient bacteria transformed with an empty plasmid (pSB1C3) are also tested and used as a control (Table 7). All the experiments were carried out in triplicates. A summary of the samples used for the experiment is also shown in Table 7:
Table 7. Summary of the samples analysed after the cells grew on them
The cultures of all the transformed strains were grown and induced in a 96-well plate. 40 hours after the induction, the samples were washed with water (in order to disregard non-attached, planktonic cells) and dyed with crystal violet. Finally, the wells were filled with ethanol so all the content can dissolve in the liquid phase and be measured in the plate reader in triplicates.
Results and discussion
The absorbance at 590 nm of wavelength is measured for all the samples, obtaining the following results displayed as bar plots (figure 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18):

Pipette, protein, E.coli, culture medium, camera, computer engineering… As part of our team culture, Tuanzi are our little bonus, for us and for other iGEMers. They were printed on sweaters and key rings, delivered to friends, instructors and others who gave us a hand during our preparation. Also we will bring them to Giant Jamboree. Thanks to them, more and more people come to know our team, realizing that iGEM involves more than wet-lab students. No matter what you are responsible for- human practice, modeling, art design and so on- we wish to express gratitude to every member’s effort in iGEM.
As a cutting-edge therapy, cellular immunology is really a hot spot. Mostly people only know it by the media, but hardly understand how it works. To make the public get acquaintance with the STEP system and how it comes to our mind, an animated video was created. Producing a video helps us reflect on the whole project design as well as plays an educational role.

What’s the connection between porcelain and STEP? We came to a workshop and made a STEP plate with our own hands. As a traditional Chinese art, it contains philosophy from our ancestor. Round and smooth, the porcelain plate serves people as a container, while it would easily hurt us when broken into pieces. Just like our system, it’s never easy to create one and make it serve the public for the right purpose.

Since we developed an in vivo mutagenesis system, based on the EP-Pol I, we contacted Mr. Camps. During E-Mail correspondence and Skype conversation he reviewed our concept and helped us to integrate the EP-Pol I to the most effect in our project. Additionally, Mr. Camps kindly provided us the EP-Pol I next to different controls we used for characterisation of our mutagenesis parts.
According to our correspondence with Mr. Camps we adapted our project accordingly.
One modification is the positioning of our target sequence on the plasmid. First, we wanted to place the target sequence behind the origin of replication, due to older information speaking of an increased mutation rate closely after the ColE1-ori (Camps et. al 2003). In our Skype conference Mr. Camps told us that the mutation is distributed evenly across the whole ColE1-plasmid with exception of the first very short region behind the origin of replication and regions of processed okazaki primers.  After this information we decided to drop our plan to move the BioBrick site directly behind the ColE1-ori and continued using the iGEM pSB1-series.
Finally, we asked Mr. Camps about an estimation of our concept. He said that our approach to use the EP-Pol I as the in vivo mutation machinery is a very excellent idea. Other in vivo approaches like the common used XL1 red system are not as efficient as mutating with the EP-Pol I in terms of a balanced mutation spectrum. But more importantly the EP-Pol I gives us control about the mutation target. Since the EP-Pol I mostly targets ColE1 plasmids, we protect the chromosome and thus house-keeping genes from being mutated. That is a huge advantage compared to common in vivo mutagenesis approaches.
Additionally, for further questions after the conversation round, we stayed in e-mail contact with Mr. Camps and asked him when problems occured.
Because our determination of the mutation rate does not confirm the rate written in the literature, we asked for possible explanations. He stressed out the importance to start the mutagenesis directly after transformation. Furthermore it could be advantageous to place the cultures under replicative stress by letting them grow for several days until reaching hypersaturation. Thus, the cultures would experience saturate mismatch repair.
Furthermore, we corresponded with Mr. Camps about"
