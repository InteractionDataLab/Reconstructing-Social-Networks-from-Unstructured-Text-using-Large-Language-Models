High Fidelity PCR
To amplify the KanR cassette* (~1kb), high fidelity PCR was done using pSB1K3 as template DNA and IV009 and IV010 as forward and reverse primers respectively. 8 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol.
NOTE: previously (10/8/2018), the KanR gene was used for amplification. This is not the same as the whole cassette, which includes the promoter and terminator.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," arsenic poisoning. Strong local and seasonal fluctuations in arsenic concentrations make it necessary to test each well regularly ( van der Meer 2003 ).
Health effects
Inorganic arsenic compounds are highly toxic. Acute effects of arsenic intake can range from gastrointestinal distress to death. Chronic exposure can result in skin lesions, vascular diseases and cancer. These chronic effects are referred to as arsenicosis, and there is no effective therapy for them. Due to its toxicity and frequency, arsenic ranks first on the Priority List of Hazardous Substances prepared by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10 µg/L in drinking water, but some countries have adopted a national standard of 50 µg/L ( World Health Organization 2012 ; Chen, Rosen 2014 ).
Detection
Arsenic can be accurately detected by means of techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), atomic fluorescence spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, they are expensive and not suitable for field testing ( Chen, Rosen 2014 ).  Chemical test kits are available, which mostly rely on the Gutzeit method. This method is based on the generation of arsine gas from a sample solution. Arsine then reacts with a mercuric bromide impregnated test strip, which results in a color change ( Kearns 2010 ). The accuracy and reliability of this method has been called into question ( Rahman et al. 2002 ).  The need for an inexpensive and reliable detection method has led to the development of various arsenic biosensors. Among them are both whole-cell-based and cell-free biosensors. For a recent review, refer to Kaur et al. 2015 .
Our arsenic biosensor
We choose to work with the chromosomal arsenic operon of E. coli, which was used by the team from Edinburgh in 2006. This operon encodes an efflux pump, which confers resistance against arsenic. The expression is controlled by the repressor ArsR, which negatively autoregulates its own expression. AsIII can bind to three cysteine residues in ArsR. The resulting conformational change deactivates the repressor ( Chen, Rosen 2014 ).

No hardware modifications are needed, because both the display and the rotary encoder are controlled software sided. With this important criteria in mind, we even went a step further and added Bluetooth to our LED device!
HC05 Bluetooth dongle that receives a series of advanced illumination settings from our android application.
While the rotary encoder in combination with the display is perfectly suited for simple applications, where constant illumination is sufficient, we wanted to enable others to use the LED panel in a more complex environment. For example if the LED panel is used inside another hardware device, where the manual controls are not accessible, or if advanced illumination settings such as time‑dependent variations in illumination intensity is needed. For these cases, we included the Bluetooth dongle HC05 into our prototype and wrote our own powerful and versatile Android application to control the LED panel. The app allows users to create a sequence of illumination settings, reaching from constant illumination intensity over linear, exponential or logarithmic changes of intensity over time, to gradient settings.
Through this repeating process of planning, constructing and testing different prototypes, we are proud to came up with a solution that is both user-friendly and versatile at the same time. The combination of a rotary encoder and a Bluetooth application ensures that our hardware device is prepared for every application, no matter how challenging it is. Based on the results from this prototyping phase, we began developing a circuit diagram and designing a printed circuit board (PCB) for mounting the components of our final hardware product.
PCB Design & Circuit Diagram
After our extensive prototyping, the next step in the development process was to design a printed circuit board (PCB) based on a circuit diagram. The circuit diagrams and PCB designs were created with the CAD software package Autodesk EAGLE Premium version 8.2.1 . For students and educators, a 3-years educational license is available for free at autodesk.com . To take a closer look at our designs, install EAGLE and download our EAGLE project files from the Downloads section.
The foundation for a good PCB design is always the circuit diagram. It contains all electrical components that are later on soldered onto the PCB, including information about their names, their electrical values and their connection pins. It also shows how the different components are connected to each other via conductive paths on the PCB. The follwing figure shows a compact representation of all circuitry that is underlying our circuit board design. In the Downloads section of this page, a structured collection of the circuit diagram can be downloaded as a PDF file.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Ethics#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," you need, especially the artistic approach? We cannot consider that the bacteria is the brush, the brush is inert, the brush cannot mute onto another brush! Whereas, your bacteria could become a communicable disease, who knows? In biology we cannot be sure at 100% that we are going to create something without any danger.
Therèse Bichon: To my mind, using a bacteria in an artistic approach is almost the same as using it to produce medicines. Both of them have a goal but it is not the same. For the first one, you want to raise a specific question, for the other one you want to treat people. We can also explain that saying that the first one is about mental health and the second one about physical health.
Is there a hierarchy between organisms according to you? Is it the same to use bacteria or a rabbit?
Emmanuel Hirsch: I think this question is biased. It depends on the personality. In a certain way, when it possible to identify yourself to a species you are more susceptible. With the world of the infinitely small, you cannot even see these organisms, so it creates a certain distance between you and them. So, I have less consideration for the bacteria than for a dog for example. The dog is more humanized. You can identify yourself as the dog but not really as the bacteria. And there is a question of inheritance. If you modify these bacteria, has it an impact on future generations?
Morgan Meyer: For Humans, some laws and right exist. Then, humans have the ability to talk and to express feelings. We made some unethical experimentation until not so long ago. And nowadays, it is very difficult to do some experiments with humans (hopefully). However, for animals it is not the same. We can consider that they have some rights too, and currently some societies defend their rights. For bacteria, mushrooms and algae, we can claim that it is really different. They have not any brain and cannot communicate with us. On the other hand, if we are human and if we share this planet with other species, have we the right not to respect them?
Living or non-living, natural or artificial, reel or fake?
What is a living being?
Morgan Meyer: To my mind, there is a fundamental difference between inert matter which is stabilized and living matter which we know can change. Between the living matter we do not really know and become dangerous afterall, and the matter which we absolutely do not know every consequences it can have behind its use, there is a difference.

Intro:
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school and collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to receive theirs.
FAFU-CHINA:
We helped FAFU-CHINA contact Zady Cytille, an international graduate student from Cote d’Ivoire, now studying in the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, to introduce their project and get feedback from him based on the conditions of his home country. ( See also )
BNDS_China:
We provided our TAKARA restriction enzymes to BNDS_China to help them with double enzyme digestion. Since high school teams do not usually have the financial support from school, most of the lab materials used by BNDS are purchased by their team members. We are very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project come true. ( See also )"

We have succeeded in designing 2 new osmoregulative promoters, PompC(CB) (BBa_K395302) and PompC(CS1) (BBa_K395303) , which can be utilized in the red-light-dependent gene expression network (Fig. 4-3). We also characterized LacIM1 (BBa_K082026) , a mutant of LacIWT,which is a key component in the band-detect network. Although, this part was registered by USTC(2008) [3], it was not well characterized in the BioBrick registry. We confirmed that LacIM1 shows weaker repression to Plac than its wild type. (Fig. 4-4)
Wolf coli and Artificial Cooperative System
Fig. 4-1 Cooperative activity of Artificial Cooperation System
The Artificial Cooperation System was designed to be switched off during the “full moon night”. Therefore, Sympathetic coli would  transform into Wolf coli at the “full moon light”. During this period, communication between 2 types of cells doesn't occur. Hence, both types of cells are unable to recognize each other by quorum sensing and become competitors. Cooperative activity in Artificial Cooperation System is regulated by 3 levels of light intensity which are weak, medium and strong. “Weak light” from the crescent moon switches the Artificial Cooperation System on, thus two types of cells are able to communicate and help each other. “Medium light” during the full moon night can switch the system off resulting in appearance of the “Wolfcoli”. During the daytime, “strong light” from the sun activates the Artificial Cooperation System.

 Jiangnan
This year, we aims at using a bifunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A, to directly break down the lignin-polysaccharide crosslink between straws and convert them into useful chemical materials. We introduced a group of cellulases (cex, cenA, xyl3A) to convert the cellulose produced by straw degradation into glucose, and then designed two pathways to ferment glucose to produce butanol and hydrogen respectively.
However, there is a problem that when the conventional E. coli BW25113 is used as a chassis organism for butanol fermentation, the yield is very low, so we hope to replace the chassis cells to reach an increase in the yield of butanol.
Through the discussions between our two teams, Jiangnan offered our team E. coli B0016-050 from their laboratory as a new chassis cell to help us make further increase in the yield of butanol. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Jiangnan/Collaborations

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," current GMO policy needs to be reconsidered, possibly by providing the opportunity for case-by-case approval decisions.
The point was raised that the legislative discussion is largely technocratic, but that in order to reach acceptance of synbio in society, the discussion should be conducted at a societal, ethical and even emotional level. This currently goes wrong, since although the questions asked are on the societal, ethical level, the answers given by the scientists are largely technical. Various strategies to raise the acceptance of synbio were discussed.
One of the most interesting findings of the discussion was that, in order to reach more acceptance, (synbio) innovation should not be stand-alone, but incorporated in processes. When synbio innovations are used to solve important issues, this would increase the acceptance. In this context, it was mentioned that the synbio solution should clearly be better and cheaper than other (non-synbio) solutions. A demonstrable benefit for the end user is essential.
In order to reach aforementioned problem-based development of synthetic biology, it is necessary to bring together the people with the problem, investors, scientists and commercial parties to develop an application. The call for such a interdisciplinary platform was widely supported and one of the main conclusions, not only of our own discussion but also of meeting as a whole.
Another interesting topic raised was the way synbio should be communicated to the general public. When selling ELECTRACE, should you focus on the fact that it uses synthetic biology or on the application? In this context, a comparison was made to the introduction of nanotechnology. Possibly hazardous nanoparticles are an ingredient of suntan oil, but this is not stressed, and public concerns are not an issue. However, there is a thin line between “not stressing” and deliberately selling false information, and therefore this might not be the best approach.
Another approach would be to strive for total openness; this is the open-source development approach used by iGEM and the scientific community. Several drawbacks of this approach were discussed. Firstly, following the proverb “Let sleeping dogs lie”, stressing all the scientific details might provoke protests that otherwise wouldn’t happen. Next to that, and more importantly, open-source development might inhibit commercial development, since it does not fit well in the current business models.
In synthetic biology communication, framing was found to be a big issue. The term GMO was found to be so “contaminated” in public perception that its use should be averted altogether. The term synthetic biology scores a bit better, but still evokes negative associations. An important goal should be to find a term with a very positive ring to it. Another solution could be"

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#solid model_-_-_TEXT.html," is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
    Using the idea of CA, first, we discretize whole space in a medium and total time we take to cultivate cells; second, we set placement rules, i.e. events that will happen after a cell is put onto medium; third, we set iteration rules, i.e. events that will trigger during each iteration in simulation.
III Basic assumptions
    Our solid model has several basic assumptions that are indispensable.
(1) A colony-to-grid representation in a 200×200 mesh grid (one grid represents a cell colony) is good enough to simulate bacterial growth in a real medium. (See Overall Discretization )
(2) The time it takes for AHLs and nutrition to diffuse into surrounding grids and reach concentration balance is very short compared to the time for cells to grow into colonies. (See Placement Rules )
(3) We suppose decomposing rate of AHLs and utilization rate nutrition are constants, and decomposing rate is relatively high compared to growth rate of cells.
IV. Overall discretization
    In the first place we do spatial and time discretization. The whole medium is discretized into a 200×200 mesh grid, and valid space for living is a disk inscribed on it with a radius of 100. Using assumption I, we set each cell colony (abbreviated as ‘cell’ in following sections) into a corresponding grid to represent its presence. In software simulation, we keep three matrices of 200×200 size to record the amount of cells, nutrition and AHLs in each grid, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the whole time we take to cultivate cells is discretized into 1,200 iterations. After each iteration, the number of substances in each grid changes according to certain rules (will be discussed in following sections).
V Placement rules
    When we place a cell onto a corresponding grid, concentrations of substances in adjacent grids also change as a result. We apply assumption II to develop a set of synchronous placement rules:
(1)The event of placing a cell triggers concentration incline in surrounding grids synchronously
(2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.
(3)Removal of a cell has"

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Biofilm_-_-_TEXT.html," by CsgA-Histag and one without inducer. From the first picture, it shows biofilm areas are densely covered by CdS nanorods. As can be clearly seen from the second figure, with inducer, there’s distinct nanofibers outside the bacteria contrast to the third picture in which E.coli are not induced. Thus we ultimately confirm the viability of bio-abiotic hybrid system.

Construction of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag/ His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
PARTS: BBa_K2132001
In light of the immunization platform of biofilm for enzymes, we need some tags acting like glues or stickers that could be connected to the tags on the enzyme. The SpyCatcher and SpyTag system seem like a good choice for us. The SpyCatcher on the biofilm will mildly bind the SpyTag on the enzyme. Note that there is no the other way around, given that the huge size (138 amino acids) may impair the normal function of some delicate enzyme, hydrogenase in our case. For more details for the principles of SpyCatcher and SpyTag and our motivation on this system, see Extracellular Linkage System .  On top of the linkage to the enzyme, we would like to equip the biofilm the ability to bind nanorods and quantum dots. This goal makes the construction of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag or His-CsgA-SpyCatcher necessary. The two sequences are submitted as our first two original parts. See webpage of the parts here: BBa_K2132001
In constructing the sequence, we simply used Gibson Assembly to assemble the clips of CsgA, SpyCatcher, Histag and the plasmid backbone together at one single reaction. For more details and the sequencing data, please click the pdf here.
In constructing the parts, we had been worried about whether the huge SpyCatcher will interfere with the CsgA secretion and whether they will secret together. Careful characterization of each subunit proves that the two parts work excellently, in consistence with previous findings[4].
Characterization
Since the sequence is actually a fusion protein, we identified each unit individually in characterization.

Mag-attraction Test
After the bio-mineralization, we did an intuitive mag-attraction test as a pre-experiment to observe the effect of bio-mineralization.[7]And we found that mineralized E.coli gathered at the edge of the magnet, indicating that we had successfully made our E.coli have magnetism properties, which might be of relevance with the iron contained ferritin as we supposed. To verify such assumption, we did following test.

Ferritin Expression Test
We purified the ferritin over expressed in E. coli through Ni-chelating affinity chromatography and highly concentrated it and then do SDS-PAGE. The position of clearly targeted band (19.5kDA[1]) on the gel was consistent with the size of ferritin monomer fused with His tag, explaining that the ftnA expression is successful.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Test
After successfully verify ferritin expression in our bacteria, we attempted to observe the result of bio-mineralization with TEM as most literatures do[6].

2 Objectives
2.1 Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
2.2 Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
2.3 Increase our own social reach and personal values
3 Lab Project
4 References
This year, we designed an audiogenetics system to explore the secret of sound sensing inspired by the status of hearing loss issues all over the world. Our human practice naturally focused on the combination of our lab works and prompting global concern about hearing-impaired people.
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We also designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, propagation, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project. Through a series of interviews , we harvested many information about hearing loss including policies, medication, research and philanthropy. The knowledge about hearing formation also helped us promote our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonwealth activities and cooperate with accessibility App developers to further extend our social impact.
Human practices made us to rethink the relationship between we researchers and the public. Countless people has given us tons of new ideas about our project during our campaigns. We are truly thankful to all the people who supported us with their words and gestures. Without them, this project would have never been what it is like now.
Background
Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a worldwide problem. There are about 360 million hearing-impaired people around the world, accounting for 5% of the world’s total population. [1] In China, people with hearing impairment take more than 1.67%, ranking at top of the whole disabled groups.
Fig.1 Worldwide hearing loss status Asian hearing-impaired population accounts for a large part of the overall group with hearing loss. The number of people with hearing loss increases by year. [2]
However, after communicating with relatives or friends that suffer or have ever suffered hearing impairment, we found that, although the concerns by the international community are rising, there is still few efficient way to cure such problems.
Though many contributing causes of hearing problems [3"

Characerization of TetR/pTet
As mentioned on the System design page, we wanted to investigate the Tet promoter expression profile, and what influence the LVA tag on the pTet promoter regulator (TetR) had on the expression profile.
For this purpose three plasmids were constructed. The first expressing GFP from pTet promoter with no regulation. The second and third constitutively expressing TetR with or without the LVA tag as well
The pTet-GFP construct was cloned.
A TetR (no LVA) construct was cloned by PCR amplification without the LVA tag and addition of promoter, RBS and terminator. Subsequently the construct was ligated into the pTet-GFP construct. The constructs can be  found in parts registry as Bba_K1475004 and Bba_K1475005 , respectively.
A TetR (with LVA) construct was cloned by PCR amplification with the LVA tag and addition of the same promoter, RBS and terminator as TetR without LVA tag. Subsequently the construct was ligated into the pTet-GFP construct, as well. The construct can be found in parts registry as Bba_K1475006 .

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ologists in mind, general biologists and undergraduate students also gave us constant feedback in improving the efficiency and clarity of our designs.
Sitting in on MIT& BU Lab Meetings
While initial testing of the MoClo Planner was occurring, we focused on peer-education and student collaboration techniques, and also on how troubleshooting works in a team environment.  One of our team members went to MIT iGEM team’s meetings weekly, and took notes on presentation styles, technologies used, data sharing methods, and potentially software tools we would built to improve the efficiency of the wet-lab meetings.  We also sat down and observe BU iGEM team’s lab meetings, and realized that the dynamics between the teams were very different in terms of collaborative troubleshooting, data sharing, and organization.  How can we design tools that can assist all kinds of different iGEM teams?  How can we design tools that not only can be used in individual PI and student meetings, but also roundtables among several PIs and more than a dozen undergraduate and graduate researchers?  How would data sharing and file sharing work in an organized manner? How to the students keep track of the troubleshooting suggestions they receive from their advisers at these meetings for future references?  These are just some of many questions that were brought up in our observations and in our interviews with both teams.
Next Steps to Take in the UCD Process
While we talked to a variety of users this summer, there is still much work to be done in terms of user-centered design.  In our next step, to improve the MoClo Planner we are hoping to also redesign it to allow for top-down design process; from our interviews with the BU team we realized that both bottom-up and top-down assembly methods would be useful for synthetic biologists, whether it be for characterizing a specific part, or for constructing a working, complex biological module.  In terms of our SynFlo project, because we understand and appreciate the importance of biosafety and synthetic biology education, we will push for broader familiarity of the field and safe lab techniques through the usage of our project, a MS Surface and tangible Sifteo Cube game for high school students.  For SynBio Search , further user studies will be conducted with iGEM teams, both domestic and international, as we refine the design and test the robustness of our search engine with synthetic biologists and continue to ask for their feedback.  We are hoping to design a collaborative surface tool to facilitate lab meetings, and hoping to address many questions arose in terms of data sharing, biosecurity, and collaborative research methods.  This is only a brief"

This algorithm is used in the Ribosome Binding Site Calculator (https://salislab.net/software/ , Borujeni & Salis). We used this Calculator to predict the translation rates of our mRNAs.
The results are in table 1. The program gives us results in au (arbitrary units). Since we know the translation rate of LuxI and LuxR, we can use these as a base to calculate the other translation rates since the used scale is proportional. (table 1, column 2) LuxI and LuxR have almost the same output from the calculator which corresponds with the paper where they also have the same translation rate. (Ag43 has a very low translation rate, which is not completely illogical, since Ag43 is by far the biggest protein.) Our values are normal values since 1000 is a moderate value and values between 1 and 100 000 are possible. (efficient search, mapping and optimization, salis). We did get warnings about the prediction (NEQ: not at equilibrium) which happens when mRNA may not fold quickly to its equilibrium state.

3.3 DNA binding
Our system includes two types of DNA binding proteins: repressors and activators. These proteins bind certain regions in the promoter DNA. This binding can either repress or activate the promoter activity, affecting transcription. The repressors used in our system are the cI protein of the lambda phage and the PenI protein. The activator protein is LuxR, which should be activated by AHL. All proteins first need to form homodimers before being able to bind their target DNA.
DNA binding will be simulated using the Hill function : ${\theta} = \frac{{[L]}^n}{{K_d}^n + [L]^n} = \frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[L]})^{n}}$. $\theta$ is the amount of DNA bound by the protein, $L$ is the amount of"

Overview
Our team was organized by International Teenager Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC) in January 2018, following 12 days of professional training in fundamental theory and experimental operation on molecular biology and synthetic biology.
After several months of brainstorming and conducting literature reviews, we decided we wanted to establish a detection and degrading system for aflatoxin B1. With our new detection method successfully worked, then we worked on several enzymes we thought might be able to degrade aflatoxin. However, as we reviewed the experimental result from our first two enzymes, ADTZ and BacC, we realized that our preliminary idea was unlikely to be successful. Instead, we are now aiming to develop a data library for enzymes that might be able to degrade aflatoxin. We are developing this data library by using our previous results as well as testing the function of new enzymes (e.g. F420).
Since the establishment of our team, we have received guidance from academic advisers from the University of Science and Technology Beijing and Beijing Institute of Technology. We also received lectures from Ms. Qu on genetics (e.g. on the transcription and translation from DNA to amino acid, principles of gel electrophoresis, lac and tryptophan operon, and the process of PCR).
Despite the fact that our team members study and live in different cities and provinces in China, we have embraced this challenge and used innovative solutions to help push our project forward. We convened during summer vacations and all other public holidays to work on our project. We conducted our experiments in two laboratories located in Beijing and Nanjing. Since the team members study at different schools, we have made full use of modern telecommunication technology including WeChat and QQ. Since the team’s inception, we have held telephone conferences every week to communicate on our work’s progress. We have thoroughly enjoyed this project and would like to thank all related people at CIEI-BJ and elsewhere. Without their invaluable support, this project would not have been possible.

Teaching Presentation
The impact of synthetic biology depends on the number and quality of scientists making significant contributions to the field. Future scientists will rise from current high school students who are excited about science and gain a solid background in math and science in their formative years. To this end, we decided to raise the awareness of high school students about the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology and to also teach them about the process of scientific research.
As an additional outcome, the proposed methodology of using an electronic circuit equivalent for modeling biological phenomena can be replicated and used beyond the context of our current project.
We decided to create teaching materials for high school students inspired by our team’s research project. Our goal was that these materials can be easily used by a science teacher in a lecture in a Biology or Chemistry course to:
Explain what Synthetic Biology is;
Illustrate the opportunities created by Synthetic Biology in improving human well being;
Discuss ethical concerns related to Synthetic Biology;
Enable the students to understand how our biosensor works.
To bridge the gap between the background of a high school student and the complexity of our project, we built an affordable, microcontroller-based, hardware platform and associated, open-source, digital simulation software. In designing the demonstration platform, we exploited the relationship between biological networks in synthetic biology and electronic circuits in electrical engineering. Specifically, we created a circuit kit that emulates in hardware our biological construct and in software both the response of the biological construct to specific cell conditions and the fluorescence measurement.  It is important to note that the kit is INTERACTIVE (students can easily change electronic components to simulate different biological or external changes and the outcome of these changes), RELATABLE (the students can directly use the kit) and EASILY SHARED AND IMPROVED (the list of electronic components, circuit diagrams etc. are in the public domain and the software is open source).
The teaching materials we have created, specifically a power point presentation and an electronic circuit kit , have become part of the Lending Library of Kits of DNAZone , the outreach program of the Center of Nucleic Acids Science and"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"close non-zif268 fingers"" were actually not all that close to Zif268, and so we went into the 88,000 zinc finger database and pulled out zinc fingers surrounding zif268.  In fact, there were many, many, many zinc fingers that had identical sequences to the Zif268 F2 finger, and so we looked at sequences around it.  The tree below shows the new non-zif268 backbones that are actually close to zif268 compared to our old set.  The new set is in gray, the old set is in black.  This gives us a potential seven more backbones to work with.
Sequence Generation
We made some small updates to the sequence generator, based on the frequencies we noticed in the outputs of the tests we ran.
We decided to only include pseudocounts for position 6 for 'CNN' and 'ANN.' Originally, 'CNN' and 'ANN' were using pseudocounts for all seven positions. However, this introduced a noticeable increase in amino acids, such as tyrosine (Y), that have been shown to occur rarely in zinc fingers (according to our data from OPEN and Persikov). Additionally, because tryosines occured so rarely in the data (11 times total in the open data set), we decided not to give tyrosine a pseudocount.
We added the capability to prevent repeat backbone-helix combinations on the chip. That is, we wanted to make sure that the same exact zinc finger was not generated for different triplet inputs.
To test the sequence generator, we made two sets of 2000 sequences for GAA, then infographic-d the results. Comparing these with the images for OPEN and OPEN+Persikov shows that our generation follows the major themes of those datasets, but also introduces variation. The two generated sets also vary slightly from each other, which shows the influence of randomness on the generation.

Spinning with the godet, attempt 1
90% v/v Isopropanol coagulation bath
We first tried a godet speed of 15.67 steps/second
Yesterday, we tried to measure the speed at which the fiber comes out of the tubing and obtained ___.
godet was way too slow. The thread drooped to the bath floor and the thread coming out of the PEEK tubing was just bunching at the bottom.
Tried bumping the speed all the way up to 15.6719 x 14
This cut some of the slack in the thread
However, I observed something strange: it seemed that the faster that the godet reeled the thread, the faster the thread came out of the tubing
So it never happened as we envisioned -- that the thread would be taut coming out of the PEEK tubing
Spinning with the godet, attempt 2
I was frustrated with the godet, so I had the idea to reel the silk around something that I could spin with my hands. Used a 25 mL pipette
I used tweezers to pick up the fiber and wind it around the pipette
I spun the pipette slowly at first, but realized that the fiber in the bath was still slack
I then started spinning the pipette as fast as I could -- remarkably, the fiber tolerated this, and was still slack in the bath!!
Spinning with the godet, attempt 3
Hands getting tired. I decided to let the motors do the work.
Set up the godet outside of the bath. See picture.
Silk spinner or shitty Rube Goldberg machine?
Here's the weird part, the fiber ended up being kind of slack-ish?
The thread would drop vertically down from the PEEK tubing as it emerged
But before touching the floor, it would be pulled upward towards the surface
Right below the thread, there would be some white stuff. Not sure what it"

  4. We visited an electroplating factory, to consult their needs and requirements for heavy metal bio-sensors products and to ask them for advice on our projects and products.
  5. We interviewed Junjiu Huang (Associate Professor, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat - sen University), Lizhen Huang (Associate Professor, School of Biological Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology) and Yaqin Wang (Associate Professor, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University), consulting their advice on optimizing our projects and products.
  6. We conducted a questionnaire survey to understand the public's knowledge of heavy metal-related information and the need for related public science education
  7. We promote knowledge of heavy metal-related information, synthetic biology and iGEM In our university, a high school, as well as some public places.
Future plan
  1. To optimize our method’s practical application, we will make efforts to turn our engineering bacteria into freeze-dried powder form, making it more portable.
  2. To reduce the impact of environmental factors, we try making “dark box” to reduce the impact of light on the mobile phone app.

YFP protein (LuxY)
LuxY is a gene coding for YFP, a protein that shifts the light emission wavelength of Vibrio fischeri’s luciferase from 484nm (blue) to 534nm (green - yellow); because our system needed a green or yellow emission module we looked in the literature for a protein capable to generate this phenotype.
The sequence was taken from the article published  by Thomas O, et al., and then the sequence was synthesized by Mr.gene.
This is the composition of the synthesized sequence, “Gene” stands only for luxY coding region.
Preffix+ Promoter + RBS + Gene + Double Terminator + Suffix
See LuxY(BBa_K360100) annotation at the registry for more details.
RESULTS
We tried to get luxAB from V.fischeri's genome and then make a bio-brick with these genes, although we did not have many problems getting luxAB genes from V.fischeri's genome with a PCR approach, ligations and the following transformations never worked although we tried with several plasmids (see Augusto's results).
However our collaborator, Cambridge University sent us a plasmid with luxABCDE under PBAD promoter so E.coli tranformated with this plasmid and grown in arabinose media showed a blue glowing phenotype.
We cotransformated luxABCDE with luxY and the cotransformation was successful although we have not been able to characterize it yet, the experiments are still in process.

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#ToxicCompounds_-_-_TEXT.html," phenol and PCBs in our bacteria. In fact we can create more than a sensor system based on sponge: a complete filtrating system which can not only sense pollutants, but totally remove them.
For removing nitrites, it exists different biological denitrification systems to reduce nitrates concentration in water that use bacteria as Pseudomonas with a denitrification yield of 80%. Bacteria are fixed on a mineral support and feed with acetic acid or ethanol (SNIDE). The major drawback is the production of nitrous and nitric oxide that are greenhouse gases.
To make a bacterium able to transform nitrites into nitrogen we just have to add two enzymes:
-> Hydroxylamine oxydase from Parococcus denitrificans: nitrite + H2O = hydroxylamine
-> Hydrazine oxydoreductase from Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans: hydroxylamine + NH3 + acceptor = N2 + H2O + reduced acceptor
Figure8: Nitrogen cycle.
Unfortunately, dealing with heavy metals means dealing with atoms which cannot just be degraded by a biological pathway. But we can imagine some ways of accumulation of these elements in bacteria that we can remove and treated after like chemical waste.

Because we share a language and a geographic area, we considered it important, that as Latin countries we participated in a collaboration that allows in the short and long term to obtain benefits for the different teams.
We’ve worked in generating a document that contains the most relevant information of our projects, along with a section in which that reports the main problems we have had to get to iGEM. The idea is to disseminate this document widely through our networks in order to let know other countries not only how Synthetic Biology can bring great benefits to society, but also the great complications that we must go through to reach the Giant Jamboree to present our ideas and projects.
4.- Collaboration with iGEM Chihuahua
Unfortunately, we didn’t get our kit on time because of border control issues, and even worse, it seems to be damaged. Therefore, we weren’t able to carry out the InterLab and do the necessary transformations to meet the bronze criteria. However, the iGEM Tec-Chihuahua team collaborated with us by helping us with the transformations we needed: BBa_I744204 -plate 3, well 20F-, in E. Coli BL21B3,  BBa_K137055 -plate 4 and also well 13I- was transformed in E. Coli BL21B3. The transformations were successful and they were shipped to Guadalajara so we could continue with our work.
3.- Collaboration with iGEM CEM
CDMX team designed and developed a new method for siRNA production in BioBrick BSLA, which encodes for the reporter gene of the Blue Chromoprotein, the sense strand of the siRNA, a loop, and the antisense strand of the siRNA.
As the protocol stayed E. coli HT115 was used in the presence of plasmid L440, which confers resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline. When transforming this BioBrick in pSB1C3, the bacteria is resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Due to the risk of using multiresistant bacteria in research and to optimize BSLA expression, they asked us to determine the influence of multiple antibiotic resistance in the expression of BSLA.
In order to achieve this, the received strain was cultivated in luria broth with 1) chloramphenicol, 2) chloramphenicol and ampicillin, "

In nature, some of organisms which eat insects lure them. Rafflesia attract flies by distinctive smell. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in tunnel in anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulans, emits light in the first week of rainy season to hunt the termites. Arachnocampa also uses light for hunting flies. For Carnivorous E.coli, we chose light as the method to lure insects like Pyrearinus termitilluminans, because it is simple and there is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
To probe that Carnivorous E.coli can lure insects. we, group luminescence, intend to do the following things.

Lac Operon Repressor
Codes for the production of the repressor protein that binds to the Lac Operator to prevent expression until induction of the media with IPTG. We have designed pUS270 to have the LacI under the pVeg promoter for strong constitutive expression in Bacillus.
pIP501 Rep
This gene codes for the Replicator protein that pairs with the Bacillus OriV and is essential to promote the independent replication of pUS270 in Bacillus.
E. coli OriV
Taken from pSB1C3, having this origin of replication will make it easier to construct the plasmid using E. coli as well as improve cloning efficiency downstream. Chosen because of the high copy number of pSB1C3.
Multiple Cloning Site
The multiple cloning site of pUS258 and other expression plasmids that we considered using either had too few restriction sites or sites that were incompatible for the efficient cloning with the BB Prefix and Suffix. So we have designed two highly diverse MCS’ that have 27 unique sites amongst them on either side of SF AmylCP-6 to promote simple cloning of parts from the Bio Brick Registry.
Antibiotic Resistance
Codes for Neomycin Phosphotransferase II that gives transformants resistance to both Neomycin and Kanamycin. Allows selective screening of transformants
Antibiotic Resistance
This region allows independent replication of the vector within Bacillus at a high copy number to provide more copies of the recombinant gene to maximise expression.
Lac Operator
Consists of the target sequence for the lac repressor protein to contribute to the IPTG induction system.
SuperFold AmilCP-6
SuperFold AmilCP-6 is a variant of amilCP which was used by the 2016 Sydney IGEM team and originally submitted to the registry by Team Uppsala Sweden in 2011. This variant has undergone site directed mutagenesis to increase the folding rate of the chromoprotein and enhance the blue colour. We are taking advantage of this protein to enable blue-white screening without the need for adding X-gal to the plates. Cloning with the two multiple cloning sites that flank SF AmilCP-6 essentially swaps it with the insert to leave the recombinant bacteria white rather than blue.

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.

These oxides are harmful as they are the main reason of the present day acid rain which leads to a number of problems ranging from deterioration of the fertility of agricultural lands to polluting the water bodies.
Scope of application indicating anticipated product and processes
✔Applicability to the Indian environment and Benefits to Indian society, especially economically weaker segments: India is a tropical country and the release of greenhouse gases adds to the elevation of the temperature. A lot of research is being carried out and high cost equipment are being used to reduce the amount of greenhouse emissions. Our project aims to be an economical and efficient substitute for reducing global warming. According to WHO report, about 15-20 million people in India are asthmatic and it’s high time that the level of gases such as NOx and SOx in the atmosphere is controlled. Apart from this, agriculture is the mainstay of the Indian economy and hampering of agricultural lands by acid rain will cause a major loss to the nation. Our model will help in resolving all these issues by converting harmful greenhouse gases that affects our health, agriculture and the economy, to non-harmful compounds and also useful compounds.
✔ Scalability-The ability of the innovation to export to the real world and change it. Pragmatism is highly encouraged. Scalability is defined as the ability of a system or a process to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. The utility of our model is manifold. It varies from installing it in a small compartment in an automobile to something as large as the chimney of a thermal power plant. The handiness of our model is derived from the fact that all of the sub-components work independent of each other and hence can be easily detached and replaced. For example, the medium can be replenished at regular intervals by detaching the medium container. Similarly we can replace the reaction chamber and wash out the dead bacteria.
Our project is scalable in various dimensions: Firstly it has load scalability i.e. we can expand and contract our inputs depending on the required output. For example if our project has to be installed in the chimney of a factory or a thermal power plant, where the load of input gases is very high, we can increase the size of our reaction column or increase the flow rate of the medium i.e. scale up our model to perform in proportion to the input load without loss of efficiency. On the other hand, if we intend to use our model to reduce the concentration of NOx and SOx in the exhaust gases of an automobile we can very efficiently scale it down"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#cn_-_-_TEXT.html," research centers about synthetic biology were established with the financial support of central government, including the Systems and Synthetic Biology Research Center in Tianjin University, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology of CAS and the Synthetic Biology and Bioinformatics Center in the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Zhang et al., 2011). Currently there are more than 15 institutes that have projects focused in this field (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). They play a big role in the development of synthetic biology in China.  The Chinese government also focuses on this emerging discipline. The Ministry of Science and Technology had enlisted it as a major research area in its R&D plans in 2010. Also, there was an increasing number of projects related to synthetic biology in the two most important technology development programs, National High-tech Research and Development Project (863 program) and National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 program) (Pei et al., 2011).
When it comes to the general public, they are not aware of synthetic biology.  As a new developing scientific field, synthetic biology is largely known only within academia. Except for a few media exposure to the public, not many information of synthetic biology is available for the general public. The general public is therefore, not familiar with the pros and cons of potentials in synthetic biology, issues in biosafety, biosecurity, and ethics. To avoid doubt and panic among the public, it is necessary to conduct synthetic biology research in collaboration with social scientists to promote the awareness (Pei et al., 2011).
Research, People and Organizations
Synthetic biology has received a lot of attention from academia and many researchers have devoted into this field. Below are some of the leading researchers in this field:
Most institutes are founded and supported by the government. The Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Chinese Academy in Science (CAS) in Shanghai is an example of institutes that first established to use synthetic biology to address issues related to energy, human health and the environment (Zhang et al., 2011). Besides government supported laboratories, individual studies on synthetic biology are carried out in universities throughout China as well.

Sándor Bán
I started my career in 1993 at the Dugonics András Piarist Grammar School, Szeged, where I taught chemistry and biology, both as part of the regular   curriculum and in advanced elective courses as well as special after-school lessons. In 1998–99, I played a leading role in designing and equipping   the science section of the school’s new building. I was also the head of the department of biology and chemistry for four years. Since 2002, I have   taught in the special biology, chemistry and mathematics programs at the Radnóti Miklós Grammar School in Szeged, mostly in small groups. Between   2005 and 2012, I headed the biology department, which developed into the most successful high school biology workshop in the country during that   period, based on advanced Matura examination and competition results. My colleagues and I have also established a state-of-the-art high school molecular   biology laboratory. This facility has been made available to biology teachers from other schools for in-service trainings as well as to students for selection   tests for international biology competitions. My colleagues and I have attended in-service trainings in molecular biology at the EMBL laboratories in   Cambridge, Heidelberg and Monterotondo on a number of occasions. Since 2009, I have been the team leader of the Hungarian national teams at the   International Biology Olympiad (IBO) and mentor to our national teams at the European Union Science Olympiad (EUSO). In 2010, I won the Rátz Lifetime   Achievement Award. I am currently head of the EU-funded high school science laboratory.

I’ve been an associate at the TERMOSZ Laboratory since 2014, I consider it as a prime element in my life. During my high school years I had the   opportunity of assisting at the Cell Biology and Evolutional Micropaleontology Laboratory of the University of Szeged, which helped me start my scientific   work. Throughout my university studies I was co-authoring several English publications, participated in an Indian-Hungarian joint research and for years   I was the technical editor of the Plant Cell Biology and Development (Szeged"

PelBGaussia-101A
The J23100 did not fluoresce red therefore we didn’t extract it through the PCR. We only did colonies found in CelmGaussia-101A (2 colonies) and PelBGaussia-101A (6 colonies). It might be worrisome that we did not have much colonies after ligation but something is there.
For each colony, we suspended in 50µl H20 and added 1µl of the suspension into PCR tube with 9µl MM.
The MM protocol can be found in the other spreadsheet in the folder. We did have 8 samples but since the volume is 9 each, we actually had the volume for 8 PCRs so 4µl * 20 is equal to 8µl*10.
Used the Program: CherylTAQ30s and then put it through the gel extraction.
After gel extraction, will do miniprep (Gel extraction photo in folder).
Prepared minipreps on samples where the backbone was incorporated into Gaussia DNA samples. (CelmGaussia Samples did not work)

1. Characterization of SΔTMD1 quantitatively
We checked the function of SΔTMD1, however, we couldn’t confirm that SΔTMD1can inhibit S gene when SΔTMD1 expresses simultaneously. We think this is because the expression level of SΔTMD1 is too low to inhibit the  activity of S gene in the experiment. By Jamboree, using more strong promoter to express SΔTMD1, we check the function of SΔTMD1, which prevents cell-lysis.
2. Change the point of cell lysis and make lysis cassette more useful device.
We used the inducible promoter to express S gene and measured what the promoter activity leads cell to lyse. Such experiment suggests that there is the threshold for cell lysis caused by lysis cassette. By expressing SΔTMD1, we can make cell lysis at higher expression level, and change the threshold of the cell lysis.
If lysis cassette expressed by promoters which cannot exceed this threshold, cell lysis does not occur.  Expression of SΔTMD1 by constitutive promoter may inhibit the activity of lysis cassette and increase the threshold. Therefore, we can regulate cell lysis by controlling expression level of SΔTMD1. Besides, by characterizing of the relationship between cell lysis and the balance between S gene and SΔTMD1 with RPU, we can control cell lysis easily with promoters characterized by RPU in the partsregistry…. There are many kinds of well- characterized constitutive promoter in the partsregistry.

Experts in the topic of biotechnology were invited from the field of science and industry. The iGEM team from Darmstadt could get Dr. Maurer for the panel discussion, who had worked 25 years for Henkel and became new Director of Business Development of AB Enzymes. Prof. Dingermann from the Goethe University in Frankfurt took part as a scientific representative for the red biotechnology. Prof. Warzecha of the TU Darmstadt was proponent as Instructor of the iGEM team as well as a representative of the green biotechnology. For the ethical and moral issues in the field of biotechnology, the team from Darmstadt got Prof. Nordmann, who deals with the philosophy of Synthetic Biology. At the beginning of the event, Prof. Warzecha conducted a presentation on biotechnology. He gave the audience a short overview of biotechnology and its applications in today's world. He spoke to the fears of the people and tried to clarify them. This was followed by the presentation of the project of the iGEM team by Arne Wehling. Afterwards was a ""get-together"", in which the audience could talk to speaker and members of the iGEM team. The audience had the opportunity to write down questions on flipcharts that should be answered in the upcoming panel discussion. In the subsequent discussion were the issues of the flipcharts discussed with the audience and the experts. The panel was moderated by Henrik Cordes, who also brought in the discussion as a representative of the team. The event officially ended after three hours, but enough guests remained until late in the evening with the experts and students to discuss about the pro and contra of biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. It was a good step of the iGEM team of Darmstadt to organize this interactive panel discussion, as it allowed reaching the people. The event shown young scientist, which concerns prevail in the human and which misinformation need to be clarify.

Firstly, we selected an appropriate annealing temperature to avoid unnecessary amplification as well as improving primer efficiency by normal PCR test in wild type CHO-K1 genomes, the result indicates that 62℃ may be the most appropriate annealing temperature. In addition, we also confirmed that the amplification product was accurate at 62℃ when the target was cells genome that transfected with neomycin-loxp gene by sequencing the PCR product.
Real-time PCR ( here we used TaKaRa-SYBR Premix Ex Taq II(Tli RNaseH Plus) ran in the ABI StepOne Plus qPCR instrument) can be used to calculate the primer efficiency of PCR amplification via Equation 1. In which X_n
= PCR product quantity after n cycles, X_0
= initial copy number, E
= amplification efficiency, n
= cycle number.
X_n=x_0 \times (1+E)^n
Equation 1
The efficiency of the primer is 104% by calculating (Within the usual margin of error, which is 90%~110%). Also, the melt curve has only one peak, which means the designed primer is quite specific to the transfected CHO-K1 cell’s genomic DNA.
2.2 Select the cell colony with single copy number
In each qPCR screening experiment, we made a standard curve by employing a series of 5-fold dilution gradient Neomycin-loxp gene with known mole amount. Therefore, we could quantitatively examined the copy number of neomycin-loxp gene in single colony genomes by fitting the sample Ct data in the standard amplification plot.  Standard curve was made by using the following data.

Testing of arsenic biosensor
Background
Arsenic is a serious groundwater contaminant of major public health significance. During the 1970s, due to a high incidence of waterborne disease, millions of tube wells were drilled in Bangladesh to provide drinking water. Unfortunately, years later, many instances of ill health were found to be associated with consumption of this water, and it became apparent that many of the wells had inadvertently been drilled through arsenic bearing sediments and that the water was contaminated with arsenic in the form of arsenate and arsenite anions. Arsenic is a serious poison, and chronic consumption leads to arsenicosis, with symptoms such as skin lesions and cancers. The WHO limit for arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb, though a more relaxed limit of 50 ppb is still in operation in many countries. Many wells exceed these limits. Similar contaminated groundwater has also been found to occur in many other countries, and one estimate suggests that 100 million people worldwide may be at risk. There is therefore a need for methods for testing and monitoring arsenic levels. Various highly accurate laboratory methods are available, but for large scale use in less developed regions, it would be preferable to have simple and cheap test kits which can be used in the field.
In 2006, Team Edinburgh have developed a genetically engineered machine which was able to detect arsenite/arsenate ions in water samples. They particitaped first time and won first prize in the Best Real World Application category.To see the part (BBa_33203) visit the Registry of Standard Biological Parts here: [1] .
As the South-East of Hungary is highly affected by the arsenic problem (there are wells in which the level of arsenic exceeds the allowed limit), we had the possibility to use real-world samples for testing. The current situation of the arseinc problem in the drinking water of the south east region of Hungary can be found here: [2]
As the Edinburgh team tested the system only on distilled water samples spiked with sodium-arsenate, we contacted the team and offered our help to test the machine on real-world samples to prove that it works not only on artificial but on natural samples as well (with many different compounds that may interfere with the part's action)."

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

A positive and negative control were loaded for PCR reaction, and another positive and negative control were loaded for Cas9.  Gel was run for 60 mins at 90V.
Lanes containing BL21 (1/100), DH5a (1/100) and DH5a (1/1000) showed band weights of ~800bp. These PCR reaction tubes were then incubated for 15 mins at 37°C with the Cas9 and re run on the gel for 60min at 110V. Image of gel showed that both DH5a diluted strains were successfully cut at ~800bp and ~200bp showing that the Cas9 works for the ferrecheletase PCR product.

From these results samples of 7, 12 and 17 were sent off for sequencing.
For 7, 12 and 17 we obtained wild type sequences for ferrochelatase, although no sequence results were sent off for number 1.
Sample 1 was re-amplified a number of times and no ferrochelatase product was detected? This indicates possible detection and is consistent with the accumulation of PPIX in this strain.

Schueller Bettencourt Fondation
was created by Mrs Liliane Schueller Bettencourt and her family, in the memory of her father Eugene Schueller, founder of L’Oréal. It helps to initiate, support and develop projects in the medical, cultural and humanitarian fields.
The foundation is active in the following areas:
• Medical research : The foundation supports the research through two types of actions : the assistance to the researchers and the support for the education (as example the foundation generously supports the FdV-Liliane Bettencourt PhD program).
• Culture : The foundation supports talented artists or craftsmen and attempts to make known or to acknowledge works of great quality, whether from the past or present.
• Social/humanitarian relief : It really important for the Foundation to provide help for associations that are  engaged in social and humanitarian actions. Through these, it contributes to relieve particularly difficult situations and to give new opportunities to children and adults in adversity.

For our next steps, we want to program the widgets to bounce off of another, and eventually try introducing video and text to the screen that can play and display independently.
6/8/2015: Day 6
Today Natalie Kuldell stopped by the lab and led a few discussions about presenting and teaching synthetic biology as well as the complexities and controversies surrounding the topic. It was quite a wonderful experience-- I definitely admire a lot of the work Natalie has done- teaching and developing curriculum at multiple undergraduate institutes, founding BioBuilder Educational Foundation (a non-profit that teaches biology/synthetic biology topics online, making this knowledge widely available and accessible), working as a visiting scientist in labs… she clearly communicated her deep understanding of teaching and interacting with others and the greater implications and questions of synthetic biology.
We began our day with a short presentation by Natalie where she defined the study of synthetic biology and, upon learning that most of the team-members had more of a computer science background than biology background, began introducing these biological concepts as forms of coding.  She also explained the link between biology and engineering by passing out small educational kits comprised of mini-breadboards, wires, batteries, LED lights, and more where we could explore how biology functions to create its own “hardware”.  She then gave us a brief but very interesting lecture on the actual science behind how genes are expressed.  I understand that our exhibit will probably focus on the user being able to “make and tinker” than on the actual science, but it is still helpful for us to better understand what we may eventually represent and display.  I loved hearing Natalie teach-- she is very present and energetic.
We then went on to discuss some of the most famous synthetic biology experiments and previous iGEM submissions such as bacterial photography, E. chromi, Eau that Smell, Colorful World, etc.
Throughout the day, Natalie kept giving tips of what to keep in mind when designing a museum exhibit- such as taking into account the convenience of recovering/restoring materials (both accessibility and in monetary value), considering the attention span of the museum-goers, understandability (e.g. would a facilitator or written instructions be needed?), and how concrete or abstract the concepts that we would eventually teach would be.  Each point was definitely helpful, and something that I had not fully considered at that time.  This"

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we decided to use this as a tool to educate students on the benefits of producing genetically modified crops. Drought resistant crops could be extremely useful in this region if this drought persists.
Our work in Honduras highlighted the need for a vaccine for this disease. Both researchers and regulators validated that this disease will only get worse if we do not do something in the future. They will also provided us with valuable information on how it would be best to deliver this vaccine and of possible regulatory requirements that it would have to fulfill. In addition we were informed of the under-diagnosis disease and that it is actually more prevalent than any statistic would indicate. This was revealed through our interactions with staff in the Alonso Suazo Hospital and with the doctor in Choluteca. When we visited Choluteca, we observed that the cause of the disease is multifactorial. The presence of the sand-fly alone is problematic but the nature of this problem was amplified by factors such as education, hygiene and nutrition. Therefore we felt that for treatment and prevention against leishmaniasis, it should not solely be pharmacological but also should include fostering interest in education, improvement of the water supply to the region and improving the community’s diet.

The platform will make it possible for teachers and students to communicate and help each other across the country, and it is especially smart when the kit is updated, so protocols are up to date.
Competition
DTU’s iGEM team will look through the reports and the best biosensors and submit them to the iGEM BioBrick registry. The best biosensor of the year will receive a prize of 5.000 DKK (750 USD). The students also has a possibility of coming up with ideas for a new biosensor. The best idea will also receive a prize of 5.000 DKK (750 USD).

Testing at Bagsværd Kostskole
The biosensors have been tested at our BioBrick Tutorial and have gone through a couple of changes, but of many tests make a good product. We went to a local high school to do the second test. The test went well and showed that the exercise works! The high schoolers came with feedback on what they liked and what they thought could be improved. They were thrilled that they could pick the genes they wanted to combine themselves. Figure 6 and 7 are from the testing day.
The kits are expected to be ready to be shipped in December. Feedback from the test at Bagsværd Kostskole needs to be implemented and the parts need to be amplified. We hope that the next generation of DTU BioBuilders will continue to develop the project and add new parts as time passes.

Brixells: Achieving Spatial Organisation of Cells
Our aim is to develop a technique which allows precision control over the positioning of cells in space.
Our goal can be broken down into two main steps:
1. Developing a method that enables cells to bind to a specific area.
2.        Creating a target to which the cells can attach.
By modifying cells to express (and display) zinc finger proteins on their surface, we can engineer cells that have the ability to recognise and bind to specific sequences of double stranded DNA. The arrangement of these DNA strands can then allow the cells to be positioned in the desired area.
What we did:
Zinc finger proteins are intracellular molecules that recognise (and bind) unique strands of double stranded DNA. We expressed these zinc fingers on the surface of our cell by attaching them to transmembrane proteins.
Using 4 different zinc fingers and anchor proteins, we planned to optimise the system by finding the best combinations of zinc fingers to anchor proteins.
By using immunofluorescence microscopy we were able to test the 2 main steps to achieving our goal. We looked at whether our anchor proteins were being expressed, as well as the binding between our zinc fingers and their unique binding domains.

Tübingen
Back in April, after receiving the designation kit from the iGEM HQ, we found out that we would need a couple of plasmids which have not been available at the iGEM HQ. So we contacted the Tübinger iGEM members from 2015 for a collaboration after exploring that they had what we needed.
This collaboration was about giving us 5 different yeast shuttle-vectors (pTum100, pTum104, pRS314, pRS315, pRS316), which were either used or produced by iGEM Tübingen 2015. We used these plasmids to test our construct consisting of the blue light switch and the red light switch in yeast.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to test our whole construct in yeast cells, but a part of the red lightswitch Bba_K1936002 .
Without these plasmids we would have had to produce the shuttle vectors ourselves, but luckily they still had glycerol stocks from last year and were so kind to share these with us.
European experience in Paris
On July the 2nd to July the 3rd 2016 we attended the European Experience iGEM meetup in Paris. Together with 29 other teams we listened to lectures of iGEM founder Randy Rettberg and other renowned scientists.
Randy Rettberg’s lecture was especially inspiring. He told us why iGEM was founded in the first place and what vision he had for the future. Every attending iGEM team had their own information stand and the opportunity to explain their projects to all other teams.
We learned new lab techniques and discussed problems and solutions of our and their projects. This was very helpful for making connections to other teams working in similar fields of synthetic biology as we do.
This initiated collaborations with other teams using optogenetics. We also got to know Victor Plet from iGEM-Team Ionis, who visited us for a few days in Germany too.
Our team had a lot of fun at parties and activities organized by the iGEM Teams from Paris.

research
Week 1-2:
“...[Scientists are] embracing a wider vision of nature managed for a wider array of goals. Instead of focusing on the past, they are looking to the future and asking themselves what they’d like it to look like.”
Because we are outside of the field of synthetic biology we began by immersing ourselves in it, reading: Rambunctious Garden: Saving Nature is a Post Wild World, J. Craig Venter Institute's Press Release “First Self-Replicating Synthetic Bacterial Cell,” Oron Catts and Gary Cass's “Labs Shut Open: A Biotech Hands-on Workshop for Artists” to name a few. This helped us gain a better understanding of the emerging research and conversations within synthetic biology. Generally everything we read blew our minds, everything was interesting! So this was really our research challenge as designers, where or what can we most effectively contribute to the field? What conversation can we offer another perspective to? Thank you Christina Agapakis and Ben Hooker for sources.
brainstorming
Week 3-5:
The team collaborated through a series of brainstorming sessions. Each person discussed their research. Through a series of white boarding sessions we developed a set of categories or groupings that helped identify where our research and interests overlapped:
Culture Reserves / Modeling Life:
human mediation in nature
the managed wilderness, perpetual weeding, perpetual watching
generating divergent ecosystems by accident - animals migrate
conservation, restoration - we recreate it ourselves
site specific
what is from scratch?
Ecosystem Design / Rewiliding & De-Extinction:
diversity occurs in unfamiliar places
extremophiles
“sanctuaries”,designing new ecosystems
the food chain
lack of predators
introduced animals are fenced in
Evolution / Time & Scale:
a slow learning process, we wish we could speed it up
compete, react, evolve, migrate and form new
a balance of life and death
human time vs microbial time
what are times for simulation, slow vs fast, the sims
lab scale vs life scale
evolution and repercussions

Before me, my happiness in tremulous agar
Oh how I've transformed my cells, and how they've transformed me!
Plasmids taken up, and with them my heart
I reach out, drawn to them, attraction inescapable
Sweet contact, pure bliss, prokarya and eukarya unified as one
Softly, I wipe away the tears of joy, of science realised

From the restriction mapping, it appears that the use of BBa_I0500 in constructing the AraC-pBad device do not yield the expected device due to self-ligation. The use of BBa_I13458 seems to produce fragments with the correct size, even though the size similarity between the backbone and insert (approx. 2000 bp) prevent us from seeing the cut part. Because the pC+AraC+pBad+GFPc (BBa_I13458_I13453_E0240) and the pC+AraC+pBad+RFPc (BBa_I13458_I13453_J23101) seem to produce the correct DNA fragments, I decided to proceed with induction using them.

A new method was then used to induce these AraC-pBad devices by having the overnight cultures dilute 200-fold into 1 mL solution. I also added various arabinose concentrations: 2.5 uM, 10 uM, 100 uM, 1 mM, and 5 mM. It was expected that overnight"

It’s win number two for the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time” -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In addition to winning $10,000 in the SouthVenture Business Plan Competition in March, the group recently took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region.
They received another $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect -- An Alberta centre for New Commerce -- a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge -- plus a host of other in-kind prizes including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
“I am extremely proud of the Synbiologica group for their achievements and wish them continued success,” said Dr. Dan Weeks, the U of L’s Vice-President (Research).
“The U of L is a comprehensive research institution that offers significant research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. This approach is important as it equips our graduates with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.”
The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the"
