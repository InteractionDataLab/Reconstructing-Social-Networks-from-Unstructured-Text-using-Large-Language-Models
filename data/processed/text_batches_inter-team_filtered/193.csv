TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," generated for each switch and is positioned right upstream of the target site. In principle the recognition can be any random sequence as long as it remains unique within the molecular network.
Summing up, the recognition site allows a specific interaction between switches and transmitter molecules. Once this interaction is formed, an interaction between the transmitter and the target will actually switch the state of the terminator. This allows the specific arrangement and interconnection of numerous of these switches by transmitter molecules, without changing the target site. Comparable to wires connecting many identical transistors, our target site remains the same.
Transmitter RNA´s
As desccribed above, transmitter RNAs are the input and output of bioLOGICS switches (compare How to connect BioBricks ). These transmitters are short ssRNA molecules representing the ""trigger"" to shift switches between the ""on"" and ""off"" state. To fulfill this role, they need to posses the following properties:
A transmitter may only interact with certain switches. That is, a transmitter has to find the corresponding  recognition site of a switch.
Once an interaction is established between a transmitter and a switch, a transmitter has to be capable of changing the secondary structure of a terminator and thus cause antitermination.
Again, these two properties are fulfilled by two components of the transmitter:
Identity site
This site is capable of forcing an interaction between the transmitter and the switch. Therefore it is complementary to the recognition site of this switch. As the recognition site is unique within a network, so is the identity site. However, the single identity site is not capable of changing the state of the switch. That is were the trigger site comes into play.
Trigger site
Once an interaction is created by the identity site, the trigger site is capable of actually shifting the switch since it is complementary to the target site of the switch. To fulfill this role, it is placed upstream at the 5' end of the identity site. As the target site is the same for all switches, the trigger site is the same for all signals. Therefore it is important, that similar to the identity site, a trigger site cannot function on its own. That is, a single trigger site cannot shift the state of a switch without the help of an identity site.
Summing up, we applied the principle introduced for the switches to the transmitter molecules. In contrast to previous approaches on this field [12] , we introduced the described synthetic trigger site in such a manner that it is not able to change the state of the terminator on its own, but only in combination with the identity site. So the challenge is to arrange and optimize these elementary building"

Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

Our gold and integrated practices were two large components of our project this year as we took into consideration what our user groups needed and how we could ensure we were providing a safe tool. Based on our conversations with educators and members of the DIY biology community, we decided to focus on education as an application of our cell-free system. To ensure our system would be safe and available for people to use around the world, we explored the regulations surrounding synthetic biology and cell-free systems. We also discovered a potential dual-use of our system and came up with a solution to this using software .
Education Kit
Taking into account the suggestions we received from the interviews we conducted with educators, we have developed a simple experiment that aligns with the Alberta Biology 30 curriculum [1]. Members of the University of Lethbridge iGEM community have previously looked at how the principles of iGEM aligns with the Alberta curriculum [2]. Derek Masterman, a high school teacher, suggested we use physical indicators to ensure students understand that the processes are separate. To validate the occurrence of transcription, the fluorescence capability of the RNA Mango aptamer was employed. Translation is confirmed based upon the chemical reaction between salicylic acid and the protein BMST1 (Paris Bettencourt 2014  BBa_K1403009 ) to produce a wintergreen scent.
During the development of this experiment, we received feedback from students on the Lethbridge High School iGEM Team (pictured below), Keith Aiken  (an education student and member of the Lethbridge iGEM team), and Patrick Shackleford (a biology teacher from Winston Churchill High School). The high school students suggested the inclusion of figure captions to avoid student confusion. Keith sent us the current Alberta curriculum guidelines for us to base our learning objectives off of. Our modules were sent to Patrick and he confirmed that they are aligned with what is currently taught as part of the Biology curriculum (pictured below).
In addition to the transcription and translation protocol, we also developed a biosafety module. We designed this module in response to conversations with the Public Health Agency of Canada . They recommended that students need to understand how to interact with microorganisms at an early age to"
Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," protect all the bees and larvae from the inside out. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produces the miticide oxalic acid in the midgut of any bee that ingests it. Our construct will include the Petal Death Protein (PDP). This protein aids in the conversion of oxaloacetate, a natural product of the Kreb’s cycle, into oxalic acid.  Oxalic acid is an optimal weapon against the mites as the concentration needed to kill a mite is 70 times less lethal to the bee. The acid is already being used in syrup and spray solutions.
In order to apply this construct to the hives, we plan to use nurse bees to feed a mixture of E.coli and sucrose to the young bees. In the midgut the E.coli will produce low concentrations of oxalic acid that are lethal to only the mite, and that will diffuse into the hemolymph of the bee. This will cause the Varroa destructor to die if it sucks the bee’s hemolymph.
Our construct is  more effective than current methods used, as it allows us to tackle the issue at an earlier stage, when the bee has not hatched from the uncapped brood. It also targets the mite more directly than other spray-on insecticides. With this project, we will take one step closer to combatting Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the devastating issue of decreasing global bee population, by improving the method of killing one of the main culprits of CCD: the Varroa destructor mite.
Description The purpose of hospitals is to help people get better. However, in the United States, 2 million people are infected during their hospital stay and bacterial biofilms are responsible of 65% ( Sydnor, E., & Perl, T. (2011, January 24). Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control in Acute-Care Settings. Retrieved September 18, 2015, from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021207/)    of all hospital acquired infections. A biofilm is a conglomeration of bacteria that is enclosed in a matrix of sugars and extracellular DNA, this helps to hold the bacteria together like a community. Biofilms can adhere to any surface and are commonly found in nature. However, biofilms can become problematic when they adhere to surgical tools such as catheters, endotracheal tubes, and scalpels. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms include antibiotics and biocides. These methods are often expensive, harsh, and ineffective"

Figure 3: Results of the Berkeley 2006 iGEM Team .
On day 1, the main goal in the morning lab was to make a ligation reaction ready for transformation on day 2. The backbone (pSB1C3 based) had to be cut with SpeI & PstI which linearised the vector backbone by cutting into the suffix(as highlighted in Figures 1 & Figures 2). The insert dervived from pSB1A2 by a double restriction digest using XbaI & PstI. In order to verify reactions had worked, each of the double digests were ran on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel (100 V for 1 hr), visualised by ethidium bromide staining and visualising bands using a U.V. light source.
After reaction verification, a ligation was performed by using ~75 ng of insert to 25 ng of vector. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 minutes and the heat killed at 80°C for 20 mins. Reactions were stored at 4°C overnight for transformation.
Meet & Greets
All team members were invited to the anatomy building of UCL to meet each other. After a brief 30 minutes of introductions, A skype talk was held with Randy Rettberg (the president of the iGEM foundation). The talk consisted of Randy Rettbergs general background, interest in synthetic biology & the origins of the iGEM competition. A Q & A session was held after the talk.
A previous iGEM team member (UCL 2014, Georgia Bondy) held an interactive talk on the division of labour within groups. Emphasis was placed on the need for team members to take responsibility for one aspect of the project. The ""babies"" had to be nurtured by the team member who chooses to be responsible for each task.
Tuesday 16th June
Morning Lab
On tuesday morning, groups were divided into sub-groups with the different subgroups using different methods in transformation. For electroporation, the ligation reaction had to be de-salted prior to electroporation. The chemical transformation protocol did not require this step and 2 μL of ligation reaction was pipetted straight into the compotent cells. E. coli cells were out grown in SOC media for 1 hour before plating on LB media containing chloramphenicol (20"
Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#DougNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," talks to java, java does not talk to java FX? (Richard can comment on this)
I have sent Richard and Joanna my old project which used Visual Library. Hopefully they will be able to salvage something from this. I know JCA really wants us to use Java FX. I personally want something easy to use and something we can build on.
We also have our group meeting. Lesia and Adam showed off their version first version of BOL. They have started a white paper and have example syntax started. Overall a really good start.
The rest of the day I spent revising the SDS algorithm code so that we can calculate the cost of a final assembly independent of the cost metrics used to build the assembly graph (which could be corrupt when we break cycles to perform valid 2ab coloring). I also fixed a bug that Nina found while playing around with Clotho.
Densmore 22:56, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
Today was a good meeting between myself, Evan, and Bing regarding the new Clotho Core. This is going to be much more robust and will be a much better way of doing things as compared to the first approach. I expect Bing and Evan to have an illustration soon that shows what we are going to do. This is key so that we can all get on the same page.
Also today I met with Nina and Bing about the robot automation. This project is the one project which I have the least grasp of since the details of the protocol are key. Nina believes she will have a first pass done by Friday. That would be a good timeline since the wet team is just getting their oligos back this week. Hopefully we can get this tested out while the wet team is trying to build things (as opposed to having to make up our own test and running them).
Another development has been the release of Clotho Beta build 6/15/09. This is the first build that has a truly working SDS algorithm. I spent TOO MUCH TIME fixing this but I am proud that it now works. Josh has given me some good feedback on ways that it is still lacking (primarily in how it formats output for the users). I can fix most of these issues quickly. My goal is still to get the JBE paper out before the end of the month. We will see. The only thing really holding it up is a concerted effort on the part of myself and the other authors. The code is 95% done.
Finally here are some random thoughts:

As a result, a group of experiments from module 2 was changed to use GFP as an indicator of successful communication between IODs. The use of color indication in the further research proved advantageous (at least partially), and the use of color indicators will always be considered in later experiments.
A recommendation was made to test the agglutination on a slide. As a result, since we had the possibility to perform our experiments in microfluidics, we listened to this advice and used microfluidics as well as microscope slides in our agglutination experiments.

Multinational general public vs. biologists GMO survey
Team Chalmers Gothenburg offered us to participate in their GMO survey. We asked 63 biologists and 50 respondents from the general public to fill in the survey. Same thing was done in Sweden. Thanks to this, we had the opportunity to compare GMO knowledge in Sweden and Czech Republic. Big thanks belongs to the team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of all data.
Key outputs
The positive attitude and further interest of many respondents delighted us.
However, although anticipated, the difference in opinions between biologists and the general public is disturbing. On that account, we are going to arrange more lectures about synthetic biology at our university and also for the general public in Czech Republic.
Read more about the survey...
Safety
We did not only wholeheartedly followed standard lab safety techniques and complied with the national GMO laboratory regulations but also considered the broader safety assumptions of our technology. We discussed our idea with non-biological specialists as well as experts, which enabled us to improve the design and get a better grasp of the notion our project idea transmits.

Autoinduction
Overview
The CRP glucose repressible promoter  triggers the encapuslation phase.
When levels of glucose in the medium are high, cAMP levels are low and encapsulation is repressed
When the levels of glucose in the medium are low, cAMP levels are high and encapsulation is induced.
Diauxic growth
Starting the encapsulation and maintaining expression of colanic acid requires energy in the form of carbon sources. Bacteria use up a primary source to grow and trigger encapsulation. Glucose here is the primary source, which in unison with cAMP, is responsible for switching on the CRP promoter and the encapsulation process.A secondary carbon source is also needed to maintain the system once glucose is used up. This phenomenon of switching from a primary source to a secondary source is known as a diauxie.
This switching process occurs automatically, hence we have called it ""autoinduction"".
  About diauxic growth
Comparison with IPTG induction
Conventional induction relies on adding small amounts of IPTG into a cell culture. Autoinduction media instead rely on culture conditions for induction. When glucose levels are low due to cellular consumption, the CRP promoter in cells is activated, and induction occurs automatically.  Compared to IPTG, current methods of autoinduction allow for higher density without the need to monitor cell growth [1].
For the autoinduction media, it may include one or more carbon sources selected from the group consisting of glucose, lactose, glycerol, rhamnose, arabinose, succinate, fumarate, malate, citrate, acetate, maltose and sorbitol. The secondary carbon source involves the import and consumption of lactose and glycerol [2].
Relevance to our project
We are not using autoinduction for ensuring high protein density as it was originally intended to.  Instead, we are using autoinduction for ensuring a time delay before encapsulation occurred( Glucose time delay assay ). Therefore, we not only have a simplistic cell growth model to take into account.  Instead, we will also have to take note of"

BBa_K1886007
Device
AND GATE-input
This is the input part of AND GATE. After being induced by IPTG, plac promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase which contains two  amber mutations (T7 ptag) . After being induced by L-arabinose, pBAD promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, only when the two inputs exist together, T7 RNA polymerase can be expressed, and then T7 promoter can be activated to express the downstream gene.
BBa_K1886008
Device
AND GATE-output-1
This is a report system to test the AND GATE made up of SupD tRNA coding gene and T7 polymerase with two amber mutations. T7 promoter is a very specific promoter which is transcribed only by specific T7 RNA polymerase. Following the PT7 promoter is the reporter gene GFP, Only when the two inputs are given, the GFP gene can be expressed.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota_-_-_TEXT.html,"::gfp negative control (118.9μM ± 1.1). These results are in line with those seen by the Keasling lab. Following sulfide measurements, cadmium chloride was added (200 μM), and cells were allowed to incubate without shaking at 37C overnight. Cells were pelleted to look for a color change indicating precipitation of CdS.  Cell pellets for K12 expressing phsABS were yellow/brown indicating precipitation of CdS while the vector control cells (pBBRBB::gfp) remained white.
Heavy Metal Bioprecipitation Results (II)
A second set of experiments was also conducted with pBBRBB:phsABC K12, pBBRBB::GFP K12, and an abiotic control grown in heavy metal tryptone medium, 3mM NaS2O3tubes, and 2.5mM Fe(II)Cl2. Since the phsABC gene is responsible reducing thiosulfate, NaS2O3 would be converted to H2S, which will further react with Fe(II)Cl2 to produce FeS, a black precipitate. After a 24 hour incubation period, the cell cultures appeared as displayed. The pBBRBB:phsABC K12 cells were the only ones seen to produce FeS, the black precipitate seen in the figure, confirming the role of the phsABC gene in reducing thiosulfate. To affirm that this reaction is also successful under non-enclosed systems, the same sets of samples were also tested on 0.2% plates containing 3mM NaS2O3tubes and 2.5mM Fe(II)Cl2. The results after 24 hours of incubation were similar to the experiments conducted in test tubes
Encapsulation

The main goal of EncapsuLab was to design a system to physically separate our living bacteria from the outside environment as well as to preserve and protect the bacteria inside our system. This was essential that the bacteria survive the process we subjected them to in order to be able to actively remediate mercury over time. To achieve this, we created a water-porous silica matrix using techniques developed by the Aksan and Wackett labs at the U of M. Furthermore, we developed a device to house the encapsulated bacteria for application in real world water-cleaning system. In addition to this, we conceptualized a scaling-up of our system for larger water-cleaning problems. Lastly, we developed a mathematical"

iGEM IONIS
That's the slogan under which iGEM IONIS promoters their video project. And that's exactly what they did. Several other iGEM teams have successfully produced a short video clip in which they sum up their project in about one minute. Those videos are a great way of getting to know the basic information about other projects, so you can get to know more teams faster. Like various others we have also produced such a video.

Supporting iGEM Team Aix-Marseille
""Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific engines are used but they are heavy and expensive. [...] Regarding these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally- responsible way to sanitize our streets.""
iGEM Team Aix-Marseille
In order to archieve this goal, iGEM Team Aix-Marseille designed an assay in which they combine three enzymes: a laccase, a lipoxygenase or latex clearing protein (LCP) and a cytochrome C. The purified product will then degrade synthetics polymers found in the chewing gum.
In order to evaluate the impat of their work, the team created a survey in which the participants were questioned about their knowledge about chewinggum, GMOs and many more. We took half a day off so we could support them with further data coming from the streets of Heidelberg."

Once we had our Gibson assemblies we transformed them into chemically competent E. Coli and then plated them at a 1:4 dilution on LB+chlor plates
●
These plates were placed into the 37 °C incubator overnight and we hope to see growth tomorrow on the plates
●
The plates from the previous transformation continued to grow colonies but we believe these colonies were contamination because they were a different almost pink color but not the color the colonies were supposed to be on each plate

Checked the plates from the transformation yesterday and there was no growth seen on them.

Because we are not seeing any growth on the plates there may be an issue with the Gibson reaction itself or the transformation. We realized we needed to gel extract our chromoprotein instead of doing just a PCR clean up because our primers are not necessarily"

Did PCR for the anderson promoter from the diluted J23100 plasmid template. Annealing at 64 degrees and elongation for 8 seconds, 30 cycles. The only visible bands in the gel are the primer dimers
Did PCR for the Chlor and Kan backbone using the the same primers but different templates. Tried 10 cycles at 62 degrees celcius then increased to 68 degrees celcius for 25 cycles. Elongation at 1 minute 5 seconds. Left in the cycler overnight (4 degrees)
Did another round of PCR for the double terminators. Left in PCR machine upstairs with a greater concentration of primers (1/10, rather than 1/20). still 65 degrees and 10 seconds elongation.
From now out, based on this Gibson Assembly guide , we'll be doing agarose-gel/staining/UV light on 4-5 uL of the 20uL PCR product. If the results are positive for the desired DNA, we can purify that PCR result using the PCR clean-up kit. This has a higher yield than the gel purificaiton (and is easier). We also won't have to worry about the UV light causing mutations in our fragments
Gibson_test-scale_PCRs.jpg
If the PCRs continue to fail, we can start trying the multi-PCR approach of the guide (linked above). It's approach is outlined in the table above. Attempts PCR at two temperatures 3 degrees apart and with different concentratiosn of DMSO. DMSO promoters denaturing. Also improves amplification of GC rich reasons by structual changes that are caused by DMSO binding to cytosine residues

Let ${\displaystyle M=\underset{n\in\mathbb{N}}{\sup}\max(1,\underset{x\in Supp(\phi_n)}\sup f(x))}$. And the Heine theorem assure that $M$ is finit. Actually, $f$ is continue on the compact $Supp(\phi_n)$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ so is bound on it. By passing to the limit, we find \[ {\displaystyle |~a(u,v)~|\leqslant (1+M)||u||_{\mathcal{H}^1_0}||\phi_n||_{\mathcal{H}^1_0}} \] which is what we were searching for.
$a$ is coercive :
With a simular calculation, we show that $a$ is coercive, i.e. that it exists a constant $\alpha$ in such a way that \[ \forall u \in \mathcal{H}^1_0(\mathbb{R}^2), \quad |a(u,u)| \geqslant \alpha ||u||^2 \]
So, according to the Lax-Milgram theorem \[ \exists ! G\in\mathcal{H}^1_0,\quad\forall\phi\in\mathcal{H}^1_0,\quad a(G,\phi)=0 \] In other words, it means that, in the space of distributions, if we can exhibit a solution, it is the only solution of this problem. And the solution exists. If the solution we find is sufficiently regular (in a way to define more precisely), general theorems assure that the solution we find is not only a solution in the space of distributions but is also a solution in ""the real life"".
Precisely, we can verify with a computation that, if $\lambda\neq\mu$ \[ \gamma(z,t)~:=~\left(\frac{\mu(1-z)-(\mu-\lambda z)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}{\lambda(1-z)-(\mu-\lambda z)e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}\right)^{N_0} \] is solution to the equation, i.e. that \[ \forall(z,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2, \partial t\gamma(z,t)+f(z,t)\partial z\"

For housing applications, it is important that our mycelia has adequate structural integrity - we have begun to address this concern via materials testing. For filtration, one risk is that the mycelia will somehow contaminate the actual water being run through it - and one way we are addressing this concern is by killing the mycelia before using it to filter water. For off-earth applications, it is also important for our bacteria/mycelia to not contaminate the planet. Based on discussions we had with NASA's planetary protection officer, we have incorporated additional precautions against interplanetary contamination (including killing bacteria/mycelia via extreme heat, and only growing mycelia within plastic shells to limit exposure to the planetary environment). Thanks to our multiple post-doctoral advisers with many years of synthetic biology lab and safety experience, our primary investigator, and government-mandated inspectors from NASA for ensuring careful training and vigilant maintenance of safety standards."

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetox_-_-_TEXT.html," will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and we can determine from absorbance measurements whether the HMF pathway is functioning.  We will sequence the genomes of non-functioning strains and identify which genes were turned off via dCas9 knockdown.
The 19 target genes in P. putida were identified through manual genome comparison with the help of graduate student Iman Farasat.  These are genes that are likely involved in furfural catabolism and are present in P. putida but not present in E. coli.  Many of these genes encode cofactors, chaperone proteins, ATPases, and several other possible transport proteins.  Our hypothesis is that a key oxidoreductase in the HMF pathway requires a molybdenum-containing cofactor, which is produced by a separate pathway and inserted with a chaperone protein.   Manual comparison of genomes is time consuming, and another objective of our research is to develop a program that can optimize genome comparison. This program would employ “BLAST”, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, to identify homologs between species and potential target genes that are contained in one genome but not another.  Optimizing genome comparison would allow industrial and academic researchers to identify the likely missing genes in any pathway.
The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli.  This is a late-stage goal, providing the missing ingredients of the HMF pathway are identified.  But if this objective is completed, it could be one step closer to sustainable fuels produced by bacteria.
Our Objectives
1) Validate the gene knockdown strategy using dCas9
This is our first objective.  Once we insert the dCas9 system, HMF pathway, and RFP cassette into the P. putida genome, we will use a crRNA targeting RFP to attempt to knockdown RFP expression. If we see white colonies, we will know that transcription of the RFP gene is blocked and the system works.
2) Validate the functioning of the HMF pathway
Along with our first objective, we will concurrently evaluate the functioning of the HMF pathway inserted into the P. putida genome using a 2-furoic acid assay. We will inoculate LB broth with P. putida colonies that have grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil and add 3 g/L 2-furoic acid. Colonies that show growth and consumption of"

This is mostly for the discussion: if we’re contributing a mutant to the Registry, it would be nice if we could find a use for it in other areas. After all, there has to be a greater sexiness factor to this lowly mimic of a dephosphorylated protein.
I went on to Google Scholar and clicked the list of papers that cited Freeman and Bassler 1999 (A genetic analysis of LuxO…), and looked at where it has been used in other studies. D47A was a little harder to find, but lots of people use D47E, so I think that it’s reasonable to propose a synthetic biology project where the two are used in conjunction in different contexts
A study where LuxO D47A is used to eliminate density-dependent Lux expression in Vibrio cholerae (“Parallel quorum sensing systems converge to regulate virulence in Vibrio cholerae”), as well as the contents described in “Quorum sensing controls biofilm formation” have potential. I have saved both of the papers. With the former, we have developed biobricks for E. coli, but we can always change our chassis and biobrick a similar system in V. cholerae. Unlike the system in nature, we can tweak different modules and genes as we see fit, using the mutants to help validate our testing process. The latter only brings up D47E to mimic the high cell-density state, so it will be harder to tie that in. I’m not sure if it’ll be too far-fetched to suggest that you still need D47A to validate a reporter circuit, if only to establish a negative control.
2. Versatility of AI-2 signalling
So I was hasty last week and didn’t bother to really read the paper that I thought had an estimate of how prevalent AI-2 signalling is among bacteria (50% of bacterial species, according to the business plan). Imagine my surprise when I didn’t find that statistic when I verified my citation today. Accordingly, I sought to find a way to justify why we’re even bothering to implement AI-2 in the first place. This is mostly for the introduction
First, I found a paper that discusses how AHL is limited to gram-negative bacteria (“Interspecies communication in bacteria”). Next,"

Equipment Sharing
As this year a 96-well plate is required for parts shipment while the lyophilizer in WHU-China team and HZAU-China team was not working, they ask us for assistance on the lyophilization of samples before shipment. In order to share experimental resources and promote work efficiency, we undertook the job to help them submiting all the samples.
Help from HZAU
We met difficulties when amplifying the reporter BBa_E0040 because of certain unknown factors. Considering the limited time, we turned to HZAU-China iGEM team for help. Finally, with the construction of RBS+GFP-pSB1C3 plasmid generously offered from HZAU, they succeeded inserting the reporter gene GFP with RBS respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
Others
Apart from these collaborations, we also tried to make collaborations away from Wuhan region. For example: We had planned to utilize a device NZAU designed as a fluorescence detector to achieve a part of our characterization work and help them test the accuracy of the device. But it was a pity that we did not achieve the cooperation this year, because we didn’t finish this corresponding reporter plasmid in time. And we also offered some reasonable advise to ZJU team on safety problems of their project, provided the ideas of kill switch in our previous project. But finally after deep considerations, for the reason of not suiting their project, they adopted another kill switch.
Conclusion
All in all, we have achieved several successful collaborations this summer. In the future, we aim at expanding the collaboration region and diversifying the cooperation content, such as helping high school teams with their project."

The Real Thing
How it works
Building the L.A.S.S.O.
How it works
In the process of building the L.A.S.S.O. we optimized our circuitry in subtle ways to improve the photodetector’s sensitivity and reduce noise as much as possible. This was done in order for the readings of the samples to be as accurate as possible.
Since the first iterations of the biological devices use GFP and mCherry as outputs, we attempted to create a detector that would pick up fluorescence from these proteins. However, fluorescent proteins need to be excited in order to emit light which adds an extra degree of complexity. Therefore we considered a reporter whose nature eliminated the excitation step. Thus, we decided to work with luciferase, a bioluminescent enzyme, feeding back to the biological team that ultimately the biological devices would require luciferase as an output of signal detection. This meant that the step of excitation was removed and we would not have any issues related to filtering the excited fluorescence. Although light interference could be dealt with in our L.A.S.S.O., we also felt that this was the more reliable route to take in terms of our circuitry when building the remote monitoring sensor. Less components would also ensure that the L.A.S.S.O. could be kept less expensive and that the size could remain more compact.
Our final circuit uses an extremely sensitive photodiode. The diode has a peak sensitivity at 580 nm however it spans"

Background
The plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, expresses a unique outer membrane surface protein which is used by the pathogen to promote ice formation (Orser et al., 1985) (Wolber et al., 1986) (Deininger et al., 1988). This protein, called an ice nucleation protein (INP), has been taken advantage of by various researchers as a cell surface display model when fused with a florescent protein such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (Lindow et al., 1989). An alarming aspect of this protein in regards to practical research applications is its size at. In Li et. Al (2004) (Li et al., 2004) (Gurian-Sherman and Lindow, 1993) (, a truncated INP with its C-terminal and internal repeats removed (INP-N) was fused with GFP and showed improved rates of outer membrane localization compared to full length proteins (~1400 amino acids) or ones with simply the internal repeats removed (INP-NC) (Li et al., 2004).  In 2011, Edinburgh took the approach of using an INP-NC protein within the iGEM registry (BBa_K265008) and fusing it to YFP in constructing a cell surface display.
Our Approach
Our project this year was concerned with developing a novel bactericide for gram negative bacteria. Since our bactericide would be used to lyse the peptidoglycan layer of these pathogens from the external environment (Kadurugamuwa and Beveridge, 1996), we needed to develop an assay to examine the efficacy of outer membrane (OM) permeabilization techniques which would be coupled with our bactericide. We chose to develop an assay using an outer membrane florescent cell surface detection method with the theory that any OM which was permabilized would pellet"

Software tools for iGEMers : BioBrick/Project Search & Tutorials
We developed new search and educational tools to assist iGEM teams. For many teams, the majority of team members are new-comers. Our primary goal therefore is to aid these beginners get used to iGEM earlier to make project initiation swift.  All of our tools are web-based and have user-friendly interfaces enabling users to gain quick access to needed information.  Our project consists of the following four tools.
“BioBrick Search” improves convenience in searching BioBrick parts by a sophisticated interface and an ordering algorithm taking into acount the parts' frequency of use. With “Past Project Search” , you can run a keyword search for all past projects and access past teams' presentation material easily. “BioBrick Puzzle” and “Gene Network Game” are educational games intended for beginners to acquire knowledge about BioBricks and gene networks, which aides them to plan their projects and conduct experiments.

SVCE_CHENNAI,2017,Team:SVCE CHENNAI#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," use a ML approach to get a first guess about a sequence’s function)’ – Team Heidelberg 2017.
All teams generally agreed there has been a significant amount of data available in the registry now that some rudimentary machine learning algorithms can be applied it.
However they also asserted that they would only use it if the models correlated really well with the experimental data.
They believe that if a really useful tool exists then the registry could possible list it so that teams can use it more easily.
However they believe that if a team has a built a tool with predictive capabilities then they will not use it as the final node of inference and would still carry out biological experiments.
Hence, it can be concluded that teams are looking forward and are already applying machine learning to data in the registry and are very welcoming towards it. However, they consider that Machine learning like modelling can only aid teams with their experimental results and not be used as a sole method to understand the function or characterize the part.
Engineering the pH riboswitch to have a BioBrick scar
We observed that the wild type pH riboswitch had a 4 bp scar that was different from the 6 bp biobrick scar. While teams have generally dealt with a different scar by simply replacing it with the biobrick one and making appropriate changes that base pairing was observed to preserve the RNA secondary structure. To make it compatible with the biobrick standard, we had an additional contingency in that the number of base pairs were different for the two scars. While we tried engineering the riboswitch to have the biobrick scar site , we failed in engineering them to have the same secondary structure and gibbs free energy as the natural wild type riboswitch.
We then reached out to multiple professors who have worked with pH regulatory elements and explained our project and our problem with engineering the pH riboswitch to accommodate the BioBrick scar.
Prof. Gal Nechooshtan at the Cold Spring Harbor lab provided us with critical knowledge on how mutations affect the pH riboswitch and how we can accommodate a scar site that’s different in size to the natural one by following certain rules pertaining to RNA secondary structure design principle. He also provided us with appropriate resources for us to read so that we learnt how to engineer the riboswitch to have the biobrick scar and still contained the same secondary structure and Gibbs free energy.

This barcoded sequencing adapter is picked up by the Tn5-dxCas9 fusion protein and integrated into the target DNA of a specific athlete. When the DNA is sequenced by pore sequencing, the barcode is readable in the sequencing output and is used to assign the DNA directly to the corresponding athlete (figure 1).

Figure 1. Multiplexing of samples in Targeted Next Generation Sequencing by using barcodes.
Every athlete needs the personal DNA embedded barcode. The minimal barcode length we need to generate a unique barcode for every person on Earth is 17 nucleotides as 417 is more than twice the world population. Implementing this 17 nucleotide barcode will be sufficient to mark samples of multiple athletes and multiplex in one sequencing run.
However, characterization by personal identification barcodes, for example name, date of birth, sports etc, rather than a unique identifier requires extensive barcoding. The barcode sequence should be extended due to the fact that 4 nucleotides cannot cover the whole alphabet, numbers and other characters. Therefore, we assigned sets of three nucleotides to a specific letter, number or other character (such as a dot (.), comma (,), semicolon (;) etc.). Converting the characters of the barcode into DNA allows labelling of the targeted DNA to be sequenced. Converting the DNA strand back into the athlete details after sequencing allows multiplexing of many athlete's samples.
Translating an athlete specific barcode into DNA is performed by extending the iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 to include more characters. Additionally, the start and stop codons are removed from the DNA translation tool since we do not require protein production. Instead, the mosaic element and sequencing adapter are implemented to flank the barcoding sequence.

Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"esis is showing promising results. Week 30: 23-29/7 This week we really tried to keep a good attitude to the project and to each other as the Gibson assembly kept on failing. Science is a challenge, but a challenge that we love. Our mutagenesis was showing good results as we added restriction sites. Week 31: 30/7-5/8 We discussed with our supervisor Per Hammarström which led us to the decision to change track in our project. Instead of working with multiple chaperone-systems in the bacterial genome we will try expressing hard-to-fold proteins with just one chaperone, GroES. The chaperone will be induced in E.coli plasmids. We also sent our mutagenesis to GATC Biotech for sequencing, and out modelling-group needed to do some changes with their model, to adjust to the new project. Week 32: 6/8-12/8 This week we spent a lot of time brainstorming and adjusting our experiments on the new project. While waiting on our new parts from IDT, we worked on our wiki-homepage.  We have also recorded a new podcast episode which is a part of our Human practice project - we want to enlighten people about synthetic biology. Week 33: 13/8-19/8 This week we sent our mutagenesis to GATC Biotech for sequencing and the new part from IDT finally arrived and we are therefore back in the lab. We also colored our “Liu-IGEM” logo on campus, which is a tradition for students unions at Linköping University. Week 34: 20/8-26/8 This week we spent a lot of time in the lab and did digestions and ligations of GroES and also heat shocked our mutagenesis. Week 35: 27/8 - 2/9 This week we struggled to get our results, with no good results in sight… Week 36: 3/9-9/9 For some of us in the team, a new semester has begun and we have to study and try to work with iGEM continuously. We finally see some progress on our results and continue working with GroES and our mutagenesis. This week we have attended the annual reception called “Kalas” which is an event for new students at Linköping University to get attached with different student societies. On this event, we told students about our team and about the competition and recruit new members to our student organisation. Week 37: 10"
Lambert_GA,2015,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," for our shaking water bath. This is a problem because it did not all us to secure it well enough to be able to incubate overnight.
Solution: We noticed the holes at the bottom of the shaking water bath's tray that are meant for the wingnuts to be secured. Instead of purchasing the expensive brackets (that don't fit correctly, since we have one small set)- we found that a configuration of rubber bands works much better and is much more secure. All you need to do is secure them to the bottom using two holes and pulling each end of a single rubber band through two close holes. You then pull one end through the loop of the other to secure. Continue doing this until you have four points of contact to the base and can then work on securing the glassware to the base using more rubber bands.
Blue Ice
Problem: When using clear microcentrifuge tubes or PCR tubes, the transparent plastic can get lost amongst the white ice/Styrofoam.
Solution: It is a simple solution to this frustrating problem- color the ice. One drop of blue food dye per 1L of water creates vibrant blue ice that can be easily differentiated from the tubes during wet lab work. It is also very helpful to have ice with a hole/dip in the middle to place tubes as opposed to strictly shaved ice (which runs the risk of diluting your solutions).
Keeping PCR Tubes Cold
Problem: As a high school lab, we don't have an ice block for our PCR tubes. This poses a problem because regular shaved ice could easily destroy the precise experiments by dripping melted chips into an open tube.
Solution: We fixed this by taking shaved ice, and packing it into a tray made for microcentrifuge tubes. We then used a single PCR tube to make indentations in the ice to use as a mold. This mold is then frozen for use in the next heat-sensitive lab. (Note: It is recommended that you use the centermost slots during your wet lab to avoid your ice channels from melting too quickly.)"

For another, we can consider how many animals are saved. Additionally, 3D cell structures live longer than 2D models, which is preferable for longer tests, and they are also more robust, which is highly favorable for the customer in terms of storage and transportation. Another advantage of our product over other approaches is that we might be able to arrange the cells into a great variety of shapes and even connect different types of cells that are usually difficult to connect under laboratory conditions.
Fig. 1: Our product fills in the gap between 2D cell culture and animal testing within the drug development process. This fits to our USP: ""We achieve a level of quality for printed tissue to enable drug testing on it""
The feedback from the interviews (protocols attached in appendix, pages 22 through 30) about the idea behind our technology was consistently positive. Moreover, the hypothesis (Appendix 1) that reliable 3D cell models are requested by the industry was confirmed. The ability to print the cells in a great variety of shapes and connecting different cell-types (co-cultures) is of high interest to our interview partners. The different partners even emphasized that a product with adequate quality and reliability is not yet on the market. As interviews with different pharmaceutical companies confirmed, the best stage to use our product in drug development will be after the initial high-throughput screening of candidates in 2D cell culture is completed. Our product will be used after 2D cell culture screenings but before the candidates are tested in animal models. Another interesting result of the interviews is that a price of up to € 10,000 for one 96-well plate with our cells is realistic. The majority of people confirmed that, in this particular industry, the price is practically irrelevant if the quality of the product is high and solves the customer’s problem. In company B, we have acquired our first potential customer. Person B, head of the in-vitro pharmacology and toxicology department at company B emphasized that we have aroused great interest and that they might test our prototype within their product development process.
Product. We offer ready-to-use 96-well plates equipped with 3D-arranged liver cells for pre-clinical drug development and toxicity screening. For the first product type, we have chosen liver cells because liver toxicity is one of the most frequent reasons for drug candidates to fail in later stages of drug development. We offer our cells in 96-well plates because they are the industrial standard for most laboratory applications. In the"

Modeling is an attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
The purpose of our modeling team is to peel back the layer of appearance of the device to reveal it's underlying nature. We tried to improve the device, cooperating with the experiment team. To achieve our goal, we have developed three fundamental themes. These three themes divide the modeling part into three parts. At the beginning, we confirmed whether our circuit realizes a reaction:this for part 1. When it comes to extending the counter to a device which can count a lot of numbers, there is a possibility that the device skips the next state due to the leak expression of sigma factor. So we examined what influences the leak of sigma factor have on the state-transit device:this for part 2. Thirdly, as an implementation of our genetic circuit, we designed new construct freeing the degree of induce-time and checked how the circuit works:this for part 3. Finally, we discussed what would be appropriate modeling, frequent issue to attack, in order to find the best strategy of modeling and wrote how we constructed our model:this Guide for modeling.
In Part1(deterministic model, stochastic model), we considered whether the device outputs much higher fluorescence when 2nd-induced than that of 1st-induced. In addition, we checked the key function of our device, reset function. Two approaches was made.
・Deterministic model:In this model,intermolecular interactions such as DNA-protein interactions and protein-ligand interactions are described as differential equations and concentrations of product (multimolecular complex) can be calculated by those of reactants. This model is intuitive, simple and hence popular to estimate the result of experiment.
・Stochastic model:Due to a cell's small volume (down to a few femtoliters for bacterial cells) and typically low bimolecular concentrations, the absolute number of molecules of a given signaling species in a cell may be quite small (typically on the order of 100 to 103). At such low numbers of reacting molecules, the reactions are heavily influenced by chance events, such as the chance encounter of reactant molecules. So we also used the stochastic model. The most common formulation of stochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation (CME). We used Gilles"

Project Description
Honey Bees
Honey bees, also known as Apis mellifera, are incredibly important pollinators responsible for the abundance and diversity of our food. They can pollinate an enormous range of plants through active collection of pollen, making them important for pollination of crops. Apples, almonds and numerous other crops rely heavily on bee pollination, tying the diversity of our diet to the well-being of these insects 1 . Therefore, it is of key importance to keep bees alive and healthy. Unfortunately, honey bees are in trouble: there has been a sustained loss of bee colonies in the western world for at least 10 years. In 2014-2015, US beekeepers lost over 40% of their colonies 2 . Such numbers are unacceptable!

Haemin Cho
Team Leader
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year's HKUST iGEM Team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the times, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is ""What did I just do? *blank face*""
BONGSO, Nadia Benedicta
""She is one of the rare team member that does not major in Life Science, she is a year 2 student majoring Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering(but still, Bio is involved). She is one of the 3-man Indonesian gang, which contributes to most of the noise in lab. She is indeed very helpful in the lab, such as helping to fill boxes of tips just after a few hours she landed in HK. She also helped much in Human Practice work.  She is quite absent-minded about her iPad, luckily she does not forget her lab work. She LOVES people calling her surname, and she really likes Hong Kong Disneyland.""
Jordy Evan Sulaiman
Jordy is a year two student majoring in chemical and bimolecular engineering. He is hard-working, diligent, and creative. He also likes to eat, play basketball, and play computer games. Above all, he likes Doyle the most. Though Jordy is very funny, sometimes he can be extremely serious when doing something. The scary part of Jordy is that he is good at everything, even arts. Everyone likes Jordy.

Gaston_Day_School,2014,Team:Gaston Day School_-_-_TEXT.html," biofuel research. Developments in using bacteria to produce biofuels such as isobutanol and ethanol have come with this research. These alcohols are favored because they can easily be swapped into our current infrastructure of car and truck engines. At Gaston Day School, we have decided to launch a biofuel-focused project. To create the alcohols, we developed alcohol-resistant strains of E. coli through artificial selection. We are also using PCR to amplify and ligate the genes GlmZ, GlmY, and IlmV, which are used in native alcohol production. The combination of these genes and the alcohol resistant strains are the first steps in our new biofuels project.
Cadmium Detector
The surrounding areas of Duke Energy’s Buck Steam Station have unintentionally been affected with millions of tons of coal ash containing multiple toxic chemicals including cadmium. The release of this ash has caused the water to become a hazardous with the potential to cause a wide range of health issues: flu-like symptoms, kidney damage,  fragile bones, and possibly death through prolonged exposure. To minimize the damage caused by cadmium in water both locally and globally, our 2012 team created several heavy metal detectors, but in 2013 we decided to concentrate on the cadmium detector. The detector responds to the presence of cadmium with green fluorescence. Next, the team worked to increase the sensitivity levels of our detector. Our detector needed to be able to respond to cadmium at low enough levels that the detection would be useful and the presence of cadmium would not already be apparent. This year, we completed the addition of the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to our detector. The sensitivity tuners amplify the signal received by the detector. At the end of last year, after adding the sensitivity tuners, we began to see indications of a peak at lower levels of cadmium than we had previously thought. To define that peak, we used test points that were closer together. We discovered a peak of fluorescence and identified our detection points.

Welcome to iGEM Aachen 2016
Beyond The Basics
Apart from basic lab work we also established a dialogue with the public.
Our outreach included contributing to conferences, socializing and scientific events.
Beyond that we asked ourselves how to maximize the future impact of our project and made an effort to get as much feedback from outsiders as possible. This motivated us to evaluate the economic perspectives of our LIPs, as well.

Economical Perspective
Many iGEM teams create great ideas and great projects, but when it comes to the implementation and application in real life, it is also important to deal with the following questions: Would this project be applicable in reality? Would there be a market for this product? What opportunities are there to make the product more appealing to consumers? Apart from ""Integrated Practices"", it was also of great interest for us to examine the potential of our idea on the laundry detergents market.
That is why we created an economical analysis in cooperation with a business administration student from the University in Nantes, France.
Policies of the New Product
The iGEM team Aachen wants to produce the photocaged Subtilisin E and the organisms, which can produce the new enzymes. So they are in direct competition to companies like Novozymes or Roche, which offer enzymes for different applications. Until now they only produce in a very small scale. Maybe they can work together with other enzyme producing companies or directly with washing companies. It would definitely be necessary to have an industrial partner to benefit from their experiences on the global market, because the German laundry detergent market is too competitive and controlled by a few corporations.
Policy Regarding the Distribution of the New Product
The distribution of the new product depends on the way the iGEM Team Aachen wants to introduce the new product on the market. On the one hand they can try to industrialize it with the help of already existing enzyme companies. One the other hand their product could be applied in"
Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," is Toehold Switch
We choose toehold switch as our miRNA detector. The structure of toehold switch is similar to hairpin, except it has a loop at the top as ‘toehold’. Toehold switch functions as riboregulator through linear-linear interaction between RNAs. When target RNA appears, it will bind one of the toehold switch stems and open the loop, exposing the RBS.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger. The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single-stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest.
Our Circuit to Detect miRNA-144
There are 3 parts in our circuit in total.
Part 1 includes toehold switch for miRNA-144 and GFP coding sequence. When miRNA-144 exists, the switch is on and mRNA for GFP is transcribed.
Part 2 contains toehold switch for GFP mRNA and T3 RNA polymerase coding sequence (BBa_K346000). Note that, since the maximum length of trigger RNA for toehold switch is about 25nt, so we analyzed GFP mRNA’s structure and choose a small piece from it which ensures binding specificity and stability.
Part 3 is simply a GFP generator (BBa_E0840), with T3 promoter. As we know, T3 promoter can only function when bound with T3 RNA polymerase.
So now it’s clear that, part 2 and part 3 are designed for amplification. They form a positive feedback loop. So the whole process is as follow: when miRNA-144 exists, it triggers part 1 and GFP mRNAs are transcribed. These mRNA on the one hand can be directly translated to GFP and show green fluorescence, on the other hand, can trigger part 2 and T3 RNA polymerase is transcribed and translated, which enables part 3 to work, thus transcribe more GFP mRNAs. And these GFP mRNAs can also be used"

RIP Secretion BBa_K2616001
The sequence we designed contains two RIP (RNAIII Inhibiting Peptide) sequences fused to two different export signal peptides for E. coli Type II Secretion System: DsbA and MalE, placed on their N-termini (Figure 11).
Figure 11: Schematic representation of the RIP production cassette.
We gene synthesized our DNA constructs commercially. Once we received the sequence encoding for this production cassette, named Seq8 (461 bp) in the commercial plasmid pEX-A258, we amplified it in competent E. coli DH5α. After bacterial culture and plasmid DNA extraction, we digested the commercial vector with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. We extracted the inserts from the gel and performed a ligation by using specific overlaps into linearized pBR322 for RIP expression and into pSB1C3 for iGEM sample submission. We proved that our vectors contained the insert by electrophoresis (Figure 12, 13).
Figure 12: Agarose 1% gel after electrophoresis of digested pSB1C3 containing Seq8 (Bba_K2616001) with PstI and EcoRI. All colonies except 1, 3 and 7 contained the insert.
Figure 13: Agarose 1% gel after electrophoresis of digested pBR322 containing Seq8 (Bba_K2616001) with NdeI (lane 1 to 7). All colonies except colonies 2 and 7 contained the insert.
Sequencing results, when aligned with our original construct using Geneious, confirmed that pSB1C3 contained Seq8, Bba_K2616001 .

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," our needs. This could also provide us with some intuitions in the way of fine tuning the whole construct in order to ameliorate the current design and try to strive for excellence.
Characterization of our prototype
Figure. The characterisation result of the prototype of the Tristable Switch. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bars represent SEM from 3 biological replicates.
The results showed that the Tristable Switch could neither produce steady output nor possess sensitive state-changing ability as we expected. Three different inducers, aTc, DAPG and IPTG were added to induce one of the three promoters every two hours in order to test its capacity to switch after induction. Unfortunately, the construct did not exhibit these characteristics while green fluorescence proteins keeping on dominating throughout the whole experiment. According to the data obtained, both the levels of red fluorescence protein and blue fluorescence protein were significantly lower than that of green fluorescence protein without responding to its specific inducers.
We therefore conjectured that this might be due to the imbalance promoter strength among the three promoters and the insufficient induction time. Mutations could be excluded since sequencing of the circuit was done and proved to be correct.
1. Three different repressible promoters, tetp, phlFp and lacpwere used to build the circuit. lacp were the strongest one among the three according to the paper, Genomic mining of prokaryotic repressors for orthogonal logic gates. Since GFP was driven by lacp and the GFP level remained nearly the same throughout the whole experiment, it suggested that the promoter strength of lacp was too strong that the other two promoters were continuously inhibited by the repressors that were driven by the lacp.
2. The induction time after adding inducers might not be enough. If time was not enough, it would be hard to produce the fluorescence proteins to a particular level. Usually, the induction time would take around 6 hours which is triple compared to ours (Cameron, 2014). If there was not enough time for the circuit to produce sufficient amount of fluorescence proteins, it would be hard to measure the fluorescence accurately. Aside from this, some repressor proteins would remain, thus, hamper the activation of another repressible promoter.
Improvments
1. In order to build a circuit that could produce steady output, strength of most of the parts involved should be kept constant, if not all. In our case, the ribosome binding sites in the construct could be replaced by a stronger or weaker one depending on the situation. This fine tuning"

People usually don't think of the dependence on animals synthetic biology creates, they only think about control (anthropocentric view). But I prefer being dependent on Bioengineered frogs, rather than on very polluting (and invisibly polluting and destructing) industries thousands miles from me. In a way, and counter-intuitively, synthetic biology would make us closer to nature and ecosystems...""

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," PUF - It is know that PUF bind the RNA and assists with gene expression. However, not many other details are known. - It’s like zinc fingers for RNA - Is 8 base pairs specific enough to identify viruses? What if we used several PUFs? 16 base pairs would probably be enough. This works well as a viral detection system. - RNA detection system is a possibility but it would take a long time to perfect. - Use possibility is an in vitro RNA regulator. Binding of PUF to mRNA inhibits its expression. Very simple, and a proof of concept experiment. This could tie into the lysin manufacture for the tuberculosis proposal - Want a quick easy test to see if this works. This is definitely worth pursuing. Anthony: Production of a New Food Source for Aquaculture of Predatory Fish - E. coli naturally make triglycerides, but not the type we’re looking for. There is the possibility to introduce another substrate. - Is there the possibility to create a bioreactor where the enzyme just breaks down fats? - More research on possible substrates needs to be done. Asha: Tuberculosis fighting E. Coli - Wouldn’t work with tuberculosis, would use M. smegmatis which has 17 known phages - It takes 2 weeks to grow! It’s hard - Perdue might be pursuing something like this because one of their professors has done research on it. - Instead of looking at tuberculosis phages, just look at bacteriophage ideas in general. - Need to look at the lysin proteins in more detail. Bob: Crossing the Self-sustainability of Photosynthetic systems with Other Cells - It’s not really possible to introduce photosynthesis to e. coli. - Nanotechnology or endosymbiosis would be better options - We need a model for this Recommendations: - Do the PUF project and then pick another one of the 3 application projects to pursue. Announcements: Divya – publicity: - We are signed up for IGB Fellows, where the E. Chiver poster will be presented. 1 or 2 people need to present, so watch for the email closer to May. Cara - WashU has been contacted, Cara’s contact is working to connect us to the WashU team. - NU will be contacted next, along with Perdue Angela - This Saturday we will be cleaning up the lab! Everyone should come to help and learn more about where everything is in the lab. It will start at 1. - The coming weekend meetings are very important, please commit the time to be there! - On"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," For the transformation, we did use the protocol (2). Then we have grown the cells on the plates, I13504 and pUC19 on AMP, J23101, J23106 and J23117 at CAM and pSB4K5 at KAN.
07/07/2015
For IDT transformation we already decided which plates we should use
- 16 plates LB-KAN;
- 16 plates BL-CAM;
08/07/2015
We prepared our own antibiotic stock solutions (although we had to redo it anyway)
Amp: 100mg/ml = 0.1 g/ml (dissolved in water)
Kan: 50 mg/ml = 0.05 mg/ml (dissolved in water)
Cam: 35 mg/ml = 0.035 mg/ml. (dissolved in 100% ethanol).
After preparing the antibiotic stocks in only 1 mL, the supervisors (Essengül) told us to make larger stocks and also filter them in order to sterilize them (since we cannot autoclave them).

“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Citrobacter-Freundii#5-Genome-sequencing_-_-_TEXT.html," help of the sequencing data (Figure 1), we have found that both strains have got several beta-lactamases encoded within their genomes, which normally confer these bacteria resistance to antibiotics with beta-lactam rings, such as ampicillin.
Figure 1: A snapshot of the sequencing reads that covered one of the beta-lactamase regions in Citrobacter freundii, showing good sequence coverage.
This is a puzzling find, as neither strain shows any resistance to carbenicillin, a synthetic ampicillin analogue. Nonetheless, a lot of gram negative bacteria carry beta-lactamases within their genomes, so even if Citrobacter freundii were released into the environment, it should not lead to an increase in the spread of antibiotic resistance.
The raw sequencing files (zip files) and the contigs that have been assembled de novo (.fa format) can be accessed at the public Dropbox folder along with pdf files of the assembly reports. In addition, the automated annotation spread sheets (done by RAST) for both strains can also be accessed from this location.
Lac operator sequence analysis
One possible reason the Lac promoter coupled to our BioBricks is not regulated is because its LacI binding sequence might be different from that of the native Citrobacter freundii operator sequence. To test this, we have done a sequence alignment of the region where we think the Citrobacter freundii operator region might be with the consensus operator sequence in E. coli (5'-T GGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATT-3').  The sequence alignment can be seen in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2: Sequence alignment between our Citrobacter freundii sequence and the consensus E. coli operator region sequence
As it can be seen from this sequence alignment, the Citrobacter freundii sequence, while showing some similarities, is not completely identical to the E. coli consensus sequence, which might be the reason. We then looked at the sequence of the LacR repressor protein in Citrobacter freundii, as it is known that the N-terminal sequence of this protein is what binds to DNA. We wanted to see whether there are any differences between this protein’s N-terminal sequence and that of E. coli MG1655, the strain that is most often used in iGEM and in labs in general. The protein BLAST results can be seen in Figure 3.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," These hardware components are designed to integrate seamlessly with Neptune’s Software.
Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular to ensure the user is not overpaying for extraneous hardware nor is unable to safely control their setup. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and varies headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately. The power is delivered through 5v 10W laptop power supplies which are readily available, safe, and deliver enough power to control up to 16 servos at once. The stackable controllers can each control 16 servos per board, and therefore users do not have to order a more expensive system that can control 200 servos if they only need 10 to get started.
A piston rod setup for syringes and servos used to control valves and dispensers on the chip was selected to prioritize low cost, ease of use, and modularity.  In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. This involved geometric modeling and trigonometry to translate the rotational motion of a servo arm to linear syringe pump motion. After the equation for off-center and on-axis piston rod motion was verified and tested, the response was modeled with a range of values for each parameter. The ideal parameters for a smooth and most linear response were selected, as well as limits imposed to ensure Neptune always delivers smooth syringe motion.
An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. Furthermore, the equation derived to map this motion is not invertible, preventing a simple equation to obtain change in linear motion with a change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done by creating modular squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. The 1/8” diameter holes are arranged in a grid, spaced 0.3” from one another and "

Parisian Meetup collaboration with iGEM Saclay Team
We had a very fruitful collaboration with Paris Saclay iGEM team that resulted in the organization of the Ile De France meet-up. With Naiane, one of their team members in charge for communication, we decided to host an event where Parisian teams could have the opportunity to present their project in front of a public and jury, just like at the giant jamboree! The goal of this meeting was double: we both wanted to place teams in competition-like conditions, but we also wanted to socialize with the teams nearby in the Parisian region and have a great time. On both levels, the event was a complete success! Attending Teams were Paris Bettencourt , Paris Saclay , Ionis Paris , Evry , UPMC Paris , Marseille .
Collaboration on questionnaires with other iGEM Teams
Together with iGEM Tianjin , iGEM Pittsburgh , IGEM ULV-LC-CV , iGEM Valencia UPV and iGEM Virginia , we created a grouping for questionnaire distribution. Each team created surveys about their project, about synthetic biology in general, or another related topic. The aim was to share the surveys from other teams online as much as possible in order to help them get as many replies as possible.
Collaboration with EPFL iGEM Team
We had a nice collaboration with the iGEM EPFL team. We had a fun skype meeting during which they interviewed us, on our project, on how we were managing with organization, with team building, on our country and more! They transcribed our answers to fill their cool website « igem today » which offers an overview of the teams, their project and the daily life of iGEMers around the world.
Collaboration with Groninger iGEM Team
We helped iGEM Groningen by completing and sharing their survey.
Fun collaboration with iGEM Freiburg 2016
We especially want to thank the iGEM Freiburg team for the package that they sent us, we loved it! We made a collaboration in a more fun way. The idea was to send to each other a care-package with regional specialities (foods, souvenirs and wine). That is an unconventional collaboration in a more entertaining way. We were delighted to meet you"

From the I13522 – CAM, we picked from both plates a colony. Also the J23117 gave colonies which has been used for further experiments. J23101 and J23106 we have decided to redo, because the transformation failed. The picked colonies were incubated in 8 mL LB; I13522 in 1:100 AMP and J23117 in 1:1000 CAM.
Transformation (2) of J23101 (1 µl, 0.5 mL of LB instead of 1 mL) and J23106 (1 µl, 0.5 mL of LB instead of 1 mL). After transformation they were plated on LB+AMP petri dishes. It might be that there has been sample confusion during incubation on ice for 2 minutes occurs (J23106 with J23101), should be confirmed later with sequencing.

Results of the above transformation: J23101 3 purple colonies; J23106 6 purple colonies with small colonies around them. The plates were stored in the fridge.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
The model was implemented in MATLAB, due to its efficient functioning in solving systems of ordinary differential equations. The script “Cas9.m” reads in the C. reinhardtii genome from a text file, and generates a copy of the reverse strand of the genome. It then checks if all potential DNA sites on both the forward and reverse genome have a PAM which could bind to Cas9 in an energetically advantageous way (although Cas9’s PAM is NGG, several other PAMs are still capable of binding Cas9). For the circular, 203 828 base pair C. reinhardtii genome, this means scanning 407 656 different sites, yielding 88 740 potential binding sites.
The script then calculates the free energy change which would be involved in Cas9’s binding to all potential target sites. However, here an issue was encountered with the ΔΔGCas9:gRNA values which we were using. Theory suggests that perfect matches will have a ΔΔGCas9:gRNA value of 0, while mismatches will have a positive ΔΔGC"

Nagaraj et al. 2011 and Qudrat & Truong 2016 only give the amino acids of the TM­TLR4 but do not mention a ‘stop-transfer signal’ or the flanking sequences of their construct in general (not in the paper nor in the SI). However, the flanking sequence of a TMD (which is a stop-transfer anchor signal during co-translational import into the ER) is crucial in the establishment of a TMD and its orientation! his problem has been resolved by using the TMEGFR as described by iGEM Munich 2016.
With this experiment we wanted to confirm whether our E-cadherin plasmid (received from Prof. Price) worked on its own.
We did that by:
Transfecting CHO cells with the plasmid
Adding calcium solution (CaCl2) to their growth medium
Measuring the number of aggregates and comparing it to control conditions
Experimental setup
The experiment was carried out in a 6-well plate, in which wells were marked from A to E.
The well contents were the following:
Well A: cells + superfect + plasmid
Well B: cells + superfect + plasmid + calcium
Well C: control cells
Well D: control cells + calcium
Well E: untreated cells
Control cells = treated with superfect + PBS instead of plasmid
Pictures of the cells were taken under the phase-contrast  microscope. For each condition, 3 pictures at the same magnification were taken and single cells and aggregated cells were counted. The ratio of single to aggregated cells was calculated based on the average counts (see the table below). Aggregate definition: clump of 3 or more cells.
Results and discussion
After the transfection, cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. 46 h after the transfection cells from the 6 well plate were transferred into adherent cells dishes. 7 mL growth media was added to each well and gently mixed with the cells. Cells were incubated for another 60 minutes at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
Afterwards, pictures of the cells were taken under the phase-contrast microscope. For each condition, 3 pictures at the same magnification were taken and single cells and aggregated cells were counted. The ratio of single to aggregated cells was calculated based on the average counts (see the table below).  All individual cells were classified as single cells, while the clumps of 3 or more cells were classified as aggregated."
