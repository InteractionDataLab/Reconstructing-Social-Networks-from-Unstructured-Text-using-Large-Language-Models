Currently, emerging technologies are moving at a rapid pace, but often societal responses lag behind. Understanding the social-ecological-technological systems and the underlying dynamics can help to guide decisions-makers and the public towards better governance models. With these goals in mind, she explores the values, organizations, and outcomes associated with existing oversight systems in order to inform future policy-making. Her work draws on developing methods for integrating multiple disciplines in a policy sciences approach. It is also translational, striving to engage and serve stakeholders and citizens who come from a variety of perspectives and expertise areas. As such, she and colleague Professor Fred Gould (CALS) will co-direct a new center on Genetic Engineering and Society to help support bi-directional learning and communication among academe and public and private organizations.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#Conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html," the recipient becomes a donor
A cell may divide if there is an empty adjacent hex
A donor may conjugate if there is a recipient in an adjacent hex
The natural death rate of cells is negligible (i.e. cells don’t die)
All cells are stationary, so population “movement” occurs through division into neighboring cells
The scripts used to run this model were written in Python and follow a very basic structure:
Flowchart for the Agent-Based Model algorithm
Technical assumptions and details:
The algorithm uses weighted uniform distributions (about specified parameters) for conjugation and division
Donors lose half of their plasmids when they divide
We do not distinguish between transconjugants original donors
Cells enter a paused state after they divide or conjugate for a certain amount of time, allowing them to “recharge”
A few potential issues:
Donors are given a chance to conjugate before they are given a chance to divide
Cells are equally likely to divide, whether it's 100 turns after they're created or 0 turns
We iterate through the grid in numerical order, which may lead to an “unnatural” sequence of cell interactions (i.e. inaccuracy). As the simulation “turn time” decreases, the resulting inaccuracy from this behaviour should become negligible
The lack of cell death does not seem realistic in a living body

We asked 11 people to participate in this blind test and calculated the percentage of people who smelled MeS. We can conclude that the MeS/wintergreen smell was stronger after 24 hours incubation time compared to 8 hours. Growing the bacteria at 37 degrees also produced a more pronounced smell than those at room temperature. What’s more, in the microcentrifuge tubes where 0.1mM or 1mM salicylate was added, the smell became more obvious both after 8 and 24hrs of growth. The positive effect of adding chorismate became noticable after 24 hours. The reason why chorismate requires more time to show an effect may be that chorismate is the very first precursor of the methyl salicylate production pathway, whereas the salicylate is an intermediate closer to the end product. As such, the impact of salicylate on the end product will become noticeable sooner. Most importantly, our brick worked in terms of producing methyl salicylate.
The results are shown below:

Headspace GC
Headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) was used for the measurement of MeS production by our BBa_K1060003 brick in a BL21 strain. Samples of 5 ml supernatant (centrifuged and filtersterilized) were collected in 15-ml precooled glass tubes, which were immediately closed and cooled on ice. Samples were then analyzed with a calibrated Autosystem XL gas chromatograph with a headspace sampler (HS40; Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) and equipped with a CP-Wax 52 CB column (length, 50 m; internal diameter, 0.32 mm; layer thickness, 1.2 μm; Chrompack; Varian, Palo Alto, Calif.). Samples were heated for 16 min at 72°C in the headspace autosampler. The injection block and flame ionization detector (FID) temperatures were kept constant at 180 and 250°C, respectively; helium was used as the carrier gas.

Prevent escape of the bacteria/contamination issues
The backing layer and the size-controlling membrane prevents the bacteria from escaping outside of the patch and being released onto the skin, respectively.
Although our initial diffusion assays have shown that bacteria can diffuse through our semipermeable membrane, we have begun testing with other smaller filters including peptide dialysis membranes and 0.2 micron size filters.
If we can determine a better membrane that prevents the diffusion of the bacteria, we can use a two layer semi permeable system where the first layer prevents the diffusion of the bacteria and a second layer which further filters BBI for diffusion.
See pages 15 - 16 of the Device Manual to tackle contamination issues.

Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
None of the new Biobrick parts are thought to be hazardous as the proteins our genes code do not increase the pathogenicity of the bacteria.
The engineered organism could potentially disrupt existing ecologies and be difficult to contain; however, as mentioned previously, integrated BBI would not make a difference in the bacteria’s survivability outside the lab, and we have taken care to ensure that the Threonine auxotrophy is fatal to engineered microbes. Namely, given the nature of our project and safeguards we have implemented, none of our BioBricks confer unsafe risks to individuals nor the environment.
 
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Our project utilized BSL1 cells (E.coli and B.subtilis) that have GRAS labelling, thus our main project did not require ethics approval by the review boards. The University of Calgary has a university-wide Biosafety Committee, whose guidelines for safe biological laboratory practices were adhered to throughout the project.The team’s lab benches and experimental plans were assessed and deemed safe to proceed with. The Environment Health and Safety (EHS) provided training and information on the hazards from the types of sources and each form of radiation. All researchers underwent safety training courses. The individuals who worked with irradiated cells received radiation safety training from the EHS.

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". Snobelen’s research interest include science in popular culture, and the popularization of science, therefore we knew we wanted to meet with him to discuss our science literacy survey. We did not have much previous survey planning experience to draw upon, and thus it was great to get an expert opinion on how to form unbiased questions. Dr. Snobelen advised us not to use the phrase “science illiterate” as it could potentially polarize the audience. Furthermore, we discussed that people are not scientifically literate or illiterate. For instance, someone could be literate in biology, but have a poor understanding about physics. For this reason, we tried to instead paint the idea that science literacy is a spectrum.
Safety
After speaking with Scott Doncaster from the fermentation company, BioVectra, it was clear that there were a few safety aspects to consider if our project were to make it to the bioreactor stage. In this section, we hope to address two questions:
is our design safe?
What are the major concerns for companies?
Whenever organisms are genetically modified to do something they wouldn’t normally do, safety is definitely something worth considering. Furthermore, because genetic modification is such a contentious topic it is important to be very clear about the control mechanisms and safe-guards surrounding these organisms. While we are not yet at the stage of introducing our bacteria into a bioreactor we have been thinking about possible ways to make our project safer. During our tour of the bioreactors at BioVectra the most obvious safety feature was the slanted floors to collect any fluid that may leak. All of this collected biohazardous material could then be correctly disposed of via an autoclave. There are additional ways to safe-guard our biofuel design that do not involve infrastructure, and instead involve the organism itself. We first brainstormed potential “kill switches” which would ensure that if our organism escapes it would not be able to survive long in the wild. The problem with kill switches, however, is that they can sometimes suffer from selective pressure. We were then inspired by the publication by Mandell et al. (2015) where the researchers altered the genetic code of an organism to confer metabolic dependency on nonstandard amino acids. Furthermore, the system these researchers developed blocked incoming and outgoing horizontal gene transfer with natural organisms. Whether it be by controlling the environment, controlling the organism, or both, we have been thinking about safety since the start of our project. We are eager to ensure that our cellulose-degrading E. coli offers a safe and efficient alternative to current biofuel systems. In talking to representatives at BioVectra"

Determine how current biosensor developers design, produce and implement biosensor projects
Use these talks to determine the common barriers to biosensor development and implementation
Create novel solutions to identified problems, producing frameworks and guidelines to aid future researchers
To achieve these aims, we emailed, skyped and attended conferences to speak to stakeholders in biosensor development, from the early research stage to the end-user. Check out our integrated human practices page for more information

Preparation of Reaction Solutions
1. gBlocks
2µl of each stock solution were diluted in Milli-Q water to achieve final solution volumes of 20µl to make 1ng/µl-1
2. Primers
2µl of each stock solution were diluted in Milli-Q water to achieve final solution volumes of 20µl to make 10µM reaction solutions. (The solutions are labelled as ""Prefix primer"" and ""suffix primer"" in eppendorf tubes in the fridge.)
Polymerase Chain Reaction
25µl reactions were run according to the PCR protocol.
* The final concentrations of the primers were noted as they are needed to determine the annealing temperatures for the primers, which can be done using NEB’s online tool here.
** Add components in order of decreasing volume for maximum ease-of-pipetting.
*** When reaction mixture is being made up, all components as well as the mixture itself are to be kept on ice, as the Master Mix is a high-fidelity polymerase that will recognize the primers as being incorrectly base-paired and be able to hydrolyse the primers if kept at room temperature.
**** Use Q5 enzyme in the cold room to avoid defrosting and freezing the original stock of Q5 enzyme. This could decrease the activity of Q5 enzyme. Bring ice bucket to the cold room to bring Q5 into the bench.
***** Make sure that the primer and small amounts of DNA and primer doesn’t stick onto the side of the tube or the tip.
The reaction mixture tubes were positioned in an Eppendorf Mastercycler nexus X2 and the PCR program was run.
* DNA denaturation can be performed at 98℃ because of the high thermal"

Propaganda and Education
Science Popularization Lotus Festival
On June 24th, 2018, the Lotus Festival, a campus open day was held in Nankai University, our iGEM team participated in this event and successfully propagandized knowledge about synthetic biology as well as iGEM, let a lot of high school students and their parents for the first time knew about our competition and synthetic biology. We built a bridge between iGEM and the public.
Investigation and Propaganda in Western China
To investigate the education and the popularization of biological science in western China, we went to Yinchuan, Ningxia from August 1st to August 7th, 2018. We went to Minning Middle School to teach students some funny knowledge about synthetic biology. Through the research, we found that people in the western China knew little about biological knowledge, and we need to increase publicity and popular science.
Synthetic Biology Propaganda in Tianjin No.13 Middle School
After meticulous preparation, three iGEM teams came from Nankai University, Tianjin University and Tianjin University of Science and Technology went to Tianjin No.13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.” While these students have only been exposed to biology for a year, they like it very much”, the teacher said.
Biological Science Popularization Day in Nankai University
In order to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, we have organized the science popularization report on July 7th, team NKU-CHINA, Jilin_China and TUST_China took part in the publicity. Each team introduced their respective experiment directions and preliminary work with the synthetic biology as a common theme. After the report, outside the venue, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology, iGEM competition and experiment projects.

This week, I began my research at the Human Computer Interaction lab. It was a great introduction to synthetic biology, and I enjoyed getting to know my labmates.
Tuesday:
Today, we received an introduction to the lab and the projects we are working on this summer. I was assigned to Tabula, which is based off of a previous project in the lab, G-nome Surfer. There’s a user testing for Tabula next week, so I got caught up on what has been done so far and what my tasks were for the near future. I dived into the code for G-nome Surfer to get familiar with it and to formulate the code for Tabula. It was my first experience coding with C# and XAML, so it was tricky, but I anticipate the coding becoming easier.
Wednesday:
Today, I continued coding for the Tabula project. We’re redefining G-nome Surfer, so what I’m doing is using elements of that project to make a similar project for Tabula. In particular, I worked on making the chromosome bar for a specific mouse genome visible, which was much harder than I thought it would be. Much of the code is intertwined with other code, so it’s not as simple and just copying and pasting code. I got the bar to be visible at the end of the day, which was nice, but I still have a lot of work to do. First,"

Such as: “Your hydrogel insoles maybe a bit cold for people to use in winter.”Or “How about your insole swelling after absorbing the foot sweat?” Also, they talked about the flatfoot. All their praise and suggestions encouraged us very much, so we decided to continue to improve it. Finally, we made the advanced hydrogel insole— insole 3.
Insole 3:
Instead of using one kind material and the flat surface, insole 3 was made of two kinds of hydrogels and it had an ergonomic hook face structure. In the force-intensive areas such as the toe, sole and the heel, the fist softer hydrogel was used to support the force and the first type E. coli to grow. In the other area, the tougher hydrogel with the second E. coli grow on it. Besides, we introduced the swelling super absorbent polymer(SAP) particles and dried one to deal with the swelling problem. Insole 3 had two different types. The summer type was thinner than usual and absorbed the CecropinXJ directly without the first type E. coli grow on it. The winter type insole had an extra convenient heating equipment on the bottom of the insole. It also had four layers.
You can try it on Gaint Jamboree！
It should be pointed out that people’s need for the special insole inspired us. We thought it was an opportunity for us to produce personal customized insoles. Everyone’s feet are different, even one person’s two feet were rare identical. With the help of foot scanner or the camera of the smart phone, we can produce your personal customized antibacterial and deodorant insole for you, your own “comfortable”!

Patent Application
As a very practical application of innovation, we want to make our project a further continuation of the real daily life in the more general case - the real into commercial application.
To this end, we negotiated with the patent application service professionals. Topics will be packed to make more business sense as a result. After finishing the application form, we have submitted to the People's Republic of China Patent Office for patent application. In the process of talking to the Patent Office clerk, the clerk said: this product is of extremely practical application value. We believe that our products can be correctly on the road of commercialization."

Lisa Pratt, NASA Planetary Protection Officer
Amy Kronenberg and Emilia K Mann at the NIAC Symposium.
We also spoke with Dr. Lisa Pratt, NASA’s planetary protection officer , about concerns that may arise from the fact that we are using a biological material as our main building component. Pratt informed us that we needed to ensure that no spores would be able to form from our mycelium blocks, and to ensure that there will not be the creation of a superorganism due to the interaction between the mycelium and the substrate it eats. We were also reminded that there are specific parameters in regards to harvesting water from the Martian surface. But most importantly, Pratt emphasized that many of these regulations will be subject to change as real human missions to Mars are planned and that we therefore must remain adaptive and anticipate any potential issues.
Jim Head, a professor at Brown University in the Department of Geoscience, gave us excellent recommendations on potential landing sites for Mars as well as other important logistical information key to the mission architecture of our design.
Lastly, Amy Kronenberg, Biophysicist Staff Scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley Labs, as well as a member of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts advisory board, gave us great insight and critique on our radiation protection. We had initially planned to use melanin, but she encouraged us to focus on finding ways to increase the number of protons (hydrogen) present to protect from cosmic radiation as melanin is only useful for UV radiation which the mycelial structures themselves should do. As a result we shifted our focus to creating a design that contains a thin outer layer of water.  She also provided us with important literature [0].
The information and feedback we received from these experts greatly informed our mission architecture––helping us to design a mission that not only fits NASA’s requirements but also protects the planet in order to ensure the integrity of scientific missions to Mars.

We initially gravitated towards using mycelium as the core material in the design our habitat for Mars because of its self-perpetuating property--it can grow, given a substrate to bind, into the shape of any mold it is placed in. The results of our work demonstrated that we could produce  a cost-effective, replicable habitat for Martian exploration.
However, as our research progressed and we spoke to more experts working with the material, we learned there was so much more to mycelium than"

To Mars and beyond: engineering today’s most important microbes
What does the colonization of Mars, the energy crisis, and the food crisis have in common?
Earlier this month, U.S. President Obama outlined his plans to send humans to Mars by the 2030s with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. He joins Elon Musk, SpaceX and a collection of people and organizations interested in pursuing this goal. However, to make this vision a reality, we need a way to grow food in the harsh environment of Mars. Here on Earth, we also face challenges in meeting our future demand for food and energy which forecasted to increase by 50% and 45% respectively by 2030 (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2015).
There is one organism that has the potential to solve all of these problems – rhizobia. Rhizobia are nitrogen-fixing bacteria that form symbiotic root nodules with legumes. By increasing their hardiness and nitrogen fixation efficiency, we can expand the arable land that can be used to grow crops and reduce our dependence on ecologically-damaging nitrogen-containing fertilizers. We chose to focus on two strains of rhizobia, Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021.
To engineer them, we selected a technique called multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE). MAGE is a form of genetic engineering that generates increased genetic diversity at targeted genomic loci through the introduction of synthetic oligonucleotides, allowing for the directed evolution of cell populations (Wang et al. 2009). By creating a framework to implement MAGE in rhizobia, we open up numerous potential applications; for example the optimization of nitrogen fixation mechanisms. Furthermore, our work with rhizobia can be used to guide the implementation of MAGE in other non-model organisms.
Multiplex engineering of rhizobial genomes
Our 2016 Yale iGEM team is focusing on optimizing multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) in two strains of rhizobia, Rhizobium tropici (R. tropici) CIAT 899 and Sinorhizobium meliloti (S."

Ben advised that I let it grow and I also transformed more comp cells with pSB1C3 plasmid from the Spring 2010 Kit in case whoever diluted the Spring 2011 pSB1C3 had diluted it too much or something else had gone wrong. Marc then advised me that the competent cells may have gotten too old to be transformed well; next on the to do list, make new comp cells and repeat!

Ligation - We ligated our urease contruct with pSB1C3 plasmid backbone using T4 DNA ligation protocol .
Transformation - Transformation of E. coli with our urease construct/pSCB3 (part BBa_K656013) was conducted using NEB's NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) protocol . Transformant cells were plated on LB-chlor plates and allowed to grow overnight. Colonies were sampled at random, and tested for ureolytic activity.
Characterization
As a qualitative assay of urease activity, we selected transformant colonies at random from the LB-chlor growth plates and grew them up in liquid LB-chlor culture. These monoclonal cultures were then plated and allowed to grow on urease test plates ; if urease is present and active in the cultures, the urea is cleaved in the surrounding agar, causing the pH of the surrounding agar to increase. Phenol-red then indicates the subsequent increase in pH from ureolysis.   All but one of the colonies we selected off the LB-Chlor plate exhibited ureolytic activity, indicating that our workflow had resulted in the construction of a functional S. pasteurii urease biobrick. From the urease test plates we were able to determine that our part did in fact, function, albeit qualititatively.
Successful urease biobrick transformants, plated on LB-chlor agar plates.

To more accurately and quantitatively measure the activity of the urease biobrick, we hope to perform a conductivity assay protocol with our transformants. At this time, however, the conductivity meter is not available in our building has gone missing; we are doing all that we can to retrieve it, and once in hand we will perform the assay and upload the results to [ BBa_K656013's page in the registry.
Another component of our characterization of part BBa_K656013 was a determination of the construct's compatibility with the biobrick assembly method. Because we lack the"

Background
It became the hotspot of research of Life Science since miRNA has been found. It has been shown by Life Informatics that miRNA might be able to regulate more than a third of human gene, including wildly participating in many biological process of growth, differentiation, propagation, apoptosis, cycle regulation, shift and the formation of tumors. There are always changes of expression profile of miRNAs in many different varieties of human tumors, which is a king of latent powerful biological norm of assessing the tumor genesis, development, diagnosis, cure and prognosis. Specific changes of miRNAs’ expression profile of specific cancers are related to tumor genesis, metastatic, clinic pathological characteristics and prognosis, etc.
As for the relationship of miRNAs and mammary cancers, Matron adopted chip technology to detect mammary cancers and the aberrant expression of miRNAs of normal mammary tissues matched them. [2] There were 29 diverse levels of expressions of miRNAs detected between normal mammary tissues and mammary cancer tissues. In addition, Volinia has found there were up-regulations of 15 miRNAs of mammary cancers.[3] Both two scholars’ researches have shown that the expression of the miRNA-155 was most significant different, and the expression of specific miRNA can be consorted to clinic pathological characteristics and biological and physical characteristics such as ductal type, mesophyll type, the type of metastatic of lymph gland, vascular invasion, proliferation index, the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor and CerbB-2. The accuracy of experimental data is fairly essential since the experiment of detecting the expression levels of miRNAs is based on gene circuit, where lays the purport of mathematical modeling.
Introduction
Gene lines in experienmental part as shown below:
Figure1: genetic circuit schematic diagram
The main work of establishing the model research gene regulation network is through the analysis of gene expression data, combined with bioinformatics methods and techniques to build the appropriate topology and to simulate the regulatory mechanism of the cell system, in order to understand the system under the framework of life phenomena. The mathematical model not only integrates gene expression data, but also provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic behavior or static expression of gene regulatory networks. At present, the mainstream methods of modeling control network include Petri net, Bayesian network and differential equation model.
In many methods, the differential equation can"

Abstract
The Tristable switch was derived from advanced studies of other synthetic networks like toggle switches and oscillators. We think it would be helpful to create a synthetic network which produces distinct signals under specific induction. We hope to create a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while preventing signal interference. During data-mining, we noticed that iGEM Team Brown University has tried to build tristable switches in 2006 and 2007 but had low outputs. Therefore, we troubleshot and investigated improvements that can be applied to their design."

Can I contribute to the openProtocol project?
Absolutely!  We are particularly interested in recruiting new members to our team that have expertise in versioning control systems, the jQuery javascript framework, and scaling database solutions.  Others are also welcome: get in touch with our project lead Eric at eric.meltzer at google's popular webmail client dot com.
If you have any other questions, let us know at openprotocol @ that google mail product dot com.
Collaboration
Our vision for openProtocol actually started when we saw a comic-book protocol produced by Gingko Bioworks last year at Foo Camp.  We realized that comic-book style protocols could be very information dense and at the same time be easy to use for beginners.  Inspired, we began to draw sketches for a series of comic-style protocols, and hacked together some javascript to make creating and editing them easier.
Once we had a sort of storyboard going for how these books would look, we sent it to our partners at UCSF and asked for their help in taking pictures and producing a test run: a mini-prep comic book.  As it turned out, the original form of a comic book isn't actually that great for biological protocols.  There are many steps for which a picture is totally useless, which left us and our UCSF buddies scratching our heads (its very hard to take a picture of a pipette adding 1uL of liquid to a tube...)
Still, we felt that there are some steps for which pictures (and even video) are incredibly helpful.  Back to the drawing board! The next iteration of our design was essentially a comic-book type layout but with some text overlays... it was a mess.  UCSF patiently continued to provide us with the raw pictures and video of their molecular experiments that we needed during this most trying of times.
Finally, we realized that what was most compelling about the idea of a multimedia protocol was not necessarily the comic book layout, but merely the ability to put pictures, video, and audio in whenever you needed them.  We also realized that being able to share these protocols was going to be incredibly important.  Since we had benefited so much from UCSF's real life feedback on the earlier versions, we had a meeting with a group of students in Paris who are dedicated to providing low-cost protocols for science in developing countries, and got some of their feedback on what they would want in a protocol.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," homologous to part of the chromosome. The linear DNA fragment was electroporated into bacteria containing the pKD46 plasmid, encoding the red λ recombinase Thompson JF, de Vargas LM, Skinner SE, Landy A. Protein-protein interactions in a higher-order structure direct lambda site-specific recombination. Journal of molecular biology. 1987;195(3):481-93. , which mediated the recombination. The fundamental concept of this approach is illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3. The principle behind the recombination. By PCR, the two flanking sequences are assembled with the fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene (camR), the OmpR-regulated promoter, and the relE gene. The flanking sequences are homologous to part of the chromosome around the bacterial attachment site (attB), enabling the homologous recombination.
Using this approach, it was attempted to assemble the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RelE with the flanking regions by PCR. The assembly of the fragment derived from the plasmid with either one of the flanking fragments was achieved. However, the assembly of the complete chromosomal insertion fragment containing all three segments emerged problematic. Several attempts with numerous process optimisations were performed, but unfortunately without success. To circumvent this, another attachment site was chosen. The assembly of the complete fragment by PCR was achieved and chromosomal insertion by electroporation was attempted several times, but in vain. In consideration of the fact that RelE is a bacterial toxin, the cloning of this gene was inconvenient. The model indicated, that overexpression of the antitoxin RelB would bypass this difficulty. As the homologous recombination of this fragment emerged such a challenging task, it was decided to focus on the conduct of the OmpR-regulated promoter on different plasmids, as this was evidently the more convenient approach of the general implementation of the OmpR-regulated promoter.
An Inducible Promoter was Chosen to Regulate the Gene Expression of the Antitoxin RelB
Originally, it was thought to place the antitoxin RelB under a constitutive promoter of appropriate strength. However, as the modelling revealed, strict regulation of RelB is essential to counteract the toxic effect of RelE and enable a functional dormancy system. Thus, it was deduced that it would be more suitable to utilise an inducible promoter for this purpose and it was decided to put RelB under control of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Consuelo sent us another database from which to extract information to create a more complete parts datasheet: BioFab.com. BioFab’s projects are aimed to sharing information on the parts they themselves develop, but looking through how they organize this data gives us another idea of how our datasheets can look. Unfortunately, their database, C-dog is not searchable. They instead list out the and instead organize them by their name, construct, description, mean fluorescence per cell, and standard deviation. Choosing to organize them by name though is a bit frustrating. Each of their parts has the same prefix, “apFAB” followed by some number. Unfortunately, because they don’t precede these numbers with 0’s to ensure that 47 is not considered greater than 101 because the leading digit, 4, is greater than 1, then the order is not correct. However, I assume they provide information on standard deviation and mean fluorescence per cell because they are a major factor in helping biologists decide which part they need. We’ve started to finish up creating a more comprehensive data sheet using the information from the Parts Registry as listed by Linda in a document. However, because the pages are incomplete we are unable to extract some of the points. We still have to work on Web Crawlers for other databases, like BioFab and others, and customize the old Web Crawler for PubMed to extract information on parts instead of genes.
Day 20: June 25, 2012
Until we get a response from our source about where to obtain more of the information we need to complete the data sheet, the code we have so far is essentially complete. Veronica and I managed to finish debugging and cleaning up our code (commenting, creating properties, etc.). This version of the crawler is only able to handle Parts pages. Because we were able to finish debugging before the end of the day, we try to use the HTML Agility Pack to try to parse through the other types of pages and try to extract all the content within the HTML and CSS style tags. Unfortunately, we ended up in a dead end because the resulting output was a mess due to the page’s formatting. Some pages just had headers and text, which was easy enough to interpret and if we had spent a bit more time we could have tried making the output relatively more readable for the reader. But, a lot of pages contained images, captions to these images, tables, and other representations of information, so the subsequent output was too much of a mess to read through. Instead, we’ll just have the Crawler process Parts pages, so next time we have"

Parts
We have characterized and submitted 25 BioBricks which could either be used directly or serve as a universal tool readily for potential scientific or engineering use.
   Those BioBricks could be divided into four groups.     1.BioBricks in Basic Parts are all basic components of the whole project. They can be assembled to carry out different tasks.     2.BioBricks in USB is our designed sequence. They can help us easily and quickly insert our target sequence and make a whole part.     3.BioBricks in application is our complete part.     4.BioBricks in New TAL is our new design TAL parts which are robust and perform better in Golden Gate method.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," through the rumen wall into the bloodstream, serving as a main source of energy. Unfortunately, alongside the VFAs greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are produced and released into the atmosphere by eructation.
All rumen microbes are well adapted to the conditions prevailing in this special ecosystem. Its temperature averages at about 39°C, but is also dependent on external influences. The pH value is relatively constant, ranging between about 6.5 and 7.0, although acids are permanently produced – this constancy is due to bicarbonate contained in and swallowed with the saliva and to ammonium set free in the course of the deamination of amino acids. Under certain nutritional conditions, though, stronger deviations of the pH value may occur due to the rapid proliferation of bacteria like Streptococcus bovis which produce lactic acid.
In newborn ruminants, the microflora and -fauna of the rumen is not yet properly developed. However, through contact with the mother animal or aerosols a rapid colonization occurs and a microbial population emerges, ensuring the functionality of the rumen. In the view of this, it is imaginable to influence the fermentation processes in the rumen by dispensing microbial probiotics to the calf directing the composition of the population in a certain way. Furthermore, there are different approaches to particularly influence methane production inside the rumen by dispensing so-called direct-fed microbial (DFM); these are, however, as yet restricted to making use of alternative metabolic pathways competing with methanogenesis.

Two parallel                             experiments were performed to determine whether there was a deviation in the results of our                             previous experiments.

Following the last experiment, we thought that 500 ng/mL antigen fixation is currently                             reasonable. So we did the effect of antibody concentration of 1000 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL at                             an                             antigen concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figure (6) a, b), where we will self-assemble the upper                             and                             lower slides. And considering the damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the                             self-assembly                             of the slide, the slide was dried at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the                             same                             time, the antigen fixation process still adopts the method of soaking. Three sets of                             parallel                             experiments were performed separately.
Then we also made a set of antigen concentration of 500 ng / ml, antibody concentration of                             1500                             ng / ml (Figure (6) c). However, the method of soaking the immobilized antigen was not                             adopted,                             but the previous dropping method was employed.

Improving on Neptune
The control syringe system we implemented in TERRA was repurposed from the 2016 Boston University iGEM Hardware Team, Neptune. Neptune designed an end to end design suite for continuous flow microfluidics, which helped automate the microfluidic design process. The team coupled this design software with DIY syringe pumps hardware, which are responsible for inputting flow into the microfluidic chip, to increase the accessibility of microfluidics due to the high cost of retail syringe pumps.
Our team decided to repurpose Neptune’s syringe pump hardware to develop our control syringe system because they already went through the process of designing and validating a DIY platform for automating syringe movement. In addition, since the syringe pumps were used to gradually push a syringe to dispense at a constant rate, they were able to demonstrate a high degree of controllability with their hardware platform. This gave us the confidence to reuse their hardware platform for our control syringe system in TERRA.
However, because of the difference in application between Neptune and TERRA, we needed to update the software operating the syringes. TERRA’s control syringe system is responsible for actuating control valves on the TERRA Adapter as opposed to inputting constant flow. In addition, the control syringes needed to work alongside the other components of TERRA, particularly the XY Plane and UI. To accomplish this the control syringes system needed to be able to sustain on/off states based on the output selection system on the TERRA Adapter in order to dispense the proper product into the vessel. In order to execute this, we programmed the servo motors for the syringes to move and hold certain positions based on the experiment protocol given by the user. These positions would last for a certain duration, depending on how long an output is selected for. Then, based on the experiment protocol from the UI, these on/off states were coupled with specific outputs on the microfluidic chip to control which when they would be dispensed and how much. These improvements to the software enables us to reuse the hardware for a wider range of"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," close relationship between urbanization and IBD [19]. In Asia, the high incidence of                         IBD is mainly found in some highly urbanized areas, such as Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou,                         while residents and rural residents in some less industrialized areas show lower morbidity                         [14]. People who flood into cities have access to better health care and sanitation, but the                         abuse of antibiotics and overly hygienic habits can interfere with normal gut flora [5, 20]. In                         addition, due to the poor quality of air condition, heavy mental stress, a more sedentary                         lifestyle and consumption of high-fat foods, people who live in a developed city are more                         likely to get IBD [5, 20]. At present, the incidence of IBD in Asia is rising rapidly. In Hong                         Kong, for example, the number of cases increased by 30 times from 1985 to 2014 [21], and the                         gastroenterology ward was crowded with young IBD patients [20].
Western diets are broadly defined as containing high amounts of saturated fat, red meat, sugar                         and low amounts of fruit, vegetables, grains, seafood, poultry meat [17]. Studies have                         confirmed the association between Western diet and the pathogenesis of IBD [22, 23]. In                         addition, immigration studies showed that people move from developing countries to developed                         countries and adopt to Western lifestyles are more likely to suffer from IBD.
In the long run, the incidence of IBD in Asia will soon be similar to Europe and America [20].                         To make matters worse, compared with European and American countries, the efforts of Asian                         countries to cope with the medical and economic burden of IBD are seriously inadequate [20]. In                         addition, many patients who have been sick for a long time are unaware of the fact that they                         have IBD, which leads to underdiagnosis of IBD [20].
5. Current therapies
The treatment of IBD is very complicated. Traditionally, IBD has been treated with Step up                         therapy, which starts at a certain level depending on the severity of the disease, and                         gradually escalates the therapy when the lower-level therapy fails [25]. The order from low to                         high is as follows: aminosalicylic acid preparation (aspirin) → glucocorticoid →                         immunosuppressant (azathioprine) →biological agents (anti-TNF) → surgery [26]. This routine                         step up treatment is not suitable for patients at risk of rapid disease progression and may                         delay"

UIUC_Illinois,2018,Team:UIUC Illinois#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," fact of the matter is, people don't trust GM products to that extent. If I tried to sell that, I would lose almost all  of my business. I think the technology you are working with could do a lot of good in industrial applications like cellulosic ethanol; but I don't think it  is viable for something people directly consume.
Q3: Do you think there will ever be a market for specialty brewing with GM organisms?
A3: No, I don't.
While it was fascinating to talk with Mr. Riggs about his many years of experience in brewing, we ultimately decided to move our project focus away from brewing applications after this interview.
We also attended the CABBI (Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproduct Innovation) annual retreat, where we spoke with researchers, such as Dr. Ting Lu, dedicated to converting biomass into usable products. They gave us suggestions on how to improve the industrial viability of our system, such as testing its behavior under anaerobic conditions rather than aerobic. Most industrial-scale bioreactors function under anaerobic conditions in order to limit the amount of carbon leaving the system as carbon dioxide. This maximizes the amount of carbon that can be converted into the desired product.
Many of the researchers at this retreat agreed that a multi-organism system like the one we were working with could have profound advantages in the context of bioprocessing. After having the opportunity to speak with these experts, it was clear to us that we wanted to take our project in an industrially-oriented direction.
Cabbi Annual Retreat
Pictures from when we presented our work at the CABBI annual retreat where we had active dialogue with professionals in the research community. We discussed about iGEM requirements, RFC 10 standard, and even synthetic biology as a whole. The research professionals who stopped by our poster gave us advice on how to improve our project to get better results.
Closer to the end of our summer, one of our members came across the wiki page for the 2016 Leiden iGEM team . They were experimenting with the effects of microgravity on gene expression. Instantly enamored with this, one of our members set out to see if we could integrate this into our project. He reached out to Abhishek Dhoble, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the University of Illinois. Dr. Dhoble designs and tests anaerobic digesters for space missions. He has dedicated a substantial amount of his career to the study of microbiomes  in microgravity. ""One of the largest barriers to microgravity research"", Dr."
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," it takes might change. Peptides cannot arrive directly since larvae do not feed on their own: on their first 3 days, larvae are fed jelly, and with bee bread the following three. He also gave us a first draft of the path the peptides follow: from the digestive system to the hemolymph and finally to the hypopharyngeal glands in the head where they produce royal jelly.
Adult bees are not affected by P. larvae. In fact, in their digestive system, there is an anatomical structure called proventriculus and can close when the time comes to purify the food. He shared with us a new fact about hygienic behavior. As brood infected with AFB begin metamorphosis, proteolytic enzymes from P. larvae degrade fibers and reduce them to pure viscose biomass. Bees organs in their antennas can sense this decomposition; cleaner bees then break through the capped cell, remove the corpse, and clean the cell. All colonies of beehives exhibit this behavior being in some more marked than in others.
We mentioned the possibility of adding the solution cell by cell, but he said we must think of the beekeeper. This just isn’t scalable for 3,000 or 4,000 boxes. We realized here that the easier the application, the more attractive the product. This made us think of secondary factors that influence our products viability, other than its antimicrobial ability. This is further discussed in our business model . He noted that if the product is applied to cure it is susceptible to apply directly in the cells as mentioned above since in an apiary of 20 to 30 hives, this disease can be initiated in 2 or 3 of them, however, it should be applied as a preventive measure throughout the apiary.
He mentioned that we should consider the effect our product would have on the bee's usual microbiome. He asked us whether our product was a remedy or a preventive measure. We answered that the design wasn't enough to pick one or the other, and it might be both.
Finally, he recommended articles and contacts for further information. He put us in contact with MSc Alejandro Romo, MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, and Dr. Alfonso Arroyo.
He congratulated us for our work; he found our efforts and interest fascinating, especially when we put it to work to help the beekeeper community up close. He encouraged us to keep at it and invited us to the XXVI International Congress for Beekeeping Updates in 2019 .
The chat was enlightening, and gave us valuable information for our"

    Through genomic mutation and high-throughput screening, we obtained a strain L. lactis WH101 with good acid resistance at pH 5.0 from 35,000 strains. Next, we compared the NZ9000 and WH101 by transcriptomics analysis and mathematical model and obtain key acid resistant components—msmK gene.
    The survival rate of L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 in acid stress result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-flood higher survival rate than parent one after 3 hours at pH 4.0.

    Before the acid stress, the cell structure of the control strain and the recombinant strain remained intact. After 3 h of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on"

Vaccine Platform
This project was based on a past UVA iGEM project on minicells. We tried to use this minicell as a vaccine platform using Wolbachia Surface protein as an immunogenicity factor/adjuvant for other protein that are not very immunogenic. Our goal was to immunize animal vectors and make them immune to the Lyme bacteria. We were going to use 4 common surface proteins from Lyme: OspA, OspC, DbpA, and DbPB. We selected these proteins because based on research they are the most common protein that are expressed in the different animal vectors. Unfortunately due to the lack of resources and the need to focus, we are putting this project in our drawer for future use.
Bacteria mimic/Living vaccine project
Idea
After researching for the vaccine platform, we realized that the only component needed for the Lyme bacteria to colonize the Tick's gut was OspA. We started brain storming as how we could use it to combat Lyme disease. We first thought of making a bacteria that can secrete the Tick Receptor of OspA protein (TROSPA), which was shown to be active and able to bind in its soluble and truncated form to the Lyme bacteria's OspA. We quickly realized that our secreted protein may not co-localized with Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme bacteria) and therefore be ineffective. This is how the idea of making a mimic came about, if we wanted our bacteria to co-localize with the Lyme bacteria then our bacteria would have to resemble Lyme. And the only protein needed to accomplish this is OspA. Through our research we also realized that this technique can potentially work for other insect born diseases. The only problem that we had was how to vertically transfer (parent to offspring) our mimic to the next generation of ticks, so they are also vaccinated against Lyme disease. We knew the key was the sex cells and we found our answer on another bacteria, a symbiot called Wolbachia. Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) is responsible for bacteria host interaction"

A Statewide Standard
During our outreach programs, we noticed that many students were ready to learn about synthetic biology, but had not yet been exposed to the science. To address this issue, our team worked with the Virginia Department of Education to update the Standards of Learning to include synthetic biology. Standards of Learning (SOL) dictate what subjects are taught in all public schools in Virginia; by altering them, we are exposing over a million students to relevant information about synthetic biology. Our team received NASA mini-proposal funding to support teachers in the change through the creation of a continuing education course. The course explores synthetic biology and its potential applications in space. In addition, we have partnered with Thermofisher Scientific to improve Virginia student access to bioengineering lab experiences.
Virginia Department of Education
Throughout our summer outreach, we noticed that most high school students were in the process of learning about DNA and genome editing; however, they had never been exposed to the modern applications and techniques used in bioengineering. After discussing with teachers and researching the current teaching standards, we learned that the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) had not been updated since 2010 and held an outdated representation of synthetic biology.
The Current Biology Standards State: The student will investigate and understand common mechanisms of inheritance and protein synthesis. Key concepts include exploration of the impact of DNA technologies.
The Standards and the 2010 Curriculum Framework do not include modern technologies like CRISPR-cas, DNA transformation, or the advancements of DNA sequencing. Instead, the standard and framework focus primarily on the human genome project, ethics and eugenics and cloning. These examples no longer encompass all that is possible and relevant in synthetic biology.
As synthetic biology grows it becomes more important for students of every discipline to have an up to date understanding of the science. Additionally, because synthetic biology is inherently multidisciplinary, students who hope to work in any STEM field will ultimately benefit from a strong understanding of bioengineering. To broaden our reach and ensure we could impact as many people as possible, our"
BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we would require the modelling work to suggest that this was indeed possible before any effort was made to maintain chemotaxis upon adhesion by either of the above strategies.
In light of this, the focus of the lab work will move towards producing proof-of-concept BioBricks that will allow us to demonstrate the communication of an adhesion event from an adhered to an unadhered bacteria. This can be achieved  making extensive use of the available BioBricks. Specifically, sender cells (cells that have adhered to beads and are trying to communicate with unadhered cells), will contain the LuxI-GFP portion of BBa_J37015, fused downstream of a CpxR responsive promoter (modified from current version fused to LacZ provided courtesy of T.Silhavy, Princeton). Upon adhesion to beads, LuxI will produce AHL, which will diffuse into the medium, while GFP will give confirmation that the transcript is working. For receiver cells we will test both BBa_T9002 and BBa_I731014, which produce GFP and mCherry respectively upon activation by AHL. We will also BioBrick the CpxR responsive promoter itself, and aim to fuse BBa_E0840 (GFP) to the CxpR responsive promoter, creating a nice visual assay for adhesion (the CpxR-LuxI-GFP BioBrick will also do this, but producing AHL in addition may not be ideal for certain future applications). Therefore in total we aim to produce 3 BioBricks in total.
2nd September - 9th September
Biobrick transformations
A series of biobrick transformations (J37015, T9002, E0840 and I731014) were performed using electro-competent DH5α cells.  After several attempts, only J37015 and T9002 appeared to work, but after carrying out colony PCR on the transformed bacteria we found that the J37015 part doesn’t appear to be in its plasmid (pSB1A3).  The T9002 transformation, however, was successful, and this was verified by plasmid mini-prep and subsequent test digestion.  Its activity as a luxR GFP receiver construct was also confirmed, by testing the fluorescence of the transformed bacteria when incubated with two different concentrations of AHL.  (No GFP was produced in the control, un-transformed, bacteria).   Since we have tried several times, unsuccessfully, to transform the other biobricks, strains already transformed with these biobricks were requested from iGEM HQ.

Carbon Fixation
Approach
Engineering E. coli to Perform the Calvin Cycle
In order to engineer E. coli in the outer chamber to turn atmospheric CO2 into cellulose, the carbon first needs to be fixated by the bacteria. This requires the heterologous expression of the genes encoding the three enzymes RuBisCo, SBPase, and PRK. In correspondence with the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team , who worked with a similar subpart of their project, we discussed the cloning of these genes and received two crucial parts. The first of this was BBa_K1465214 , containing RubisCO from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and PRK from Synechococcus elongatus under the control of a composite promoter controllable by IPTG. The second was BBa_K1465228 , which contained SBPase from Bacillus methanolicus. Through the concurrent expression of these parts in E. coli, all enzymes required to fixate CO2 through the Calvin cycle were present in the cells.
The first approach was to assemble both parts on one plasmid by molecular cloning, as shown on Figure 1. In doing this, it was discovered that the BBa_K1465214 part was missing roughly 1 kbp when digested with standard restriction enzymes with recognition sites within the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Sequencing of the part revealed that the part was missing the entire promoter sequence of 1239 bp. Consequently, the assembly of the parts additionally required the cloning of a promoter. For this purpose, the Tac-promoter (Ptac) from the part BBa_K864400 was chosen, as this is commonly used to overexpress genes in E. coli. With the objective to place the two Calvin cycle parts on different vectors, it was attempted to clone Ptac in front of both parts. However, this did not succeed and it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth.
Implementing the Carboxysome in E. coli to Increase Carbon Fixation Efficiency
The implementation of the microcompartment carboxysome in the test organism can increase the efficiency of the carbon fixation process substantially. As for the Calvin cycle parts, we corresponded with the 2014 Bielefeld iG"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Discussion
A novel integrative vector for E. coli has been successfully designed, constructed and used to integrate two proof of concept protein expression systems in two commonly used E. coli strains.
The results showed that the vector is fully functional and can integrate into the correct targeted locus of the host chromosome through the Phi80 site-specific recombination system by using <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo>, an existing BioBrick helper plasmid from the Registry. In most cases, the integration occurs in tandem copies, probably because of the too high Chloramphenicol concentration used during the selection of integrants, which forces multiple integration of Cm-resistant constructs. This concentration was the same used during the pSC101 low copy plasmid (~5 copies per cell) selection. In some cases, it is desirable to have a single copy of the desired BioBrick in the genome, for example when the gene dosage is important. In [Haldimann A and Wanner BL, 2001] the usage of Chloramphenicol at 6 ug/ml yielded a very high percentage of single integrants. However, when tested in our lab, the MG1655 strain could survive on LB plates with Cm at 6 ug/ml and also at 8 ug/ml. For this reason a higher concentration of Cm was chosen for selection. Further studies should investigate the optimal antibiotic concentration to yield the highest single integrants percentage as possible.
The Flp/FRT mediated excision of the R6K and, most importantly, of the Cm resistance marker also worked by using the pCP20 helper plasmid. The estimated efficiency of this process was 100%. In addition, multiple tandem integrants became single integrants after the marker excision. This is because the Flp recombinase mediated the recombination of all the FRT sites of the multiple integrants until only a single FRT site was present"

The iGEM-team from Heifei University of Technology is doing a software project called the BioDesigner , made with the purpose of making BioBrick information more accessible through improved searching and documentation. As we had previously written a script with a similar purpose, we can definitely see the value of such a project. They were surveying what sort of functionality other teams would be interested in having in such software; we gave feedback on what we'd like to see, as well as asking how feasible those implementations would be as not all the information we'd be interested in would necessarily be easily collectable from the iGEM webpages. We also actively tested the software and provided feedback on functionality, design, and things we thought were lacking and unnecessary.

Target of evaluation
In the part of system analysis, we have talked about the influence of promoter strengths and plasmid copy numbers to initial steady states and expression level of gene elements after sensing nicotine. The goal of our project is to detect nicotine and transform nicotine to more valuable chemicals, so it is necessary to evaluate the performance of sensing system like threshold and timeliness. Besides, because part of nicotine is degraded to 6-Hydroxynicotine which is out of the pathway of 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine metabolism, we need to calculate the rate of nicotine transformed to the target product. Parameter sweep provides us appropriate parameter intervals for system design, so effectiveness analysis is based on these parameter settings (s2 = 0.5, s1 = 0.5, plamid1 copy number =10, plasmid2 copy number = 10). We mainly focus on the threshold of sensor, time point suitable for fluorescence measurement, the recycle rate and the relationship between nicotine input, promoter1 strength and these three properties.
Threshold of sensing system
The usage of sensing system is to detect the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium, so it has its own detection limit. Besides, in consideration of the complexity of the system, its sensitivity to nicotine input may vary a lot with different concentration of nicotine input. The combination of parameters is another important factor in the discussion of threshold and sensitivity because both low nicotine input and low expression of Vppa leads to inadequate 6-Hydroxynicotine to release the hdnoR repression of GFP signal.
Figure 1 GFP with s1, nicotine input
Figure 2 GFP heat-map
The nicotine input we set is within the interval of [1e-5,1] M and the strength of promoter in is within [0,1]. To get the full vision of GFP change along the time span, the simulation runs for 200000 s. From figure 1 and figure 2, we find that the maximal GFP concentration ranges from 0 to about 2000 nM with the increase of nicotine"

The motility of both strains was tested under different conditions:
- agar concentration: 0.3 % and 0.5 %
- incubation temperatures: 25oC and 30oC
The OD600 was adjusted to 1.25 and the bacteria were inoculated in the middle of an LB-plate without yeast extract, but with streptomycin. After an incubation overnight there was no growth of MG1655 visible, because only MC1000 is resistant. Therefore, the experiment should be repeated.
The motility comparison experiment was repeated, but this time only the plates for MC1000 contained streptomycin. None of the 0.5% agar showed growth. Overall MG1655 swarms were possibly slightly larger than MC1000 (in Cambridge 06' MC1000 had much greater motility than MG1655). The growth/motility of MC1000 might be disturbed because, in contrast to MG1655, the bacteria had to deal with an antibiotic. Thus, the experiment will be repeated without any antibiotics in the agar.
23rd July - 29th July
BioBrick Transformation
The cells transformed with BioBrick were grown on ampicillin plates as if transformed are able to do so, however there was no growth of bacteria except when pUC19 was used. This highlights some problems with the DNA and not the actual transformation. The experiment was repeated with larger amounts of TE buffer around spot and with a different BioBrick. Results see weekly summary.
Bead experiment 1
The bead we had focused on overnight (see 22 July 2008 ) had gone!! There were observed lots of beads clumping together, areas of dead/non-motile bacteria and also filamentous bacteria (possible conaminant). There were also areas of still motile bacteria.  The bacteria had travelled 40 % of way across bridge, thus a smaller bridge was suggested.
Swimming agar assay
The experiment from 21 July 2008 was repeated. The aspartate solution was added eigth hours before the inoculation. The Results for showed that both strains were actually repelled by aspartate, possibly because the concentration was too high. Aspartate is the well on the right, and the control (water) is on the left.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html," diet that is rich in lycopene, which given the price and availability of these fruits, especially watermelon, could in the long term be a more economical solution.
DESIGN
We combined the lycopene BioBrick already existing in the registry with the NarK promoter in order to control the expression of lycopene. The BioBrick falls into two parts:
Sensing The promoter senses oxidative stress and in response turns on transcription of the downstream genes.
Responding The gene for the antioxidant, lycopene is turned on as a response to oxidative stress.
Lycopene-NarK initial design:
 
 
Simplified diagram of our lycopene BioBrick. Further design steps:
1. Removal of illegal restriction sites within the gene through silent mutations.
2. In order to minimise the time to receive DNA from IDT, design steps were taken in order to put these into gBlock format. This required splitting up of the rather large gene construct into 4 parts of around 500 bp as well as consideration for the collating of the parts into one by Infusion.
The final outcome was a composite BioBrick, BBa_K1954001 , which we submitted to the registry.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We wanted to find validated protocols for the expression and detection of lycopene. Firstly we wanted to induce oxidative stress. After several options were considered, from nitrogen gas to hydrogen peroxide we went with a protocol involving nitrate, nitrite and NO. Secondly we wanted to measure lycopene. We adapted the protocol used by Cambridge 2009 iGEM as they had success and produced data, suggesting we would also be able to follow this.
The detection of Lycopene is simple since it has a distinctive red colour enabling it to be determined by spectrophotometry. The protocols can be read here .

mNARK lycopene enables ecoli growth under Hypoxia conditions
Hypoxia is a condition in which cells are deprived of oxygen due to low concentration of oxygen in the extracellular milieu. In humans, low oxygen levels in the blood affect tissues. Oxygen is essential for diverse cellular functions, such as catabolic and anabolic processes, and low intracellular concentrations have a negative impact on cell functions and survival.
Oxygen deficit can have a severe impact on cellular function, as seen in cell stress. The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Y"

Transformation of CACCI
In the future, CACCI will not just CACCI(that is characterization of antibiotics concentration based on chemotaxis and interference). Because of any possible molecules response promoter with integrated improvement in both chemotaxis and permeability. CACCI is able to detect anything in water as you wish. May we should substitute 'A' in CACCI in to '#', Let's say it C#CCI, or more academically, SBI, Standardized Biological Interface. As long as you get the bacteria powder you need, you can carry out experiments based on it or engineer it directly on it. My dear friend, isn't it cool?
SBI contains several modules:
Integrated Improvement(IITwins). This is constructed by us, which is able to share after packaging SBI. See how to package bacteria: Protocol: Package our CACCI .
Editable Biological Circuit(EBC). We provided several possible signal sensing circuits with amplification or modification for you, accompanied with USTC-Software's project, you are able to generate your own genetic circuit used to response molecules you wanna detect. In the furture, NDM will be not just Nanomachines Detecting Microbiotics, but Nanomachines Detecting Materials. Everyone can edit them and operate them!
Adhesion Preparation in Wide Adaptability(APWA). Two adhesion strategy is very widely adaptable for every user to construct new bacteria. Strategy I is based on polylysine coating, which doesn't need any genetic engineering. Though, Strategy II demands strict genetic modification, we are still able to share the bacteria with IITwins and tRNA plasmid in powder.
In the future, SBI will be collected in a professional database. You could find your SBI in a more convenient and accurate way.
We could expect the day when SBI is finally established and widely used. Synthetic biology would not just share parts, those genetic modules packaged in plasmid, but share devices, different specific functional modules packaged in bacteria. We are looking forward to that moment.
More Convenient User Experience
In the future, our GUI, that is graphic user interface, will finally be packaged in python, and it is for everyone. You can download it and install it for free. And now, GUI version in Matlab has already uploaded to Github, you can get them at: Github-USTC . We are very glad to share our ideas and get better.

Quantitative Indigoidine Production Assay
1. OD Spectrum Measurement
96-well plates are prepared with 100 µl LB-medium/well containing appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol and kanamycin for the indigoidine and PPTase contrcuts, respectively) and each well is inoculated with single colonies (in duplicates) from plates positive for the co-tansformation experiments i.e. from plates with blue colonies. Two sets of negative controls are also inoculated on the plate: First, pure medium serving as the baseline for background correction for the OD measurements. Second, transformation controls accounting for potential differences in cell growth due to expression of proteins contained on the plasmids, i.e. the antibitotic resistance gene and IndC. In this set of controls, the plasmid used in co-transformation with the PPTase plasmid contains IndC-constructs carrying a randomly generated sequence instead of the T-domain.  A second 96 well plate was prepared with 180 µl LB-medium/well for the measurement itself. The 96-well plate containing the pre-cultures of the co-transformed colonies was inoculated for 24 hours at 37°C. Subsequently, 20 µl of the pre-culture was transferred to the measurement plate. The absorbance of the bacterial cultures was measured at wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm in intervals of 10 nm for each well every 30 min for 30 hours at 30°C in a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader. For the measurement plate, Greiner 96-well flat black plates with a clear lid were used.
2. Data Analysis
Detecting the amount of the NRP expressed by the bacterial host strain is desirable. By tagging the NRP with indigoidine, the amount of the fusion peptide can be determined by quantifying the amount of blue pigment present in the cells. As the amount of blue pigment is proportional to the amount of the NRP of interest, a method for the quantification of the blue pigment will yield information about the expression of the NRP. Quantification of the pure indigoidine pigment can be easily achieved by optical density (OD) measurements at its maximum wavelength of about 590 nm. In cellular culture, indigoidine quantification by OD measurements is impaired. Cellular density of liquid cultures is standardly measured as the optical density (OD) at a wave length of 600 nm, i. e.  the absorption peak of indigoidine interferes with"

The UC Berkeley iGEM Team of 2008 started the Clotho software project to provide a suite of software tools for synthetic biology. Since then, Clotho has evolved into a platform on which new software tools can be developed. Clotho as a platform factors out the common functionality that many software tools would provide, thus allowing new tools to be developed more quickly and making it easy to integrate new tools with existing tools.  More importantly, anyone can now write a tool that will work seamlessly with other Clotho tools.  In this regard, you can think of Clotho like the an iPhone.  Anyone can write an App, and the platform facilitates its creation, distribution, and operation.  The Clotho project has also expanded beyond the walls of UC Berkeley to include collaborators in the BIOFab, JBEI, Boston University, University of Washington, Autodesk, and the DIY community.  Perhaps you’ll join the movement as well!
This summer, the 2010 Berkeley iGEM Team is proud to release Clotho 2.0 which completes Clotho’s transition to a community resource for open tool development based on a standardized API.  Though the overall effort included the work of many folks outside the iGEM team, our iGEM group was responsible for developing the new internal architecture of Clotho and implementing its first set of Apps.  Clotho 2.0 now features the robust Netbeans plugin platform App platform , a reworked framework for automating workflows framework for automating workflows, as well as a shift from dynamic data models to a static Clotho data model Clotho data model . Read more about these new features here on our wiki, or visit our new public website for more information and to download our wonderful tool!

Abstract
What is bioHYDRA?
BioHYDRA is a project to create biological artificial muscles that respond to changes in humidity. This past year, Chen et al. [1] at Columbia University devised a way to utilize the power of evaporation and the way Bacillus spores expand and contract depending on ambient humidity in order to create contractile structures coined as “HYDRA” (Hygroscopy driven artificial muscles). We wanted to improve on this technology by creating fully biological hydras, using cellulose instead of polyimide, and incorporating cellulose binding sites on the spore coats instead of using artificial artificial glue. By affixing the ends of these HYDRAs to a given substrate, we could produce a folding mechanism that not responds to humidity, but is also reversible.
See our BioBricks
Introduction
How spores and the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM team first met
In our search for a folding mechanism for biOrigami, we wanted to find a something that wasn't a material, but a biological agent that could contract and at the same time have high resistance to harsh environments. That is how we first met bacterial spores. But, bacterial spores are usually thought of as inert, hibernating organisms with little to no metabolic function.  So how can these actually be useful to us?
In response to stressful environmental conditions, vegetative Bacillus subtilis will sporulate to produce robust organisms called spores, which can survive in extreme conditions for many years. To be able to germinate and regain full vegetative function, they have to maintain a certain internal environment so as to preserve the integrity of its organelles while in spore form. To regulate the humidity content in the spore core, B. subtilis have adapted by changing the shape of"

Analysis protocol
Our team decided to test the fluorescence with a TECAN infiniteM200 in 96 well plates. Each assay were performed after a 16 - 18 h preculture on 5 ml of LB medium at 37°C with 220 rpm agitation. Cultures were distributed 200 µl per well. Three strains per constructions were tested in five replicates. Two controls were added on plates: LB  with chloramphenicol and the strain carrying the promoterless vector on LB  with chloramphenicol.
Fluorescence data were analyzed via following formula that come from 2010 De Jong et al Experimental and computational validation of models of fluorescent and luminescent reporter genes in bacteria .
Equation A: A(t) is the corrected absorbance of DH5 alpha with the functional reporter system, Au(t)the uncorrected   absorbance of DH5 alpha with the functional reporter system and Ab(t)the background absorbance corresponding to LB  with chloramphenicol medium absorbance.
Equation B: B(t) is the absorbance of the strain carrying the promoterless vector, Iu(t) the uncorrected fluorescence intensity of DH5 alpha with the functional reporter system and Ib(t) the background fluorescence intensity of LB chloramphenicol medium with the DH5 alpha carrying the promoterless vector.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," constraint \(c_i\) can be expressed as a sum of all \(r_j\) weighted by the stoichiometric coefficients \(a_{ij}\), where \(a_{ij}\) = 0 for reactions that do not affect the concentration of the considered metabolite. Thus,                $$           c_i(r) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^R a_{ij}r_j       $$               Which is just a generalization of the constraints of the two-metabolite network presented in the previous section. In addition to the steady-state constraints on the metabolites, for each reaction rate, \(r_j\), there is a lower and an upper bound (\(l_j\) and \(u_j\)). These inequality constraints can be expressed as,            $$          \begin{split}              c_{j,l} &= r_j \geq l_j  \iff r_j - l_j \geq 0 \\              c_{j,u} &= r_j \leq u_j \iff -r_j + u_j \geq 0          \end{split}      $$            Having the objective function and the constraints well-stated, the linear program 6 can be formulated in standard form:            $$          \begin{split}              \max \quad & f(x) \\              s.t. \quad c_i &= 0 \quad \forall i \\              c_j &\geq 0 \quad \forall j          \end{split}      $$            Solving this program is equal to optimizing the genome-scale model. In order to accomplish that, it is necessary to define the so-called Lagrangian Function.
Solution to FBA and Shadow Prices
For each constraint \(c_i\) on the metabolite \(m_i\), let \(\lambda_i\) be the associated Lagrange multiplier 7 or shadow price, let \(\lambda = (\lambda_i,...,\lambda_M)\) and let \(c = (c_1,...,c_M, c_{M+1}...,c_{M+R})\). Now, define the Lagrangian function:              $$           \mathcal{L}(\lambda,r) = f(r) + \lambda^Tc(r)       $$              The solution to the linear program is then found by maximizing the gradient of the Lagrangian, \(\bigtriangledown \mathcal{L}(\lambda,c,r)\) , while satisfying all constraints, i.e. by solving the system,              $$           \begin{pmatrix}               \bigtriangledown \"
Wisconsin-Madison,2012,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#lemon_-_-_TEXT.html," ispA gene.
As seen in this GC/MS data, limonene was not produced. There was a small peak located where limonene was expected, but this peak also appeared in the empty promoter strain as well. In order to the strain's production capacity, we replaced the limonene synthase with amorphadiene synthase. The ispA gene produces farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the precursor to amorphadiene. Both the pBbA5c with ispA and GPPS were used to troubleshoot the mevalonate pathway by attempting to generate amorphadiene. In the GC/MS data, both strains created amorphadiene when amorphadiene synthase was included in the strain. Thus, we surmise that the mevalonate pathway is functioning correctly. The pBba5C-GPPS strain with amorphadiene synthase should not create amorphadiene, as ispA has been replaced with GPPS; however, because the E. coli genome naturally contains
, some amount may still be produced. The amorphadiene peak associated with the pBbA5c-GPPS was much smaller than the peak generated by the pBbA5c-ispA construct, as expected. However, this does not prove that the GPPS is working as anticipated.
The Conclusion
The data shows that the mevalonate pathway is functioning correctly. This indicates that the problem is either limonene synthase or GPPS. To further assess the production strains, a growth curve was run to determine if cell viability was being affected by the synthetic pathway.
Growth curves are organized either by base mevalonate vector or by version of limonene synthase. pBAD33 mimics pBbA5c, acting as an empty vector. Four replicates of each strain were grown on a 96-well plate; error bars indicate standard deviation.
The growth curves show two important things. The naturally-occurring limonene synthase shows a growth defect in comparison to the synthesized codon-optimized limonene synthase. More notably, the pBbA5c with ispA greatly inhibits cell growth. A possible explanation for this is the toxicity of FPP, as the pBbA5c-GPPS did not inhibit cell growth in comparison to the pBbA5c-ispA. Since ispA is native to E. coli , it should be translated more efficiently than the other enzymes in the mevalon"

Occurrence
Chromium is an essential part of the earth´s crust. It is the sixth most abundant one and used in metallurgical, chemical and refractory form. The three most important oxidative forms of chromium are the elemental metal (Cr), the trivalent (CrIII) and the hexavalent (CrVI) (Mitchell D. Cohen et al.).
Health effects
While the trivalent form is an essential dietary mineral and the most common natural form, it is of interest  to detect the hexavalent form because of its potential toxicity and carcinogenic effects. Most of it is produced trough industrial uses (Paustenbach et al. 2003). Chromium intoxication can result in damage to the nervous system, fatigue and mental instability (Singh et al. 2011). Its potential cancerogenity is the result of chromium VI being , able to enter cells , while this is not possible for chromium III compounds. Inside of"

for our contribution requirement, we decided to write a protocol for testing for allergenicity in different proteins. This would make it easy for other teams to see if their biobricks would produce proteins that could contain allergens, and allow us to characterize other parts by testing for allergens in them.
Lab:
Because our protein gels were consistently negative for esterase, we hypothesized that the enzyme was toxic to E.coli. To test this, we decided to try transcribing and translating our esterase constructs using a cell free kit. We also wanted to sequence our biobricks by themselves, so that we could be sure that there were no errors in them before we started. Because of this, we needed to PCR amplify our biobricks to get more DNA to work with"

Introduction
E. coli Based Bionanotemplating
Figure 1. Active site of cathsilicatein from Homo sapiens. Cathsilicatein is postulated to function similarly to silicatein which was cloned from Suberites domuncula
Our goal is to employ E. coli to create well defined, solid, two and three dimensional structures by stimulating expression of silicatein on the surface of the cell using light. Once expressed, the silicatein protein (originally from Suberites domuncula) will nucleate silica acid to form rigid structures at the cell surface 7 . By using light as a regulatory expression mechanism, we can create differing two and three dimensional structures by varying the intensity of light incident upon the incubation plate. Intense light exposure will induce maximal expression of surface displayed silicatein in the maximal number of cells in that region whereas a reduction of light exposure should result in a graded response. Furthermore, high light intensity should result in greater penetrance into the incubation medium. The ultimate result of these two factors should be a definable rigid structure.
This bionanotemplating system will depend upon two components: a light inducible regulatory system and a mechanism  to decorate the surface of the cell with silicatein. To accomplish this goal, out team decided to employ the Coliroid red-light sensor system first characterized by the 2004 joint University of Texas at Austin and UCSF iGEM team 5 . Unfortunately we were unable to reconstitute the system from the iGEM distribution plates and so one of our projects became the reconstruction of the complete system and update the physical parts in the Standard Registry of Biological Parts. The second project we chose to work on was producing a chimeric fusion protein of silicatein with an outer membrane protein such as ompA or ice nucleation protein (INP) in order to decorate the surface of the cell with silicatein as shown below in figure 2.

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#MedalRequirements_-_-_TEXT.html," 185 pairs of primers for essential genes submitted to the Parts Registry have been tested in PCR's and shown to give a product of the correct size. The essentiality of all these genes for a minimal genome was predicted using a computer model. Also, pAB/BA primers for sequencing inserts in pAB/BA worked as intended when used to verify part insertion.
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick part and enter this information:
The pAB and pBA plasmids and USER primers have been extensively tested in order to optimize the BioBytes assembly method, as documented in the DNA Assembly section of this wiki.  We’ve also tested several components in pAB and pBA using the BioBytes assembly method, and verified by gel electrophoresis and sequencing that they assemble properly.  Moreover, we’ve characterized the behavior of parts for Biobyte assembly in a microfluidic chip, demonstrating successful construct production on a micro-scale.
Gold
Only one of the following criteria must be met for Gold. However, our team has met all four possible criteria:
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick part or device:
The GFP and RFP parts we have submitted in pAB and pBA are derived from preexisting Biobrick parts. By adapting these parts to the BioBytes plasmids, we allow them to be used in the BioBytes assembly method, expanding their applications.
Furthermore, we adapted the Anderson collection of promoters to the Biobytes method. We removed NheI and AvrII cut sites from the consensus promoter and added two nucleotides downstream of the -10 region to place an A as the +1 nucleotide. These promoters are currently being tested by cloning them upstream of a ribosome binding site-red fluorescent protein segment, and checking for red colonies.
Help another iGEM team:
We constructed an expression plasmid for MMS6 (part K249019 ) for the University of Lethbridge team.
Develop and document a new technical standard:
We have written and submitted a new RFC, BBF RFC 47, detailing how the BioBytes assembly method can be used, and have included detailed protocol for how to perform this assembly method.  RFC #47 The BioBytes Assembly Standard can be found here .
Outline and detail a new approach to the issue of human practices:
As a novel approach to human practices, we worked with eight internationally competitive debaters to produce a debate about the ethical and societal implications of developing artificially engineered organisms. This debate was filmed and is posted and summarized on our wiki for the benefit of the public. The extensive"

BOKU-Vienna,2017,Team:BOKU-Vienna#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," need to be functionally implemented for such a system to work would be the in vivo reverse transcription carried out by a heterologous reverse transcriptase as well as site-specific recombination. For both processes several options are available. The reasoning that goes into our choices as well as some other thoughts are briefly explained below.
Host range
Not being reliant on host-specific factors (like the Ty1 retrotransposon in yeast) but only on heterologous components (RT and recombinase) D.I.V.E.R.T. – at least in general – should be applicable in a broad range of organisms as we wanted to show by performing our proof of concept experiment in yeast as well as in E. coli. Some minor adjustments in regard to the host, however, need to be made. For example, the relevant proteins have to be tagged with a NLS in eukaryotic systems and ribosome vs. reverse transcriptase interactions might play a role in prokaryotes. More details can be found in the D.I.V.E.R.T. experiment section .
RT choice and priming conditions
In the early phase of project planning we spent quite some time on gathering relevant information about a variety of reverse transcriptases including processivity, mutation rate, mutational spectra and RNase H activity. Finally, we chose to use Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RT mainly due to it being the best characterized monomeric15 reverse transcriptase while the active forms of many other RTs (e.g. HIV16 and ASLV17 RTs) are heterodimers. Picking a monomeric enzyme allowed us to save some IDT DNA synthesis credits; a wise decision, since we managed to use up all the credits for gBlocks, primers and DNA oligos during lab work in the summer months. As an additional requirement MMLV RT also shows RNase H activity which might help to synthesize double-stranded cDNA by degrading the RNA template after the first cDNA strand has been generated and we knew that active enzyme could be expressed in E. coli18.
In its natural context MMLV RT uses a mouse tRNAPro for priming19,20. It has been shown, though, that MMLV RT shows not very stringent preferences and that MMLV can replicate using different tRNAs as long as the PBS is complementary to the 3’ end of the tRNA21. From in vitro studies (and cDNA synthesis kits for RT-PCRs) we furthermore know that MMLV RT can also initiate replication using DNA or RNA oligonucleot"

Figure 5. Plasmidcard of NodC. The nodC gene (in pink) is located on the pSB1C3 vector without a promoter system. It is a basic part and can be used in combination with other parts. BioBrick (BB) suffix and prefix are shown in light blue. (BBa_K2380000) .
Figure 6. Plasmidcard of NodC with Anderson promoter. The nodC gene (in pink) is located on the pSB1C3 vector with an Anderson promoter (red) and a RBS (grey). This part is used for expression studies without the necessity of an induction. BioBrick (BB) suffix and prefix are shown in light blue. (BBa_K2380001) .
Figure 7. Plasmidcard of NodC with AraC promoter. The nodC gene (in pink) is located on the pSB1C3 vector with the AraC promoter system (dark blue and blue) and a RBS (grey). BioBrick (BB) suffix and prefix are shown in light blue. (BBa_K2380002) .
Afterwards we transformed the vector in E. coli BL21 for expression studies and started the expression, once by induction with 100 µL arabinose for the AraC promoter system and the other without induction by the constitutive Anderson promoter. To examine the successful expression, an SDS-PAGE was done.
The next step was the purification of the protein and the verification of the enzyme function. To purify the enzyme, a site-directed mutagenesis was done at the C-Terminus to add a His-tag and the protein was purified via an ÄKTA in combination with a 1 mL HisTrap column by GE Healthcare.  The activity of the NodC enzyme was evaluated via two different assays.

Oh Boy....
Lots of changes will be needed to adapt my notebook to the new layout.  Hopefully I will get this done by the WIKIFREEZE!
Also new PuppetShow GUI information can be found here .
The Backburner
OpenPCR
Create a modularized PCR for easy integration with the Tecan robot
costs ~$500, which is almost 10x-15x less than commercial cost
need to look into open-source code and see their implementation methods
