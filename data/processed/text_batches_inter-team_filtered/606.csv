Kyoto,2014,Team:Kyoto#Project#Magnetosome Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," formation in E. coli. As we showed in Fig. 7 , we could not detect any expression of mamL by the immunoblotting experiments. While we believe that our synthetic operon produce all of the genes introduced, it is possible that mamL is not expressed from the plasmid. We have no clear result for the significance of mamL in our system. To clarify this point, we need another plasmid that expresses only mamQ.
Huge E. coli emerged in pLQ and pLQB transformants
As described earlier, we noticed most of the pLQ and pLQB transoformants are larger than the control strain( Fig. 16 ). They also show the winding outer membrane structures. We presume that these phenotypes can be attributed to the partial inhibition of cytokinesis. In the case of a mutant of FtsZ [9] , a ring structure forming protein essential for cytokinesis, elongated cells are observed as well when the mutant strain is placed in the non-permissive temperature, showing that the proper alignment of FtsZ protein on the middle of the cell surface is indispensable for E. coli cytokinesis. Based on these information, we assume that the disruption of healthy membrane structure by ectopic expression of mamL and mamQ interferes with the alignment of FtsZ ring.
Fig. 16  The cells of pLQ and pLQB transformants were larger than control
pLQ and pLQB transformants' average size were 1.44 (pLQ) and 2.46 (pLQB) times larger than negative control.
The growth of the tansformants of pLQ and pLQB are lower than that of pL transformant and negative control. These results clearly show that the induction of vesicle formation is harmful for the cells. In the present study, we used a constitutive promoter and a high copy plasmid for the expression of the synthetic operon. We need to find the best condition for the vesicle formation by reducing the production rate of mamL and mamQ.
Conclusion
Through our experiments, we revealed that the ectopic expression of M. magneticum mamL and mamQ is sufficient to induce magnetosome-like vesicle formation in E. coli. We observed vesicles by TEM and showed that the efficiency of vesicle formation is nearly 100%.
Future work
In the present study, we successfully induced the magnetosome-like vesicles in E. coli. We will next try to fulfill these empty containers by magnetites. mamM gene is the"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.

Set up 2x 25 uL reactions for each using same protocol as 5/19/2015 but with the following modifications.
Tested 23x and 20x cycles.
2. Results
Cast a 2% TAE agarose gel to visualize results. Used NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Test amplification with biobrick sequencing primers (VF/R) and post-elution primers (P/E). The expected product for VF/R is 443 bp. The expected product for P/E is 170 bp.
The post-elution primers were made from stock prior to this PCR, which means that the previous post-elution amplification was unsuccessful due to bad primers.
The presence of a smear above the product bands is probably due to non-specific amplification. We should use fewer cycles. Along with results from 5/19/2015 , which showed that 17 cycles was not quite complete, we will use 18 cycles for future amplifications."

Interview with MSP Mr Jim Eadie
On Friday 27th September, we sent two team members, Jan and Aleksandra, to conduct an interview with our local MSP (Member of Scottish Parliament), Jim Eadie. Given the upcoming vote on Scotland’s independence from the UK, we felt it would be interesting to hear Mr Eadie’s opinions on how independence would affect Scotland’s Life Sciences industries. Below is a transcript of that interview.
J – Jan
A – Aleksandra
JE – Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) Jim Eadie
J: What is the current view in Scotland regarding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as a part of industrial processes, especially in the context of environmental applications such as waste water treatment?
JE: I don’t actually have advanced notice of that question. It’s a very technical question and I’m not qualified to say much on it.
A: It’s completely understandable.
JE: So I’m not going to just make it up, I’d have to check what the Scottish government has said on that. If we’re talking about GM food production, for example, that is something that the Scottish government has not embraced. I think there is a debate, obviously within the public sphere, about what the benefits and disadvantages of that would be. But I think it’s fair to say that Scotland is not seeking to establish an area of expertise and comparative advantage in that area. I’m sure you could research that area further.
J: Of course, thank you. That was just an introductory question.
A: I think that most people are reluctant to use GMOs as food and in food production.
JE: Yes, but I think there are key stakeholders within society, both in Scotland and the UK, that would be very much in favour of that type of technological and scientific endeavour. I suspect, though I haven’t checked it, that the Royal Society of Edinburgh would be supportive, a lot of the scientific community would be very much in favour [of such developments], but there is a"

1.8. A novel nechanism conferring resistance to glyphosate
In the past years, the underlying molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to glyphosate have been intensively studied in bacteria and plants. In many cases glyphosate resistance is directly linked to the target of the herbicide. For instance, bacteria like S. aureus are a priori resistant to glyphosate because this organism synthesizes an insensitive EPSP synthase (14-17). Moreover, increased cellular levels of the EPSP synthase, which can be achieved either by overexpression of the coding gene or by gene amplification, can confer resistance to glyphosate (Figure 12) (9, 18-22). Due to the increased cellular levels of the EPSP synthase, the glyphosate is probably titrated away and sufficient amounts of the precursor for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis can be produced. As mentioned in the design section, several glyphosate-insensitive EPSP synthase mutant variants have been isolated and engineered (11, 23-36). Often, a single amino acid exchange is sufficient to render the EPSP synthase insensitive to glyphosate. However, although glyphosate resistance is frequently linked to the target of the herbicide, resistance against the herbicide may occur by other means. Several studies have demonstrated that glyphosate can be detoxified by covalent modification. For instance, the Gat glyphosate N-acetyltransferase from Bacillus licheniformis, which was subjected to directed evolution for creating an enzyme with higher efficiency and increased specificity for the herbicide, converts glyphosate to N-acetylglyphosate, which is not herbicidal and is not an effective inhibitor of EPSP synthases (Figure 12) (37-40). Moreover, the hygromycin phosphotransferases Hph and GlpA from E. coli and Pseudomonas pseudomallei, respectively, phosphorylate glyphosate and thus confer tolerance to the herbicide (Figure 12) (41,42). Interestingly, the gat gene has also been used as a selection marker for genetic engineering of bacteria (40). The enzymes that covalently modify glyphosate have been successfully introduced into crops to increase herbicide resistance (43"

And Cry toxin create unregulated pores in the membrane of targeted cells. We assumed the engineered plasmid did be put into our competent cells, but the Cry toxin derived from our engineered circuit kill the competent cells and other bacteria on the plates.(In fact, our competent cell have ever been contaminated by unknown plasmid carrying ampicillin or chloramphenicol resistance.) So, there is no colony growing on our plate. Our future plan is to book or make competent cells which are gram-positive bacteria, and proceeding our function assay on the midgut cells of honey bees.

The work done so far in synthetic biology may only be the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Drew Endy has stated that the “scope of material I can work with is not limited to the set of things we inherit from nature.” The growth in the number of teams involved in iGEM over the last decade has been staggering. Not many other fields of science have experienced the rapid growth that synthetic biology has. If ethics is described as “rules of behavior based on ideas about what is morally good and bad” (1), then what ethical concerns may exist?
Synthetic Biology is the manipulation of DNA or genes to create new qualities or characteristics in readily controllable and standardized biological systems. As it has such groundbreaking potential for change in regards to human life, the ethics of synthetic biology should be considered before work in this field of science. The Catholic Church expresses the viewpoint that altering certain things in genetics is ethical, and not sinful, however, humankind must never attempt to create life (2). Most notably in recent history there have been attempts to create synthetic cells with various degrees of sophistication. These attempts have been described as producing a large synthetic genome, and not ""synthetic life"" itself. Despite such dismissals that we may not in fact have “created life” we should be mindful that “reducing life, even though it is non-human life, to merely another quantity that we control, exploit, and subject to market forces is to coarsen our sensibilities towards an important measure of our own being. In every living organism, whether humble bacterium, plant or animal, we encounter a faint glimmer of our own delicate life.” (3) The scope of the high school iGEM project exists within the boundaries of altering, and not creating, life for the betterment of humankind.
Possible misuse of synthetic biology should not dictate whether scientific advancements should be made, but rather how they are regulated. In the MIT Video “The Implications of Synthetic Biology” (4), Drew Endy was asked if a one percent misuse of this powerful technology could potentially set back the ninety-nine percent of researchers advancing the field for good. Few people would argue against breakthroughs in the form of biotherapies, more affordable pharmaceuticals, or eco-friendly bio-fuels."

For a 0.8% (w/v) gel in TAE, weigh agarose powder for a 0.8% (w/v) gel.
E.g. weigh 1.6g and add to 200mL TAE buffer for a 0.8% gel.
Add weighed agarose in TAE buffer (1X) and warm the solution (in a microwave) until it is completely dissolved. Let the solution cool down to hand warm temperature.
NOTE: Make sure the lid is not completely closed to avoid possible exploding of the glass bottle.
Pour gel in gel tray and mix well with SYBR Safe. For a small gel (~ 40mL solution) add 1µL of SYBR Safe; for a large gel (~80mL) add 2µL of SYBR Safe. Add a comb to create wells for the samples. Allow the agarose to solidify (approximately 20 minutes).
NOTE: For better mixing, add SYBR Safe to bottle instead of tray.
Transfer the gel to the electrophoresis cell, remove the combs and cover the gel  in TAE buffer (1X).
NOTE: Mind the direction of DNA migration when placing the gel in the cell.
Prepare the electrophoresis samples by adding Nucleic Acid Loading Buffer conform the manufacturer’s instructions.
Load the molecular weight marker (DNA ladder) in the first well according to manufacturer’s instructions (generally 3-5µL) and load 5-10µL of the dyed samples in the other wells.
NOTE: Do not contaminate the loading buffer and ladder with SYBR Safe! Do not touch it while wearing a glove.
Connect the cables of the gel tray following the colour code and run at 80-110V for 40-60 min.
NOTE: Mind the direction of DNA migration when placing the lid on the cell.
NOTE: Time and voltage depend on the density of the gel and the length of the lane in the gel.

Mathew pipetting the sterile distilled water needed to hydrate the BioBricks
Jess carefully rehydrating one of the BioBricks from the Spring Distributions
There are five BioBricks which are likely to be used by our system. They are:
BBa_C0056 – cI repressor (lambda phage)
BBa_B1002 – Terminator sequence
BBa_C0077 – CinR activator
BBa_C0076 – Autoinducer synthetase
BBa_R0077 – Promoter (CinR and HSL regulated, RBS+)
Each well containing these BioBricks was firstly identified and marked with a pen (in the corners of the wells). Once we had confirmed that the correct wells had been identified, a pipette containing 15ml of distilled water was then used to pierce the film lids of the wells and hydrate the DNA within. After a few rounds of mixing the DNA inside the wells, the BioBricks were extracted and placed into Eppendorf tubes which were transferred to the -20ºC freezer for storage.
The locations of the BioBricks can be found here – all are contained within the iGEM spring distributions. The hyperlinks for each BioBrick below will direct you to the distribution information page:

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," by Bioneer Corp. The protein has an absorption maximum at 597nm and a deep blue colour visible to the naked eye. The protein aeBlue has significant sequence homologies with proteins in the GFP family. The coding sequence for this protein was originally submitted to the registry as BBa_K1033916 by the 2012 Uppsala iGEM team.
Design Stage
In order to implement these three chromoprotein variants into the Sensynova platform, designs were made by replacing the sfGFP in the original reporter module with the parts detailed above that were ordered from the iGEM parts registry.
Figure 1: SBOL Visual Detailing Reporter Variants
Using Benchling, virtual digestions of the three chromoproteins and ligations to the part K2205013, the connector 2 receiver module detailed above, were carried out resulting in the three plasmid maps detailed below; parts K2205016, K2205017 and K220518.
Figure 2, 3, and 4: Parts BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205017 and BBa_K2205018 in PSB1C3 (Click for larger images)
Implementation
The chromoproteins aeBlue (BBa_K1033929), amajLime (BBa_K1033915) and spisPink (BBa_K1033925) parts were requested from the iGEM parts registry. Upon arrival, parts were transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colonies were picked and overnight cultures were prepared for miniprepping . Minipreps were digested with XbaI and PstI for BioBrick assembly. The part K2205013 contained in pSB1C3, was digested using SpeI and PstI to allow for the insertion of the chromoproteins directly after the RhI controlled promoter (pRhI) that would trigger transcription of colour proteins in the presence of connector 2 of the Sensynova platform. Stared colonies picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Characterisation
Initial testing of these three chromoprotein reporter variants was conducted by inoculating 1ml of LB containing the antibiotic Chloramphenicol with a colony from each colour proven by colony PCR and sequencing data to be correct and grown at 37° for 2 hours as well as a control of wildtype DH5α.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

A new ON culture of these strains is prepared, in case that something goes wrong
Also the ordered parts from iGEM arrived today, and these were plated on agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics and placed in the incubator.
B construct in plasmid was digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The band on the gel was at the right length. The gel was cut out and purified.
New plates containing antibiotics were made.
Thursday 17/7
The plasmids that were prepared yesterday (PCR 1, PCR 2, PCR 3 and B+C) were digested today with:
PCR 1: EcoRI + SpeI
PCR 2: EcoRI + SpeI
PCR 3: EcoRI + XbaI
B+C: EcoRI + XbaI
The products were then run on gel, cut out and purified and furthermore the concentration was meassured with NanoDrop.
PCR1 and PCR2 were ligated with PCR3, and BC and B were ligated with A. All plasmids were transformed.
Furthermore the plasmids with PCR 1, PCR 2, PCR 3 and B+C were prepared to be sent to Eurofins for DNA sequencing.
As mentioned yesterday a ON-culture was prepared. The culture was attempted mini-prepped, but the mini-prep was not successful. Consequently a new ON-culture was prepared today.
The parts from iGEM that were plated yesterday, were today prepared for ON-culture, so that a freezing stock can be made tomorrow.
Friday 18/7
We prepared a freezing stock of the parts we had ordered and received from iGEM, and the remaining sample from the ON culture used for the freezing stocks, was miniprepped and catalogued.
Some of the minipreps, were prepared with a wash buffer not containing any ethanol, and therefore we has miserable results. New ON cultures of those was prepared.
Saturday 19/7
The ON cultures of the iGEM parts from yesterday, were miniprepped with fine results.
Colony PCR was performed on the cultures transformed with PCR1+3, PCR2+3, ABC and AB. There were no colonies on one of the plates (AB-part).
Plate streaking was performed on each colony taken for colony PCR.
At first sight the results from the colony PCR seems to suggest that something went wrong during the digestion or ligation, since only re-ligations seems to be present.

No colonies observed on plates from Sunday. Attempted to use ligation product from Sunday to transform another batch of cells, because of sudden fear that our electrocompetent cells may not be good. Not enough ligated product remains to attempt this.

Ashlee and Emily prepared tubes of primers and four purified digestion products to send for sequencing.  They continued their work on the website and tried to find more html help for certain aspects.
Goal of the day is to transform some more cells, and use different ratio of insert to backbone during ligation in hopes of getting colonies to grow. Attempted to re-ligate digested GFPs and pFTV but not enough remains from Sunday to attempt this. Calculations ran for re-doing digestions and ligation. Digestions completed. RBS calculations from 6/26 analyzed, found that even using no initial condition (only N's followed by Pst1), sufficiently high TIR can be discovered. Need to use calculator algorithm on either Dr. Salis or Iman's computer so that a dRBS can be constructed using an initial condition that is followed by a non-mutable Pst1 site.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged (it is equivalent to use pLux/Tet hybrid promoter).
The results is shown for each (we plot GFP concentration versus time and compare it with experiment measument):
Part:BBa_K176026 (Promoter Strength: 0.55 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176126 (promoter strength: 0.0192 1/s)

Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR"

We briefly discussed our idea of culturing our E. coli bacteria in a continuous culture system. John suggested that if we were to consider starting up a business, the idea of using a batch culture is probably best during the initial stages. As the business expands and the demand of our product has increased, only then it is advisable to proceed to move and invest on a continuous culture system. He reasons that the bioreactor might be quite expensive for an initial investment and recommends us to rent an existing bioreactor from a manufacturer which would be cheaper in the short period of time.
Nonetheless, he challenges us to try our best to estimate the cost of our production in a continuous culture system to see whether our project can be financially feasible. He gave us some books and resources that would help in cost estimation. Through those resources, we were able to find a rough estimation cost which we used in our modelling and business plan .

Legislation
In envisioning our project in real life, safety and GMO legislation is inevitably one of the most important factors we have to consider. After some initial research on the UK GMO legislation, we contacted the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to answer some of our questions about the legislation in the context of our project. Through a conference call, DEFRA explained to us the procedures that one will have to go through for any commercial use of GMOs.
Conference Call with Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 25/07/2017
*To respect privacy, the names of those in the call are kept anonymous*
In envisioning the implementation of our project in real life, we wanted to understand the regulation and legislation process that we would have to address. We had a conference call with DEFRA to discuss this issue. We explained to DEFRA how we envision our project to work in real life. We would grow large cultures of bacteria and then place them in panels covered by a membrane that allows water to pass through but keeps the bacteria inside.
One of the things we discussed was regarding the different legislation between ‘contained use’ and deliberate release of GMOs. We were not sure whether our project would fall under ‘contained use’ since our engineered bacteria is still exposed to the environment so we briefly talked about the application process for deliberate release of GMOs. DEFRA advised that it could not provide specific guidance in this case because it would require further details of the nature of the activity (species of bacterium, exact genetic modification, containment measures etc).

Thus, the total variance <math>\sigma_{\bar{f}}^{2}</math> is the sum of first-order variances <math>\sigma_{i}^{2}</math> , second-order covariances <math>\sigma_{ij}^{2}</math> , etc. The magnitudes of the indices <math>\sigma_{i}^{2}</math>, <math>\sigma_{ij}^{2}</math> reveal how the output uncertainty is influenced by the input uncertainties and the nature of the cooperativities that exist. The direct determination of the component functions of RS-HDMR at different values in the unit hypercube by Monte Carlo integration can require a large number of random samples. To reduce the sampling effort, the RS-HDMR component functions may be approximated to any desired level of accuracy by either analytical approximation or numerical approximation. In our code, we implement the former approximation, which approximate the RS-HDMR component function by expansion in terms of a suitable set of functions. Specifically, orthogonal polynomials \cite{paper7}"

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Macquarie_Australia,2014,Team:Macquarie Australia#Project#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," Protochlorophyllide. CTH1, Plastocyanin, and YCF54 are involved in the oxidative cyclase pathway. ChlM methylates Mg-protoporphyrin IX, facilitating the highly-regulated catalysis of Mg-chelatase. CTH1 catalyses the conversion of Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl into divinyl protochlorophyllide, interacting with YCF54 and Plastocyanin.

Figure 4 Schematic representation of the conversion of Mg-Protophoryrin IX to Divinyl protochlorophyllide via the genes in Operon 2.
Operon 3: BBa_K1326003
The construction of this operon included the genes responsible for the terminal steps of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, in the conversion of divinyl protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll a. DVR1 reduces divinyl protochlorophyllide,  POR converts protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide,  ChlG adds the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate chain to the chlorophyllide molecule, and ChlP reduces the double bonds on GGPP. The final product is chlorophyll a.

Parts Annotated and Improved
Last years' 2013 Macquarie iGEM team designed all 13 parts required for the biosynthesis pathway and successfully synthesized most of these. This year we screened and verified the identity of all their parts, as we required them to assemble composite parts with the aim of forming functional operons.
The ‘parts from previous teams used’ table below show the individual parts designed and synthesised by the 2013 Macquarie team, as well as the composite parts they made using each part with the lac promoter synthesised by the 2012 iGEM Uppsala team.
Many of the individual parts from last year were not received by the registry in 2013."

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s expertise in the hematology field proved to be very beneficial in aiding with the design of our blood coagulant.
St. John's Ambulance
We were able to conduct a phone interview with Chris, the training manager for St. John’s Ambulance in our province, in order to gain further feedback on our our project design. The interview was centered mainly around the possible application of our blood coagulant and any other considerations we need to keep in mind when designing our construct. He informed us that hemostatic agents as the one that we are designing would be most effective in cavity wounds, which are difficult to treat using the traditional methods of slapping the wound and applying direct pressure to stop bleeding, as is often performed on flat wounds. Chris mentioned several pros and cons of applying our blood coagulant in a bandage or a gel form. Gels are more affected by temperature changes and become less effective in colder temperatures, which is not the case for bandages; however, bandages can quickly dry up in their packaging. Since special training is required to apply a hemostatic agent, it could not be included in a first-aid kit; however, it could still be marketed in stores such as Outdoor World. Chris also addressed his concern that the snake venom component included our construct could induce a systemic reaction when it comes into contact with the tissue. Overall, he stressed the importance of considering the shelf life our hemostatic agent, the application medium of our blood coagulant and if it causes any systemic reactions in the body. Although there are several hemostatic agents already being produced, he liked our approach of using a component of snake venom as it is very different from current methods, that use agents  ranging from shellfish derivatives to volcanic rock . The interview with Chris from St. John’s Ambulance provided us with valuable feedback for us to consider in the further design of our project and its application. In fact, the positive and negative aspects he provided on application methods led us to decide on using a bandage component for applying our product."

Human Practices
In the ""Talking life"" project we did not only want to speak with bacteria, but we also wanted to speak with humans! The HP practices team identified some ethical and social issues that were relevant to our project. We wanted to  communicate such issues and discuss them with a broader peer community, with scientists and other citizens. We made a movie that we used as a vehicle to communicate those issues and to trigger public debate. Slide along the timeline to know the steps we followed in the course of our HP exercise:
If you are fond of our work on Human Practices, download our Ethical issues diary here !
Talking Life
Click here to watch the 10 minute film that we made in collaboration with Artefactando. We also acted in the movie and used it in our debates. Based on real ethical concerns but in the form of a fictional story. We envisaged a possible future applications for our talking bacterial cultures and we used the movie to generate debate. The movie initiates debate around three ethical issues: Could we use talking bacteria to care for others? Who should own living technologies? If bacteria can speak, can they also lie?
The film was projected and debated five times: (1) France (Banyuls) to an audience of scientific European students, (2) Norway (Bergen), in front of a group of sociologists and ethics, (3) Barcelona, to a heterogeneous group of students and workers, (4) Valencia, in the cultural center named “Octubre” to a scientific public from professors and doctors to undergraduate students, and (5) in the scientific Campus of University of Valencia to a wide biology-related student audience.
If you are interested in how we did it or you want to know about the main ideas debated click in the different links that you can find above. To know more about other non-planned ethical aspects that came out to debate click here .

Microbial half fuel cells
Methods
The half fuel cells were constructed using the following components provided by Matthew Knighton from Dr Bruce Ward’s lab:
- 250 ml or 500 ml glass bottle
- A standard plastic cap with two holes drilled for electrodes
- carbon weave electrode fixed to the cap with silicone sealant
- reference electrode ""red rod"" REF201 available for sale from Radiometer analytical
- Following the assembly, bottles were autoclaved (reference electrodes were instead sterilised with alcohol as they are temperature sensitive). Under sterile conditions, reference electrodes were dipped in alcohol, inserted into the cap of the bottles and sealed with silicon sealant. The half fuel cells were then filled with media, inoculated with bacteria and sealed with parafilm in order to ensure anaerobic growth. The bacteria were left to grow at room temperature. (Figure 1)
- Media used: standard LB or M9 ( minimal growth medium ) supplemented with 1% lactose, 0,4% glycerol or 0,4% sodium acetate.
- Measurements were obtained using a digital multimeter.
Results
- We have examined the behaviour of S. oneidensis and E. coli in different media using half"

This morning we have repeated the Gibson assembly of TPH1 gBlocks. This time we have decided to just assemble the two gBlocks using the assembly kit. Then we digested them with EcoR1 and Pst1, performed PCR clean-up using Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system, and ligated the assembled construct into the linearized pSB1C3. We finished the day by doing the transformation of DH5alpha cells.

Overview
When reflecting on human practices over the course of our iGEM project, several major themes emerged. We considered major policy issues (intellectual property policy, biosecurity, licensing), the extent and nature of public opposition to synthetic biology, research and bioethics, outreach, collaboration, and decision-making in conditions of uncertainty.
Metaphors We Build Life By
Synthetic biology is a creative human activity, and although quantitative engineering frameworks can increasingly be employed for formalized analysis, prediction, and optimization of biological systems, the influence of human cognitive quirks, limitations, and uniquenesses on synbio design remains inherently substantial. Especially when considering challenges in synthetic biology that might be called “wicked problems,” (and it may be the case that all problems are wicked, only becoming tractable when artificially defined tamely - http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X04000626), the metaphors and symbolic systems we use crucially determine our problem-defining and solution-exploring activity. Many of these metaphors are verbal (“BioBrick,” “circuit,” etc.), and have drawn some reflection and investigation, but the primary emphasis of discussions of metaphor in synthetic biology representation has so far seemed to have been on metaphors being taken literally or framing public discourse.
We propose incorporating insights from cognitive science into the intentional design of representations in synthetic biology for the purpose of fostering clearer, more innovative, and more reflective synthetic biology practice. Many dimensions of synthetic biology radically diverge from the normal objects of established ways of considering design, risk, and ethics using conventions of natural language, intuitive models of causality, and narrative structures. This branch of human practices research and intentional reflection would develop a vocabulary of concepts, visual metaphors, and relational phrases with researchers in mind.
Although a stereotypical “synthetic biology thought process” is not obviously easily characterized"

However, we will need to construct Test #2 so that it conforms with our design for the final device.  This means that we might have to attempt putting multiple parts on the same plasmid.
For YPD plates:  made 250 mL of YPD Agar for growing yeast strains
YPD mix: 12.5003g
Bacto Agar: 5.0021g
Took transformations of ligation between J63001 and J63002 out of incubator roughly 14hr and 15 min after it had been put in.   No colonies visible.  It is more than likely that the UV light from the two transilluminators used with the gel mutated the DNA such as to inhibit ligation.  This UV light was UV-B.  One should note that of the two positive controls, the one incorporating cells that had been thawed for about one hour still had colonies, although at a significantly lower density (about a dozen colonies as compared to more than one hundred in the other positive control).  Should take this into consideration when transforming the remaining parts tonight, which means being frugal with the plasmid DNA (using 1.5 uL, for example).  This might also simply mean sticking to newer competent cells.
Took transformations of Z0842 and Z0279 out of incubator after 14 hr and 10 min.  Found that there were colonies on these plates.  Also note a significant amount of colonies on the plate containing the 3x flag that was microwaved.  However, there were no colonies on the positive control that did not go through the microwave, indicating that something went wrong (e.g. perhaps the two were switched).  Further investigation seems to indicate that both positive controls were accidentally spread onto the same plate.  Evidence for this is that there are two distinct circules on the agar that indicate where the transformation liquid was applied onto the plate before it was spread.   In any case, will inoculate cultures with the colonies on the plates containing the LexA parts later tonight.  Caution concerning this mistake:  DON'T WORK LATE AT NIGHT.

In order to put our lab work into market as soon as possible. We designed models which can contain our Metarhizium anisopidae and can lure cockroaches simultaneously. And it has to be convenient to use for our customers while it shouldn’t be too expensive.  Base on these thoughts we designed our models and improve them along the way. Here is the evolution history of our models.
First generation:
Pic1
At first we chose to use oil solution to contain our Metarhizium anisopidae and put them at area C in pic 1.  Area B is a hollow cube to contain baits for cockroaches. There are breathable holes on top of it to make sure the smell of the baits gets out. After combining the lid and the body. They will form four entrances like A together which allow the cockroaches to enter.  When cockroaches get in, they will definitely get in contact with our Metarhizium anisopidae in area C which will kill them. And the cockroaches can also get out and infecting other cockroaches by contacting them.
Pic2
Pros:
1. It is made by acrylic which makes it cheap and light.
2. The design above can function when we test it in the lab.
Cons:
After the human practice in Chongqing. We know that cockroaches will likely to climb gentle slope instead of entrances that high. And they are fond of getting into crevices. So we decided to improve our model.
Second generation:

U OF C iGEM: REPROGRAMMING A LANGUAGE AND A COMMUNITY
The progression of strong scientific research depends on whether industry and the public know about it and understand how the research can be applied. With this in mind, the U of C iGEM team’s work stretches far beyond the wetlab. We pursued initiatives all the way from mathematical modelling to ethics and from education to fundraising. Below there is a list of all the aspects of our project with respective icons and a brief description about each endeavour. These icons are present throughout our wiki so you can keep track of which aspect of our project you are learning about.
LAB. For the wetlab, we explored the concept of Quorum Sensing, a cell-to-cell communication process used by bacteria. We constructed the V. harveyi AI-2 signalling system in E. coli. This system allows for the fined tuned coordination of bacterial behaviour in that bacterial colonies are able to act as single entities.
MODELLING. We modelled the AI-2 signalling system using mathematical modelling (Matlab) and the novel Membrane Computing (Mathematica) frameworks. The purpose of these models is to characterize the AI-2 signalling system by predicting and evaluating certain parameters.
HUMAN PRACTICES. We pursued various approaches to communicate with the public about Synthetic Biology, iGEM and iGEM at the UofC. This initiative is important to gain an understanding of the public perception of Synthetic Biology, whether the public knows about this field or not. We investigated the ethical issues surrounding this emerging field as well as novel means to communicate our research work with the public.
SECOND LIFE. Education is a fundamental aspect of iGEM because synthetic biology is an emerging field in which students have limited knowledge before participating. We have created and are continually developing an educational tool for teaching synthetic biology within the virtual world of Second Life. This interactive platform has been used to teach the potential applications of synthetic biology, the assembly of genetic circuits, and molecular biology lab procedures. We hope that our virtual learning environment will allow for the training of future iGEMers.
MARKETING. In order to (1) get industry interested in Synthetic Biology/iGEM, (2) afford to send all UofC team members to the iGEM Jamboree and (3) fund lab, modelling, Second Life and outreach endeavours, we have pursued marketing and fundraising initiatives. Our communication with businesses in many industrial sectors allows for the discussion of the opportunities and future developments of"

Latest Update
At the Asia Jamboree, many iGEM participants played this game with fun.
However, we realized that some players were having trouble with playing, because they were not familiar with the idea of BioBricks and how to assemble them.
So, we thought the game will be more useful with some teaching material, which we have added.
Try our updated version of the BioBrick Puzzle!
Overview
""BioBrick Puzzle"" is a puzzle game for played for the purpose of learning BioBrick Standard assembly easily and enjoyably.  In this game, the challenge is to make a complex BioBrick part from several simple BioBrick parts provided.
Background
BioBrick is unique in its idempotent design for efficient assembly.  However, because of this uniqueness, if one wants to take part in iGEM and start his/her activites, it is necessary to learn about Biobricks for example by reading papers or taking tutorials on the web (iGEM's official web site).  But reading papers is tough for beginners, and although reading a static web site is rather easy it may be hard to  grasp the actual feeling of the operations and understand the value of the assembly technique.  Considering these problems, we created ""BioBrick Puzzle"", in which you can enjoy and learn about the BioBrick standard assembly process in an interactive way.  Playing with this game and experiencing the Assembly process, we think the user can understand the characteristics of BioBricks more easily.
Method
We utilized HTML5 and JavaScript to make our web-based software easy to use.  Since our software uses ""canvas"" of HTML5, any computer with modern internet browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari) can run it without any preparation.  This is quite convenient considering that most software requires installing or compiling.
Future
As stated above, we created a user-friendly software with web-based technology, but some problems remain in the comprehensiveness of the content.  In the future, we would"
USTC-China,2012,Team:USTC-China#team_-_-_TEXT.html," interested in synthetic biology because i think it will be very useful solving some very important problem ,such as cancer ,HIV ,etc .In the future, I want to design something with synthetic biology to help those people to decrease their pain and cure them. In the laboratory, as a fresh man, my experiment skill is not as good as other senior students. So I always play a helper or a cooperator. in addition, I also do some work during the human practice part. I really think our iGEM team is a good one. I learn a lot in the team, not only in experiment skill and knowledge of synthetic biology ,but also in cooperate skill and communicate skill. In the end ,I really appreciate ustc iGEM team to give me a chance to take part in this team.

Hello everybody, I am Zhang Sitao , a freshman  of USTC .
My major is life science.  I am an assistant of all the other guys in my team, in other word, my duty is to keep every fellows feel more comfortable and convenient while they are doing their work . Certainly I have many other work to do, helping figure out the main direction of our theme, combining some bioparts together and doing some survey during the human practice part .  For I have a strong ability of communicating and cooperating, everybody loves me , in my view . Personally speaking, iGEM just establishes a board for many biology nuts from every parts of the world, it is meaningful for the mixing of science and interest.  Though I am not the main force of our team, but things will get changed the next time of this game , I will come back for the honor of my university !

Abstract
Eukaryotic synthetic biology has huge potential, yet it is still in need of more diverse molecular tools for defined gene regulation.  Nuclear receptors are a conserved family of proteins responsible for sensing lipids; they may be viewed as lipid activated transcription factors. We have successfully developed a kit with a variety of lipid responsive domains (from H.sapiens, D.melanogaster and C.elegans) for the rational construction of synthetic transcription factors. The domains respond only to predefined lipids and selectively activate predetermined gene expression.  To characterize theses domains, we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity.

Osaka,2011,Team:Osaka#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"M belongs in a distinct clade of a subfamily together with Csp homologs from D. geothermalis and Thermus thermophilus.  PprM plays an important role in the induction of RecA and PprA and is involved in the unique radiation response mechanism controlled by PprI in D. radiodurans.
RecA
The D. radiodurans RecA protein has been characterized and its gene has been sequenced; it shows greater than 50% identity to the E. coli RecA protein. D. radiodurans recA mutants are highly sensitive to UV and ionizing radiation. In this context, early work by Carroll et al (1996) reported that E. coli RecA did not complement an IR-sensitive D. radiodurans recA point-mutant (rec30) and that expression of D. radiodurans RecA in E. coli was lethal. More recently, however, it has been reported that E. coli recA can provide partial complementation to a D. radiodurans recA null mutant (Schlesinger, 2007).
DNA damage detection
SOS response
If DNA is significantly damaged (eg by exposure to UV radiation or chemicals), synthesis of several DNA damage-related proteins occurs quickly. This reaction to DNA damage is the SOS response.
RecA is a 38 kilodalton Escherichia coli protein essential for the repair and maintenance of DNA. RecA has multiple activities, all related to DNA repair. In the bacterial SOS response, it has a co-protease function in the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor and the λ repressor. LexA is expressed constitutively and prevents expression of damage-related proteins by binding to SOS box as a repressor. RecA is activated by binding to single-stranded DNA, and the activated RecA then turns on LexA protease activity. Self-cleavage of LexA derepresses the expression of damage-related proteins enabling a response to be mounted.
We decided to employ the promoter of the RecA gene ( BBa J22106 ) to detect DNA damage. While RecA is an inducer of SOS genes, it itself is an SOS gene that is auto-induced upon DNA damage. Expression of genes downstream of this promoter is induced by DNA damage.
Lycopene biosynthesis
Our Bio-dosimeter must have some sort of visible output to alert users to radioactivity (detected as DNA damage). In a previous iGEM project, ""colrcoli"", we attempted to use E.col"

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," would lead to the GMO quickly being outcompeted by the WT in a natural setting.  In fact, contamination of the fermentation culture, by wild bacteria, in an industrial reactor is a constant issue for biotech industry. In such a case, it could be argued that the product itself (the enzyme) is where the focus of concern should be. Though most products produced by industrial bacteria may be considered safe in small amounts, large scale fermentation does produce them in large amounts and high concentration. This raises the question that maybe the products are what should be the focus of a discussion of safety GMO, rather than the organism itself.
This is not to say that there is not a safety concern regarding the use of GMOs, but the concern needs to be focused on each case and not on GMOs in general. In cases where the effects of the modifications are not well studied or when many modifications are made, the organism needs to be evaluated and safeguards put in place. Such safeguards can be put in place as part of the modifications. Examples of this are making the microorganisms reliant on a certain kind of medium (food), requiring specific signaling to proliferate or incorporating a kind of suicide switch by inserting a lethal gene that can be activated on command etc.
The intentional misuse of genetically engineered microorganisms is a separate issue that may be more difficult to handle. Especially since the technology for performing genetic modifications is becoming more and more readily available. However, this did not have a huge impact in the formulation of our project idea, since we would consider misuse of genetic engineering to be more of a regulatory issue. Due to this it was outside the scope of our integrated human practices.
Environmental vs social sustainability
Safety issues are not the only problem that needs to be addressed if large scale biosynthesis is to replace the current petroleum based chemical production. Industrial fermentation requires large amounts of substrate, mainly in the form of sugars. These are currently derived mainly from plant-based sources such as corn, sugarcane and sugar beets [2].
The use of these crops as industrial substrate raises concerns regarding competition for these feedstocks as food or industrial substrate. In countries like Brazil, where large-scale bioethanol production has started to replace conventional fuel production, this has already been shown to have negative social consequences. The competition for farmland has led to an increase in the prices of raw feedstocks [3]. This example of biosynthesis can teach us what effects large-scale implementation of this type of production can have. The price difference in developed countries is relatively small, since the value of the raw ingredients comprise a small part of the total cost of processed food [4]. However"
USP-UNESP-Brazil,2012,Team:USP-UNESP-Brazil#Plasmid Plug n Play#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"_Tokyo_Tech (BBa_K649205) was right but no DNA was available in the registry. So we decided to synthesized it and test it, using the proper sequence described  in [4] . We submitted the correct DNA to the Registry and our results suggest that the lox71 submitted by our group is working.
This was the first test of one of the six prototypes, we want to test the others in order to find out which is the best structure for developing a complete series of recombination plasmids that use this mechanism. As a proof of concept we developed a plasmid for expression in E. coli, but this methodology could be use for developing plasmids for expression in another systems, like plants and yeast.
This technology could help in the screening/development of candidate genes in a high-throughput manner for creating new standard biological parts, making faster and easier to produce tools for hacking biosystems.

Overview
Health risks and ethical dilemmas are inherent to using gene therapy for human enhancement. Sports is currently the only field where active measures against genetic enhancement, also known as gene doping, are desired. Present gene doping detection methods like nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and the privacy invasive whole genome sequencing (WGS) lack versatility to detect the plethora of genetic differences or require large storage capacities and high processing power. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive package ( ADOPE ) consisting of a cheap and scalable gold nanoparticle based visual prescreening, a newly designed, produced and characterized fusion protein for targeted sequencing and a self-learning algorithm for data analysis to anticipate future gene doping development. ADOPE is versatile, efficient and reliable and can detect low copy number DNA in samples, whereby it not only facilitates gene doping detection, but also blood banks and food safety institutes around the world.

1. Gene Doping: The Threat
Gene doping is a true problem. It is the first doping that could not only find interest in the athlete population, but also in the rest of society. Thereby it is not only a global, but especially an intergenerational problem, given the possibility of (accidental) germ line infections, as well as the extension it finds in the designer baby concept. However, there are many health risks related to gene doping use, amongst which are acute immune responses upon the viral infection, as well as cancer and"

Background analysis
In the process of Human Practice, GDSYZX - United has plenty of in-depth discussions with life science professor, previous winner of iGEM and outstanding students of life science. Therefore, each member of GDSYZX-United has further understanding of life science, and they are more and more interest in life science, even treat it as their pursuit of life.
This is the age of high technology, and the era of biological technology change the world is coming. Chinese people has stronger interest in synthetic biology.
Genomics, one of the famous Chinese firm, which was founded in 2009. The value of this firm has up to RMB 20 billion, and this is the result of the confidence in Chinese biotechnology.
Chinese students have strong enthusiasm for synthetic biology, biotechnology and genetic engineering. GDSYZX - United has shared experience of iGEM through science festival of Guangdong province experimental middle school and community activities. Indeed, they found out that high school students have a strong interest in synthetic biology, but a few of them know iGEM. Beside, there is no chance for them to get a better understanding of synthetic biology, therefore, it’s very necessary and significant for students to do experimental operation by themselves, and spread synthetic biology, life sciences and iGEM to them.
Up to 35.64% of high school students in Guangzhou takes an interest in biology through the Human Practice investigation of GDSYZX – United.

Introduction
The term chemotaxis is defined as the process in which organisms, both unicellular and multicellular, move toward or away from a chemical source that is present in the environment. Depending on their behavior to the chemical, chemotaxis can be positive, if cellular movements go toward higher concentration of the chemical, or negative, if they attempt to move away. In the first case, the chemical is called chemoattractant, in the second case, chemorepellent. Therefore, whereas the outcome of positive chemotaxis used to be the accumulation of organisms or cells in regions with higher concentration of chemoattractant, the outcome of negative chemotaxis would usually be separation and dispersal of them from the chemorepellent. Generally, this behavior is a consequence of using the chemoattractant as a nutrient, or due to the chemorepellent are excretion products or toxic. However, chemicals are not the only stimuli that cells and organisms can sense. They also are able to detect others stimuli like light, temperature, touch, electric fields, etc.
Bacteria have the capacity to sense a great diversity of chemical stimuli. Usually, there are families of substances that only act as chemoattractants and others that only do as chemorepelents, but this is not a primal rule. For example, E. coli has positive chemotaxis to sugars, oxygen, weak bases, dipeptids, whereas it present negative chemotaxis to alcohols, weak organic acids, inorganic ions and extreme extracellular pH values. As for amino acids, exist a division in their action and they exhibit a gradation. E. coli is strongly attracted to L-alanine, L-asparagine, L-aspatate, L-cystein, L-glutamate, glycine and L-serine, but is repelled from hydrophobic amino acids like L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan and L-valine. Chemotactic response of E. coli to amino acids involves two MCPs (methyl-"

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to synthetic biology. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology-based solutions to global issues. They arrived at the conclusion that scientists should focus on some major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction/gene transfer. In the past, using this framework has helped to uncover its limitations and the ways in which we could improve our own approach to environmental risk assessment. [11,12,13]
Altered Physiology: We synthesized new proteins that are originally found in E. coli, but we induced them at a higher rate. The proteins are involved with osmoregulation, so the toxins would cause E. coli to lyse itself if the regulation somehow goes out of control. Thus, we found that the growth rate of our engineered cells was severely impaired due to the toxicity of EcnB.
Competition and Biodiversity: Since our cells never leave the laboratory environment and only the EcnB peptides enter the fish, the issue of competition is not as relevant as it would be for other projects. Our engineered plasmids cause our cells to be not as able to compete in the natural environment as the cells would grow too slowly and other bacteria would outcompete them. These new cells would not have time and resources to form their own niche.
Evolutionary Prediction/Gene Transfer: There is not likely to be a consequence when it comes to evolutionary prediction as there would be low evolutionary pressure for the bacteria to keep the plasmid in absence of the antibiotics. Furthermore, the cells with the engineered plasmids would be retained in the laboratory setting. Moreover, if EcnB gets more aggressive as a toxin, it would just lyse the cells before the culture has the chance to proliferate. The issue of gene transfer is not relevant and not likely since we are limited to and working in the laboratory setting when handling bacterial cells.
Bioethics:
We designed our project in accordance with the ethical principles identified by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010). Our primary motive is to better stabilize our source of food by fighting a disease that is often harmful economically to communities and physically detrimental to many species of fish and the animals that rely on these fish as much as we do. We have also demonstrated responsible stewardship by considering the environmental implications of our project. The ecological impact of placing our genetically modified strain in water would be minimal because our filtration system will not allow bacteria to escape, and we have structured our future directions around risk management for the future. In addition, our project is an"

Aroma Pageni
Grade 11
Hi! My name is Aroma Pageni and I am currently in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. This is my first year in iGEM and I joined because of the problem-solving aspect of it. I love being able work with other people my age to address important issues in the world head-on. In iGEM, I enjoy designing and coding the wiki and working in the lab. After high school, I want to complete a bachelor’s degree and then hopefully go to Law School. When I am not in iGEM, I am usually watching rom-coms or taking pictures with my camera.

Hello :) My name is Mark Lea, I am in Grade 12 and I go to Chinook High School. I am really glad that I have had the opportunity to participate in our iGEM project this year! Originally, I wanted to focus on the wiki design and coding, but I have found that I am very interested in wet lab and mathematical modelling. I have learned a lot this season, and it has even influenced what I want to study for my undergraduate degree. Currently the degree that interests me is Biochemistry (Biology AND Chemistry!!?), and in the future I would like to pursue a career in Medicine. Outside of iGEM I enjoy playing piano, volunteering, listening to music, drawing and reading anything!

Figure 3：The relationship between Kmlac and the proportion of terminator turned off
To show aintuitionistic relationship between the the regulateability of Lac and Bxb1, we gave out a a holistic view of relationship of [GFP] and Kmlac.
Figure 4：The Relationship between Kmlac and kt and The Final Concentration of GFP
Asymmetric Conditions
We build the regulating circuits of FimE in the same way, but it is a pity that it is hardly to find any references about the parameters of the chemical kinetics constant of FimE, so we just assumed that 𝑘𝑇2=1e5, and vary 𝑘𝑇1. So the system is not symmetric any more. Then we find that the tendency of change of [GFP] is almost the same as the case in which 𝑘 and 𝑘𝑇2 remain the same and change together.
Figure 5：The Relationship between GFP and 𝑘𝑇1 in the first condition
Here, we fix 𝑘𝑇1𝑘𝑇2=1e7, and vary both of them. So the system is not symmetric any more. Then we find that the GFP output changes with 𝑘𝑇1 in the way of the previous figure. We can conclude that in the symmetric condition we can get the maximal GFP output.
Figure 6：The Relationship between GFP and 𝑘𝑇1 in the second condition
Summary of Modeling
We not only finished modeling for our own project, but also assisted BIT with their modeling task. We give a complete description of their gene circuits. We tried to change the value of the undetermined parameters to get the trend of the variation of GFP under these conditions. The effect of varying a single is almost identical to the result in the case that km(lac) and km(tet) varies together. However, unlike 𝑘𝑇1, km has a smaller effect on the final output of GFP. As shown in the left figure, when km(lac) increases for 100 folds, the GFP output remain at the same order of magnitude.

Once run on gel, two from Rob’s cells (A and B) looked promising so these have been sent off for sequencing (Figure 2).
A new ligation was made with HydEFG and Thi’s batch of cells transformed with this new construct.
Unfortunately, nothing grew.
With 5µL of HydEFG plasmid still available we decided we should reduce our transformations to use only 2µL.
This would leave us enough  to digest and run on a gel next week.
The plan was to make up new competent cells as it appeared the cells we are using were not as competent as expected.
Keen to keep going we proceeded with commercially available competent cells of our next HydEFG transformation attempt.
Running a gel showed that the latest attempt to PCR amplify the three backbones- Amp, CAM, Kan, was not successful (Figure 3).
Another attempt has been made to achieve this using different templates.
We plan to run these on a gel next week.
Figure 2. Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of single and double digests using Eco-RI (E) and PstI (P) in fer/hyd DNA in transformed colony samples A, B, C and D. Lane 1 contains a 1kb ladder. Samples A (lanes 3-4), B (lanes 4-5) and C (lanes 6-7) are from the same transformed plate. Samples A and B show expected band weights for the single digests (~5400bp) and double digests (~3400 bp and 2000 bp) respectively, and were submitted for sequencing confirmation. Band weights in sample C do not correspond with expected band weights and were unsuccessful.  Sample D was spun down prior to loading and no band weights were detected. This gel validates the fer/hyd1 Biobrick to the designed constructs in samples A and B.

And what is difference between the half retaining strategy and traditional method?
Contrast with the traditional comparative genomics method, it has two advantages as follow:
1. Traditional method is using comparative genomic approach to find ubiquitous genes from two completely sequenced small bacterial genomes. As we know in introduction, it will lose some genes when essential cellular function is performed by unrelated proteins that show no sequence similarities to each other in different organisms. However, half retaining strategy can get a stable result of minimal gene set, for it is based on plenty of reference species and an ideal retaining ratio.
2. Half retaining strategy uses experimentally-determined essential genes which are specific to organisms. Differ from traditional method, which is based on the whole genome, Half retaining strategy has lower false positive results.
MCCAP implements the half retaining strategy perfectly. Differ from traditional method, which provides a certain result of minimal gene set, MCCAP believe that minimal gene set is not unique, and it will be difference with different research fields. MCCAP provides a reference species selector interface to users, so that you can get a specific minimal gene set by your purposeful selection.
Most important information of minimal gene set to users is functions of genes. So in the results interface, MCCAP will give the function descriptions of gene firstly. MCCAP have also divided minimal gene set to four categories by their functions reference the standard of COG[2]. In fact, there are 25 function categories of COG. But, it is too complicated for user’s browsing experience. So MCCAP reorganizes them into four categories. These four categories are Transport and metabolism, Transcription and translation, General function prediction only and Others.
In addition to base information, MCCAP will also provide users with information related to KO(KEGG Orthology), EC number of enzymes, COG(Clusters of Orthologous Group) and so on. It is convenient for researchers to do further study.
3. Generating gene network diagram
In addition to determining the minimal gene set, there is still a crucial consideration is to know gene metabolism and regulation in building a minimal artificial cell.  In order to solve this problem, we combine KEGG Pathway and KEGG Module with the minimal gene set to generate gene network diagram. KEGG Pathway is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing our knowledge on the molecular interaction and reaction networks. KEGG Module is a collection of manually defined functional units[3].

Instead, she suggested using RPA, that is chemically initiated with the presence of MgOAc and also functions at low temperatures (37-42 oC). Dr. Tsaloglou also gave us an insight into the scale of a reasonable cost for such a device, targeting low-resource POC facilities. She recommended that, in the end, we should perform a cost-of-goods analysis and take into account the upscaling for calculating the final cost of our kit.
Professor Aashish Priye, University of Cincinnati
Aashish Priye, Assistant Professor in the University of Cincinnati, is an expert on Lab-on-a-Chip applications in diagnostics and has worked on the development of a platform for rapid detection of viruses, such as Zika. We had the chance to discuss with him in depth some aspects of our kit design. To begin with, we presented to him our idea for the reagents' storage in a bubble-like structure that would break with a plastic needle letting the liquids to be absorbed by the paper disc. He underlined that given the volumes needed, this method of storage would be very convenient as it would prevent evaporation. Professor Priye also emphasized that the reagents encapsulation process should be uniform so as to be precise on the contained volume, and suggested the use of a self-sealing polymer to facilitate the process.
Professor Keith Pardee, University of Toronto
Professor Pardee's work has inspired us in many different stages of our project. We had the honor to discuss with him a few features of our diagnostic kit. Regarding the RNA extraction, in the beginning, we were thinking of including a heating of the sample at 95oC, as it is commonly done in laboratories. However, Prof Pardee suggested that we should start with the simplest approach and use an RNA extraction kit in our design proposal. In this way we can avoid excess energy needs, as well as, minimize the insulating materials cost. He also advised us to keep the RNA amplification and the cell-free transcription-translation system in separate steps, since there are indications that this way the two systems show better performance. Finally, he gave us some useful tips concerning the fabrication of the paper discs and the reagents quantities.

There are some ways to fight against the antibiotic resistance, such as restricted politics [1]. As a researcher, one effective way is to produce more new antibiotics. However, the new antibiotics development is virtually empty [2]. Fortunately, some researches showed that antibiotics can be synthesized by using synthetic biology methods. Relationship between antibiotics and polyketide, as well as its mechanism of synthesis show us an approach to solve this problem[3].
2.Our goal: Programmed synthesis of polyketide.
Polyketides are a large family of compounds that represent a wide range of pharmacological effect [4]. And polyketides can be the precursor of many antibiotics. The natural antibiotics such as erythromycin and vancomycin are all the downstream products of polyketides[5]. Polyketides are synthesized by polykeyide synthase (PKS). They are structurally complicated because of the complication of modular PKS. Combining the modularity of PKS and synthetic biology’s principle, we can standardize the PKS and assemble them just like LEGO blocks [6]. In this way, many different assembly lead to various polyketides, which provide a wide range of compounds with biological activities to search for new antibiotics[7]. Our team tried to standardize domains and “programme” PKSs to synthesize custom polyketide. By synthesizing new polyketides, we can help to discover and screen new antibiotics[8][9].
3.Introduction of PKS
PKS is the assemble line of polyketide. PKS are very complicated that contain several kinds of domain in one module. Each module catalyst to extend,modified or terminated the polyketide chain. The PKS we choose is type I PKS,which is highly modular. The modularity of type I PKS are reflected in three aspect. First, the gene cluster of type I PKS are modular that each enzyme corresponds to the unique sequence of gene cluster. Second, each enzyme of PKS has only one function. Third, the process of polyketide synthsis are modular that each module modify one unit of polyketide chain[3].
3.1. PKS: The Domain
PKS is the assemble line of polyketide. PKSs are so complicated that each PKS is composed of a number of modules which contain several kinds of domains[10]. Each module has catalysed functions for extending, modifying or terminating the polyketide chain. The PKS we choose is type I PKS, which is highly modular. The modularity of type"

Safety
Security
One of the most essential problem urgent to solve in synthetic biology is the security problem. It has been a troublesome part whether we can pursue that the constructed bacteria cannot survive in the circumstance with some target genes imported by us. As for our project, though there is no safety worry, we come up with an original way to synthesis one kind of standard constructed bacteria, if slightly simplified by our project. In our previous project there are three cases when criminal can survive, but based on the safety consideration, we cannot let any bacteria alive in the wild, so we refer to this design because there is nearly no possibility for them to survive in the wild, for the living conditions have to reach several high levels, which is hard to achieve in the natural circumstance. What’s more, we have made mathematic model of it, which offers the theoretic evidence of it and make it more feasible. The design is like the figure below.
Just as the graph has shown, we make some modifications in our previous design. We remain the communication pair genes as the message access between them-LuxR and LasR, the products of which-6HSL and 12HSL still function as the signals between the two bacteria communities. It’s apparent that reporter genes are unrelated to the safety problem. So just leave them out. In the meantime, we cut off the tetA gene directly and import the cl gene exactly the same place of the zeo-R. The function of the cl gene is to reduce the expression of the ccdB gene. What is an obvious change is that we replace zeo-r gene that is resistant to the antibiotic zeocin in the culture with the toxin gene ccdB, whose product is a kind of poisonous protein and ccdB can express continuously and by itself. This requires us to switch the gene circuit, which means we change the poisonous protein gene and the mechanism of the toxin principle"

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2015,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#iQuestionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html,"473 responses from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 77 responses from Brazil, 13 responses from France, 563 responses in total.
Over 80% participants are not quite satisfied with the water quality as they ranked 4 or below in the Q1. Over 80% of participants ranked 4 or above for Q2, which indicates that level of heavy metals is one of the major concern of water quality and participants are not satisfied with current situation. Over 70% of participants ranked 4 or above in Q3, which indicates that they are willing to install a heavy metal water filter at home.  It may due to the fact that they are concerned about the intake of heavy metal from drinking water.
Regional difference
The average score of the satisfaction on the water quality is 3.57, which indicates that the participants are not so satisfied with the water quality. The average score of Taiwan & Hong Kong and Brazil are 3.54 and 3.49 respectively, which are similar to the average score. However, there is a significant difference between the average score of the overall participants and that of the France, which score 5. It suggests that the respondents from France are more satisfied with the water quality due to either a better water quality in France or they have a lower standard on water quality. There would be a further study on the reasons of the differences in the average score so that we can better understand the perspectives of the participants on water quality and a more affirmative conclusion can be drawn. The participants from France care about the further decrease of the heavy metals least and they are also least willing to install a small “heavy metal water filter” at home. The average scores are 5 and 4.5 while the overall average score is 5.28 and 4.77 respectively. It may mainly due to the fact that they are satisfied with current water quality, when comparing to participants from other regions. The difference of water treatment between France and other developed countries is probably another contributing factor of the relatively higher satisfactory level of water quality in France, where private sectors participated actively in water treatment and these companies provide high quality of water to the people. Therefore, it is possible that the French are satisfied with the water quality and not so willing to install water filter compared to participant from other region.
Age difference
Beside the regional difference, the difference between participants with different ages is examined. Participants who aged 41-50 years old are least satisfied with the water quality but they are not intended to have a further reduction in heavy metal and not willing to install a small “heavy metal water filter” at home."

The program will then check to see if the F1 that is parsed from the sequencing data exists in the dictionary.  If it does, that is great.  If it does not, it will do one of two things:
Perform a modulus 3 operation to see if there was a frameshift.  If the F1 is not a multiple of 3, it can be assumed that a frameshift occured.
Look for the closest entry in the dictionary to the errant sequence (something off by 1 nucleotide, for example)
This will allow us to automate our efforts, and will make it easier when more sequencing is performed.  Vatsan recommends using BioPython to write the script.

File Processing for Library Sequencing
Preliminary processing of the library sequences consists of agreggating the 94 individual fasta files into one multifasta file (which will be easier to work with) and taking the reverse complements of all the sequences (since we used a reverse primer for sequencing, the 100_bp_junction primer).
A Python script for converting fasta into multifasta can be found here: [22] , and a website for converting a multifasta file into its reverse complement can be found here: [23] .
The reverse complement multifasta file for the 94 sequences thus far can be found in the dropbox under sequences/CB bottom insert seq 08292011 with the name CB bottom seq multifasta RC.fasta.
Remaining efforts include parsing the file to extract the F1 subunits, which will require either removing the newline characters and using regex or by using a regex that can recognize sequences across multiple lines (i.e. regex that recognizes sequences with newline characters randomly in there).  The chip dictionary still needs to be built and the code for comparing our sequences with the dictionary also still needs to be written.

Chose 4 colonies from each biobrick and will grow them overnight. Tomorrow they will be miniprepped and sent out for sequencing using the standard primers on the backbone. (This should cover the entire insert for omega-ZF and most of the insert for ZFB-his3-ura3.)

Our primary focus at this time is to attain the proof of principle of the science upon which BEAR is designed. Once we have our proof of principle, we will expand on it and develop a working prototype. We will then make efforts to improve upon our initial designs and expand product development, making more BEAR units and variants of the system that will be able to detect different hormones.
We are consistently updating our business plan and making efforts to help Synbiologica Ltd grow. When we begin to create variants of BEAR and increase product development, we will hire a manager and research lab technicians to oversee development. At this time we will be looking more deeply into medical device certification in Canada, as well as making adjustments to meet regulations in the United States and Europe.
We have already received initial funding from Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (GeekStarter), the South Venture Business Plan Competition, and the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. In the near future, we will apply for the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax incentive program as well as the Industry Research Assistance Program. These programs will help us obtain funds that we can use as salaries for employees as well as funds that we can put directly towards the purchase of materials and equipment needed for the development of BEAR. We will also be applying for the Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Voucher program when we have a functional prototype of BEAR. This program funds a third-party opportunity assessment of our product. In other words, a company in the biotechnology industry will be funded to conduct research that will determine if our produce will flourish in the marketplace. The second Voucher program will provide funds to further the commercialization process, protect our intellectual property and continue improvements of BEAR. We will eventually be seeking private investment that will allow us to continue developing variable hormone sensitive components of BEAR and expand our laboratory capacity.
