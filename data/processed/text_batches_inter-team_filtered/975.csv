Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were unable to test the switches with luciferase. If we had managed to test our switches with luciferase, we anticipate that our sensitivity would be significantly higher.

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.

Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

We were unsure as to the clinical implementation of our project, so we spoke with Dr Justin Daniels, a pediatrician and clinical director, who has served on NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a UK public body that provides national guidance to improve healthcare) appraisal committees. He suggested its main value could be as a screening tool for high risk individuals. We knew previously about how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the"

SCUT-China_B,2016,Team:SCUT-China B#HP#HP3_-_-_TEXT.html," to introduce our iGEM project. Different roles in the movie represented different biological elements in our project and we told a story to explain process of our project. Children there were so interested in it and kept asking us questions about the animation and our project.
The children were too young to understand everything we taught in the class but we were happy to see the children were so interested in science. We believe that interest is always the best teacher. We hope with the teacher of interest can lead more and more children to learn science and finally to spread the idea of science in the country.
B.Sino-USA Chinese Collaboration Workshop
On 30th June SCUT held Sino-USA Chinese Collaboration Workshop which ended on 3rd July along with Tianjin University, Tsinghua University and Nanjing University of Technology. The workshop was held for experts from different universities to discuss about the meaning of synthetic biology and the trend of the development of it. We also hope that this workshop can make more students to have a deeper understanding to synthetic biology and its usage and therefor make them to be more interested in the subject and to generalize it to the public. Synthetic biology need to be in sight of the public.
The workshop was divided into eight sections.
Section one consisted an encapsulation of synthetic biology and construction of synthetic biology chassis.
Section two was a discussion about the future and trending of synthetic biology.
Section three was an introduction of the ideal of bio brick in synthetic biology. Energy module, PKS and NRPS were taken as examples.
Section four was about bioinformatics and search for new bio bricks.
Section five was about regulation of genetic circuit in synthetic biology and CRISPRi/a was took as an example.
Section six was about optimizing protein structure and enhancing function of bio bricks.
Section seven was about application of synthetic biology to research for new drugs.The last section was about application of synthetic biology to agriculture and energy industry.
As members of iGEM team of SCUT we hope we could experience(take part in) the workshop in flesh to search for the meaning of synthetic biology and make our contribution to it. So we took part in the preparation and the whole process of the workshop as volunteers. We did learn a lot.
Here is what we got from the workshop:
Our understanding of synthetic biology was based on iGEM ,so in a long time we mistakenly took synthetic biology as a different combination of bio bricks as well as construction and regulation of genetic circuit. During the workshop we learnt that studying synthetic biology also meant construction of synthetic biology chassis, searching for bio bricks, standardization and enhancing of bio bricks .etc. These are"

And sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing ability, but also want to regulate their killing ability in real time. (You can imagine that in a war, warrior II accumulate strength at a very fast speed and kill warrior I immediately, though their maximal strength is same. And what you want to do here is actually equivalent to regulate their speed of accumulating strength.)
Therefore, how could we do? Intuitively, we may think that if warrior II express less LuxI so that 3OC6HSL accumulate slower, so the speed of accumulating strength is slower. These hypothesis can both be demonstrated by our model.
3. Decrease the expression rate of LuxI inside warrior 2
(Figure 5: RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4,beta_const1=6)
By doing this, we can regulate the accumulating strength speed of warrior successfully! In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the constant promoter or RBS of LuxI in warrior II.
In conclusion, the core is that we can regulate the maximal killing ability by regulating amount of LacI (In this model, RFP) and regulate the speed of accumulating strength by regulating amount of AHL-production enzyme inside cell. All these can be regulated by change the promoter/RBS of the protein or adding LVA tag after the protein experimentally.
According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

During the beta test of the Labsurfing concept of team Darmstadt our team played host for the three team members Laurin, Thomas and Fabian as last stop in their south tour. We showed them our nice city and introduced them to our local franconian cuisine. The next day was less fun, more work. We presented each other the progress of our projects since the Meetup in Marburg. Afterwards we participated in their study to help improve the Labsufing website and of course we all registered there.
Marburg - Human Practice
During the meetup we especially connected with Team Marburg . Tresor came up with the idea of a human practice collaboration with our team. We wanted to create a board game for children to introduce them to science. Therefore Filip, Frederike, Nadine and Sabrina visited Marburg (15/08/15-15/08/16) where we thought of the basic concept of „Game of Cells“. Afterwards team Erlangen was responsible for the biological content and the informative texts, while Marburg designed the game. To test the game, Tresor came to Erlangen (15/09/06-15/09/08) where we played the game and improved it.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#NRPS_-_-_TEXT.html,"isation Domains
The most basic derivation is the introduction of D-amino acids into NRPs. Their incorporation is achieved by epimerisation (E) domains located between the T domain of the donor and the C domain of the acceptor module (see Fig. 3). It racemises the donor amino acid and the correct stereo-conformation is selected by the acceptor C domain. Thus the C domains can be classified as either CD or CL specific [26].
Figure 5: A combination of epimerisation (E) and C domains allow for the incorporation of L-amino acids into NRPs. First, the E domain racemises the donor amino acid. Subsequently, a C domain specific for D-amino acids catalyzes the condesation reaction (lower reaction). For the L-stereoconformation, no peptide bond can be formed (upper reaction;adapted from [1]).
Methylation of Monomers by N-Methyltransferases
Another basic modification of monomers is N-methylation carried out by N-methyltransferases (NM). They are located between the A and the T domain of a module and transfer CH3 from S-adenosylmethionine to the amino group of the module's monomer after it has been activated by the A domain [27].
Heterocyclisation of NRPs by Cyclisation Domains
Besides the macro-cyclisation performed by TEdomains, cyclisation (Cy) domains can introduce additional amide bonds between neighboring amino acids within the assembly line.  In order to form a heterocycle, serine, threonine or cystein are required as acceptor amino acid [28].
As the borders of the C or A domains can be hard to define, Cy domains and E domains are often displayed as combined C/Cy or C/E-domains. Besides these most common modifications many others can be found within the NRPS cluster or as tailoring enzymes, for instance O-methylations, halogenations, glycosylations or oxidations [13] - there is a lot more to explore!

Leucine Zipper Controls
Leucine zipper controls glow only upon addition of both arabinose and IPTG
After co-transforming pET11a-z-NGFP and pMRBAD-z-CGFP into BL21(DE3) cells, we plated on media containing IPTG (0.1mM) and arabinose (0.2% w/v). We incubated at 30° C for 10 hours and left the plates on the bench top for 24 hours. We observed accumulation of GFP only in colonies plated with both IPTG and arabinose.
TraR Fusions
TraR PCR product using pCF222 from Dr. Fuqua as template
After trying to PCR traR coding sequence from multiple sources, we finally succeeded using a plasmid generously provided by Dr. Clay Fuqua from University of Indiana (pCF222)
We successfully cloned traR coding sequence into pET11-a-link-NGFP between the XhoI and BamHI sites, and into pMRBAD-link-CGFP between the NcoI and SphI sites. We confirmed insertion with diagnostic digest and sequencing.
Characterization of Fusions
Diagnostic digests were performed on minipreps from transformed colonies to see if a traR-sized fragment was indeed inserted into the two plasmids. In both plasmids, a ~700bp fragment was observed. These minipreps were sent for sequencing and traR insertion was confirmed and seen to be in frame.
Transformed BL21(DE3) cells carrying both the pET11a-TraR-NGFP and pMRBAD-TraR-CGFP were plated on media containing IPTG, arabinose, and varying amounts of autoinducer, either synthesized, or from sterile supernatants. As of this writing, no conditions produce visible GFP on plates.

Carotenoids
As an extension of our goal to characterize our fungal toolkit with fluorescent proteins , we decided to show that a series of genes in a metabolic pathway could also be modified and engineered into fungi. For this, we decided to use the carotenoid pathway. Carotenoids are organic pigments that are found in a wide variety of organisms used for functions such as photosynthesis and protection from light. The relevant carotenoid genes have been previously biobricked by the Edinburgh team in 2007, 2008, and 2011, and we modified their biobricks for our purposes.
We used the section of the carotenoid pathway composed of crtE, crtB, crtI, and crtY. The starting compound in this carotenoid pathway is farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP). FPP is a compound critical to the production terpenes and sterols, and so many organisms naturally produce FPP, including our chassis. crtE is responsible for converting FPP into geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP). Then crtB converts GGPP into phytoene. Phyotene is then converted into lycopene, which is the first compound in this pathway to provide a color, by crtI. From lycopene, the red pigment can then become β-carotene and produce an orange color with the use of crtY [1].

Integrated Human Practices    
 
      Our project stems from an ever increasing need to address and tackle the issue of environmental pollution. Our interactions with the slum dwellers of Mohali, Punjab made us conscious of their inability to get access to clean and green sources of fuel which therefore forced them to breathe in toxic gases released upon burning cheap firewood. We immediately understood that the need of the hour is to stop further damage to our environment and make people aware of the steps to be taken in order to stop the crucifixion of our Mother Earth; but firstly we needed a way to assess the level of toxicants present in our atmosphere. This inspired us to design a cost-effective model based on co-cultures that could detect, capture, and consume pollutants from the air that we breathe. Our intention is to market this color based biosensor cum detoxifier as a cheap wristband model that can be worn by anyone to assess the level of contaminants present in the air that we breathe.    
 
Thus, people can be better cautioned to adopt greener practices in their life including:
 
1) Adopting a non-smoking lifestyle.
 
2) Encouraging the government to distribute clean gas to poverty stricken slum dwellers for cooking, as opposed to burning firewood.
 
   
Slum Awareness
  
With the aim of creating awareness among people, which is the prerequisite for mass revolution, the following activities were carried out by the iGEM team members:

LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," the LA Biohackers sought and received the  appropriate permit to allow for the disposal of their hazardous waste products.The EPA has written  detailed regulations to make sure that TSDFs operate safely and protect people and the environment.  The EPA wrote these regulations to implement the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)  of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. The U.S. Congress passed these  laws to address public concerns about the management of hazardous waste.14, 17
Compounding the general risk of hazardous waste to the environment is the generally  unpredictable nature of synthetic agents as compared to natural agents. For example, the inherent  pathogenicity of a microorganism greatly depends on the regulation of its virulence genes. Even the  smallest of nucleotide changes may have a dramatic effect on the pathogenesis or the viability of the  organism.18 Additionally, many pathogenic bacteria contain clusters of genes called pathogenicity  islands (PAI).  These are not present in related non-pathogenic bacteria. Thus, in experiments such as  the one conducted by the LA Biohackers,  the transfer of the DNA of a pathogenic agent into a non-pathogenic agent may have wholly unexpected results when released into a set environment.18 Specifically, until we know how a partially or wholly synthetic agent’s sequence, structure, and  biological context contribute to its biological properties it will be difficult to predict how it will exert  its influence on the environment.19 Adding to this uncertainty is the fact that the synthetic biology field  is progressing at a lightning-fast pace. New techniques are being developed every day that may enable  the ability to generate novel organisms with unknown properties, such as enhanced virulence. These  developments pose novel risks to biosafety, and present a multitude of ethical considerations, and only  reinforce the need to practice synthetic biology under stringent biosafety guidelines.19
Community laboratories should also be mindful of the type of organization they seek to create at  the federal level. A larger group, such as the LA Biohackers, with its rental fees, membership fees, and public outreach and teaching may be more concerned with this aspect than the fledgling community  laboratory in a neighbor’s garage, for example. In the case of the LA Biohackers, they sought and  received approval from the IRS to incorporate as a Section 501(c)(3) tax exempt entity.
To be exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code an organization’s purpose  must be charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public"

Didn’t work again. The bands are ~3000bp, when the pCZ band should be 846bp. Note: there is a tiny band at the bottom around 1000bp.  It’s possible that the darkest band is only cut in one site, while the other two bands correspond to pENTR/d-TOPO and pCZ-mODC

Third restriction digest of pENTR/d-TOPO-pCZ-mODC
This gel was run at 200V but was left for too long. We could not determine whether or not there were two bands in the double restriction digest. So we ran another gel.
 
8/6/11
Ran a NotI restriction enzyme digest to confirm the identity of any pRRL constructs. These are the sizes we should expect to see:
5.67 kb, vector
1.7kb, vector + CMV promoter
? kb, size of your cDNA of interest + 50bp (this could be aequorin, PCZ, or ChR).
Fourth restriction digest of pENTR/d-TOPO-pCZ-mODC
Success! The individual restriction digests yield one band between 3000bp-4000bp, and the combined bp of pENTR/d-TOPO and pCZ-mODC is 3696bp.
The double restriction digest yields two bands, one between 2500bp-3000bp (pENTR/d-TOPO which is 2850bp) and another around 900bp (pCZ-mODC)

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of tetracycline resistance operon, cI – repressor from phage λ and cfp – Cyan Fluorescent Protein.
The low endosomal pH limits the concentration of metal ions. In these conditions transmembrane receptor kinase phoQ is less likely to bind its ligands – divalent cations. It allows the phosphorylation of phoP by phoQ. Phosphorylated phoP activates the gene expression from phoQ promoter expression of proteins encoded by endosome detection operon. Cl protein inactivates the invasion operon. TetR protein activates cytoplasmic operon. But not all genes encoded by cytoplasmic operon are expressed in endosome because operon contains cro box that binds cro protein which stops transcription. Cro protein is encoded by endosome detection operon. After bacterium escapes into cytoplasm the endosome detection operon genes are no longer expressed because phoP is not phosphorylated in cytoplasmic conditions. Process can be monitored using CFP fluorescence protein.
The cytoplasmic operon.
Fig 4. Overview of endosomal detection operon. It is composed of YFP – Yellow Fluorescent Protein, tetR – repressor of a tetracycline resistance operon, cro box regulatory sequence from phage and λ desired genes and genes specific for desired function of bacterial strain. In this case p53 – apoptosis inducer.
Cytoplasmic operon like the invasion operon is a bistable switch. The regulatory elements are: synthetic promoter inhibited by TetR, promoter inhibited by araC, araC protein (inactivated by L-arabinose) and TetR protein (repressor of tetracycline resistance gene inactivated by tetracycline). [18] This switch controls genes expressed in the cytoplasm. Cro box confines the gene expression to the cytoplasm only. Cro protein bound to it stops the transcription while the endosome detection operon is expressed. The yellow florescence protein is expressed to allow detection of the cytoplasmic operon activity. The set of genes in the cytoplasmic operon depends on the desired functionality of bacterial strain. In case of anticancer therapy it would be p53 protein with mitochondrial leader sequence. In the strain able to conjugate with mitochondria cytoplasmic operon will control genes responsible for conjugation process.
The mechanism of proposed regulatory system.
In the medium the expression of all genetic circuits is inactive. After temperature increase to 42°C the system is activated by thermal deactivation of cI."

For the second BioBrick, split TEV N-split Intein N - Double Terminator, we used the following parts: BBa_K1362401, BBa_K1159102, BBa_B0015.
For this module we designed the BioBrick GFP-TEV Site-Dark Quencher-Double Terminator based on iGEM parts: BBa_E0040, BBa_K1159318 and BBa_K1319001 and BBa_B0015 respectively. Then we assembled the construct with the Anderson Promoter J23101 and the RBS Elowitz BBa_B0034 to generate our response module device, and we registered this complete device as a BioBrick too.
We designed a positive control device expressing a TEV protease to cleavage the linker between the GFP and the Dark Quencher. We based this BioBrick on the following parts: BBa_R0010, BBa_B0034, BBa_K1319004, BBa_B0015.
Results
Assembly
We assembled the response module BioBricks with the corresponding promoter and RBS, as we did in the Signaling module, because we wanted versatile BioBricks. We also selected the J23101 to express constitutively BioBrick and the LacL regulated promoter R0010 for inducible expression.
As detailed in Figure 4. we were able to validated the assembly of Biobricks K1903006 (Split TEV N- split intein N DnaE), and K1903008 (split Intein C DnaE-split TEV C) with the R0010-B0034 and J23101-B0034 respectively, to have complete devices using RCF 10 triple A assembly. However we couldn’t assembled each of the device together because the BioBrick K1903013 has the same band size as K1903006 and results suggested that the devices didn't ligate with each other.

Monday
In the morning we checked the BMG microplate reader which had been run over the weekend and provided interesting growth curves, quantifying the extent to which adding chloramphenicol to the medium slowed growth (this was by c. 50%).  Bill miniprepped lux R DNA from the registry. James told us that to use the standard Gibson protocol we needed 40bp of overlap, not the 20bp we planned which required rethinking oligos.  Peter prepared a number of cultures to test the effect of lumazine on emissions.
In the evening Hannah, Peter, Anja and Theo combined take-aways and beer with primer design, which went surprisingly well.
Tuesday
In the morning we sent off an order to Biolegio for oligo synthesis, in order to PCR out the Vibrio fischeri lux operon.  Will also designed oligos for the site-directed mutagenesis of Luciola cruciata luciferase into different colours, ready from when it arrives from DNA 2.0.
We decided to have a synthetic lux operon synthesised, relieving HNS repression.  Theo and Anja transformed TOP10 cells with Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent protein and a TetR repressed promoter from the registry, the latter will be used to control the firely oper"

""Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.""
Synthetic biology has its unique magic:  every element works together for one purpose in the system we design, just like an imaginative idea can act as a magnet to draw people together. Involving the public stays on in our mind. In this spirit, we delivered a set of lectures and mini-labs to students of all ages to unlock a world of synthetic biology for juniors. Excitedly, vibrant students from High School Affiliated to Fudan University applauded the idea of synthetic biology and newly established an iGEM team on our instruction. In addition, inspired by the principle of opening science, we interviewed Ms. Shi, a doctoral student in pharmacy, revealing the true living and studying condition of common sci-researchers in China to people outside the industry. Finally, some artwork was created to help explain our STEP system to the public, saturated in the two-way constructing process of humanity and technology.
1. An image of sci-researchers in China
In our wildest dream of childhood, there always existed a profession named ‘scientist’. But only a few of us hold on to it ultimately. Researchers are always a mystery to the public. In public mind they are a group of people burying themselves in labs and isolated from normal society. Nevertheless, the truth is far from that while the public has started to think differently. Rooted in China, we focus on the topic Society, Research, Researchers to reveal the true living condition of sci-researchers in China today.
Begin Reading
In the meeting with Shi, a typical doctoral student of pharmacy, we discover the change of public attitude towards the field of research. What’s their working pattern? How do they step into this field? What do their future look like? Her one-step-at-a-time experience gave the answer.
2. Future scientists — from kindergarten to college

Then, spread the inoculum by moving the spreader in an arc on the surface of the agar while rotating the plate. Continue until the inoculum has been absorbed into the agar. Repeat 4 and 5 for the other replicates. Then, go to step 6.
Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 for each dilution. When done, let the agar dry for a few minutes, tape the plates together, and incubate them upside down for one week.
Set up a series of dilution tubes to obtain dilutions of 10-1 through 10-7 of the E. coli cultures. Microfuge tubes are convenient to do this (see Figure 1-3). Each dilution tube will have 900 ml of dilution fluid (sterile saline). A dilution series will be needed for each E. coli culture (T0 thru T8).
Begin dilutions by adding 100ml of E. coli from the tube labeled T0 which is the initial E. coli culture to tube A.Tube A is the 10-1 dilution of T0.
Vortex the 10-1 tube for 5 seconds.
Follow this by subsequently adding 100 ml of Tube A to the next tube of saline (Tube B). Tube B is a 10-2 dilution of T0. Repeat until completing the dilution series, referring to Table 1-2 to see how far you will need to make dilutions for each E. coli culture. Remember to vortex each tube prior to transfer. It is also important to use a new pipette tip for each transfer.
Repeat dilutions for T1 through T8 or for whatever samples were assigned to you. Again refer to Table 1-2 to see how far you need to make your dilutions.
Plate according to the regiment specified in Table 1-2.
Label plates with the dilution and volume to be added to the plate. Make sure the label contains the time point plated (T1 thru T8) identification. Use triplicate plates for each dilution.
Pipette 100ml from each of the three dilutions to be plated. Add 100ml of each dilution tube to be plated by pipetting the amount to the center of the agar plate (Figure 1-3).
Immediately spread the aliquot by utilizing a flame sterilized “L” shaped glass rod. If the aliquot is not spread immediately, it will sorb in situ in the plate resulting in bacterial overgrowth at the spot"

How to use it
How to use it
To initiate the program with the selected variables you just have to click on the setup button. If you want to adjust all variables to the values by default just click on reset.
To initiate the simulation click on the go button. (aquí me falta añadir junto al texto las imágenes de los botones a los que me refiero con sus correspondientes pies)
The user can modify many variables and see which are the effects of modifying these variables in the simulation:
He can change the number of starting molecules or select the number of repressors that can admit every promoter.
Sliders to select the number of molecules
The user can also control the life-span of RNA and repressors. The life-span of these molecules is distributed according to a normal distribution.
Mean life and standard deviation of several species
He can regulate the strength of the interaction with several molecules. The repressor strength is inversely proportional to the given number, because it gives the chances per second that an attached repressor to the DNA falls from it. Since the strength of the promoters gives the chances (in percentage) that a given RNAP which detects a promoter starts transcription.
Interacition Strength of repressors and promoters
The parameter called time-constant gives us the number of steps (or ticks) of simulation that the program performs by each second of evolution of the system and has a value of one hundred per default. The movement of the proteins in the cytoplasm and the speed of the RNAPs and ribosomes when they are “reading” has an optimal value if this number is 1000, but it also makes the program run slower. Taking as reference a medium-size protein (40 kDA)  which moves with a speed of 5"

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," Because of the existence of leucine zipper, which can bind with each other due to electrostatic attraction automatically without out outer-membrane, transmembrane domain or ligand. Then, when they express enough cECFP and nECFP, we lyse the bacteria with ultrasound and mix them up to emit cECFP and nECFP to a same system. At last, we measure the fluorescence with plate reader compared with negative and positive controls. Figure 1 shows that our attempt does succeed and it might be reliable for more complicated conditions.
Figure 1. The sketch map of BBa_K2886013 & BBa_K2886012 and the result of their interaction in E. coli induced under 4 ℃. (a) BBa_K2886013 & BBa_K2886012 can bind with each other through the electrostatic attraction of leucine zipper and emit fluorescence. (b) The background fluorescence of nECFP , cECFP and their average value (average(n,c)). Fluorescence emission of the mixture of nECFP and cECFP shows a 4.19 folds of intensity. And the original ECFP shows a 5.7 folds of intensity compared to original ECFP (BBa_E0020), exceeding the less than 10-fold result reported in literature.
Moreover, to further demonstrate the reliability of our BiFC system, we also do some similar things in Hela cells. The difference is that we add outer-membrane and transmembrane domain to it as well as substitute the leucine zipper with GS linker. We transform the cells with these plasmids and then induce them with the ligand VEGF. When we observe the cells under fluorescence microscope, we also see the fluorescence, which is showed in Figure 2.

Week 6-8 (2017.8.7-8.20)
We reapeated the conjugative transfer and the following procedures, and successfully got double-crossover clones, which was verified using PCR.  Finally, we obtained our aimed strain – BcsA-knockout Enterobacteria sp. FY-07. The BcsA-knockout Enterobacteria sp. FY-07 strain was cultured and made competent for future use.
2. Construction of Plasmids
Week 1-3 (2017.7.3-7.23)
Initially we planned to construct pBBR1-rhlABC-fimS-lacI-lacO-BcsA and pBad30-cm-fimE. Then first we cloned some single fragments by PCR for preparation.
rhlABC
We cloned rhlABC gene from pET28a-rhlABC and gained the fragment through gel extraction purification. But the concentration was very low, just 22.314 ng/μL.
lacI-lacO
We cloned lacI gene from E.coli K12 genome. After this we used the product as template and changed a new downstream primers to gain lacI-lacO.
BcsA
BcsA gene was cloned from FY-07 genome.
fimS
fimS was cloned from BL21 and was amplified by PCR.
fimE
fimE gene was cloned from BL21 and was amplified by PCR.
Week 4-6 (2017.7.24-8.13)
Because every time we cloned the rhlABC gene through PCR, the product is mixed with other non target products. In addition, the concentration of the fragment through gel extraction purification was always low. So this week we tried to find a way to improve this condition.
Using existing fragments as templates
We tried to use existing rhlABC as templates, but sadly the products were only non-targeted products with 1000-2000bp.
Using temperature gradient to find the best Tm
The PCR system and PCR reaction condition was the same as above. The best Tm we found is 50.7℃. However, we cloned it again using this Tm, the concentration of the product was still frustrating, just 18.699 ng/μL.
Nested PCR
There was no aim product and the result of nucleic acid electrophoresis showed that the template could have some mistakes.

What have we fulfilled?
Is it ethical and would the public support releasing GMOs into the water supply?
As part of our human practices we looked at ethics and sustainability. Our project involves bioremediation of toxic substances from wastewater. As part of this project we had to look at the feasibility of using our bacteria in commercially. We realised that in order for our project to work we would have to release the engineered E.coli into water supply. Therefore, we had to determine whether this would be ethical, whether it’s advantages outbalance its downsides and whether the public would support this initiative.
Our Approach and Evaluation of our approach
The approach we used was to send out surveys to members of the public. we did this by posting surveys in groups on Facebook, getting our members to give surveys to people they knew and spreading them on online social networks and forums such as The Student Room, Imgur and Tumblr, as well as on GMO debating websites.
While this approach got us a considerable number of responses we found that the majority of the responses were from similar age groups, possibly representative of the demographics that are more likely to use online social media. 55% of our responders were in the 18-24 years old category, 25% were between 25 and 34 and 10% between 35 and 44. 5.6 % were younger than 18 and only 4% of responders were older than 44. In spite of the fact that most of the responders were from adjacent categories(18-24 and 25-34), our analysis did find significant differences between age groups, but only with regard to attitude towards environmental conservation projects.
In order to decide whether or not it would be ethical to release our bacteria into the water supply we did extensive research into the effects of cadmium on humans and ecosystems using research papers and journals and we compared them to the impact that our bacteria might have, should it be released into the water supply. We also researched what impact introducing a foreign bacteria might have on endogenous species. Our approach uses up-to-date scientific literature that has been subjected to peer review and intense scrutiny. However, the scientific consensus may change when more information on this topic becomes available. It is also very difficult to predict with 100% accuracy how our bacteria would behave and react to certain environmental factors. Taking in cadmium in large quantities can lead to"

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to measure and detect sulfamethoxazole in wastewater in a standardized way. Our work in SSS and the technical committee (TC) was really similar to the process in ISO when standards are established. To inspire other students to participate in similar processes, we got the opportunity to present our work in a movie at the Technology and Science University in Iran for students and the ISO secretary Sergio Mujica. Our work was also presented by Mojdeh at the international ISO conference in Switzerland. Check out the procedure on how to form an SSS and develop a student standard here .
We reached the stage of a committee draft in developing the standard, which will be developed further and can be found here .
We were given the opportunity to send a video message to the ISO meeting at the biggest University in Iran, to talk about our work as the first established SSS. We hope to set the example for other students to start their own SSS!
Boardgame (""Plasmido"")
Instead of going to a high school and simply talk about iGEM, synthetic biology or our project we wanted to make something interactive and fun. We wanted young adults to get a taste of how it really feels to be part of iGEM. With these thoughts in mind we created “Plasmido”, a board game with the goal to be as creative as possible to solve a real world problem using the power of BioBricks. All the challenges were chosen from former iGEM teams to show not only the range of challenges that can be faced but the potential of synthetic biology. The goal of the game is similar to the goal of the iGEM competition, you get out in the world -literally, with our world map as the game board- search for BioBricks, collaborate with other teams around the world represented by the other players, try to integrate your project in the society and deal at the same time with lab related obstacles to solve a problem in a creative and innovative way. The first player, who finds all the desired BioBricks to master the challenge goes to Boston and presents the solution at the Giant Jamboree. Check out the rulebook of the game here .

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography and plasma bonding. If we decided to do this, there would be a blunt eighty-thousand-dollar barrier of entry to researchers and hobbyists looking to use Neptune. That would be unacceptable. We could have had Neptune’s microfluidics be controlled using very high precision, high accuracy pumps that would provide flawless flow rates. But the hardware and infrastructure for these pumps would cost hundreds of dollars per pump, and the cost would not scale. We could not settle for this.
Instead, we framed our workflow around the low cost MakerFluidics fabrication protocol. In this protocol, the eighty thousand dollar fabrication process of photolithography is bypassed; instead our microfluidic chips are fabricated with a simple CNC mill, costing a order of magnitude less, while still delivering high performance devices.
We made it our project goal, to fully integrate accessibility into Neptune. Neptune is microfluidics for industry, for research, for education and for hobbyists. We made Neptune have the lowest possible bar to entry; it is the only microfluidic design, fabrication and control workflow all integrated into one software tool-- and the best part is it can be used by anyone. We made accessibility the centerpiece of Neptune.
Open Hardware Schematics
A big aspect of enabling accessible microfluidics is reducing the barrier of entry for controlling these devices. Microfluidics are controlled by pumps that generate pressures gradients to push or pull fluids, or open and close valves. Most modern microfluidic control pumps are expensive and difficult to integrate, making it hard to scale for larger microfluidic designs, and dissuasive for hobbyists.
We chose to directly target our hardware designs to this problem. We developed completely open 3D print design schematics for our microfluidic control infrastructure. These designs are available for download on our GitHub repo, and server though Neptune as well! Furthermore, we developed a completely original hardware design to control syringe pumps using very low cost servo motors.
NONA Research Foundation Partnership
Integrating our workflow with the idea of accessibility was a huge step; we successfully build Neptune as the most accessible microfluidics creation tool to date, with low cost fabrication protocols, open hardware designs, and powerful design algorithms- virtually any research lab can now realistically consider microfluidics as an option, without devoting huge costs or needing expertise in the field.
A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a"

During this summer and late september, we provided assistance within our capacity to Peking, another iGEM team, iGEM14_Peking also help us.
We helped Peking iGEM team on the iGEM project including:
1.Modeling. We both focused on E.coil motility while solving our problems. Peking wanted to use a motility model in which E.coil will diffuse freely to the algae. To solve their problem,  we suggested that Fick’s lawof diffusion be a good choice. We designed is a dynamic modeling of E. Coli and peanut root system, which quantitatively describes the process of the engineered bacteria carrying Mo towards the root as a porter.
2.Standardizing. As we use pET-21A as a plasmid backbone to express our proteins, we helped Peking to standardizing BBa_K1378001
3.Judging the parts. INP was used as the scaffold of surface display system in two teams’ experiments. We compared displaying efficiency between INP and its variants including INPNC, INPN. We recommend to use INPN for it's benefits.

We hosted the first iGEM workshop for high schools students in the UAE, where students from Brighton College in Abu Dhabi were given the opportunity to experience the integration of synthetic biology and engineering. Furthermore, the team published a magazine Synthetic Biology 101, which was distributed online and among NYU and Brighton College students. iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi also helped and advised a student from the NYU New York campus on how to start their own iGEM team. We have also developed a program that allows users to facilitate information sharing regarding their detection results. Read more
Due to the geographical location of NYUAD, which is in close proximity to countries where food safety is a daily, life-threatening concern, we were inspired to design and deliver an efficient solution to reduce the severity of this issue. The feedback from our target audiences was taken into consideration, which was later reflected in the evolution of our design. We surveyed potential consumers of different backgrounds: (1) food vendors from Pakistan and Indonesia, and (2) individuals from our international student body. We modified our eco-friendly device such that it is portable, affordable, and allows for rapid STEC detection in 20 minutes. Based on the significant local interest and usability of our device for other point-of-care diagnostic applications, our idea was introduced to startAD, an innovation and entrepreneurship platform for start-ups in the UAE. With their guidance and expertise, we aim to further develop our device to meet our target’s demands. Read more
We believe change should start with increasing awareness and educating individuals, particularly those in vulnerable environments. To extend our project beyond developing a device, we conducted several education and public engagement efforts. We taught primary school students in Indonesia about food and personal hygiene in order to instill this knowledge early-on. We held the first iGEM workshop for high school students in the UAE. In the interdisciplinary spirit of iGEM, we taught students how to perform bacterial transformation, code using the Arduino platform, and the positive outcomes from integrating these disciplines. We also advised students from NYU New York on how to begin their own iGEM Team. We presented our project to students in the Foundations of Science courses, which was developed to integrate the natural and physical sciences.

BioBrick characterisation
ccm, napC and cymA
We have tested the expression of NapC and CymA proteins in ccm transformed cells (ccm gene cluster BioBrick was transferred into pSB4K5 vector to allow for double epxression of ccm and cymA/napC genes). Cell pellets were scanned prior to sonication and cymA and napC transformed cells show slightly more intense colour, indicating higher concentration of haem in cells.
Following the sonication protein samples were run on a gel and were stained for haem using the following protocol:
The NuPAGE® gel was first soaked in 100 ml solution-I  (30 ml methanol, 70 ml 250 mM NaAc, pH=5.2) for 10 min, and then was moved into 50 ml  solution-II (15 mg 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ), 15 ml methanol and 35 ml 250 mM NaAc, pH=5.2; TMBZ was prepared  by dissolving the powder in methanol and placed in the dark) in an opaque box to prevent  the light. The box was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. 150 ul 30% (w/w) H2O2  solution was then added into the box which was further incubated in the dark for 3~5 min  after gentle mixing. The stained bands were fixed by washing the gel with dH2O.
Haem staining resulted in clear bands forming in all samples, probably representing one of the Ccm proteins, most likely CcmE (haem chaperone protein). In napC and cymA samples additional bands were present, indicated by the arrows.

Jun 20th~Jul 1st,
After having a meeting with our instructors and got an overview of the basics of synthetic biology. We did a survey of previous iGEM teams that got the Best Experimental Measurements award and read many papers. Base on the condition of our college and our expectation, we decided our project and create a schedule. Then we did some experiment technologies trainings, such as making gel, gel electrophoresis.
Jul 1st~Jul 8th ,
1.The construction of single enzyme carries.
To facilitate the overexpression of target genes, the four genes LinA, LinB, DhaA, and HheC were optimized, synthesized and cloned into the vector of PUC51 by Gene script Corporation. The resulting vector S1 contains gene fragments of LinA and LinB, while vector S2 contains gene fragments of DhaA and HheC.(Fig.1) After digestion using Xbal and Xhol, the four genes were cloned into a modified pBAD expression vector pOHC_00, respectively, resulting in the following four vectors, POHC_01 (LinA), POHC_02 (LinB), POHC_03 (DhaA), POHC_04 (HheC).

WLC-Milwaukee,2018,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," well water can still be dangerous not just for those individual well users, but also for other individuals with wells that tap into the same deep aquifers. The CDC recommends that well water should be tested annually for water borne illnesses  but in many areas, especially agricultural communities, Nitrates and micro-organisms are known to contaminate well water through sewage and fertilizers.
This market of small town well water users is one that is of great interest to the WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team as it would be an ideal niche in which to implement our project and target as a market for our kit. There are currently a variety of biological contaminant test-kits on the market for private consumers to use in their own homes. Unfortunately, however, these test kits are marketed as requiring 24-48 hours until a result is ready.
The 2017 WLC-iGEM Team, specifically Elise Sloey, tested a variety of these test kits on the market using blind-study methods for whether a sample contained bacterial contaminants or was a control to determine the accuracy of these kits (see …. for more information on testing methods and results analysis). The results of this testing indicated that not only do many of these test kits require a significant amount of time, many of them are quite inaccurate (data table courtesy of WLC-Milwaukee iGEM 2017).
The cost-effective, time efficient method of water testing that the WLC iGEM team has been developing will make water testing more convenient for well owners increasing the likelihood that well owners will follow the CDC recommendation for annual water checks. Increased testing regularity and additional testing options may reduce infection risks by alerting consumers of possible contaminants before they reach dangerous levels.
Our team also investigated the need for water testing systems in developing countries where water sanitation regulation may be lacking.
In developing countries, water contamination is a more prevalent issue when compared to first world countries. In some developing countries, resources are often allocated for other issues besides water management and testing, so water contamination can be overlooked.
This often means that water testing is performed intermittently, if at all even on important potable water sources. If contamination is not accurately identified indicating some source, there are often few choices for remediation and individuals continue to be impacted. Without sufficient testing or proper education about water safety and the properties of bacterial infections, people continue to utilize potentially dangerous water supplies.
Besides testing and supply management, another vitally important component of ensuring safe water practice is education. People need to aware that unseen dangers reside in the waters they drink and use every day. Accepting the existence and understanding the dangers"

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," for the progress of technology or contribution to open source science, but it is the case in everyday scientific practice. In fact, lots of money (and/or other company interests) may be at stake.
Bioterrorism? The last issue related to open source technology that will be mentioned in this report has to do with bioterrorism. For obvious reasons, open source technology is connected to dual use issues and (deliberate) misuse or bioterrorism. These issues are discussed in the next paragraph.
From the issues described above, one may begin to doubt whether the open source approach of the iGEM competition is actually as useful as is sometimes proposed. It may in fact even be naïve to believe in the success of this approach. Still, from a different point of view, the benefits of the BioBrick database may also be recognized, as presented in the introduction of this report. Having discussed al the above, one topic remains to be described, the risks associated with synthetic biology. This topic will be discussed in the next paragraph.
3.10 Prospective: solutions to ethical problems?
By looking at the future of synthetic biology one can identify all considerations presented in this report to play a part in future research and applications, but also in governance, regulation and enforcement issues, where the issues that were mentioned are to be reflected in. Conventions or international agreements may also be considered. Still, technological advancement and governance are somehow related when speculating about the future of biotechnology. When life science activities are tightly regulated and difficult, this will yield a different future than when synthetic biology turns out to have results easily in an unrestricted research environment. This is further specified by Aldrich et al. Here, speculations are made on the likelihood of e.g. deliberate misuse, garage biotechnology and open source approaches towards technology, but no conclusive remarks can currently be made.
Hypothesizing about the future of life science technologies, together with scientific advancement, different stakeholders and many conferences and papers on the ethics of technology may together lead the development of synthetic biology applications into a future with fewer concerns  related to synthetic biology.
The discussion on the ethics of synthetic biology classifies as a “wicked problem” , as proposed by dr. Jeff Conklin , director of the CogNexus Institute. He published on shared understanding of wicked problems : this involves problems with many stakeholders, large technical complexity and where no easy solution is available. If this is the case, fragmentation between stakeholders occurs, resulting in different parties with different opposing opinions, which is not a good development for coming together and deliberating on a certain topic"
Westminster_UK,2018,Team:Westminster UK#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Miah, Client Relationship Manager in Bywaters. He said that although most laboratory plastics are made from commonly recycled materials, most plastics that come out of them, especially bio-experimental labs, cannot be recycled due to the potentially toxic contaminants that end up covering them from the experimental studies. Say for example micropipetting tips: unless isolated and specified by the customer, all micropipetting tips no matter if they were thrown in sterile from handling water or alcohol, we always must assume that they were used for handling hazardous chemicals and biomaterial. The company does not recycle laboratory plastic waste, but they do recycle a lot of our plastics into the medical and biomedical material and are one of the biggest recycling distributors in this area.
University of Westminster sustainability team
We collaborated with University of Westminster's sustainability team at the early stage of our project. After we chose the environment as our major topic and plastic as our project focus we wanted to research on the plastic types that are usually disposed of.
We managed to put our own iGEM rubbish bins around the university so that we could empty them in the lab and use the waste to analyze the plastic. The amount of non-plastic rubbish stood out at first. People usually do not care about what the disposal sign says and threw everything into the same rubbish bin. Whilst it is good that people use rubbish bins rather than throwing rubbish on the floor it takes a lot of effort for the waste disposal companies to sort out the rubbish. So we decided to stick leaflets around the university that would draw attention and at the same time make people be more careful as to which rubbish they put in the rubbish bins.
The polystyrene bits from the rubbish were used in some of the chemical experiments and the water bottles collected were washed out and used in the education and engagement part of the project where we explained our project to school children.

Swimming Speed e. coli

University of Alberta
A Method for Measuring Bacterial Chemotaxis Parameters in a Microcapillary Justification: University Alberta's datasheet gives 50μms-1. However, Swimming speed is affected by:
Viscosity (as viscosity increases the speed increases to some maximum, then decreases as the viscosity increases further. E.coli (strain:KL227 of length: 1.0μm and diameter: 0.5μm) maximum speed occurs at viscosity 8cp.
Temperature
Culture medium
Vary strain to strain.
Experimental methods
Various papers give different speeds for E. coli (most papers provide information on AW405 with a speed of ~20μms-1). The speed itself is nearly uniform during the run. The wet lab may need to measure this experimentally as we are unaware of the conditions that the speed for MG1655 was obtained. Alberta's value is higher than other values, but this probably because MG1655 is a motile strain.

Aspartate concentration detected by E. coli
Related to Run Tumble Motion.
Over ~5 orders of magnitude, 10nM up to 10mM. Can detect changes of as little as ~0.1%
 
Competitive and Cooperative Interactions in Receptor Signalling Complexes Justification: E. coli detect small changes in concentration of 0.1% via temporal comparisons (4s) over a large range ( 10-8 to 10-3 ). Most computer simulations of chemotaxis are based on experimentally determined rates and concentrations. As a result they predict that the minimum detectable concentration of Aspartate is at ~200 nM. Experiments performed by Segall et al. in 1986, exposed tethered E. coli cells to iontophoretically delivered quantities of chemoattractant. These experiments indicated that a change in receptor occupancy of as little as 1/600 could produce an detectable change in swimming behaviour. With a Kd of 1 ?µM, this corresponds to a minimum detectable concentration of about 2 nM Aspartate. Wild type E. coli cells"

Workshop Development and Documentary
To achieve our goal of inspiring younger students we decided to create a brainstorming workshop. The idea was to present high school students with a number of local and global problems and give them a “synthetic biology toolbox” which could be used to solve these problems. The toolbox was a list comprising a number of organisms, cell types, biological components (e.g. proteins, enzymes and receptors) and examples of functions of these cells and biological components. See our achievement page for further information. As another initiative we took part in documentary on biomimicry aimed at students in the final stage of primary education. In this documentary we talked about how synthetic biologists are inspired by nature to combine natural parts in new ways, to create new systems.
Workshops
We used the above mentioned toolbox to host two workshops at summer camps for talented high school students. The workshops started with us giving a small introduction to the world of synthetic biology followed by a presentation of previous iGEM projects that gives an idea of the unlimited possibilities within synthetic biology. The students were then presented with the toolbox and a list of suggested problems and asked to think of ways to solve these (or other) problems using the cells and biological components from the toolbox. The workshops ended with a follow up where the students presented their ideas. We emphasised that no answers were wrong, in order to keep the students’ minds as open as possible.

We performed gel extraction and then, quantified the samples.
We performed ligation of the DVL2_AF_BR, DVL2_AF_GR, DVL2_AF_HR, DVL2_EF_GR and DVL2_EF_HR with pSB1A2 and transformed them with bioline gold cells for blue-white screening. Unfortunately, colonies grew but none of them turned blue.
We dephosphorylated the backbone pSB1A2 to prevent recircularization when ligating it to amplified LacZ. We performed new ligation and transformed them. Again, colonies grew but none of them turned blue. We are troubleshooting the experiment now.
The MoClo L0 parts transformations worked nicely, plates showed more white colonies then blue, indicating that LacZ was cut out of the backbone and the Moclo parts took place. We picked white colonies and let them grow overnight. We performed miniprep in all of them and Dna quantified them.
In order to check the MoClo parts before send it for sequencing, we ran BsaI digests and ran the digest product on a gel.

We continued the ligation PCRs to add MoClo sites to J series promoters, RBSs and genes. We tried to scale down the first set of reactions, because we were only using 2 uL of the reaction product  as template for third set of pcr reactions. It didn`t work, however. The gel showed really faint bands and it was impossible to gel extract them.
We performed new 50 ul PCRs for J23103-J23106 BA-BE.
Also, we ran regular PCRs to amplify the genes with correct primers that arrived recently: R0010EB, R0010FB, R0010GB, R0079AB, R0079EB, R0079FB, R0079GB and I1453FB.
We, then, gel extracted the bands and quantified the DNA from both gels.

Modelling Results of the RelE-RelB System
Results
As the bacteria only require a few tens of RelE molecules to enter dormancy, the threshold was placed at 40 copies to allow for lag in activation. This is of course an oversimplification, but it is not a problem that activation and dormancy are defined at different levels, since the exact number of RelE molecules required to induce dormancy is unknown.

Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.
Work on media analysis project: We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.
2. Academic conference, meetings, lab work
We are fortunate to have opportunities to work with two iGEM teams of NTHU_Taiwan and NYMU-Taipei. We worked together for discussing problems we faced and together figured out solutions for improving the protein performance in experiments.  In addition to attending the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan, we have many chances to discuss our iGEM project with these two universities.   Particularly, NYMU-Taipei team gave us lectures that we need to proceed our project, and also technical supports when we had problems
Professional Support
We received full professional supports from the best universities in Taiwan.  Professors and graduate students also fully sponsored and supported our experiments in their laboratories.
Technical Support
To accomplish this project, students of high school indeed need tremendous technical supports including wiki, film, field experience, and so on.  All experts that we interviewed in our human practice also spent a lot of time in discussing the experiment and science related to our project.  We appreciated their kind technical supports to our project.
Practical Support
We received a lot of help and advice from universities, industry, NGO and government departments. They gave us not only advice but also linkage to other resources that we needed for our project.   With their important help, we can improve the quality of our project and make our project closer to the social need."

A Synthetic Biology Startup with a Three-Channel Gene Switch
Project Description
We have engineered a three-channel switch that is controlled with the intensity of blue light. By utilizing the mechanisms of the lambda repressor, we are able to switch between the expressions of three different genes with a short delay. This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses.
Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Source business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Source based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Source model’s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community.
We want to share our experiences and insights in biotech entrepreneurship and address the difficulties that students and newcomers may face in the early stages of building a synthetic biology startup.
Our pitch video on August 6th, Summer of Startups Demo Day.
The Story of Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks
We are Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks, the first-ever Finnish iGEM Team and one of the four teams in the new Entrepreneurship Track. Our team consists of nine students from Aalto University and the University of Helsinki and we are combining our interdisciplinary forces to develop something new and fascinating. We want to put Finland on the map of synthetic biology and improve undergraduate research opportunities in our universities.
We have designed a three-channel gene switch that would make it possible to control three user-defined genes with blue light intensity. We are using YF1 as our light receptor protein and the signal is mediated to lambda repressor protein (CI) production via phosphorylation pathway. The concentration of the CI protein defines the gene that should be active at a time. The secret behind this function is our modified version of the lambda repressor mechanism.
We constructed a mathematical model that simulates the interactions of the molecules and function of the gene switch we designed. This revealed interesting phenomena in the dynamics of our system which helps us to better understand the capabilities and limitations of the gene switch. We also made an interactive simulation available to everybody to best illustrate how our idea actually works.

In the latter experiment I obtained a reasonable number of colonies on the selective plates. I set up inocula, mini-prepped and performed two different digestions (SfiI and BglI) to analyze the results. The amount of DNA was too low and because of that I could not reach any conclusions.
Characterizing pUC18-SfiI-miniTn7-Gm. The aim of this characterization is determine the orientation of the miniTn7-Gm inside pUC18-SfiI, measure the frequency of transposition in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and check the site-specific insertion of the transposon at the end of the glmS gen. The orientation of the miniTn7 was determined by three digestion reactions (EcoRI, PstI and ScaI) and electrophoretic gel analysis. The transposition frequency was tested by conjugation and electroporation, using Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as the host. These assays demonstrated a high transposition frequency particularly by conjugation (10-4 insertions/viable cell).
Week 8 (September, 12-16)
Penultimate week before wiki freeze. I kept on focus in obtain the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm plasmid (main construction of the Tn7 kit) and characterize the pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Gm plasmid.
Preparing attTn7 for sequencing. I set up a couple of inocula for freezing and sequencing, mini-prepping previously.
Starting the characterization of attTn7. Considering that we only have achieved by then the minTn7 in pUC18SfiI vector (replicative in Enterobacteriaceae) we need to insert the attTn7 in a P. putida replicative vector to check the site-specific insertion of the miniTn7 in the attTn7. To this way the miniTn7 will be in a suicide vector and the attTn7 not. We are going to insert the attTn7 in the pBBR1-MCS4. That week I prepared mini-preps of pSB1C3-attTn7 and pBBR1-MCS4 and digested them with EcoRI and Spe"

Soon it became apparent, that this question is not easily answered, and a heated discussion arose between politicians and the audience.                    On the one hand, farmers rely on the very efficient herbicide to produce sufficient amounts of food, while on the other hand, the long-term effects of glyphosate are poorly understood and cause harm to biodiversity. Studies that dealt with the cancerogenity of glyphosate towards humans came to no clear conclusion, leaving a big uncertainty behind. We soon realized, that due to this heated climate in the community, more independent research on the topic is necessary and we prompt decided that this was going to be our topic of choice. If you want to know more about the scientific background of glyphosate follow the link to our Background page. Here you can find out more about glyphosates modes of action and potential ways to achieve a resistance to the total-herbicide.

Bringing our project to young students
Our Team-member Vroni with her class.
One of the most important things in science is its educational aspect. Therefore we aim to stay in constant touch with the public, to inform everyone about our project. In this way we receive constant feedback, which we try to directly implement into our project design. We especially want to raise awareness in young children to involve them in research and wake their passion for science early on in life. Therefore, our team member Veronika went to the Staatliche Chiemsee Realschule to present our project to young students and show them the everyday life of scientists. At this point, we already realized that even though Glyphosate is such a prominent topic in the media, the public and especially young people lack a certain, objective and scientific background. Informing the public in an objective and scientific way is one issue that we want to tackle during our project.

In order to collect valuable feedback and to spread awareness about our project, we visited several Life Science companies . Of the many we visited, the following stood out.
The first company that we visited was Levim Biotech LLP, where we presented our project to the CEO, Mr Jatin Vimal and his colleagues. Throughout the presentation, they raised some very important issues and also provided some constructive feedback. They were very impressed with our presentation  and hence decided to sponsor our project,  ReguloGEM 2017.
The next company that we visited was LifeCell International, India’s first stem cell bank. Although our project did not have any connections with stem cells or any of its related fields, we managed to impress them with our idea so much that even they decided to sponsor us .
Next, we went to the Center for Medical Genetics, a non-profit, service -oriented professional genetic testing laboratory and presented our idea to its Medical Director and his colleagues. At the end of our presentation they mentioned that they were extremely happy to see undergraduate  students take up such projects and attempting to bring a change in the world of biotechnology. They extended their support to us by funding our project
Finally, we went to Saksin Lifesciences Pvt Ltd and presented our idea to the CEO and President, Dr Ramchand. We then spent the entire day at their facility, of which they gave us a tour. Although they did not financially fund us, they granted permission to use their facilities for any equipment that was  not available in our college, and it was because of them that we were able to carry out some important experiments.

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Methanol#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,"Proof of Mdh Activity in Methanol Conversion Strain
As the Mdh represents the bottleneck of the whole MCC pathway we tested its activity in the strains with the polycistronic plasmid. For this the assay to detect formaldehyde first described by Nash was done with these strains. Whole cells, cell fragments and lysate supernatants were tested for the polycistronic strains. The highest formation of formaldehyde could be observed in the assay using whole cells.
Activity of the Mdh in strain harboring the polycistronic construct
The strain with the polycistronic plasmid (#POLY#) shows significantly more Mdh activity than the negative control (#OHES#) expressing GlgC and the blank consisting of Nash reagent and buffer. Fluorescence measured at a gain of 75.
It was proven that the Mdh is expressed functionally in the strains containing the polycistronic construct. However, if compared to the activity of the strain only expressing the Mdh it is rather low (for comparison see data above).
Conclusion & Discussion
The functional Mdh was successfully expressed in multiple strains. The strongest response in the formaldehyde assay was reached in BL21 Gold (DE3) cultivated at 37°C in M9 medium. Although inclusion bodies containing the Mdh are formed in BL21 Gold, a high activity in the intact cells could be observed. This suggests that either a sufficient amount of Mdh still remains functional and in solution or the enzymes on the surface of the inclusion bodies still have a catalytic activity. The fact that a higher activity is reached in whole cell samples compared to the cell fragments and the lysate supernatant might be due to the protective property of the intact cell membrane shielding the enzyme from the harsh assay conditions and keeping it in its native environment.

Figure 4. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500 + K648013. Standard BioBrick primers were used. The band about 1100-bp in size indicates the successful amplification of this part. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. No contamination is observed in the NTC (no template control). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Also received this week were the synthesized coil genes ordered from BioBasic . These genes are the K-coil, E-coil, K-coil with a His-tag, and E-coil with a His-tag. These genes were successfully transformed into our E. coli cells and were miniprepped successfully. These genes are in the pUC57 ( pUC57 PDF Information Sheet ) vector and will have to be plasmid switched into pSB1C3 for submission to the registry.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
Confirmation digests were performed upon the coil parts miniprepped last week in order to confirm the presence of the coils (Figures 5). These coils can be seen as the faint bands at approximately 100-bp in size on the gel. Digestions like these could be performed as the synthesized genes contain the RFC 25 prefix and suffix. These digestions revealed that the coil genes are indeed present in the minipreps produced. Glycerol stocks were made of our transformed cells for organized long term storage.

The Science behind the Fiction at San Francisco’s Exploratorium
For our Human Practices, we decided to take a fun and exciting approach to inspire  public dialogue about synthetic biology.  This summer, just as our iGEM 2013 team did the previous year, we coordinated with the Exploratorium, an interactive science museum based in San Francisco, to present an exhibit at their “Science Fiction” themed After Dark event.  With the opportunity to present to several thousand attendees, we prepared various materials that introduced synthetic biology in a novel and fun way – through comic book superheroes!
In our presentation, titled “Super Science: The Genetics Behind Superheroes,” we put a superhero spin on the topic of synthetic biology in order to excite people about the largely unknown and growing field. To do so, our presentation discussed the validity and possibility of specific superhero powers such as Spiderman’s spider silk, Hulk’s super strength, and Flash’s super speed, based on existing genes and techniques available to scientists today.  We also mentioned our day-to-day lab work that included these techniques, such as the cloning genes.
When guests first reached our booth, we primed them with background information about the world of synthetic biology, its applications, and how it exists in our everyday lives. As an example of what synthetic biology is capable of, we brought culture plates of yeast cells that contained isolated genes from the violacein pathway. This allows us to demonstrate a fundamental principle of synthetic biology: we can take genes from one organism and express them in another.
In our second station, guests could engineer their own superhero!  They had two choices before them: 1). To “use synthetic biology” and engineer pre-formed superpowers into their genome, or 2) to try their hand at random mutations through exposure to radioactive waste or random DNA mutagenesis. This second option mostly led them through a range of unexpected consequences from silent mutations, to cancer, to third-degree burns, and even death, with the rare exception of a favorable mutation. Our pre-formed superpowers were inspired by genes found in other animals like super strong spider silk and tardigrade invincibility.
In our third station, our caricature artist, Sabrina, hand-drew guests with their favorite superpowers!

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Note that this chromoprotein is a homotetramer. What might be able to raise problems is if homotetramerisation is essential to the functionality of the protein. The literature [3] tells us that it does not appear to be the case: fusion proteins have already been created with chromoproteins, which were homo-multimeric and the protein fusions were completely functional.
We predict that in our project, an homotetrameric state is not important to the functionality of our fusion protein. It is believed that the light emission will be less.
The second part – blue chromoprotein:
We can do the same analysis for the blue chromoprotein. For the second part of the fusion protein we use to the aeBlue which is a blue chromoprotein ( Bba_K1033929 developed by iGEM13_Uppsala). Swiss-Model gives us a model for the second part: a near perfect match between our protein sequence and chromoprotein (far-red fluorescent protein AQ143). There is a 95.59% similarity between the two sequences, the major differences are present at the C-terminus and N-terminus. As for the Yellow chromoprotein, three amino acids of the core protein are not the same.
Note that this chromoprotein is also a homotetramer.
Modeling with Swiss-Model does not provide information on the overall structure of our chromoprotein. Nonetheless, it gives us a very good approach to the structure of the two chromoproteins which make up our fusion protein.
The last part – Global modelisation:
We could make a much more complex modelisation for the overall structure of the fusion protein, we think it is unnecessary. Therefore, to have a global vision of our protein we will use the RaptorX model.
Once this new model was obtained, we performed structural alignments and we discovered the structure of the two chromoproteins, so it seems that the linker between the two proteins is not sufficient to induce stress on the structures of our fusion protein.
Obviously many biases have been introduced during this modeling and the conception of the fusion protein. This modelisation is closer to a structural analysis that a complex protein modeling. The assumptions used in the design of this chromoprotein (fusion protein) does not seem to be so far from reality. We found similar cases in scientific publications, which are perfectly functional. We suggest several"

This year we made great communication with other teams. We held direct collaboration of projects with team NUDT-China (National University of Defense Technology) and XJTLU-China (Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University). We also had communications with the team Gifu from Japan. To improve the understanding about brain diseases and the possibilities of synthetic biology through public engagement among high school students, We held a special event in Nanjing_NFLS (Nanjing Foreign Language School) .
NUDT-China
We appreciate the great help of NUDT-China. They gave us some precious advice about our project and helped us carry out the cell viability experiment, which proved that our manipulation did no harm to the cell, setting up a good start of our project.
XJTLU-China
This year, the project of XJTLU-China is related to our project in 2015, the opioid, so we gave much help of their project. We instructed them to improve their experiment plan, since we have more experience manipulating the exosomes. In addition, they brought their cells to our lab, and with our facilities and our instruction, they extracted the exosomes and did NTA (nanoparticle tracking analysis) in our lab. When they were in great need of staining reagent, we provided them with our pigment Dil.
Gifu
During the giant jamboree last year, team Gifu and our team established a good relationship with each other. So this year we decided to keep contact with each other. Fortunately, Gifu has recruited a Chinese member, Wei Youyi, so during her summer vacation we invited her to our school to exchange some experiences in the competition.
We started our meeting with the introduction of our project. The team leader of Gifu sent us profiles about their project, and we found that they were working about a mass-production of functional protein with circular mRNA in cell-free system, and we exchanged ideas about RNA elements.
Since we are teams from different countries, we spent some time discussing the way people carrying out experiments in different laboratories. We gave a tour about  academy and labs in our"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Composite Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."
Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#miRNA Kit_-_-_TEXT.html,"-transfected plasmid in HeLa cells.
It is obvious: different binding sites result in different knockdowns of gene expression. Some imperfect binding sites - e. g. single seed region - indicate even similar expression levels in accordance to the figures shown before. It can be stated, that the tuning idea seems to work for attempts varying in applied miRNAs, binding sites and reporter genes.  The hAAT as a GOI is worth testing because it is mainly secreted in liver -our target tissue of choice. Efficient transduction can be accomplished by infection with selected viruses . Dealing with hAAt intertwines our two approaches of specific gene therapy, therefor being a relevant field for future research.
In Vivo Validation
The constructs were tested in two different backbones: pBS_U6 and pBS_H1. Both are in viral context, meaning that they contain inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The constructs can be packed into the capsid of an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Those constructs we also chose for virus production to infect cells even more efficiently as compared to transfections. Because of the significant data, we decided to inject the viruses into mice to see the tuning effect also in vivo . The pBS_H1 construct should be preferred for mice injections since the expressed synthetic shRNA miR against human alpha-1-antitrypsine (shhAAT) is cytotoxic in higher concentrations. The pBS_H1 backbone leads to moderate expression ranges, still obviously showing the tuning effect.
Modeling
After creating a binding site library and testing the miRNA-binding site interaction in vitro, we were able to compute an in silico model based on a machine learning approach to predict knockdown efficiencies. A more detailed description of the different binding sites, we characterized can be found in our measurements page.
Methods
miTuner: Expression Fine-Tuning by Synthetic miRNAs
The miTuner was assembled out of different parts . Cloning was done following standard protocols .
Regulation of gene expression can be achieved by fusing miRNA binding sites right behind a GOI. In case a referring shRNA miR is expressed, the GOI is knocked down. Strength of regulation thereby depends on binding site properties. We are able to tune gene expression linearly over a broad range. This is a first proof of principle for various miRNA-mRNA interactions in vitro. Therefore, we transfected HeLa cells in principle with our pSMB_miTuner Plasmid HD3 . It turned out, that there was no obvious effect of different binding sites on reporter gene"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of the bacterial community in the body constantly releasing pathogen-killing enzymes.
Of course, altering the microbiome comes with its own set of hazards, and we hope to mitigate it at least in part by doubling up the pathogen-killing mechanism as a population control mechanism for the engineered bacteria as well:
How our 3-part engineered microbe works:
1. Constant secretion of biofilm-degrading enzyme
2. Production and accumulation of antibacterial Art-175
3. Detection of pathogenic bacteria via quorum sensing
4. Permeabilization of inner membrane by T4 Holin
5. Access and lysis of host cell wall by Art-175
6. Release of Art-175 and lysis of target cell
Art-175 is normally prevented from reaching the cell wall of the expression host by the inner membrane. When a large amount of pathogenic bacteria is present, the quorum sensing signals trigger the production of T4 Holin, which permeabilizes the inner membrane, allowing Art-175 to reach the cell wall and degrade it. This causes lysis of the host cell and releases the accumulated Art-175 in a single high-concentration pulse, killing the pathogenic bacteria and achieving population control of the expression host at the same time.
Other safety aspects of this microbiome-modification design, including issues on immunogenicity, can be found here .
Results
Through our experimental work we were able to obtain preliminary evidence suggesting the validity of these points:
DsbA-DNase and DsbA-DspB can be secreted in a fully folded and functional state
Both DNase and DspB are able to degrade biofilms
Art-175 is able to exert cell lytic activity on planktonic E. coli and P. putida
Art-175 is able to kill a portion of biofilm-encased P. putida cells
The results and in-depth discussion of our experimental work can be found on the Experiments page.

Team UCL 2012 also had a part comprising Staphylococcal DNase with a DsbA tag upstream of it. We were interested in finding out:
Whether the DsbA 2-19 sequence is able to facilitate the export of this part of expression host organism E. coli MG1655
Whether the Staphylococcal nuclease can degrade E. coli biofilms (it was shown to degrade S. aureus biofilms in Mann et al, 2009 )

BioBrick Tutorial with SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen
The DTU BioBuilders 2016 hosted a BioBrick workshop during the Spring (May 6th - May 8th) for the other Danish iGEM teams; SDU-Denmark & UNIK-Copenhagen.
The scope of the workshop was to introduce all three teams to the BioBrick standard, get a feel of working with it in the laboratory and get to know the other Danish iGEM teams. During the weekend we had planned different lectures that all contributed to a better understanding of BioBricks and iGEM in general.
Our supervisor, Christopher Workman, gave a judging perspective on the iGEM competition and we discussed the gold medal requirements. iGEM alumni Pernille Neve Myers and Viktor Hesselberg-Thomsen from DTU BioBuilders 2015 held a lecture about BioBricks and 3A Assembly along with exciting exercises in the laboratory. The tutorial also had another aspect, namely the design and development of the wiki. Here, we had this years SDU-Denmark team give us a presentation of general advices for a good wiki and alumnus Mads Anderson introduced the “Wiki-Wizard”.
Beside having an educational weekend, we had a lot of fun and got to know the other iGEM teams in Denmark!
The weekend was a great success and gave the Danish teams a great foundation for collaboration and fun during other meetups and during our projects. In"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Reporter#BetaLactamase_-_-_TEXT.html,"otic cells,β-lactamase has been found to have an alternative application in synthetic proteins as well. β-lactamase is able to preserve its activity when fused to other proteins, meaning  it can viably be used in fusion proteins (Moore et al., 1997). This feature makes β-lactamase a potentially valuable tool for assembly of synthetic constructs.
How is β-lactamase used as a Reporter?
β-lactamase, in the presence of different substrates, can give various outputs. It can produce a fluorogenic output in the presence of a cephalosporin derivative (CCF2/AM), which can then subsequently be measured using a fluorometer (Remy et al., 2007). Additionally, β-lactamase can also be used to obtain colourimetric outputs by breaking down synthetic compounds such as nitrocefin (Figure 2). The result of nitrocefin hydrolysis is a colour change from yellow to red (Remy et al., 2007). A third output that β-lactamase can give out is through pH. One example is the hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin by β-lactamase, converting the substrate to an acid and lowering pH. This can then be seen through the use of pH indicators such as phenol red to give an observable output (Li et al., 2008). The multiple ways this enzyme can be used shows the versatillity of it, as it is capable of three different outputs, fluorescent, colourimetric, and pH.
Figure 2. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin catalyzed by β-lactamase. This causes a colour change from yellow to red that can be seen.
β-lactamase can also be split apart in to two halves for protein complementation assays, where each half is linked to one of the two proteins being tested. If the two proteins interact the two halves are able to fold into their correct structure and give an output (Wehrman et al., 2002).
Therefore, this enzyme gives a lot of flexibility, both in how it can be attached to proteins as well as the various outputs it can give, making it a useful reporter to characterize and add to the Parts Registry.
How does β-lactamase fit in our Biosensor?
β-lactamase serves as another reporter we explored for our system in parallel to our Prussian blue ferritin reporter . But unlike the Prussian Blue ferritin system,  β-lactamase can also be used for a"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," always come up are: ""what is life?"" and ""what is natural?"". Furthermore, can the reductionist approach ever lead to an explanation of life? The prospects of synthetic biology re-initiates the discussion, a result of researchers working on the brink of understanding and creating life. How do the people involved in the iGEM competition think about life and the reductionist approach? Following the statements of the group, the properties of ""life"" include the existence of: negative entropy, the ability to adjust to environment, reactions to external stimuli, interaction of biochemical processes, the ability to proliferate, an information storage system, metabolism, a defined outer-limit (such as a membrane), the sum of components and its interactions, self-sustaining properties and emerging properties. Although the list is very comprehensive, many people still argue that there is no description nor a complete set of specific criteria that can define life. We are part of what we assume is life and are therefore never capable of objectively characterizing it.
Although no one suggests that it is infeasible to understand life without a definition for it, there are numerous other suggestions why understanding life might or might not be possible in the future. What seems exceptional, is that many use human life as the standard of understanding life, most probably of its complexity.
First of all, there is the problem of the observer, we cannot define life because we are life. The reducionist approach is limited because mankind is limited.
Second of all, some believe that we consist of a complex series of biochemical reactions that lead us to interact with our environments the way we do. Although synthetic biology might help us to understand the mechanisms behind the operation better, it runs the risk of becoming too detached from humanity and life, which could be dangerous in reducing the image of ourselves as the sum of our parts. Others think that life is the results of molecules bumping into each other and positive and negative charges interacting, which is perceived as sublime. They are not afraid of taking religiosity, mysticism, or magic out of human existence, but rather focus on taking a moment to appreciate the true magnificence that is a human being. New questions are proposed, such as ""Where do atoms come from?"" and ""Why are we here?"".
Science strives to understand life mechanistically, but there is a feeling amongst some survey participants that there will always be elements that mankind cannot understand as we are unable to see the entire picture. The reductionist approach is limiting because there is always ""room to go deeper"". However, as innocent as reducing life may appear to be it also has the ability to devaluate"

1.Overview
Modeling is a powerful tool in synthetic biology and engineering. In our project, we aim to design a bioinformatics tool “CRISPR-X”, which is a software developed for design of CRISPR sgRNA with minimized off-target effects and high cutting rate.
The CRISPR-associated (Cas)9 can be programmed with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to generate site-specific DNA breaks, but there are few known rules governing on-target efficacy of this system[1,2]. Related reports suggest gRNAs are most effective with a GC-content between 40 and 80%. [1] In addition, a guanine at position 20 in the target site, which appears to improve cutting rate. [1] Therefore, we use efficacy score to characterize the activity of the sgRNA.
For sgRNA sequences can be 17-20 nt in length to achieve similar levels of on-target gene editing，and up to 10,000 fold improvement in target specificity when truncated (17 or 18 base pair) sgRNA is used. [3] We design the length of sgRNA sequences vary from 17nt to 20nt.
First of all, we find the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) based on user-specified gene region. Then, we find sgRNA corresponding to the PAM. Next, we find that whether there is a potential off-target binding site for the sgRNA over the entire gene region, and evaluate the specificity and efficacy of the sgRNA. Finally, we provide a secondary structure and the restriction enzyme cutting sites for the sgRNA.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week3_-_-_TEXT.html," the bottom graph showing absorbance spectrum of carotene extract in acetone, there were two distinct peaks, one at about 450 nm (beta-carotene), and the other at about 490 nm (unknown). The 450 nm peak was very obvious for pPCB15 in MG1655 and pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5, barely discernible for pPCB15 in TOP10, and absent in K152005 in TOP10 and R0011 in TOP10. After normalising for the differences in OD 600nm values (which were independent of carotene concentration), the OD 450 nm values increased in order: pPCB15 in TOP10 < pPCB15 in MG1655 < pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5, which was consistent with previous observations.
The 450 nm peak in pPCB15 in TOP10 was very weak, demonstrating the importance of FPP flux in carotene synthesis. For K152005 in TOP10, the OD 450 nm was much lower. Although visibly yellow in acetone extraction, it did not show up in the absorbance spectrum, suggesting that the yellow colour might not be due to beta-carotene. An alternative hypothesis would be that insufficient time (20 hour) was given for beta-carotene production in TOP10. This could be resolved by trying out extraction with cultures kept at longer incubation time.
Weekend
Checked to see how the amplification project transformations went: all but I1746370, I13540, and I13520 were growing.
Additionally, the melanin plates were growing rather poorly, probably because they were inoculated with an overnight culture that was a few days old.

Wet lab:
In the following weeks, lab work needs to be divided into different teams.
MutB and GlmS were successfully subcloned and can be transformed into the arabiniose negative E. coli strain for expression experiments.
It also needs to be tested if the thioredoxin fusion protein in the pBAD202 vector influences the expression of our Symporter protein.
Financials:
We talked about the travelling costs for Boston and are happy, that we get supported by Sartorius as new sponsor.
Human practice:
The postcards from the Human practice action initiated by the iGEM team Düsseldorf have to be distributed in public.
We also will present our project results in a colloquia at our institute at the beginning of the next semester.
16/09/12:
Wet lab:
We reported the general laboratory progress to our supervisors. The next steps are the expression studies of our constructs in TOP10 and analysing them by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. However, for the proof of concept we will also need to do expression studies and western blot of our constructs in the production strains and Vitamin B12
Human practice:
We also discussed the participation at the biotechnology conference in Aachen to which we were invited.
16/09/21:
Wet lab:
The B12 detection tests have to be started. The strains will be cultivated according to protocol. For the tests minimal medium has to be prepared and the periplasmic space will be extracted by ultracentrifugation.
For GlmS the constructs without thioredoxin need to be checked by repeating the SDS-PAGE of the expression experiments.
Financials:
The travel expense accounting for Boston was done.
Human practice:
For the Wiki, texts about our human practices need to be written.
In addition to that, we might contact the schools again, organize a “lab work” event for students and arrange a BBQ for the new master students.

T. solium is endemic in India
Data from the WHO indicate that infections with the pork tapeworm is endemic in India. When performing a literature review, we found only few small studies examining the prevalence of T. solium in India. So we were full of uncertainty, when we sent two team members to India in order to explore the context in which our diagnostic test might be used.
Meeting the People's Vigilance Committee on Human Rights
Upon our arrival we met Dr. Lenin from the Human Rights organization PVCHR (People's Vigilance Committee on Human Rights ), who gave us the chance to accompany social workers to  Musahar communities, small collections of huts where poor and discriminated people live. PVCHR suspected a high chance that people in these villages are infected with the pork tapeworm.
Standard of T. solium  diagnosis in India
At this point we learnt how important it is to develop a rapid field test: Currently diagnosis is made by microscopy but it is impossible to bring a microscope and a trained physician to these areas. At the same time driving to the next hospital takes over two hours and the villagers are working a lot to gain enough money for their families. Many of them never went to a hospital and many of them are superstitious, which makes us believe it would be best, if the social workers they trust could handle our test on site in the village.
RNA sequencing
Next, we went to a government hospital, a private hospital and several clinical laboratories to meet physicians and to discuss our idea and their thoughts on T. solium. These physicians, particularly Dr. Dilip Mishra (picture), were very interested in a rapid diagnostic test and a joint research project. While we were still on site, we analyzed the research facilities and planned how to isolate RNA from T. solium in this environment. Our plan was to disrupt the eggs using QIAzol and a homogenizer.
Subsequently we wanted to ship the RNA in QIAzol to Germany for further purification and analysis. However, we realized it might be difficult to export such a shipment containing biological compounds and a phenolic agent. For this reason, we went to Delhi to meet iGEM IIT Delhi. Together with the Delhi-Team we established an RNA isolation pipeline, which was a challenge because RNA isolation kits are not developed for temperatures above 40°C. After RNA-Isolation, RNA is dissolved in water and for this reason easy to"

Competence and Transformation
Bacterial Transformation Protocol (Competence and Transformation)
Introduction
In this protocol, you will be using chemically competent E. coli that have been placed in a calcium chloride solution prior to freezing. The solution acts to neutralize the cells so that they don’t repel each other. The bacteria and plasmid mixture will be chilled on ice for 30 minutes. Placing the mixture in a 42°C water bath for 30 seconds will heat shock the mixture, which will cause the transformation. Once the LB is added and mixed with the transformed bacteria, it can be plated on the LB plate with an antibiotic. Since much of the bacteria will not be transformed after the heat shock, plating E. coli with an antibiotic will ensure that only transformed E. coli survive.
Before doing this protocol, please watch this video: https://vimeo.com/25201947 . Note that we do not have a control for our experiment, and we are not using a thermomixer.
Separate reagents from materials.
Basic Terminology and Concepts
Transformation: The process in which the genetic makeup of a cell is changed by introduction of DNA from the surrounding environment.
Competent E. coli: E. coli which can allow the uptake of DNA.
Heat Shock: A sudden increase in temperature used to propel a plasmid into a bacterium.
Safety precautions
This is a benign lab protocol, but don’t forget that PPE is necessary at all times. The E. coli you will be working with will be non-pathogenic but it should still be handled properly, which means it should not come into contact with your skin or gloves. If you are removing materials from the -80°C freezer, do not use your bare hands or regular lab gloves. Use gloves designated specifically for the freezer.
Materials
Reagents
Competent E. coli cells
250μL SOC
LB plate supplemented with antibiotics
Plasmid
Equipment
1 set of micropipettes and pipette tips
5✕1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
Ice bath
Thermomixer
Streaker
Procedure
Thaw competent E. coli on ice.
Competent cells will be in the -80°C freezer.
Do not thaw cells by hand. If they are warmed by hand they will no longer be competent.
Mix the cells gently with a pipette tip (Do not pipette up and down).
Aliquot 50μL of bacteria into a pre-chilled 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.

TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team. We have met obstacles and setbacks and we have been seeking advice from 3 teams.
NUDT-China: We invited iGEM NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM for three times to answer our puzzles. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.
Nanjing-China: After proposing some initial ideas of our own project, in order to polish up it, some of our team members went to Nanjing University to obtain experience. In Nanjing University, both teams gave a presentation on their project design. As a veteran team, Nanjing-China gave us constructive suggestions which were significant to us. From then on, we gradually became clearer in thoughts and got started with our work.
UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.
Counseling
Biosafety issues
Doctor Li Ming is experienced in doing research in horizontal gene transfer and teaching the lecture on biosafety for undergraduates. The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM. Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project. He introduced the biosafety classifications of different organisms and protection practices among different biosafety level labs. The Vi antigen project was his major concern and he gave us valuable suggestions. He also communicated with Doctor Cong Yanuang to confirm our lab procedures, making sure we were not going to culture S.Typhi but just to extract the genomic DNA of S.Typhi. He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. At last, he brought up with several biological containment strategies, including the metabolic auxotroph, suicide genes and kill switches. We really appreciate Doctor Li’s instructions on biosafety issues and his thoughtful ideas helped us a lot.
Antibiotic resistance issues
Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics. Due to the abuse of antibiotics, multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumann"
UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#es#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cells will return to its original state, due to the killer cells being unable to reproduce.
3) Killing mechanism
We decided to use conjugation as a sensor that will trigger the killing mechanisms. Our E. coli is going to be an F+ strain, carrying a modified version of the conjugative plasmid pPed100 containing a killing gene. Only the killer lineage will be able to conjugate because in the worker lineage the pPed100 plasmid will be repressed. Since most bacterial strains in nature are F- our F+ E. coli will be able to conjugate with most contaminants. There will be two killing mechanisms, one carried by the modified pPed100 plasmid into the contaminant and another triggered by the conjugation signal. This secondary mechanism is necessary to stall contaminant growth because conjugation may take some time to occur and may be impaired due to culture conditions. This secondary killing mechanism will be triggered by the presence of a diffusible conjugation signal and will be able to induce neighboring killer cells, even when not conjugating. Such diffusible signal and corresponding promoter have never been described, but we’ve found promising candidates and their characterization is the main challenge for this project.
The Yeastguard: Expandind
Industrial ethanol production occurs in open vats with over 500,000 L. This process is mostly hindered by lactobacilli contamination, which produces lactic acid as their main metabolic product. Once contaminated, the whole vat must be discarded and cleaned, thus generating losses ranking in the millions of dollars.
We want our engineered yeast to be able to detect and control the proliferation of lactobacilli by introduction of a simple genetic device. The device must be able to recognize the presence of lactate in the medium during fermentation.
To allow entry of lactate in the cell, we will construct a gene coding for a lactate transporter under the control of a constitutive promoter. Once in the cell, this metabolite will induce the transcription of the gene coding for killer enzyme lysozyme, which is the most widely used antibiotic for lactobacilli decontamination.
The greatest challenge for this project is in characterizing a lactate-inducible promoter that is not subject to glucose catabolic repression, since the device must be activated during the process of sugar fermentation of the diauxic shift of S. cerevisiae.

c. Please describe any encryption, password protection, etc. that you use to protect the user's data. (It is not mandatory to have such protections, but if you do, describe them.)
We are trying to apply MD5 encryption, an one-way encryption to protect user's data. it means that we encrypt user passwords in to MD5 value and then contrast it with the MD5 stored in the database. For the data transfered between server and client is only MD5(it can't be decode back) ,we can protect  the user's data simpleness.
Q3
Does your software include any other security features? Please describe them here.
Yes, our software includes other two security features, Restricted Rights and Information Verification. Restricted Rights means a user only have some limited rights. And Information Verification is a process to verify gene circuits and information submitted by users.
Q4
Does your software let the user create a design by choosing parts/genes from a list/database, such as the Registry? If so, which lists/databases are included? Is there any restriction on which parts/genes the user can choose?
Yes, a part of our software let user create a gene circuit from a database. The database is built up by ourselves and includes many biobricks that we chose and the logical relationship between each part. No, there is no restriction on which parts the user can choose.
Q5
Does your software allow users to write new data into any public lists or databases? If so, do you check the new data for errors before allowing it to be written?
Yes, a part of our software let user create a gene circuit from a database. The database is built up by ourselves and includes many biobricks that we chose and the logical relationship between each part. No, there is no restriction on which parts the user can choose.
Q6
Does your software include any other features that encourage the user to create safe designs? Please describe them here.
We are working hard to apply a encourage mechanism that makes users willing to do a safe design, such as adding virtual currency or applying review mechanism. So that users may diligently make their design more safe to earn satisfaction. We also print the safe agreement on our websites to remind users design safety.
Q7
Is your team also doing biological work in a wet lab?
No.

Within the scope of this project, where bacteria are being used to express contrast proteins within tumor environments, the promoter had to be tested in similar conditions as to those in which  tumor cells are present. Near and in tumors hypoxic (oxygen depleted) environments can be found. This means that the bacteria will need to express their proteins under hypoxic conditions, when tumor imaging is desired. The proteins that will be expressed are Arginine and Lysine rich proteins, which can give the proteins the feature of generating CEST contrast. As a proof of concept, the promoter that has been chosen (an FNR promoter, which is known to induce transcription when the environment has a low oxygen concentrations, in particular for metabolic cell activities), has to be tested under hypoxic conditions.
Construct Design
The construct was designed as shown below. The design was achieved by incorporating a number of predetermined specifications:  An oxygen sensitive promoter was needed, which is explained in more detail below (see: FNR). To allow for purification of the proteins after expression, a His-Tag was included in front of the protein and a Thrombine cleavage site for cutting off the His-Tag after purification. Since the His-Tag will not be removed, the Thrombine cleavage site is not essential, but to reduce the number of differences between the anaerobic and aerobic sequences, a Thrombine cleavage site was inserted. Then the sequence for the CEST proteins/EGFP was placed into the construct. A spacer sequence and a terminator were placed behind the protein sequence to ensure correct termination of the protein expression.

FNR
Since anaerobic expression is desired, a FNR promoter was inserted in front of the sequence for the desired protein. The promoter design was taken from research by Barnard et al. For more information about promoter design, see FNR Promoter . The chosen promoter had an 1.8 times higher activity than the most commonly used single binding site FNR promoter. The FNR promoter is regulated by the fumurate and nitrate reduction (FNR) protein. This is a transcription activator, that can control the expression of genes when oxygen concentrations are low. The inactive state of the FNR protein can acquire a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, subsequently it can form dimers containing [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters."
