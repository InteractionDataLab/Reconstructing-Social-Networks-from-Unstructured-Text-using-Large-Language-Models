Sensing organic pollutants
Persistent organic pollutants are harmful organic compounds of anthropogenic origins that have been, and in some cases still are, utilized as industry chemicals and pesticides. Due to their ecotoxicity and their propensity of bioaccumulation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) adopted and implemented proposed regulation of these chemicals as put forward by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001 [10]. As of 2017, 181 countries have ratified the convention [11]. While there is no explicit organic backbone, most organic pollutants share certain characteristics. They have one or more cyclic ring structures, most often of the aromatic nature, they are highly lipophilic and they are, to a varied extent, halogenated [12]. Consequently, there are different moieties that can be exploited when searching for homologues that act as natural ligands to gene regulatory elements. The 2012 UCL iGEM team successfully determined and utilized the homology between the NahR inducing ligand salicylate and the aromatic backbone found in most organic pollutants [9].
The NahR gene encodes a Lys-R type transcription regulator found in the naphthalene degrading operon of the NAH7 plasmid of various Pseudomas [13]. As with all Lys-R type regulators, NahR has a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal co-inducer-binding domain [14]. The catabolic genes are organized in two operons, fig. 1, nah (nah A-F) and sal (sal G-M) that encode enzymes for metabolism of naphthalene to salicylate, and salicylate to the TCA-intermediates pyruvate and acetaldehyde respectively [13]. NahR regulates the expression of both sal and nah through binding 60 bp upstream of each respective promoter, Psal and Pnah, and is constitutively expressed upstream nah-G [15]. It binds regardless of the presence of the inducer salicylate. However, the transcriptional induction rate is approximately 20 times higher upon association with salicylate, as this induces a conformational change in the DNA-NahR complex that relieves DNA-bending at the"

Lock/Key library
As mentioned in preliminary approaches in the section RNA-based Delay: Biosynthetic AND gate, our design was based on the previous work of Isaacs F. 2004 , Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 . However, we found that these projects were done using the ""normal"" RBS ( B0034 ). The registry of biobricks has several RBS, besides, as a advice from our modeling team, the RBS present in our constructs should be one with low affinity or “weak” in order to avoid leakage problems. Therefore, we constructed an algorithm based on the previous works which allows us to generate pairs of locks and keys for any RBS (in or outside the registry).
Lock/Key library: Algorithm
Based on the various above mentioned studies on the locks and keys, we have developed an algorithm, which has led us to develop a simple web based tool to help in generating the DNA sequences of locks and keys for a chosen Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) DNA sequence. Click here for more information.

Lock/Key library: New Biobricks Design
We want to test if the algorithm delivers functional locks and keys. In order to do that, we plan to characterize two locks and keys generated by our algorithm. The RBS’s chosen were the weak and medium (biobricks) from the registry. The DNA sequences of these new parts are... more

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Survey questions
Watch our interview! (In French)
English interview subtitles
After this short presentation, they gave us a lot of advice to improve our survey which we did. We presented a new survey on the 17th of April and obtained around 20 answers during this meeting and 53 answers online following this link: (PDF à mettre)  We also discussed during this meeting about the different way we can use to explain Synthetic biology because we still thinking that it was relatively easy to explain it. So, the idea was to do some video, game, and why not an exposition in the Museum Cap Sciences. As, we were already work on a broad game about biology, we decide to try this way.  During the next meeting, the 18 of June, we have presented a first version of our board game: Lab’Life. They give us a lot of advice on the working of the game, on the questions and allow us to better balance the game.
This partnership with Cap Sciences was also useful for the organization of the French Meetup in Bordeaux. They opened the museum so we could present our projects to the general public and get feedback on our communication skills. For more information, please visit our Collaborations page!
Survey results
With our survey, we have succeeded to have 70 answers to our survey on synthetic biology asking for different people which coma from different field as you can see on the graphs below. With the first questions, we can see that a lot of people don’t konw what synthetic biology and even if they answer yes their defenition or not always the right one.
With the following graph, we can see that the fields which people think there can be application for synthetic biology in are related to the environment with also foo industry and farming, and the medicine with health and cosmetics. After come the Energy and scientific outcome. In total, there are 548 votes that mean an average of 7.9 votes per person with the maximum of vote of 15 and the minimum of 1. In conclusion, we can say that in general, people think that there is some application for the synthetic biology.
After the different fields of application, we would like to know which kind of problem people think that synthetic biology can solve. The following graph also shows that people think that synthetic biology can solve medical and environmental issue. In total, there are 341 votes that mean an average of 7.1 votes per"

Figure 12: Pellets collected after overnight co-cultures of IPTG detector ( BBa_K2205009 ) + processor ( BBa_K2205012 ) + sfGFP reporter ( BBa_K2205015 )in ratios 1:1:1 and 1:1:13, with and without 1mM IPTG.
The 3 experiment sets clearly show that the framework is optimised when a higher concentration of cells expressing the reporter device is present (Figures 10, 11, 12, samples labelled 1:1:13). This can be considered as a further validation of our fine-tuning approach using the simbiotics model and the previous plate reader experiments. Although a background signal is visible in the systems expressing the pink ( BBa_K2205018 )and the sfGPF( BBa_K2205015 ) reporters, the blue reporter ( BBa_K2205016 ) due to its lowest background level, constitutes the most suitable reporter module for the Sensynova platform customised as IPTG biosensor. This highlights a crucial advantage of our multicellular, modular framework, which enables each component to be optimised avoiding any extra cloning steps. As each biosensor may be different and require specific designs and optimisation,  easily choosing and changing modules and predicting in silico the bacterial community behavior is essential for the development of new biosensors.
Conclusions and Future Work
In conclusion, through a comprehensive systematic review a design pattern of four components was identified for synthetic biology biosensors. The components are detection and output devices, with optional processing and adaptor units. Based on this design pattern, a multicellular biosensor development platform was designed in which biosensor components were split between cells and linked by intercellular connectors. Modularisation of biosensor components is ensured by the reusability of parts due to these compatible connectors. The production and detection of signalling molecules has been standardised across cells: Detector cells will produce C12 AHL, processing cells will detect C12 AHL and produce C4 AHL, and output cells will detect C4 AHL. Therefore, as long as constructs include the correct connectors, they are compatible will all other devices, without any further engineering of the system. This creates a “plug-and-play” approach to developing biosensors and allows the rapid construction of many biosensor circuit, which can be fine-tuned using only cell-mixing. The splitting of biosensor components between different"

The Material
1x TAE buffer or 1x TBE
5x DNA loading dye
Agarose
HDGreen® Plus Safe DNA Dye or Midori Green
The Procedure
Prepare a 100 ml mixture of 1 % agarose in 1x TAE. Carefully heat the mixture in a microwave to dissolve the agarose. You can either store the agarose solution at 65°C or cool it down to room temperature and heat it again for the next gel.
Now it is important to wear gloves. Add 3 µl of the HDGreen® Plus Safe DNA Dye to 30 ml dissolved agarose and pour the gel in a small custom-made gel chamber.
While the gel is cooling down, prepare your DNA samples by mixing 2 – 5 µl of your DNA solution with 0.4 – 1 µl of loading dye, either in Eppendorf reaction tubes or in a multi- well microtitre plate.
Remove the comb from the cold gel, add 1x TAE/TBE buffer into the chamber and load the slots with your DNA samples. Do not forget the size standard (λ-marker or commercial 1 kb DNA ladder).
Connect the gel chamber with the power supply and switch it on. Adjust the voltage to 100 – 130 V and press the start button.
If the stain bromphenol blue has passed ¾ of the gel, you should switch off the power supply and check your gel under UV light. Safe picture and print result for lab book.
If possible, take a picture for the group seminar and your lab notebook.
You can also stain your gel after the run has finished in a 1 % aqeous HDGreen® Plus Safe DNA Dye or Midori Green solution for 10 - 30 min at room temperature.
Ethidium bromide staining
To stain a agarose gel with Ethidium bromide you have to replace step two and stain the gel after running with the following procedure:
Put on one glove and transfer the gel into the staining solution (0.5 µg/ml of Ethidium bromide in water). After 10 min you can destain the gel in the water bath.
After 10 – 30 minutes of destaining you may analyze your agarose gel, either on a UV table or with a gel documentation device (imager).
Error sources
The DNA molecules were separated with low accuracy
Wrong agarose concentration; low voltage may cause diffusion of DNA molecules due to a long run.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2017,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," human expansion in the cosmos. However, before we can even think to achieve this vision, there are a number of considerations that must be accounted for. Of such considerations includes a problem that is essential to solve, and is essential in order to allowing life to thrive on the Red Planet - the issue of perchlorate contamination on Martian soil.
In 2008, NASA’s Phoenix lander identified traces of perchlorate salts in Martian soil, ranging from concentrations of 0.5% to 1% (Davila et al). What does this mean? Well, perchlorate is a highly toxic substance that, at high concentrations, imposes negative health effects.
Perchlorate Health Effects and Locations
The main exposure pathway of perchlorate for humans is through the ingestion of contaminated drinking water sources. After having ingested of high doses of perchlorate, perchlorate ions inhibit the thyroid gland’s uptake of iodine, thereby disrupting functions of the thyroid gland (Srinivasan and Viraraghavan 1426). Consequently, this leads to a decreased production of thyroid hormones, recognized as hypothyroidism. As the thyroid plays an important role in metabolism and growth, both neurologically and physically, disruption of its function can lead to adverse health effects in humans in all stages of growth. For fetuses and infants, thyroid hormones are essential for the development of the central nervous system (Patel et al. 1). In children and adults, thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.
Ultimately, perchlorate is a chemical that must be addressed before considering the colonization of Mars. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh confirmed that certain conditions of Mars, especially in the presence of perchlorate which can enhance the bactericidal effects of UV lights, make it nearly impossible for microorganisms to survive on its surface of Mars (Wadsworth and Cockell 1). Our proposed method is to use engineered E.Coli. in a regulated bioreactor system to reduce perchlorate in martian soil. We believe that developing a system to remediate the toxic martian soil brings us closer towards developing an environment on Mars that is comparable to Earth, ensuring that Mars can eventually sustain life.
Research into biological methods to remove and remediate perchlorate contaminants on Earth may prove equally as useful. On Earth, perchlorate is a chemical substance that is found both naturally and in manufactured products. Generally, perchlorate contamination is a result of utilizing products containing perchlorate. Acting as a strong oxidizer, perchlorate is commonly used in solid propellants"

A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Bottom-up and Public Outreach
We reached out to the public in many different ways and for many different purposes. We evaluated our new approach towards the general public during our debate and symposium but we did not lose sight of our end-users. We interviewed farmers to gather information about their view on our project. On top of that we contacted the industry to see whether our project is a step in the right direction. We received a lot of interest from the industry and we got the opportunity to use their facilities to perform our own experiments. Amongst all this we did not forget to educate the next generation scientists and this is why we organised an educational workshop that we presented in schools all over Belgium.
The different parts of this approach are:

Mission: Continue Last Year’s Success, with a side of ‘Save the World’
Last year, the CSU iGEM team’s gluten-free beer project and its potential for success in the brewing industry in Fort Collins (and beyond) set the bar quite high for the 2013 team here at CSU. All but one of the student team members were new to the iGEM competition, and this combination of factors meant that our new project had to be one that would make substantial waves at the Toronto jamboree. The first week of summer was spent learning about past iGEM projects and the parts/devices at our disposal, as well as brainstorming possible projects that would be both feasible and practical to pursue. We had many strong contenders, from transcription factors that led to production of specific light pigments, capable of being read by computers that would make synthetic biology a digital process, to droplets consumers could place in their drinks at bars that would change color and fluoresce in the presence of any unwanted drugs. At the beginning of week two, we decided to pursue three different projects.
Our Projects
The first project involved desalination of water using S. cerevisiae modified to sequester and store salt within its vacuole. Read more about this globally-relevant idea here .
The second project was the inflation of a bicycle inner tube using yeast, culturally relevant to bike-friendly Fort Collins. Read more about this project here .
The third project was an extension of last year’s development of gluten-free beer using modified yeast to break down gluten during the brewing process. Read more about our gluten-free mission here .

We proudly roam the steepest and most treacherous mountain sides, looking for adventure, and exploring whatever comes our way. We do not back down from challenges, instead we charge them head on. Although we do occasionally clash heads, we power through our disagreements, because... we are the CSU Rams!!!

The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 2 min 30 seconds (1 minute longer than PCR reactions before) and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Again, in order to check the difference between two PCR machines (older one and new one), the tubes were divided over the two thermocyclers. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

The numbers (1,3,4,5 etc.) describe the plasmids of different bacterial colonies. Additionally, a DNA ladder (100 - 10000 bp; Fermentas DNA Ladder Mix) is added into the gel for the validation of the DNA product length. The resulting c-Jun insert should be 341 bp long. C-Jun #19, c-Jun #20, c-Jun #21 and c-Jun #22 seem to be successfully ligated plasmids, because there are small bands at ~ 300 bp. All lanes show a p31 plasmid band, which is 4919 bp long. But other c-Jun inserts could not be recognized and so all other lanes display definetly the wrong product (JeT, ~180 bp).

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"1655. Hereby, we could use blue-white screening for our assays. This screening method is much faster than the selection on maltose minimal medium and would accelerate the assay even more. Another possible alteration of our strain could be the insertion of a reporter gene under control of an promoter which can be induced by the cAMP/CAP complex. This reporter gene could be an antibiotic resistance, a toxin or the luciferase. Using an antibiotic resistance one could use positive selection, since cells can grow on this specific antibiotic when proteins of interest are interacting. With a toxin under a cAMP/CAP dependent promoter one could use negative selection, since cells can no longer grow when proteins are interacting. The last possible reporter gene lux is giving an output signal through luminescence which could be measured.
We strongly believe, that the creation of VibriInteract is taking the community a step closer to establishing V. natriegens as the new standard chassis organism in synthetic biology.
CRISPR/Cas9
Performing genome engineering in bacteria using CRISPR/Cas9  usually requires the presence of three components in a cell at the same time, namely: Cas9, gRNA and a donor template (Wasels et al. 2017). Therefore we aimed to design a convenient system that allows easy adaption of CRISPR/Cas9 to target various sequences.
Figure 1: LVL1-pTet-Cas9.
The LVL1 plasmid with p15A origin, pTET  promotor, Cas9 CDS and tretacyclin-resisstence is shown.
Preparation of Cas9
A Cas9 and dCas9 LVL0 part was created as a CDS part in our Marburg Collection. The cas9 sequence was PCR amplified from pCas9CR4 (Reisch and Prather 2017). To make this sequence compatible with our toolbox and the iGEM registry, we removed a BsmBI and EcoRI recognition site in the parts sequence creating the Cas9 LVL0 part BBa_K2560047 . For further experiments, a dCas9 part could prove useful and therefore we induced mutations the nuclease loop in the RuvC1 (D10A) & HNH (H840A) subunits creating BBa_K2560054 .
To establish CRISPR/Cas9 in V. natriegens, we conceived a Cas9 plasmid where the expression is tightly controlled by an inducible promoter. We expect this to help during cloning and transformation steps, as the toxicity of Cas"
Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," publically, one must first contact Feds and let them be aware of your ideas to host such event well in advance (estimated 4 weeks prior). Space is very limited on campus therefore letting Feds know of your plans somewhat secures your spot on campus for that day and time.
Next comes having the Waterloo Health Region approve your plans and your food before your serve them to the public. This is a fairly long process and usually teams/clubs/groups are advised to fill out this form and get in touch with Waterloo Health Region at least 8 weeks prior to your event.
While you are still waiting to hear from the Waterloo Health Region, make sure you keep in touch with what else is going on around campus that week that could possibly interfere with your event. For example I our case, UW’s Welcome Week BBQ lunch was being held at the same time same area, same day. Try and contact those individuals so you can work out the space and equipment (if sharing) so no issues arise on the day off the event.
In addition, have your ingredients (same ones listed on the WHN form) arranged and readily available on the day of your event.
Lastly, to save yourself time, if you will be using electronic equipments or large equipments such as water thermals that require you to bring hot water externally, have it arranged close to your location and already approved by the “company” supplying it to you.
Throughout this whole process keep in mind that communication is key. You will be in touch with various individuals from various groups and so be as descriptive and detailed as possible to get your point across.
MOVIE NIGHT/ENTERTAINMENT NIGHT
The purpose of this event was to show a movie related to Synthetic Biology in relation to what is new today (for a possible discussion later on).
When starting an outreach event involving entertainment for the first time one must. Understand that the turnout may not be very high but remember it is a first-time event. Especially if it is held during midterm period.
Next you must focus on getting in touch with Feds again and communicating with them to try and find a place where not only can you show a movie but also accommodate for the amount of people you expect to turn up for this event.  This can be tricky if you have a very specific date picked out. Always have a range of dates as a backup plan because since space if limited on campus, you might not always get your desired location at the day and time you want it.
If there are specific individuals in-charge of these events make sure they are aware of not only where to find the appropriate equipment needed to show the movie"

THINGS TO TRY FOR NEXT TIME
Chop up the lyophilized silk into smaller pieces
I placed large chunks of silk into the HFIP today
Concentration Dialysis
Started at 3:00 PM
Aim for 17 hours on the concentration dialysis, so end it at 8:00 AM tomorrow
I'm doing 17 hours because so far, even 19 hours has caused the silk in the cassette to gel.
ANOTHER NOTE: I accidentally made the concentration solution 100 g PEG in 1000mL water, instead of 100 g PEG in 900mL water, as the protocol states. So I fucked up, this causes less osmotic pressure on the cassette, so honestly I won't be able to tell if it was the lower osmotic pressure or the shorter concentration time that makes a difference tomorrow.
ENDED at 8:10 AM the next day
Enormous differences!
The dope was so much easier to remove from the cassette
I believe that I removed most, if not all of the silk in the cassette (~3 mL)
It's not as viscous as the dope usually is when extracted from the cassette.
Pipetted 100 uL to test the concentration.
There was 0.014 grams in dried silk, meaning 14mg/100uL = 140mg/mL = 14% w/v."

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"Approach: We generated batches of dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNPs) and evaluated their aggregation behavior in a range of 0 - 1000 mM NaCl under three different testing conditions:
No single strand DNA probe (ssDNAp) or double strand DNA (dsDNA).
Only ssDNAp and no dsDNA.
Target gene doping DNA with a specific ssDNAp, inducing annealing between both.
We compared the extent of d-AuNPs stabilization under these three conditions to determine the required concentration of NaCl for testing. After showing the functionality of the prescreening as a potential method for gene doping, we determined three assay properties:
Sensitivity: We assayed different ratios of target/non target DNA concentrations keeping the total amount of DNA constant.
Robustness: We evaluated the influence of sample background DNA after sample preparation.
Versatility: We compared the assay at the same conditions with different targets (varying ssDNAp).
3. Fusion Protein - dxCas9-Tn5
The final step of our gene doping detection method is based on targeted sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform. Our aim was to reduce the amount of data generated with Next generation sequencing and effectively identifying gene doping DNA. We accomplished this by creating an innovative fusion protein used in rapid library preparation required for sequencing. Our fusion protein consists of a cleavage deficient nuclease specific dxCas9 and a Tn5 transposase. The dxCas9 part, loaded with a single guide RNA (sgRNA), will interact with the specific target DNA sequence via complementary matching between sgRNA and target DNA. Whereas the Tn5 part will integrate two small DNA molecules (adapters) required for nanopore sequencing. Thus, the fusion protein is capable of performing dxCas9 guided adapter ligation for targeted sequencing library preparation, allowing us to identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.
Before establishing a targeted library preparation protocol, we produced and analysed the functionality (in vitro and in vivo) of the fusion protein. We evaluated three different types of chromatography (nickel affinity, heparin, and monoQ chromatography) to develop a new downstream process for the fusion protein. Once the fusion protein was successfully purified, we evaluated the in vitro functionality.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent#MBPconstruction_-_-_TEXT.html," metal binding domain can form a stable dimer with its mercury binding affinity remained [2]; and DNA binding domain and metal binding domain can function individually [3]. Based on all these above and carefully structure analysis of MerR via 3D structure modeling, we directly tandemed two copies of metal binding domain of MerR together, to implement a mercury metal binding peptide (MBP) (Fig 2).
STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
As described before, MerR family transcription factors can be separated into two modular domains: the metal binding domain and DNA binding domain. The signature of the family is a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif followed by a coiled-coil region, namely, a similar N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains and a C-terminal effector binding domains that are specific to the effector (eg. metal ions)to be recognized[4] (Fig. 1A, Fig 3). These two domains communicate with each other by the intervening region (hinge). The crystal structure of several members of MerR family have been solved which provides us evidence for MBP design.
Figure 1. The results of 3D structure modeling for MerR based on data of CueR. (A) Crystal structure of CueR[5], which represent the overall structure of the MerR family. The ribbon diagram depicts one monomer in color and the other in gray, with DNA-binding domain in blue, the dimerization helix in red, the metal binding domain in purple and the metal ion in cyan. (B) The predicted three dimensional conformation of Hg (II) bound MerR structure by our 3D modeling. Two monomers are indicated in green and cyan, respectively. (C) and (D) were obtained after rotation of the structure in (B) by 90° about the z-axis and x- axis, respectively. The C-terminal metal binding domain and the N-terminal DNA binding domain are likely to be modular for each other.

The MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of MerR in tandem with a flexible SSG bridge. Blue bars indicate the dimerization helix in the metal binding domain of MerR, and gray bars indicate other α-helices of MerR. The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the loop after the dimerization loop and the region after the"

Parts Submitted to Registry
Below is our list of parts that have been submitted to the Parts Registry.
Judges, we would like to draw your attention to the part EutSMNLK (Figure 1). In this composite part, we have stacked all the 5 Ethanolamine Utilization (Eut) bacterial microcompartment genes from Salmonella LT2. As demonstrated in our Results section, the recombinant Eut proteins from this part are expressed well in E.coli. We have also shown that co-expression of EutSMNLK with a signal sequence-tagged reporter leads to localization of the reporter to a distinct point in the cell, suggesting that this part is able to form a functional shell which encloses the reporter protein.

Red, blue and green peaks represent florescence intensities of GFP in DH5α pro cells grown with 0 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM IPTG, repectively. The orange and cyan peaks represent the florescence of GFP in JM109 cells grown with 0 mM and 1 mM IPTG. As expected, the peaks for the JM109 transformants had similar peaks because this strain does not express LacI which is the Lac Operon repressor protein that is inactivated by IPTG. Conversely, DH5α pro cells expressed the LacI. The conformity among the peaks for the wild-type cells suggest"
Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#fabAmodeltest_-_-_TEXT.html," described above. For all cases of the Protein in water, a protocol derived from the “Lysozyme in Water” GROMACS tutorial (by J. Lemkul, Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Tech) and optimized for βHACdH was used. Briefly, a cubic cell of 2 nm in diameter with the protein centered was used and filled with the generic single point charge 216 (SPC216) water configuration[12]. The system was neutralized to a salt concentration of 150 mM by adding Na+ and Cl-. Energy Minimization (EM) was performed using the Steepest Descent Algorithm[13] with a tolerance of 1000 KJ mol-1 nm-1, to remove any steric clashes or inappropriate geometries.  In the simulation, the long-range electrostatic interactions were modeled using the Particle-Mesh- Eswald (PME) method [14][15] and the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm[16] to preserve chemical bond lengths. Temperature and pressure coupling were performed independently, using a modified Berendsen thermostat[17] at constant temperature of 300 K at a time constant of 0.1 ps and the Parinello-Rahman barostat algorithm[18] at a constant pressure of 1 bar, for a time constant of 2 ps and V-rescale, respectively.  The Molecular Dynamics simulations trajectories were analysed with the GROMACS analysis tools[19], to output structural molecular dynamics trajectories and PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Education-Use-Only, Version 1.3 Schrödinger, LLC) used to visualize and create both still structures and videos. All calculations of progression plots from the simulations were produced using the GROMACS analysis tools with output files viewed in the Microsoft Excel 2011.
Getting a working GROMACS simulation for βHACdH
To study the motions of the N- and C-Termini of βHACdH with molecular dynamics, we first had to get an optimized system preparation protocol, which we based on the “Lysozyme in Water” GROMACS tutorial by [20]. Firstly, we built a simulation box of 2nm around βHACdH, which was sufficient to satisfy the minimum image convention and the simulation cut-off schemes without adding excess solvent. βHACdH had to then be solvated within this box by a solvent configuration compatible with the solvent model applied to the protein, in this case the SPC216[12], which is compatible with"

Designing bacteria with the intention of allowing it to proliferate inside the human body presents a myriad of potential ethical problems. For example, a research team at Vanderbilt University recently designed a strain of bacteria capable of generating a hunger-suppressing lipid in vivo1. Given that one in three Americans is currently obese, this has the potential to significantly impact public health1. However, a person treated with these bacteria could accidentally transmit them to others via fecal exposure, thus negatively impacting other members of the population without their knowledge or consent1. Synthetic organisms may also mutate in unpredictable ways that could harm intended patients by, for example, causing infections or unexpected immune responses2.
 
Techniques do exist to manage these risks. In general, researchers must design methods to quickly eradicate the effector strains in case an unexpected issue arises3. For example, one research group attempting to modify oral bacteria introduced a mutation that made their strain dependent on environmental d-alanine3. The human diet contains very little of this compound, giving the researchers better control over growth3. They also added a mutation hindering the uptake of environmental DNA, thus rendering the strain less prone to transformation3. There are also more general solutions under development, such as “kill switches” that activate and automatically kill bacteria after a certain number of generations2.
While our project is still in its very early stages and mainly focused on translating the basic science and theory into a workable system, in the future, we would want to explore implementing several of these safeguards against potential ethical issues with the release of recombinant bacteria into the environment. For instance, while it is far down the line, as a step on the long path towards a probiotic that could one day be used in humans, we could add a module onto the oscillator plasmid that acts as a kill switch when the bacteria are exposed to the environment outside of the human body. Once this is complete, there would still be various hurdles to overcome, such as ensuring the bacteria with our plasmids don’t cause pathogenicity, and trials in mice similar to the Vanderbuilt hunger-suppressing project’s set-up. As we stated on our Collaboration page , we are planning to talk to other experts on sleep medicine, and the ethical implications of our project is certainly something we’d like to discuss with then.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html," the gfp genes from a bi-cistronic operon (see figure 2.1.1). For this purpose, we cut the registry part BBa_I20260 (into pSB3K3) with ScaI, to obtain blunt ends inside the GFP cassette between the RBS and the start codon of the GFP. The CmR coding region plus the RBS at the end of it was then blunt-end cloned into the ScaI-digested BBa_I20260. This new part was then again amplified by PCR introducing new specific sticky ends on the primers (KpnI/AgeI) (see figure 2.1.2) and cloned together with the oriT (XbaI/KpnI) and the GAM fragment (AgeI/XhoI) in one ligation into pBluescript SKII digested with XbaI/XhoI. In this state (see figure 2.1.3) the insert could be sequenced completely and unwanted XbaI restriction sites were removed by mutagenesis PCR (see figure 2.1.4) before it was transferred into the XbaI/XhoI digested λ phage (figure 2.1.5). The success of this ligation could be proven by growth of infected cells on chloramphenicol but not on ampicillin which is granted by the pBluescript vector and by conjugation of this chloramphenicol resistance. Unfortunately the used λ phage contained a mutation (Sam7) which made it impossible for the phage to lyse its host. Therefore the strategy should be repeated using another λ phage. Nevertheless it could be shown that our strategy in principle worked

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Relatively more light will be emitted by the acceptor when the ligand is bound. The resulting signal is thus, per definition, ratiometric. Intensity of the light emitted by the donor will decrease and intensity of the light emitted by the acceptor will increase as a consequence of ligand binding (see Figure 12).
Figure 12: A) Efficient energy transfer is not possible since the donor and fluorophore are to remote. B) Efficient energy transfer is possible due to the proximity of the donor and acceptor. As a result, light intensity of the donor decreases whereas light intensity of the acceptor increases.
Split Luciferases
Luciferases are naturally occuring proteins which convert a substrate to a product and light. Many organisms feature luciferases to produce light, such as the sea spansy, fireflies and shrimps. These luciferases have been isolated from these organisms and can be succesfully used in vitro to produce light. Some luciferases have also been succesfully split into two complementary parts. These complementary parts can self-assemble into the functional luciferase, restoring its functionality to emit light by converting the substrate. As such, these split luciferases have become a major tool to study protein-protein interactions: these interactions are coupled to a close proximity of the proteins, allowing the parts to assemble into the functional luciferase and emit light (see Figure 13). We use these split luciferases in addition to BRET as a rapid signaling component.
Figure 13: A) The split parts of the luciferase are too remote to assemble into the functional luciferase. B) Upon ligand binding, the two luciferases can self-assemble into the functional luciferase. restoring its capability to produce light from the substrate, yielding a measurable signal.

Understanding Microfluidics
The key goal of MARS is to make microfluidics as accessible and understandable as possible to the synbio community. From our poll results it was obvious that most people had not heard of microfluidics before or only had a limited understanding of their application in a lab. This highlighted the need for more education on our hardware and created the perfect basis for our human practices and public outreach.
We worked together with STEM Pathways at Boston University in order to engage and inspire High school girls to pursue careers or higher education in STEM fields. This event was particularly well suited to our project as our activity would be happening in conjunction with many others related to synthetic biology. This helped prep the students as they received a good understanding of synthetic biology prior to arriving at our microfluidics station.

Summer Pathways
On July 12th 2017 the BostonU Hardware team was able to participate in Summer Pathways, an event organized by STEM Pathways. This event aims to expose and engage high school girls in synthetic biology. Our activity aimed at giving the students a basic explanation of microfluidics and then push them to test this understanding through designing their own synbio chip using cardboard primitives.
The event opened with a video explaining the basics of synthetic biology and how it impacts the world we live in. Following this, the girls broke off into smaller groups and rotated between the different activities planned for the day.
Our activity began with a discussion of what microfluidics are and how our work can aid research in synthetic biology. Although we were limited to ten minutes, the student’s curiosity pushed us to explain microfluidics in way that was simple but did not lose the potential and universal applicability of the hardware.
Next, we handed out two synbio protocols, cardboard primitives and a primitive key. The students immediately began working on translating protocols to microfluidic chips and created a variety of creative designs. While the students worked, we engaged with each group individually answering questions, discussing designs and challenging them to include features such as shared inputs or valves geometries.
During this time, we were also able to ask the students what opinions or thoughts they"

Week 15: August 5 - August 9
University closed August 5 due to Civic Holiday.
This week we worked on the following constructs:
a) construct 11*: pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 - TALE A -link-Blac;
b) construct 11: pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac;
c) construct 10*: pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 - TALE A -link-Kcoil.
The gel for construct 10* and 11* showed bands in the expected size. After gel purification and DpNI treatment, they were transformed in Top10 cells. Colony PCR showed  right-sized bands for constructs 11*.
We did PCR on BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A with primers 1 and 8 to use it as our vector in Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed right-sized bands but PCR purification had low yields (20.4ng/uL) and low purity. After Antarctic Phosphatase treatment, we set up Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed no bands.We repeated the procedure, and PCR had nonspecific amplification. Gel purification also had low yields and low purity. After that, we did PCR with less amount of DNA (10ng/reaction) which showed no bands. Another attempt was performed with different DNA concentration (5 to 45ng/reaction). Some of them had no bands and some of them had non-specific amplification.

The Perl language is a powerful tool for dealing with regular expressions, and it manages to process complex problems in a timely way. For example, for a hash array with a few elements in the buckets almost get the same manipulating time with a big hash with millions of elements. This feature improves the speed of rule based modeling remarkably.
Dealing with regular expressions is also Perl's cup of tea. So the software can spend more running time saved by perl on providing a better user's interface, making it more convenient for users.
Our approach first realized by Chen Liao and 2010 iGEMers emphasize on the structure of the species.
Here is a detailed explanation to the input file of the rule based modeling approach There are four blocks, respectively lists the definition of parameters, the definition of compartments, seed species and events.
The definition of parameters consists of two items. The left side term is the name of the variable, to the right is the expression of that parameter. Note that variables in that expression must be defined by the user. But it makes no difference whether they are defined before the expression. This is to avoid redundant definition and no definition.
Syntax
The compartments definition is in this way:
[name ][outside][ruletable]{volume}{population}, where terms in the square brackets are mandatory, while terms in the curly braces are optional.
The default value of the volume is 1. The outside term means the compartment outside the compartment, which is usually the medium that held the compartment like the ecoli.
Ruletable is used to associate a rule in the data base with the compartment.
The third block, reads [compartment][name][structure][init_concentration]{const}, structure is the definition of the complex structure, const is optional since it's in the curly brace. If the substance has a const property, then after the substance, write a const. if not, leave it blank.
The last block is the events definition. The formats are"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," African green monkey kidney epithelial cells of the ‘Vero’ lineage. C. difficile cultures were monitored over five days in terms of optical density as a read-out for bacterial growth and samples were taken, centrifuged and the supernatant filter sterilised in preparation for the cytotoxicity assay.
Cell supernatants of C. difficile contain the two toxins of interest TcdA and TcdB which are capable of stimulating mammalian epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis. It was thought that the supernatants from cultures containing our two asRNA constructs would have a lower concentration of toxins and therefore produce lower cytotoxic effects on the vero cells. Vero cells were grown in a 96-well cell culture plate using Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). After a confluent monolayer of epithelial cells was formed the sterile C. difficile supernatant was applied and the cells incubated for 24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. After incubation the medium-supernatant solution was taken and added to the LDH master mix solution, incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes before the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. Absorbance at 492 nm is a readout for cell death due to the released lactate dehydrogenase from lysed cells reducing NAD+ to NADH/H+ which is then used to reduce a tetrazolium salt into formazan. The formazan dye produced gives an absorption maximum at 492 nm and since the concentration of formazan correlates with the amount of lactate dehydrogenase released by the cells it can be used as a measurement of cytotoxicity.
Our results show that the supernatant toxicity of wild type C. difficile appears to plateau at 48 hours with no further increases observed. This plateau effect is likely produced by the concentration of toxin in the supernatant overcoming a threshold whereby the assay is no longer sensitive to any increases in toxicity. Both asRNA construct containing cultures take around 120 hours to reach this plateau of toxicity as their rate of toxin production is significantly lower. The rate of toxin production was taken as the OD-normalised LDH assay 492 nm absorbance value divided by the number of hours that the sample had been growing. Using this formula the wild type culture exhibited a toxin production rate of 0.0506 arbitrary units whilst construct one and two produced 0.0102 and 0.0074 respectively. Comparing these rates"
Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Result#experimental-results_-_-_TEXT.html," was used as a positive control. Inhibition of the fungal growth was complete with 20 mg/ml copper sulfate, and at 10 mg/ml a darker halo appeared around the pad as can be seen on Figure 21. This corresponds to a sporulating halo in response to the stress generated by the fungicide.
Figure 21: Results of the preliminary tests of antifungal compounds
Regarding these results, we concluded that very high fungicide concentrations are required to inhibit the fungal growth in the tested conditions. Following these tests, new conditions were adopted in order to avoid too much fungal growth over bacterial growth. The culture medium was adjusted to fit our objective and to approximate the conditions found in the trees, and a 'sap-like' medium was elaborated (See protocols for more informations). Incubations were performed at room temperature. These new conditions were used as standard for the the next experiment.
Camille also concluded that turning the water of the Canal du Midi to deep blue using high copper sulfate concentrations is not such a good idea... Thereby strengthening our faith in SubtiTree :-) !
2. Test with antifungal bacteria
In order to test our B. subtilis engineered strains, it was essential to find the right balance between the fungal growth and the bacterial one which was achieved with the previous modifications. Furthermore, in our genetic constructions, the antifungal peptides were designed to be exported in the extracellular medium. The transformed B. subtilis strains were grown at 37°C during 72h before testings. Inhibitory effect of supernatant and cell pellets were tested separately. After centrifugation, the supernatant and the resuspended pellet were placed on pads and disposed on plates previously seeded with a defined number of conidia (see protocols to have more details). After several days at room temperature, an inhibition halo of Trichoderma reesei growth was clearly observable for the strain expressing the D4E1 peptide. The inhibition was even more noticeable with the strain carrying the GAFP-1 + D4E1 operon (Figure 22). However, no effect was detected for the strain expressing the GAFP-1 gene, we thus suppose a putative synergistic effect between these two peptides. Regarding EcAMP-1, no effect has been detected on the fungal growth. Several factors can explain these results: a number of post-transcriptional modifications are required to have a functional EcAMP-1 and in addition, the sequencing results for these constructs showed several discrepancies with the original designed sequence.
Inhibition halos are not visible with supernatants, probably because of"

Placing this promoter upstream of the lysis cassette (<partinfo>BBa_K124017</partinfo>), completes the simple light-lysis network. Note that the required ancillary receptor genes are contained in a pre-made plasmid (Part <partinfo>BBa_M30109</partinfo>), but should be incorporated into the same plasmid in the final product sequence. Also note that the OmpR system will only work controllably in envZ deficient E. coli; ie in strain CP919 (<partinfo>BBa_V1012</partinfo>).
Heat-Shock Promoter Coupled with System Schematics
The second and current system involves the heat-shock promoter created by UC Berkeley (<partinfo>BBa_K112400</partinfo>), once again linked to a lysis casette downstream (<partinfo>BBa_K124017</partinfo>) and completing a simple light-lysis pathway. We modified the part to be compatible with the current BBa BioBrick standard and submitted the updated brick as <partinfo>K338001</partinfo>. Infrared radiation would heat up the bacteria a few degrees Celsius, which would trigger the production of σ32 transcription factor, which then complexes with RNA polymerase to activate the heat shock promoter and transcribe the downstream genes.
Either simple network is all that is required for two-dimensional (image) selection. We planned to begin by producing flat layers of bioplastic, and work on optimizing the resolution and thickness of each layer, as well as optimizing the properties of the plastic itself by manipulating the crosslinking parameters. However, in order to apply our system to three-dimensional printing, we have designed a more sophisticated gene network, detailed below.
Schematic of the overall biosystem layout and function for 3D printing.
Positive Feedback and the AND Gate
For increased accuracy and speed, we have designed a more complex gene network to allow dual-wavelength light activation using both red 632nm light and infrared, though the system can be applied generally to any dual-wavelength combination. This way, we can select a given plane within a 3D reaction volume using one wavelength (infrared), and select cells within that plane using the second wavelength (red). The red light activation functions identically with the simpler case, but now the OmpR promoter regulates the production of the CinR activator protein"

One-Step Construction of a Bioplastic Production Pathway in E. coli
We, the determined and motivated Duke University iGEM 2009 team of 6 undergraduate students and 3 graduate students, have developed a practical and powerful method to deliver on the promise of sustainable green synthetic biology!
Due to the high costs and inefficiency of the gene and pathway cloning process, we invented a new procedure which lowers costs and increases efficiency. This method, Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC), saves time as well, since it does not involve ligation or restriction enzymes.  See publication of our method here.
We have applied our method to the production of biologically derived plastics. The high costs of the current method of producing biodegradable plastics in an environmentally sound manner has hindered its widespread use.  However, we have discovered a more efficient pathway to produce these biodegradable plastics.
Why do we deserve GOLD?
We had a Great summer working on our project
We submitted 2 biobricks: BBa_K282001 and BBa_K282000
We Created and implemented with great success a more accurate, flexible and efficient method of splicing multi-component biobricks systems into plasmid vectors.

Abstract
A convenient ligation-free, sequence-independent one-step plasmid assembly and cloning method is developed [Quan J, Tian J (2009) Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning of Complex Gene Libraries and Pathways. PLoS ONE 4(7): e6441]. This strategy, Circular Polymerase Assembly Cloning (CPEC), relies solely on polymerase extension to assemble and clone multiple fragments into any vector. Using this method, we are able to quickly assemble a metabolic pathway consisting of multiple enzymes and regulatory elements for the production of a biocompatible as well as biodegradable plastic polymer in E. coli.
What is CPEC?
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) is a much simplified  sequence-independent cloning technology based entirely on the polymerase extension  mechanism. This method extends overlapping regions between the insert and vector  fragments to form a complete circular plasmid (Figure 1a). The basic principle of this strategy is that, after denaturation, both single-stranded vector and inserts overlap with each other by end sequences and extend by using the other as the primer in a"

Oil-Eating Bacteria Arrays
It didn’t even make the evening news this time. An oil tanker travelling from Hormuz to Virginia had collided with a rift and of course, he and his unit had been called to deal with the damages. They were a special firemen unit, specialized in the cleaning of oil. He understood how the responsibility of cleaning flammable fluids could be a fireman’s job, but it still felt weird to climb onto the red boat. “Firemen don’t belong far at sea”, his younger self would’ve said, “There are no fires in the sea”. He sighed while lifting the crates onto the ship. Nowadays, a moderate oil spill was as impactful as the fires he put out on other days: they didn’t even make the evening news.
That was thanks to the contents of the crates he carried. A faded, yellow biohazard sticker hinted at the"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

Protein Trafficking
Submission of BioBricks
The Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) was cloned from a commercial plasmid, pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen) by PCR. For the MLS BioBrick, we have submitted the MLS BioBrick in RFC 10 and RFC 25, the Freiburg format which allows protein fusion, to facilitate other team to fuse the MLS with other protein for purpose of introducing other protein into mitochondria.
For characterization, MLS and green fluorescence protein was fused with constitutive mammalian CMV promoter. The promoter was cloned from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) in RFC10 format, since such part could not be found in partsregistry. The CMV cloned for our characterization construct was also submitted. The two construct for characterization, the CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 and CMV promoter – mitochondrial leader sequence – green fluorescence protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 composite parts are also submitted.
Characterization
In order to characterize mitochondria that it can translocate protein into mitochondria in standard BioBrick, we constructed CMV promoter – mitochondrial leader sequence – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3. We use pCMV/myc/mito.GFP (Invitrogen) as positive control, which include MLS with GFP reporter, and we built negative control, CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 for response without MLS. Characterization was conducted on HEK 293FT cell. If the result shows that GFP is localized in mitochondria while the negative control is scatter all around cell, we can conclude that MLS is targeting GFP into mitochondria in HEK 293FT Cell.
Since we could not find a constitutive promoter BioBrick allow expression"

Under this condition, no genes could be patented, the plant genome's or the respective sequenced part available without trade secret, research could ensue and the country could still naturally produce it's plant and use it in a traditional way may the economic incentive to do so be there.
Next steps
The most extreme opinions involve abolishing patents, some intermediate believe that the defintion must be changed and the practice must be different. May it be for visibility reasons, for acessibility or on moral grounds we seem to however all believe that the situation on patents must be changed. We agree that we iGEMers and researchers in SB should all have unlimited and free access to patented material at least for basic research. A clear next step would be to either team up with lawyers or investigate ourselves the precise laws regarding patents and propose to political institution the modifications that we deem necessary. To then fully accomplish all the objectives we would need to make the proposal visible (media, internet) for more weight and repeat the analysis for every aspect treated or not by previous iGEM teams and Obama's report.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Decoder#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," IPTG & aTc: mCherry as well as eCFP are expressed. Red and blue output.
FACS
Single cell analysis revealed that the repression by LacI and TetR occurs and that the promoters work in absence of the repressors.
Growth curve of the cotransformed TOP10 cells. All of them grew well and similarly fast.  The time after induction was measured after aliquotation of the precultures into the 4 differently treated flasks.
The peaks of the four conditions show the expected properties, which is also visible in the scatterplot (over 90% of each population shown). Induction with IPTG leads to eCFP expression, while mCherry is not expressed. Addition of aTc leads to mCherry expression, while no eCFP is produced. IPTG together and aTc lead to expression of both XFPs. No induction does not lead to any XFP expression. The graphs show the data set obtained 4.5 hours after induction.
This is a proof that the both promoters are working and that the operator sites can indeed be repressed by LacI and TetR. With that knowledge we could start assembling the whole decoder and check if the promoters can also be repressed by cI.
Full decoder
The following construct was cloned to the first part of the decoder. By that, the third repressor cI is introduced to the system. If the promoter is turned on, cI is expressed and represses the other two hybrid promoters. To test the decoder we used the same procedure as mentioned above. The four conditions are then the following ones:
1. No inducer: LacI as well as TetR (due to the leakiness of the tac promoter) are present and bind to the Lac & Tet operator regions. All the promoters are turned off. No output.
2. IPTG: LacI cannot repress the tac promoter anymore, TetR is expressed. TetR represses the expression of mCherry, cI and YFP. On the other hand the promoter controling eCFP is active. Blue output.
3. aTc: LacI is expressed, TetR is not there, mCherry is expressed. eCFP, cI and YFP cannot be produced as LacI binds to the LacO operator region. Red output.
4. IPTG & aTc: cI and YFP are expressed. cI represses mCherry and eCFP. Yellow output.
Hybrid promoters combined to the decoder.

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Overview | Design | Results
Background
mRNA is the molecule that carries information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein coding sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
The Problem
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?
The Objective
This construct aims to test the possibility of multiple start codons on a single mRNA strand. A plasmid has been engineered with two start codons slightly out of frame from each other, but close enough to test start codon slippage.  Testing the fluorescence of E. coli carrying the plasmid will determine the rate of cod"

Human Practices - Silver
Our Human Practices efforts this year have been quite fruitful. We have made more outreach connections this year, and gained valuable insight into how scientists use our software. Our goal was to expand our user base, and through our beta testing efforts we have more users and protocol than ever before.
ProtoCat Beta Testing
Several teams have given us quite valuable feedback on ProtoCat through our beta testing initiative. We reached out to fellow iGEM teams and requested their assistance with testing ProtoCat, as students of biology and other sciences would better be able to evaluate whether or not ProtoCat is truly a useful service than the computer science students who designed it. The teams evaluated the software on several fronts: our Search Function, the Upload Process, the Category System, the User Page, and the Protocol itself. After they provided us with feedback, we gave them assistance with their wikis. Thank you to the following teams: MSU iGEM team, Carroll High School iGEM team, iGEM Peshawar, University of Westminster iGEM team, University of Florida iGEM team, and Michigan Synthetic Biology.
Menlo Innovations Meeting
Additionally, we met with the founders of Menlo Innovations, a local Ann Arbor technology business to discuss the future of ProtoCat, namely, ways to make our product more sustainable and get it adopted by more users. They were able to offer us quite useful advice that we will keep in mind as we continue to grow and develop not only our software, but our team.
iGEM North American Upper Midwest Meetup
This year we also attended the first iGEM North American Upper Midwest Meetup with Michigan Synthetic Biology, Michigan State University iGEM and the Carroll High School iGEM team. At this meetup, teams got to know each other while touring the scenic Michigan State University campus, and had the chance to practice presenting their projects to each other, receiving valuable feedback and having a great time!

IIT Madras Collaboration
Lastly, we have established a relationship with the iGEM team from IIT Madras this year.. During their work on their host organism database ChassiDex, they directed their data donors to upload their protocols to ProtoCat, further populating our database with protocol and increasing the usage of our software. They include the links to our database on the pages of their database"

Assessment of Transfer Effectiveness of Gene-Tech Related Information
Introduction
In our project, we try to diminish concerns over genetically-engineered entomogenous fungi both from building a plasmid construct and a functional         prototype. However, several worries arise when comes to the word ‘genetically-engineered’. But why?
Previous iGEM teams provides precious survey outcome about it:
Although 85% of our respondents said that they would support, or strongly support environmental remediation projects and initiatives, the number         dropped to 60% when respondents were told that these projects would use genetically modified organisms. ── 2014 iGEM York
In 2013 iGEM, BGU_Israel asked the question “In the sources you were exposed to, do you feel that the subject was covered in a positive or negative         manner?” in their survey. 48% of their respondents feel positive, 28% of respondents consider neutral, and 14% think it negative.
In 2014, iGEM team Warwick asked” Do you believe Synthetic Biology is a dangerous tool, knowing that potentially dangerous organisms are being dealt         with?” in their survey. 30% of respondents say yes, 45% give negative answer.
In investigating their survey design and outcome, we thought the iGEM community are getting a clearer image of how the general public percept gene-tech     related information. We, as well as another iGEM team HSiTAIWAN, however, wondered more about how and why these perception is formed? When     genetic-engineering related information, or more generally speaking, gene-technology related information is transferred, in what attitude is the story     being reported? Does the report contain too much terminology that distant the audience with scientific outcome? Does the information sufficient enough to     transfer correct and complete story to public? What about iGEM wiki? Are the stories in iGEM wikis being told in a hard way that can be challenging for    "

Separation
For analyzing our isobutanol production we took samples directly of the cultures and analyzed the supernatant . The next step would be the separation of isobutanol and the medium respectively the bacteria during the cultivation. This could be done by the implementation of a dialysis system. The iGEM team NCTU Formosa presented a possible system .
Alcohol dehydrogenase
As described in the section about the alcohol dehydrogenase we could show the successful overexpression of the protein AdhA from L. lactis in E. coli .
Anaerobic cultivation
Further analysis could be an anaerobic cultivation for a complementation analysis of the strain ΔadhE748::kan . Trinh et al., 2011 showed that E. coli cannot grow after the loss of its alcohol dehydrogenase. Complemented with our plasmid ( BBa_K1465305 ) the mutant should grow. This experiment setup would be a possible in vivo functionality test of our AdhA.

HokkaidoU_Japan,2015,Team:HokkaidoU Japan#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Parties of the Cartagena Protocol will be taken place in Mexico, so they held this online forum like their government. Hokkaido University team participated in this forum and posted our opinions on every set topic.
Our opinions
We provided the following opinions to each Topic.
Topic1. Operational Definiton of Synthetic Biology
One team member said about definition that Synthetic Biology is the academic field whose object is synthesis of materials which is more useful than natural products for human beings by using some genes derived from different organisms. Another member said about Account for Synthetic Biology that because it becomes easy to investigate by standardizing various factors, you’ll get more chances and time to create new ideas. That is the benefit of Synthetic Biology.
In addition, another member proposed interesting analogy about difference between molecular biology and synthetic biology.  That is, when you think about the recipe of delicious apple pie, there are two ways. One is going to the cake shop which is famous for delicious apple pie and guessing the recipe of that shop. The other is making apple pie by yourself, changing each step of the recipe and selecting the best one.
These two ways are applicable to investigation ways of biology. The former, reductive approach is applicable to molecular biology. Just guessing the recipe of apple pie is easy, however it may be bothersome to try to analysis the complex organisms at the molecular level.
And the latter, architectonic approach is applicable to synthetic biology. Because of making by yourself, the complete apple pie has infinite possibilities. In addition, if the recipe is standardized and shared by everyone, that delicious apple pie is available anywhere in the world. This philosophy is just Synthetic Biology.
Topic2. Benefits of an open source approach; who benefits?
A member said that all people who experiment with the use of plasmid vectors reap benefits. It's because by open source, the operations are simplified and become smoother. In addition, if world-wide standardization comes true, exchange of genetic parts‘ll become easier.
Another member said that common people or companies who have never studied biology so much reap benefits. It’s because, by open source, they feel something familiar to genetic modification technology and use this technology easier, common people will get much more chances to come up the ideas and possibilities to append new decisions to their projects or businesses by using genetic modification.
And another member point the basal matter, ""anyway, now SynBio is not enough level to be suitable for the business. To overcome that matter, I think automatization of experiments is absolutely imperative. No matter how simplify operations of experiments by open source, if people who actually experiment don’t understand means"

Aiming to respond to the requirements of the official, we help the team FAFU-CHINA with some modeling work.
The introduction of FAFU-CHINA’s Project
We use the method of RNA interference to suppress the replication of CSBV and to prevent CSBV infecting larvae. The methods of rearing honeybee larvae and viral inoculation under lab conditions were established. CSBV homologous specific dsRNAs (dsRdRP) were synthesized using T7 RiboMAXTM Express RNAi System Kit. The daRNAs and CSBV were added into the food, dsGFP as control. The second instar larvae were first fed with food containing dsRNAs. Twelve hours later, the larvae were then fed with food containing CSBV. The mRNA level of CSBV were detected by RT-qPCR in dsRNAs treated larvae. In order to apply RNA interference technology to production practice RdRP gene cloned into the L4440 vector, and transformed into E.coli strain HT115 to express dsRdRP. Bacteria containing dsRdRP were fed to CSBV-infected colonies for studying its effect on the prevention and treatment of CSBV.
Modeling Work
In FAFU’s project, it is difficult to measure the quantitative data and determine the amount of dsRNAs which is fed to the larvae. So in the modeling part, we devoted to establishing an accurate mathematical model to simulate the dsRNA expression according to the mechanism of T7 promoter. After the model is built, we can determine the relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production of dsRNA . Then we can control  the amount of dsRNAs which if fed to the larvae by controlling the concentration of IPTG easily.
We know that T7 promoter is a kind of inducible promoter. Hill equation can be used to simulate the effect of T7 promoter. In T7 strength model, the independent variable is the concentration of IPTG, and the"

While putting BeeT into use during the competition was out of the question (as per iGEM’s Do Not Release requirements ), the fact remains that BeeT was designed to be a commercial product. As such, the organism itself needs to be safe to handle and apply by layman beekeepers as well as trained lab workers. In addition, there are major ethical and legal concerns regarding the possibility of any GMO - even one as simple as BeeT - escaping into the natural environment. As it is better to be safe than sorry, we included a dual kill switch in the organism’s design as a biocontainment measure.
Minimum-risk Organism
BeeT is designed to minimize the risks in both its creation and application. The machine’s chassis is E. coli, a very well-understood level 1 organism. The same risk level applies to the majority of organisms used during development. In the rare occasion that a gene from a Level 2 organism was required - a Serratia"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," at all. This rendered our metal detectors useless, so we used dogs to detect the IEDs. Dogs are very good at detecting explosives, but the problem is that they indicate the main charge, while you would like to find the trigger.”
We were wondering if the “traditional landmine” was still in use, since you hear mostly about IEDs in the news. Unfortunately, it is: “Landmines are used in every conflict. Besides that, it takes a couple of seconds to lay a landmine but it might take decades to remove it. There is still a lot of trouble with landmines laid during the conflict in the Balkans and the war between Egypt and Israel.” Besides landmines, also cluster bombs provide a large threat. Cluster bombs are large bombs with many small mines/bombs inside; these small bombs are spread around the site of impact.  Bergman: “About 10% of the bombs do not explode. In the case of a cluster bomb with 200 bombs in it, this means that twenty new landmine-like bombs are laid upon impact. In Iraq, where cluster bombs were heavily used, we usually found them by asking kids. They exactly knew where the bombs were, since the bombs marked the boundary of their football field.”
When telling Lt Col Bergman about our landmine sensor, he tells us: “The development of new landmine detection methods is a real business opportunity. Currently, there is no method that can say with 100% certainty that an area does or does not contain landmines. Therefore, a lot of new detectors are developed. We have an intensive collaboration with TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research) to test them and buy only the best of the best.” We explained our project in more detail, especially how it is dependent on whether TNT leaks out of the bomb. After the meeting with Mr. Lenz from the Kampfmittelräumdienst, where he showed us how thick the shells of the bombs were they usually encountered (aircraft bombs), we had some doubt about the fact if TNT would leak out at all. Lt Col Bergman told us that for aircraft bombs, this is probably true, but that most other types of bombs have quite thin shells in which leaks occur easily. “IEDs are often made of jerry cans, which will always contain traces of explosive material inside and outside. Also landmines usually have very thin shells. These will have leaks, especially when they are in the ground for a while.” Lt Col Bergman showed us a truly enormous amount of different bombs to corroborate his"

Using the Speed Vac Machine
Setting up the Speed Vac and Inserting the Samples
Make sure the valve of the Speed Vac machine is set to the closed position; if in the closed position, switch on the pump.
Switch on the cooler/vapour trap.
Set 'Drying Rate' to ""HIGH""
It is important that the pump and the cooler have been running for at least 10 minutes prior to carrying out aspirations - this gives the machine time to reach the correct temperature.
Open the Speed Vac Machine lid and insert the Eppendorf tubes making sure that the lids are open. Also ensure that the Eppendorf tubes are placed in a symmetrical fashion so that a balance is maintained.
Set the 'Concentrator' to ""ON""
Slowly set the valve to the open position.
Leave samples in the Soeed Vac Machine for 5 minutes initially, checking on it's progress afterwards.
Removing the Samples and Turning off the Speed Vac Machine
Slowly set the valve to the closed position
Open the lid and check on the tubes; if they are dry remove them from the Speed vac Machine. If you are not satisfied with the progress, leave the tubes in the Speed Vac Machine for an additional minute (by closing the lid and re-opening the valve).
Once the Eppendorf tubes have been removed, close the lid and re-open the valve slowly.
Set the 'Concentrator' to ""OFF""
Switch off the cooler/vapour trap
Switch off the pump
Slowly return the valve to the closed position.

about us
We Are Awesome
It is very simple to describe … “Work, Learn and have Fun” is our motto. This represents quite well our crazy team. Since the beginning we are creating a great atmosphere between us. Our agenda is full of iGEM activities!! Road trip to Wageningen for the iGEM Benelux meeting, team working each week to meet us and share about the project, presentation of our adventure during a conference, etc…  Though we come from various faculties, we see skills differences as a real added value and all of us have something to say around the table. Responsibilities have been allocated according to our expertise and preferences but jokes duty is exclusively for Marine.
So, we do not need to say a lot but only: “It is a great experience with great people”.
What We Do
Solar Biobadges
Our objective is to design a biobadge detecting excessive UV exposure and therefore warning us to seek sun protection should it become necessary. This badge would work as a capsule holding E. coli cells, changing colours as the UV intensity increases. Therefore, we investigated two approaches using photocaged tyrosine (o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine). In both cases, UV-rays will release the tyrosine and enhance a reporter signal. (1) Starting with a tyrosine auxotroph E. coli strain, a reporter RFP will be synthetized once tyrosine is liberated from its cage. (2) Using a photocaged peptide and a specific transcription factor called ComR, we also aim at UV-controlling the expression of the reporter gene. The capsule would also work as a safe and reliable containment, destroying the engineered microorganisms once the biobadge is discarded.

Because each project needs a great team!

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," beekeepers sometimes use extracts of rosemary or oregano against Foulbrood, but it is always difficult for them to know what dose to add and ensure it is adequate for fighting the diseases and at the same time does not destabilize the hive. On another hand, he mentioned that the method of burning beehives results very expensive for them. Currently, in Cuauhtémoc, there is almost no presence of American Foulbrood, since, in the past, many sick hives were exposed to this burning method, then the disease decreased. On the other hand, European foulbrood is most commonly found in Cuauhtemoc.
The beekeeper emphasized how a natural product against Foulbrood is needed, so there are not left residues in the honey and he also highlighted how beekeeping varies around the world and sometimes there are specific necessities for each region.
Thanks to the sharing we made with the beekeeper of our project, he was able to have a new panorama of beekeeping, and how emerging technologies, in this case, synthetic biology, can accurately respond to specific problematics and can relegate past methods that imply many setbacks.
Mr. Rodríguez kindly invited us to present our project with the Cuauhtémoc beekeepers association and commented us about M.C. Alejandro Romo who has done different investigations on the diseases and who we would talk with later in this story.
Getting to know real experiences of the treatment methods used against our interest diseases helped us to better measure the severity of the problem and the obstacles with which beekeepers have to fight to keep their bees’ welfare.
