DesA in Desferrioxamine B biosynthesis patway
We have set up the BBa_K1951000 simple biobrick. We have designed this biobrick from the sequence of desA of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (complete genome here ). It codes for the lysine descarboxylase DesA. It is an enzyme from the lyase family that converts lysine to cadaverine. desA is the first gene from the des operon. This operon is involved in biosynthesis of the Desferrioxamine B, a bacterial siderophore using to bind ferric ion from the environment. As this sequence comes from a gram positive bacterium (i.e., Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)), we obtimised codon for expression in Escherichia coli by using codon optimization IDT software [1] .
We have successfully registered for iGEM and we had a great summer. We will attends the Giant Jamboree and we are ready!!!
All the deliverables have been met.
Our Attribution page is created and all the work done during this fabulous project is referenced here .
Silver medal
To compete for the silver medal, we have constructed a BBa_K1951004 functionnal composite biobrick, that works as expected. This biobrick were designed from I0500 (pARA/araC inducible promoter), B0034 (Ribosome Binding Site) and our basic biobrick K1951000 (Lysine decarboxylase DesA). To test for function, we have complemented a cadA mutant with our biobrick BBa_K1951004 , and demonstrated the recovery of cadaverine biosynthesis. Our results show even more production than obtained with the WT strain. For more information, please visit this page .

Listed at this level are Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, chickenpox and so on.
Level 2:   The hazards to humans and animals are moderate or contagious.
Listed at this level are pathogens of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza, Lyme disease, Salmonella, and so on.
Level 3:   The hazards to humans and animals are high, but there are still methods for inhibition.
Listed at this level are pathogens such as anthrax, SARS, HIV, West Nile encephalitis, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and so on.
Level 4:   The highest risk to humans and animals has not been found in any effective vaccine or treatment.
Viruses that have been identified at this level are hemorrhagic fever diseases such as Ebola, Hanta, and Lhasa.
To deal with this level of biological hazard, it is necessary to have a laboratory (BSL4 or P4) that meets the standards of the fourth level. Such laboratories must have extremely strict access control and must be negatively isolated to avoid leak when it is damaged. Workers and items to be treated must be isolated (such as placing the item in a glove box with a negative pressure or wearing a full and independent gas supply gown).

For example, the total world production of edible rosaceous fruits in 2005 was about 113 million tonnes. If this amount is converted to money considering a very conservative farm gate value of US$400 per tonne, this represents an economic value of $45 billion (Hummer, 2009).
This family commonly suffers from different diseases, the majority caused by pathogenic bacteria. One of the most harmful diseases is known as Fire Blight, which can be developed in the flowers, fruit, branches, trunks, scaffold limbs, root systems and practically the whole plant (UCANR, 2011). Fire Blight was the first disease proven to be caused by bacteria, it was originally found in North America, but through time it has vastly expanded all around the globe, including many countries from Europe, Asia and other American countries like Canada and Mexico. Although it's been many years since its discovery, nowadays there's still not a highly effective way to counterattack this problem (Johnson, 2000).
Plague control and loss costs are estimated in approximately $100 million a year in the USA. Specifically, in Michigan in the year 2000, $42 million in losses were estimated because of the removal of about 400,000 apple trees, while approximately $68 million is estimated in losses in Washington and northern Oregon. The decline of apple and pear trees from their landscape can be expensive to replace and could have a negative effect in many areas. Although there are no recent investigations in Mexico about the epidemy, it was estimated that in 1994, Chihuahua, one of the most important producing regions of apples in Latin America, had 10% of its crops presenting the usual symptoms of the disease. In the long-run, the disease of the fire blight is a critical factor for economy and society (Johnson, 2016; Ramirez, 1994).
It's important to highlight that Fire blight is caused by a phytopathogenic bacteria; Erwinia amylovora. It is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria widely distributed in forty-six countries in every continent except Antarctica. The main characteristics that define this plant pathogen as a significant threat are:
Fast plant propagation that could induce the disappearance of the affected crop in a single vegetative period.
Great capacity to disseminate by different means.
Its ability to survive in the tissues of host plants.
Devastating effects with high economic impact"

Zusätzlich haben wir über mögliche Ziele unsere mutierten Tar-Konstrukte diskutiert. Nach unserem offiziellen „Meeting“ haben wir uns Präsentationen von zwei Team-Mitgliedern angehört. Alicia’s paper hatte den Titel “Engineering microbes to sense and eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a human pathogen"" (Saeidi N., et al. , 2011)” und präsentierte ein Beispiel der Synthetische Biologie für ein System um Biofilmformation in P. aeruginosa,  zu inhibieren. Saeidi et al. entwickelte ein E. coli Bakterium um Bacteriocin zu produzieren. Dieses ist ein antimikrobielles und lysierendes Enzym, welches die E. coli Zellwand zerstört durch das  „Quorum sensing“ Molekül AHL produziert von P. aeruginos. Sie konnten zeigen, dass man durch dieses Systeme eine Vernichtung von P. aeruginosa in vitro möglich machen kann. Danke an Alicia für ihren inspirierenden Vortrag! Der zweite Vortrag wurde von Sandra gehalten. Sie präsentierte das Thema ""Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits""(Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz, 2012). Normalerweise aktiviert Signal eine Signalkaskade. In der synthetischen Biologie ist es theoretisch möglich einen Signalweg mit beliebigen “outputs” zu kreieren. Des Weiteren hat sie uns über den Mechanismus der „Chemotaxis“ informiert.  Vielen Dank Sandra für deinen interessanten Vortrag!

Vectorization problems [13,14,15,16,17,18,19]
Today, six major issues still unresolved:
- Stability,
- Toxicity,
- Targeting/specificity,
- Passage through the membrane,
- Immune system: resistance or stealth,
- Industrialization.
The stability is an issue concerning principally lipidic nanoparticles, indeed lipidic autoassembly like liposomes are stable in time. In vivo, this type of vector incorporates or disrupts, and then releases its content. Some molecules, like cholesterol, can improve its stability, but they stay the most fragile vectors and so, the less protector for the active principle.
The toxicity is an issue from two origins. It can result from a potentiality of some vector to become uncontrollable or from fabrication methods of some other vectors. Viruses are probably the best vectors, but they are the most dangerous as well. There is a great potentiality, even for defective viruses, of replication without control in a patient organism, and it is due to the genomic recombination phenomena, very common in this type of biological particles.
The other toxicity issue comes from nanoparticles fabrication methods. The use of organic solvent for their conception can be dangerous for the patient, because even with elimination steps, organic solvent dose injected is never null.
The targeting is considered as a strange issue, it is supposed to be a technological advantage provided by the vectorization, but the targeting is far from being optimal. Targeting is realized by the recognition of a membrane marker expressed at the targeted cell surface. A weak quantity of markers is specific to only one type of cell in the entire organism. So, even if the therapeutic agent dose is higher at targeted cells level, other cells in the body will suffer to the therapeutic agent effects.
The passage of the membrane is a key event for medicine; its efficiency is linked to its capacity to cross this barrier. The therapeutic agent, whose action is subcellular, should enter inside the cell to act. Prokaryotic vectors as well as polymeric nanoparticles are disabled by this crucial step in the medicine becoming.
The immune system is probably the principal issue. It can be both specific and non specific. Indeed, the immune system fixes all what is superior to 60nm and which is in the circulatory flow. It is able to adapt and react faster as one goes along the meeting with vectors. We know for a long time that viruses, phages and bacteria are detected by the immune system and are eliminated. The first detection is always late compared to the vector injection; this permits an efficacy of the first dose. But"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 96 wells plate. As negative controls, 0 L ssDNAp 1 was added. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
With the new batch of d-AuNPs, the salt concentration variation was performed again. The range of salt concentration is adapted from 0 to 1000 mM NaCl added concentration. Additionally, ssDNAp cause a stabilizing effect as the color change occurs at a higher salt concentration compared to the solutions without ssDNAp.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt with(out) ssDNAp
The dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations and the influence of ssDNAp is determined. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution and 20 µL NaCl solutions (250, 500 and 1000 mM respectively) were added in the 96 wells plate. To test the influence of the ssDNAp concentration on d-AuNPs stabilization, different amounts of 0 to 10 µL ssDNAp 1 was added in subsequent wells. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
With a higher ssDNAp concentration, the d-AuNPs are being stabilized. The color change to purple, which indicates destabilization, occurs at a higher salt concentration.

Based on the results of the two cultivations, the relative beneficial effect (RBE) of PtNTT2 was calculated using equation (2). For each measurement point n, the optical density of the cultivation of a transporter variant in ATP supplemented media was divided by the optical density of the reference E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 in ATP supplemented media. The same was done for the cultures in K2HPO4 supplemented media. The value for ATP was then divided by the value for K2HPO4. The sum of the quotient for all measurement points n was then divided by n to obtain the final value for the relative beneficial effect of PtNTT2 shown in figure (12). The final error was calculated through error propagation of the standard error of each measured optical density.

Legend also speaks of his legendary pie making skills, though few live to tell the tale of a pie of such high caliber, as the sheer ecstasy of tasting one of these legendary morsels causes the human body to permanently cease function (in some parts of the world, death in such a way is considered an honorable one).   This biography serves as more than just a record, it is a herald, a warning for times to come.  The one named Rishabh is powerful beyond measure, though his current form may be unassuming.  Woe to those that stand in his way, as he is not known to be merciful.  The last recorded time his wrath was incurred, the Black Death occurred.  Not even the very best of heroes can even dream of facing his final form, which is also known to be incredible sassy.  So beware, beware to all those who hope to undermine his efforts.  In even the most secretive of moments, do not forget.   He won’t.
Ritvik Sarkar
What is the Ritvik? I'm glad you asked. Ritvik used to be our team's secret secret nonlethal weapon, until a series of not completely unrelated explosions and earthquakes alerted national media to its existence. Ritvik is the original prototype for our project, with its 20 micron filter hair outperforming all competition. We are still struggling to develop a successor that has even half the ability to make wet things into dry things. Capable of building models to ensure our team's success as well as other smaller ventures such as hostile takeover of midwestern states, Ritvik is an essential component of our team. Without its capabilities as a replacement pump system, we would be incapable of surmounting the one foot of head that stalls our team's inevitable victory.

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the extraction of potential reaction products, to be able to start a LCMS analysis in order to detect the synthesized caffeine.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

Gold 4/4
Integrated human practice; Expand on your silver medal activity of human practice by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project
We talked to several experts in order to develop new goals for the future perspective of our project and to expand our knowledge about the different sub elements. Among those are experts in the areas of therapeutic use of biodegradable plastic and experts in the use of antibiotics and bacteriocins as new antimicrobial components. Furthermore, we made a survey to one of the high schools we visited and used their feedback to improve our presentation. They also gave us new ideas for future development of our Bacto-Aid. Moreover, we talked to a nurse about their requirements for a patch like ours. Lastly, we made a survey to Danish companies that work with plastic production and investigated the possible interest in the use of plastic produced by bacteria. For more information go to Integrated Human Practice or explore our website to see where it was integrated.
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry
We examined the phaCAB BioBrick created by Imperial College team 2013 . We characterized the relationship between the strength of the additional promoter and ribosomal binding site and the yield of plastic. In the process we created another phaCAB construct that appears to generate a higher yield of PHB. Furthermore, we characterized the effect of the pantothenate kinase II BioBrick submitted by Imperial College’s 2015 iGEM team on E. coli’s proteome. For more information see our Demonstration & Results Page .
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept
By producing bacteriocins and PHB from different BioBrick devices, we demonstrated a functional Proof of Concept . Furthermore"

Modeling
This year we designed a construct where a lot of different genes interact in several ways. Eight sets of genes were constructed, using five distinctive kinds of genetic expression. They can be classified under the following categories:
a) Genes constitutively expressed
b) Genes that form a protein complex
c) Auto regulated networks
d) Simply induced sequences
e) Complex induced sequences
Equations for Phytochrome-PIF6 complex
In order to produce proteins, in the cell, two main reactions happen. First, DNA is transcripted to mRNA and then it is translated to a peptide sequence, it could be represented in the reaction by:
All these reactions are mediated by two specific enzymes, which are RNA polymerase (transcription) and ribosome (translation). These reactions have been well described in literature and can be modeled to a Ordinary Differential Equation system.
The rate of production of the PhyB construct is given by the rate of transcription of the protein from the mRNA molecule and the degradation of the messenger. Therefore:
Where γ is the translation rate of the cell, and α is the degradation of the degradation rate of the protein.
Also, the concentration of the messenger molecule is given by the equation
Where a represents the activity of the promoter, that is related to the capacity of being activated or suppressed by a transcription factor; β is the maximal production rate of the CaMV promoter (which is attached upstream to PhyB) and is a linear function dependent on the time of the reaction; as in the last equation, α is the degradation rate.
Also, since PCaMV is a constitutive promoter, the value of its activity is equal to 1. So the equation is reduced to
As PIF6 construct is connected to the same promoter, the equations of its expression are deduced by the same way, so:
In our system, both expressed gene constructs are part of another reaction in presence"

Human Practice
A Step Towards Our Community - The HKUST iGEM 2013 team had three main objectives in mind for human practice: safe application of our project, bioethics and biosafety, and provision of synthetic biology information for the general public. Each objective was considered carefully and human practice events were developed according to these objectives.
Novel Human Practice Approach: Country Profile , Comparison in Synthetic Biology Development and Blog
Presentation
Presentations are one way to share information about our project and iGEM to other people, whether it is to fellow scholars or to the general public. Find out more about our past and upcoming presentations on synthetic biology.
Country Profile
This is a novel human practice project that we performed. Our country profile provides information on synthetic biology in Asian countries to facilitate a more holistic understanding of synthetic biology around the world.
Gene Therapy Article
It is necessary to think about how our project could actually be applied. Since gene therapy was mentioned as a mean to deliver our DNA into human liver cells, we thought it was necessary to research on current gene therapy procedures.
Videos
We have made several videos to inform the general public about synthetic biology and our project. We tried to make the content relatively easy to understand so that people with no background knowledge in biology understand the content.
Blog
While working on the Country Profile, we could not find any webpage or blog specifically made to update people about synthetic biology for Hong Kong viewers. So, we decided to make a simple, but interactive blog for the public in Hong Kong written in Cantonese.
Interview
To discuss the possible safe application of our project, we met with prominent individuals in Hong Kong society. The interviews allowed us to gain a better understanding of how our project could actually work as a product.
Safe application
We thought safe application of our project was a very important aspect of our project because we thought that in the future our project will probably be directly applied on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolic process into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider how to eliminate possible complications that"

""Fixing"" our images using pouring plastics
When working with modified organisms such as our colourful E. coli, you must always take into account that their exposure to the environment must be minimised. Once our bacterial photographs have ""developed"", we want to be able to preserve the image but prevent release of the bacteria into the environment. Considering that, once the image had been made, we can't reverse the process or use the bacteria to generate another picture, we can utilise techniques to fix the image with no concerns about keeping the E. coli alive.
Our initial idea was to insert a ""kill-switch"" into the bacteria to switch of the image development at a chosen moment, then seal the plates they were grown on to prevent any unwanted release. However, this seemed overly complicated considering that all we needed to do was kill the bacteria then seal them into a contained environment. We looked instead at trapping the cultures between layers of plastic.
Our first test were using cultures of RFP, which exhibits a rich pink colour when grown overnight on LB agar plates overnight. We looked at using a clear, water based varnish (which is usually used for preserving craft works) and a thick, viscous epoxy resin.
The clear varnish was not particularly successful. It seems like the reasonably high water content of the agar plates prevented the varnish from setting, and instead of being clear, the varnish was cloudy and difficult to see through (see images).
The epoxy resin was initially far more successful. It formed a thick, clear protective layer over the cultures; when it was set, we were even able to peel the plastic off the plates. However, the resin appeared to react very aggressively with the bacteria. The colours leaked into the agar, and the colonies did not stay intact when we peeled off the plastic.
However, after we spoke to the members of the Exeter Camera Club (see our Outreach page) they offered some alternative techniques. We were recommended to try gum arabic , which is a natural gum derived from tree sap. It has been used extensively in lithography , certain forms of historical photography , watercolours and even the food industry. As it is a natural gum of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, it should react less aggressively than the epoxy resin but still form a protective layer. However, gum arabic is water-soluble, which may be an issue with the LB agar, which contains a high"

Furthermore, the Hill’s coefficient of each repressor-protein interaction are close to each other in our experimental design; hence, we assume that $n_1=n_2=n_3=n$. Accordingly, we derived a new version of ODEs of the system:
The main variables in these final ODEs are core parameters (a) and a Hill’s Coefficient (n). Through this model, we can subsequently analyze the system's stability and predict the system's behaviours.
(III) Overall Assumptions:
Degradation is a unimolecular reaction, depending on the concentration only.
The copy number of the plasmid (the amount of DNA) is constant.
mRNA reaches equilibrium much faster than protein, such that mRNA is at steady state when considering protein dynamic.
Compared to the cell division rate, degradation rates of individual repressor proteins are negligible. As a result, protein dilution rate due to cell division is used to replace the repressors’ degradation rates."

The picture shows a plate containing our growing ""stress bacteria"". The three white discs contain antibiotics, which can be seen from the                                                     lack of                                                     growth in the surrounding circle. On the edge of that                                                     circle you can see a dark color. Those are bacteria that are producing a grey/blue chromoprotein in response to stress caused by a low antibiotic concentration!
Disk diffusion for dummies:
Disk diffusion is a method that can be used to easily determine whether a compound is lethal to bacteria. To do this, small discs containing                                                     a                                                     potential antibiotic are placed on growing bacteria.                                                     The compound in the disc will then slowly spread out. If the compound is lethal to these bacteria, a “halo” will form around the disc where bacteria can not grow.
Night of Discoveries 
During the week of 10 - 16 september we had the honour of organising a workshop for the Night of                                                     Discoveries (formerly known as the “Nacht van kunst en                                                     kennis”). We provided people with the opportunity to create their own bacterial drawings and play our renewed ""Escape Room""-game, while learning something about antibiotic resistance on the way. We                                                     explained our project to everyone who was interested, and                                                     fortunately many people were. It was great to be part of such a big event! We loved the experience and hope that the next iGEM team will also be able to participate.

Crowdfunding
Our crowdfunding campaign: ""Say YES to Stress!"" received a major boost during the month of September. Thanks to all our amazing donors, we have                                                             reached over 80% of our total goal, which equals an amount of €7.820. The crowdfunding will end on October 6th during the Family Day of the Science Faculty at Leiden University. So, please                                                             help                                                             us reach 100% by choosing your colour and saying YES to stress!

Opening of the Academic year!
On the fourth of September we had the pleasure to attend the ceremonial opening of the academic year at the Faculty of Science. We                                                     were welcomed by the dean Geert de Snoo, were entertained                                                     by a fascinating lecture on ecotoxicology and enjoyed a musical intermezzo. Afterwards we were of course present at the drinks to promote our project and our crowdfunding campaign! We even quickly                                                     met up                                                     with Ionica Smeets, an endorser of our project and known                                                     from TV and radio.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#NUPACK_-_-_TEXT.html," = £110).
Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

To promote synthetic biology, a synbio introductory talk and wet-lab training were organised for students from Sun Fong Chung College. There were around twenty Secondary 5 (Grade 11) students who attended the introductory talk on the 5th July and some of them were also invited to gain a hands-on experience on wet-lab on the 4th and "
TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html,"tes proteins fused to it through the bacterial cell membrane. Expression of the protein is controlled by a temperature-sensitive promoter ( BBa_K608351 ). This promoter is the primary regulator, and does so by initiating transcription at or above 37⁰C. Finally, we included a strong ribosome binding site (RBS; BBa_B0034 ) for translation, and a double terminator to end transcription ( BBa_B0015 ).
Granzyme B Inhibitor (ACT3m)
Our goal is to prevent damage from excess degradation of ECM proteins in chronic inflammatory conditions. To protect ECM proteins from cleavage by GzmB without interfering with GzmB's intracellular functions, we wanted to find an inhibitor that could function exclusively in the extracellular space. Through literature research, we found that the GzmB inhibitor in humans is called SerpinB9, but it functions mainly inside cells (Sipione et al., 2006). In mice, an extracellular inhibitor, Serpina3n, exists (Ang et al., 2011). However, we wanted to inhibit GzmB in the human body, so we knew we had to find an inhibitor that would work in humans. Finally, we came across a paper where mutations made to an extracellular human protein, Antichymotrypsin (ACT), allowed it to bind and inhibit GzmB (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014). This was perfect for our purposes, so we ordered ACT cDNA (from Sino Biological Inc.) and followed their method to create an extracellular human GzmB inhibitor.
Removing P (PstI) Sites
Upon receiving the ACT gene and analyzing the provided sequence, we learned that there are two P cutting sites in the gene sequence. These two P sites would interfere with cloning, especially since P is an essential site in the BioBrick backbones that we want to build. To remove these internal P sites, we sent the part to a company (Mission Biotech) for mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequence was mutated to remove the P sites, without changing the final amino acid sequence. A sequence was provided at the end for confirmation.
Changing Three Amino Acids
Naturally, ACT is an extracellular protein found in humans. This makes it a good starting point, because it is location-specific; however, ACT lacks the ability to bind and inhibit GzmB. The authors of the paper (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014) compared the amino acid sequence between the extracellular mouse inhibitor Serpina3n and"

We also amplify B series plasmid in miniMos system for microinjection. We integrated Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP fusion genes into C. elegans(Caenorhabditis elegans) by microinjection respectively.

Microinjection Results
In order to get C. elegans strains with the preference to blue lights and the aversion to red lights, we used miniMos injection to inject our plasmids in to worms for expression.
On July.7, we microinjected 20 worms with Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and 20 worms with Str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP. After 3 days, for each kinds of worms, we obtained more than 6 free-moving F1 with fluorescences. Then, 10 days after microinjection, we did heat shock to screen stable inheritance worms. For worms with Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry, one plate successfully survived more than 30 worms without GFP(a selective marker), but none of worms with Str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP survived. In addition, we did mapping experiments and demonstrated that Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry had successfully inserted in chromosome 1.

Reductionism and evolution
The following questions are an introduction to the main ethical issue: whether the reductionist approach in biology has any effect on our current perception of life and if so, how. The questions meddle with general traditional and established viewpoints. The general content of these multiple-choice questions comes back in the last open question, where the survey-participants could choose to write their opinion on what is life and whether the reductionist approach would lead to fully understanding life.
Graph 1.
1. Reductionism (also known as the top-down approach) aims to understand the nature of complex things by reducing them to the interaction of their parts. The reductionist approach has been applied to biology in order to understand the complexity of living things by studying its components (such as DNA, proteins, etc). Do you think that the reductionist approach will lead to understand life?
No, living systems are too complex to fully understand, they have properties that cannot be explained by studying their individual parts
No, biological phenomena are fundamentally special in a way that prevents them from being completely understood
Yes, fundamental research in biology will eventually result in the ability to fully understand life
Yes, we already understand living systems completely, due to the reductionist approach
Other:...
This question is difficult to answer because it depends on future expectations. What can be seen from the results is that the synthetic biology community has very different believes. The group is practically split in two equal camps where 48% thinks that the reductionist approach will lead to understanding life, while 39% votes for the complete opposite. The majority of the latter group thinks that mankind will never be able to fully understand the mechanisms of life, because they have properties that cannot be explained by reductionism. Although not explicitly stated in answer A, this would probably indicate that they believe that biological systems have emerging properties that can not be explained using the reductionist approach.
The other-answers:
There was a very small group that did not agree on the explanation of reductionism as given in the question. The question states that reductionism reduces systems to the interaction of their parts and that it is a method to study systems by studying their components, while they believe that reductionism only applies to studying the individual components. Reductionism covers quite a broad field, it is explained differently and many definitions can be found. But the main theme that we tried to address is the scientific approach of working on complex systems top-down to understand them by studying the subsystems (both components"

I) Purpose
To characterize the mutant phage we selected from 9.13 Mutagen Concentration Test
II) Expected Outcome
EM pictures of phage with distinctively larger or smaller size.

III) Reagents Used
Post-CsCl mutant phage from 9.13 Mutagen Concentration Test
Mutant phage S4, S10, S21, and L8
x8 top agar
LB
IV) Procedure
1) Overview of previous attempts before iGEM Regional Jamboree
Before the Regional Jamboree, we identified our S4, S10, and L8 mutant. We tried to sequence their capsid genes (with the help of Dr. Grose) and take pictures using TEM. Unfortunately, the sequencing results' accuracy was less than 20%. And our phage does not have a high enough titer to be seen under electron microscope.
Thus we started off our characterization procedures with designing new primers (BI319 and BI320) and propagating our mutant phage.
2) Propagating Mutant Phage (10.10)
Three different conditions of propagation was used for WT, S4, S10, and L8

Investigators:Theo
S4+S15 Nr1, 5 and 7 were sent for sequencing. Some problems arose and the sequences seemed to not be correct or only parts of them. So I decided to digest all of the minis and if an insert band (ie about 1300bp, since it is K124017 with RBS) was seen, to extract it from the gel and use it for subsequent ligation with the Promotor.
M66 which is (or SHOULD be -arrghh-) the already modified Lysis genes K124017 was digested with EcoRI and PstI and two bands at around 1100 and 1400bp were seen, so both of them were extracted. I want to clone them on the pSB1C3 Vector and sequence that so that the part is also ready for the parts registry. More on that tommorow.
Note: S4 is the B0034 RBS (ribosome binding site), S15 is the non-modified K124017 Lysis Cassette without RBS
Note 2: S4+S15 Nr1, 5 and 7 were digested with XbaI + PstI so that they can be one-step cloned with the temperature sensitive promotor (to be cut with SpeI and PstI and then treated with alcalic phosphatase as well as with the Qiagen PCR purification kit)

Procedure
1.Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2.Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl). For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.
3.Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
4.After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate"

Plasmids
The Plasmids will be constructed as shown below
Plasmid 1
Plasmid 1 mission is to recognize the presence of chitin and to up regulate the promoter of the chitinolitic operon when chitin is abundant in the media.  We´ve extracted and amplified chitoporin, chitin sensor and chitin binding protein (CBP) from Vibrio fischerii and aimed to create the bricks needed for the assembly of the plasmid that can recognize and break the chitin association.
Plasmid 2
Given that the chitin detection process is always active due to its basal expression, it is necessary to have a regulation so that the response signal to the plant could have two levels of expression. If the response signal to the plant is not regulated, it is possible to have fake or erroneous defense system activation signals when they are not needed, inducing resource losses that should be directed to plant normal growth and fruit production. It is therefore optimal to have the the signaling system activated only when there is a constant chitin presence.
The mechanism is planned to have two parts: a positive feedback that transforms the graduated input signal to an on/off signal with time delay, and an activation mechanism that requires both the delayed signal and the direct chitin signal, so that the system activates only when there is a constant time lapse with phytopatogen presence.
Positive Feedback
The positive feedback genetic system is well studied, and shows theoretically as well as experimentally a bistable response, moving between two discrete stable states without being able to stay in intermediate states. Another property that exhibits this type of feedback is the capability to delay the protein synthesis kinetics.
The operon chosen to control the response is based on the promoter PRM and the cI gene from the lambda bacteriophage. In this system, CI positively regulates its own synthesis, and the feedback activation guarantees the existance of two stable levels of expression. It has been found that the rise time of the positive feedback system expression is activated slower than a system without feedback, with delay times of approximately 70 minutes.

Elution
Carefully transfer Minicolumn to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 µL of Nuclease-Free Water to the Minicolumn. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge at 16.000 x g for 1 minute.
Discard Minicolumn and store DNA at 4 °C or -20°C.
Gibson Assembly
Modified from Gibson et al. (2009)
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.
Preparation of DNA molecules for in vitro recombination
Generate the complenentary sequence overlaps by PCR using the Phusion DNA-polymerase. If necessary add 5 M Betain in the reaction mix by reducing the amount of H2O to decrease the number of false PCR products.
Seperate the PCR product of interest by gel electrophoresis, extract the products via Gel Extraction .
In vitro recombination
Preparing assembly mixture
320 µL 5x isothermal reaction buffer
0.64 µL of 10 U ml-1 T5 exonuclease (for DNA molecules overlapping by greater than 150 bp add 3.2 µL of 10 U mL-1 T5 exonuclease)
20 µL of 2 U mL-1 Phusion DNA polymerase
160 µL of 40 U mL-1 taq DNA ligase
add ddH2O up to a final volume of 1.2 mL
Aliquote 15 µL of the assembly mixture and store at -20 °C
That 15 µL assembly mixture on ice until use
Add 5 µL of the purified DNA molecules in equimolar amounts (between 10 and 100 ng of each fragment).
Incubate the mixture at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min with 60 min being optimal.

A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
As the second stop of our tour, we have an introduction to our team! We are a diverse group of 15 undergraduate students and 4 supervisors from health sciences, engineering, kinesiology, and computer science. Read below for some introductions about us and our fantastic university: The University of Calgary. Afterwards, you can click HERE for the next stop of our tour.
OUR TEAM
UNDERGRADUATES
Prima Moinul
I’ve just completed my first year in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary. I have a strong background in basic cell biology, DNA replication and lab work with E.coli bacteria. As a team leader for iGEM marketing, I will focus on promoting and marketing our project to a larger audience and work with sponsors to fund our project. The idea of a student-run research program immediately caught my attention because it encourages undergrads to work collectively in a group as well as individually to exercise our own creative thoughts, ideas and innovations. I also enjoy the interdisciplinary system of the iGEM project, especially the wet lab and marketing components. Aside from iGEM, I am also actively involved in the community with numerous volunteer activities. In my spare time, I love reading, camping, biking, travelling"
Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," of the iGEM teams that had great interests in our project came up with lots of suggestions and advice, which were of great help to improve our project. We owe great thanks to Mr. Haoqian Zhang, who gave us important suggestions about how to present our project in a logical order. He said that our photosynthetic system could be applied to other model organisms as long as we change the cell surface display protein, which is very inspiring.
 
The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology. The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation.
 
 
2. Conferences in Huazhong University of Science and Technology
 
On July 6th, we collected very precious suggestions from the conference in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. First, team Shanghai Tech A is also doing experiments about constructing a photosynthetic system with CdS, but they are using a special species called Moorella Thermoacetica. There are current seven kinds of bacteria that can transmit electrons. Secondly, a team from Taiwan last year has focused on the protein OmpA, but with low efficiency. We don’t meet this difficulty this year fortunately. Third, a teacher from Taiwan was curious about how to transform such a long gene HyaABCDEF into E.coli. Last, A teacher from Taiwan suggested that the experiments should be done under well-controlled conditions. There are possibilities of false positive and false negative results because of the low concentration of hydrogen. The teacher also suggested that we can either change the contents of the media to reduce loss of hydrogen or add a negative pressure to suck out all the hydrogen.
 
 
3. Conferences with five iGEM teams in Zhejiang University
 
In summer, we got the chance to communicate our projects with other five iGEM teams from Zhejiang University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yet-Sen University and Fudan University. Students from other universities are very interested about our project and come up with many doubts and suggestions. One student from ZJU is interested about the formation of CdS precipitation. He also had his explanations about why red fluorescence intensity becomes darker upon silicon encapsulation. Another student from ZJU suggested that if electrons can’t be conducted across the cell membrane of E.coli, we can try to culture shewanella spp. with E.coli to increase electron transduction efficiency because the flagella of shewanella spp. can help to aggregate E.coli.
 
This conference indeed helped us familiarize with our project as"
NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants for the next year crops, as well as, mixed different plants to create something new and probably better.
NMS St. Leonhard
On May 3 we got the chance to visit a “New Middle School” (NMS) in Graz. We were talking about iGEM and Synthetic Biology in all grades (from 1st to 4th). For this reason, we separated in two groups of 2/3 and visited 2 classes at a time. The lesson started with a small introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, in a child-appropriate manner. We compared DNA and genes to a recipe and tried to keep it as simple as possible. The kids were very attentive and curious. Some of them also had an impressive knowledge about the topic. They asked us questions about Genetic Fingerprinting and inheritance.  After the theoretical part, we did our DNA extraction from strawberries again. The enthusiasm was huge and some kids told us they wish to become biologists, like we are. It was an awesome experience and we will never forget the excitement in the kid’s eyes.
Spritzerstand
After bringing the subject closer to the general public at “Lange Nacht der Forschung” and to kids by teaching at NMS, we tried to figure out the best way to get our university and especially students from all departments involved. It did not take long and we came up with the idea of a “Spritzerstand” on June 16. Spritzer is very popular among young people here in Austria, as it is wine mixed with sparkling water. We also added some flavour like raspberry and elder. Around the “Spritzerstand” we placed posters and further information about our project. The students were very curious and interested in what we are doing. It was a great success and it had exactly the effect we wanted because people were spending hours talking, drinking and discussing science!
Sturmstand
After the great success of our “Spritzerstand” in summer, we thought about doing a similar thing in fall. In Austria it is very popular to drink must, grape juice during fermentation. Especially in fall must in combination with sweet chestnuts is a lovely thing. For this reason, we planned a must event (like the spritzer event) on October 18. It is a great chance for us to present the results of our project to fellow students and to continue spreading the idea of iGEM among young people.

CU-Boulder,2014,Team:CU-Boulder#Project#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," gRNA is coded for by a spacer sequence that can be modified to direct the Cas protein to a different target sequence. Goma et al found that if this spacer sequence complimented the genome of the host cell adjacent to a PAM sequence, then the DNA would be targeted by the Cas, resulting in cell death. They then designed a spacer that would target one strain of bacteria but not another. Transforming the CRISPR-Cas machinery into a mixed population of both bacteria, they showed that the strain containing the target sequence was killed while the other strain was unharmed. Their experiment demonstrated the antibacterial potential of CRISPR-Cas9 but their experimental design lacked a delivery mechanism that could be used therapeutically.
To address the delivery problem posed by Gomaa et al,  our experiment highlights the potential for non-replicating phage to be utilized as a delivery mechanism.  During the laboratory experiment phase of this project, two papers were published in Nature Biotechnology that further demonstrate the potential of this system.  Professor Marrafini of the Laboratory of Bacteriology at the Rockefeller University in New York² and Professor Timothy Lu of the MIT Microbiology Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology³ have demonstrated the specificity and effective delivery of CRISPR-Cas phage.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

This means maybe more than one STAR antisense combined with one STAR.  There is also another possibility that the reaction of STAR need more than one step. The specific reason of why our lab work indicates that the Hill function $n_{STAR}=1.4$ still remains to be explore in the future.

Streptococcus pneumonia
  Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. It has been noted that Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) plays an important role of being sickness. PAIs are a distinct class of genomic islands and are incorporated in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms but are usually absent from those non-pathogenic organisms of the same or closely related species. We would like to concentrate on the special properties of PAIs with measures of synthetic biology. PAIs have correlation of other diseases and may become a fundamental therapy.
ASTHMA
  Asthma， a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs, has been increasingly observed in developed countries. Its remarkable increase attributes to changes in the environment due to improved hygiene and fewer childhood infections. Researchers have found that asthma has close correlation with increased IgE level. Those who are prone to asthma are able to express complete FcεRI in dendritic cell(DC).  We planned to use synthetic biology to focus on dendritic cell to lower the level of IgE expression. This may lead to a new-era of asthma therapy and bring hope to those suffering from asthma.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Symposium_-_-_TEXT.html,", is the                 founder of Desktop Genetics. The company is building software for biologists,                 with a focus on synthetic biology. The software helps to improve the efficiency                 and to lower the costs. He explained that genome editing remains hard and became                 a design and software challenge, and not purely biological challenge. This is                 because genome editing needs to be accurate, precise, effective and rapid.
Sebastian Maerkl, the second keynote speaker, discussed the topic cell-free                 synthetic biology. He explained that microfluidics with cell-free lysate can be                 used for rapid prototyping of biological systems. One of the advantages is that                 it has defined and controllable reaction conditions. In vitro prototyping is                 used to speed up research in synthetic biology. The pipeline of cell-free                 synthetic biology: design a biological circuit, build the circuit, test parts                 and circuits, characterize working circuits, clone and implement in vivo.
The second home speaker, Yves Peeters, gave a talk about directed evolution of                 polymerases using synthetic biology methods. The research of Yves Peeters is                 part of the research domain Xenobiology, creating alternative life, one of the                 approaches of synthetic biology. XNA, also called orthogonal DNA, is designed by                 several labs using different strategies. Making organisms with XNA will be an                 ultimate biosafety tool for synthetic biology. Before being able to have a                 liveable organism that uses XNA, there is a need for polymerases recognizing the                 specific XNA. To create the wanted polymerases, Yves uses directed evolution,                 including mutagenesis, screening, amplification and iteration of the most active                 enzymes.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.

Determining the Connection Strength among Neurons
Firstly, we assume that the strength of a connection between neurons is positively correlated with the number of synapses. It includes synaptic outputs from any group of presynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the total synaptic outputs of the presynaptic neurons and synaptic inputs to any group of postsynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the synaptic inputs of the postsynaptic neurons(Figure 2.) [1] .
Figure 2. Diagram of a connection between neurons based on first assumption.
Determining the Promoters
After getting a collection of potential downstream neurons, we need to determine which promoter to use.  There are the basic requirements:
The selected neurons cannot be too closed to each other. Thus we can distinguish each of them under microscope.
AIA, AIY, AVA are the three neurons indicated to play important roles in worms movement [1,2,3], so they are prior to choose.
The selected promoters should be as few as possible to express in neurons as many as possible.
Here are the work flow:
1.Make a table recording the promoter expression location. Data source . The table contains 43 neurons and their promoters
Table 1 The table contains 43 neurons and their promoters, promoters are in the first line. Their correlated promoters are shown in one column.
2.Make a table recording the neurons that cannot use the same promoter for they are close to each other. Data source . The table is manually made by evaluating the difficulty to distinguish neurons based on the online 3D model of C. elegans’ neurons (Figure 2.)
Table2 The table of neurons can not be distinguished ( shown in one column).
3.Write a MATLAB program to search the appropriate promoters based on the table2 and the requirement above 4.Remove the negative result based on table2 (in one column).

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Golden, we learned about neutral sites in her recommended cyanobacteria “suicide vectors.” These types of vectors integrate into the genome through double homologous recombination and have no origins of replication. The neutral sites match sequences in the genome where the recombination occurs. As a result, E. coli conjugation was no longer necessary, resolving issues that Dr. Aikens brought up. Furthermore, through correspondence with Dr. Golden, she also confirmed that we should characterize the light and iron induced promoters during experimentation. Overall, Dr. Golden provided advice that validated our decisions regarding which promoters to characterize and helped us to confirm our use of decanal in testing these promoters.  
May 30: Meeting with Dr. Daniel Ducat (Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Michigan State University)
Dr. Daniel Ducat is a Professor of Michigan State University, and he wrote a research paper in which he engineered cyanobacteria to secrete sucrose. We reached out to him because he attempted the kind of research we were about to perform. During the video call, we were able to ask all questions we had in regards to cyanobacteria and the specifics of our project which was very beneficial in our experimental design. While discussing the creation of constructs, he suggested using Gibson Assembly. Additionally,  Dr. Ducat provided us with research materials involving quorum sensing as a method by which to regulate gene expression, and later on sucrose production,using cell- density population. A review of the literature showed that there is a lack of research in the field of quorum sensing, however, this research gave us the idea to use nutrient-repressible promoters which may act as viable density-dependent regulators.   
June 1: Meeting with Dr. Jarrod French (Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University)
We met with Dr. Jarrod French to discuss plasmid construction and experimental design. We wanted to meet with him because his research on characterizing metabolic pathways in cells gave us insight to our cyanobacteria’s sucrose pathway and how we can manipulate it in our experiments.We learned that the rate of sucrose production won’t be drastically higher in our sps- overexpressing cyanobacteria because another step in the sucrose production pathway will inevitably become the rate limiting step.
For our experiments, Dr. French also recommended having a positive and negative control wherever possible. For example, we decided that in part II, the trp-lac promoter would serve as negative control and the rbc promoter would serve as positive control. Unfortunately, in later stages, the trp-lac promoter was"
ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Model#Environment Sensing#parameter fitting_-_-_TEXT.html," deviation for each measurement point, which is the standard deviation that was observed in the data used to fit the expression of luxR.
From the experimental data of the quorum sensing end-point experiment, we could fit two parameters of our model: the expression level of luxI, and once again the leakiness of our promoter (both in log scale):
Figure 2. Fit of the expression level of luxI. Parameter space fitting the experimental data. Each point represent a parameter vector that significantly fit the experimental data. The blue points fit the data the best (least sum of square) while the yellow ones represent parameters combinations that barely fit the data (but still significant according to the chi2 test of goodness of fit). Fitted parameters are annotated in red.
From our statistically significant fit and under the assumptions made, we can gather with a 95% confidence that:
The expression level of luxI in our system is comprised between 1.0 and 6.8 µM.min-1, with its most probable value being 3.2 µM.min-1
The leakiness of the PLux promoter in our system is comprised between 2.0 and 6.2 %, with its most probable value being 3.7 %
In addition, we can verify that the leakiness of the PLux promoter was successfully fitted two times with excellent consistency on two completely different experiments, supporting the validity of our approach and the assumptions we made.

Next there is a nutR followed by a terminator site, which is different for each of the plasmids. pAT14 and pAT15 contain a single terminator site, namely BBa_B0011 (from pAT09) and BBa_B1003 (from pAT10) respectively, while pAT13 contain both (pAT11). Downstream of the terminator site, there is the N gene followed by RBS and RFP (from pAT02) present in each of the three constructs.
Figure 3: pAT16: Insert´s organisation in plasmid pAT16 with pSB2K3 as the backbone. First there is an RBS and the FACS optimised GFP (from pAT03), followed by nutR and terminator site BBa_B1003 (from pAT07). Downstream of the terminator there is another RBS followed by the RFP and a double terminator site BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 (from BBa_I13507).
Figure 4: pAT01:pAT01 contain the arabinose inducible promoter pBAD, and the N plasmid.
As described in the Construction of Parts , several promoters of different strengths have been introduced into the final constructs pAT12-pAT16, all containing GFP and RFP reporters. Together these promoters constitute Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL). Transcription through the terminator site results in the expression of the N antiterminator. If enough N protein is produced, the antitermination is mediated. Our system enables us to measure the promoter strength by measuring the amount of GFP produced. At the same time the amount of transcription past the promoter can be estimated by measuring the amount of RFP produced. This is one of the strategies for the characterization of our final constructs. For a more detailed explanation see the section on Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL).
Strains containing pAT12-16 have also been transformed with pAT01, containing pBAD and ARAC promoters upstream of lambda N-gene with its natural RBS. This has been done in order to induce expression of N protein. Supplement of bacterial cultures containing these plasmids with arabinose enhances the expression of the lambda N-gene and therefore increases the production of the N protein. As a consequence, the N produced in pAT12-16 can be measured and compared. Based on that, we have also tried to characterize our system by testing whether or not"

During the course of this iGEM edition, TU Delft embarked on an ambitious and challenging journey for the realization of its project. However, we believe that the iGEM experience is more than just carrying out complex microbiological lab work and developing complicated yet cutting-edge models: iGEM is also a worldwide community that continues to expand, with more than 300 teams participating from all around the world this year. Consequently, TU Delft organized an European iGEM Meetup in which teams from all over Europe were invited to join us in Delft, the Netherlands. Approximately 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects,"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," a student to undertake studies in synthetic biology?
“I would try to convince you that curiosity is what makes it really fascinating.”
Roy Wollmann (University of California, San Diego, USA)
How far is a future where synthetic biology applications are part of everyday life?
“Tremendous effect on the scientific community: The availability of new tools […] will open up a whole new field of experiments that we can do that we weren’t able to do before.”
Ulricke Gaul (Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany)
What is the biggest risk associated to synthetic biology?
“There is always the danger when you create something new that has never existed before, that if you release it into the world at large that it might harm something.”
Uri Alon (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rechovot, Israel
How far is a future where synthetic biology applications are part of everyday life?
“It’s hard for me to believe that the century will end without a profound incorporation of understanding of biology into everyday’s life.”
Walter Kolch (University College Dublin, Ireland)
What are the qualities that distinguish a synthetic biologist from other scientists?
“A broad way of thinking and an open way of thinking, […] you also need to be inventive and actually finding the right applications. You need to be an allrounder.”
Beyond the systems biologists, we actually received written answers to our questions (Table 1) from the director general of the EMBL, Dr. Ian Mattaj. He showed quite some knowledge of what synthetic biology is, and gave us some interesting points of views, such as the feeling that synthetic biology applications are already pervasive in our daily life (we would not have expected this statement!). Here you find all his replies:
Q: Do you know what synthetic biology is?
A: Yes
Q: How does synthetic biology impact society in your opinion?
A: Synthetic Biology will lead to the way that many types of “manufacturing” are done, in the widest sense of the word. This has both the potential for good, for example in easing shortages or developing processes that produce fewer pollutants or unwanted side-effects, but will also change how some people work.
Q: Throughout the years did your opinion on synthetic biology change?
A: No
Q: Did you hear of great accomplishments in the field that you thought would never be possible?
A: Thus far not. There was always a very large potential and so nothing I have seen has gone beyond the obviously possible so far.
Q: What is the biggest risk associated to synthetic biology?
A: I would say a lack of acceptance in society"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation. Opportunities for green marketing: young consumers . Social Media Influencing Green Buying
Our Strategy
The design of our logo consisting of a light font and a picture of a leaf combined with an electrical plug, was determined in the start of April. We sought to make a simple logo that showed the essence of our project, The PowerLeaf, not only in name but in brand as well.
During spring we narrowed down the relevant hashtags of our Twitter and Instagram to #science, #igem, #sdu, #gmo, and #forsksdu. These hashtags were used at relevant occasions and generally helped expanding our reach on social media. A few times we even used a couple of silly hashtags like #adventuretime and #lifechoices when we found it appropriate.
A complete relaunch of our social media platforms was made in the start of April. One of the changes we made was the setup of the Facebook page and Twitter account, that we changed to resemble an enterprise.
Results
Looking at Figure 1 we see the number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year. There is a sharp increase around the start of April, this correlate nicely with the relaunch of our social media. Since we started using the Facebook page on March 1st, we have seen an increase of followers on 44%.
Figure 2 shows the number of unique interactions with our Facebook posts each day. Some posts gained around 200 interactions per day, while the highest amount of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated bacteria from the fingers of the attendants on agar plates. The photo gallery of these plates was widely shared on our Facebook page, and it probably was the reason for the rise in amounts of interactions.
During the summer, we realised that an increasing fraction of our followers on Facebook were non-Danish speakers. Therefore, we set out to analyse the distribution of first languages among our followers seen in Figure 3, which showed that one in three of our followers were not speaking Danish as their first language. This data led to us switching the language used in our Facebook posts from Danish to English.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing 2 mM copper (II) chloride. The results indicate that the mNARK-Lycopene device boots E. coli growth. Wild type E. coli grew to a final optical density of 0.35 after three hours, from an initial OD of 0.15. The mNARK-Lycopene progressed from an initial OD of 0.25 to a final OD of 0.60.
The BioBrick was then tested against simulated oxidative stress conditions of 50 and 100 µM sodium nitroprusside. Both of these experiments, again, indicate that, in the presence of simulate oxidative stress conditions, the mNARK-Lycopene promotes E. coli growth substantially better then the control. At 50 µM, the optical density of the wild type cells decreases to an OD of 0.05 from the initial reading of 0.17. In comparison, the mNARK-Lycopene cells achieved a final optical density of 0.33 from a low of 0.05. At the 100 µM concentration, the wild type cells flat lined, remaining at an optical density of 0.25, while the lycopene cell concentration increased substantially from an optical density of 0.07 to 0.45 after four hours of growth.
In summary, out analysis has shows that our mNARK-Lycopene device protects the cells from oxidative stress and, from this, we can assume that this effect will continue once our lycopene probiotic is consumed by and aging person. Additionally, it has been proved that the cells will be able to survive and multiply in the gut and colonise it. Therefore providing protection to neighbouring cells by ‘mopping up’ the oxidative stress.
After establishing that the mNARK-Lycopene device improves cells growth compared to wild type E. coli, the growth of the Lycopene cells was measured against lycopene expression.
First, the cells were grown in LB media with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate. As shown in the plot, the mNARK-Lycopene device reached a higher cell density of 0.57, which corresponds to an OD485 of 0.68. Wild type E. coli does not achieve such a cell density and, by extension, lycopene expression. From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34. Additionally, the"

Preparation for gene knockout using Datsenko and Wanner method was the first on the agenda.  Prof. Stafford from the Univeristy of Sheffield Medical School provided us with electroporation protocol. From 11th August to mid September the electroporation was carried out unsuccessfully.
15th August - an official project presentation to the ChELSI research group.
the transformation using the Biobrick BBa_I763004  containing a plasmid with GFP – LVA tag  was made. All attempts were unsuccessful despite using pre – approved protocols and cultures.
26th August - Mr. Peter Grant representing the Biofusion Group provided funding to cover the costs of the U. S. VISA for 3 team members.
September 2008
The gene order for CqsS membrane receptor arrived.
Along with that Prof. B. Bassler from Princeton University sent us the plasmid containing CqsA -  a protein producing CAI -1 (Cholera Autoinducer – 1) with the appropriate purification protocol.
Prof. O. Melefor from Karolinska Instutue kindly provided us with a DH5 – alpha strain containing a barA knockout
Prof. Robert Poole agreed to cover further funding for the trip to USA. On 16th September the hotels and flights to the Jamboree were booked, along with registration confirmation of all attending team members.
The electroporation and transformation were still unsuccessful even after extensive troubleshooting.
29th September VISAs were attained.
October 2008
Plasmid prep of one possible GFP - LVA transformant colony was made. The attempt was to characterize a possible Biobrick using Tecan as well as loading a restriction digest of the plasmid prep on the agarose gel. The results suggested that the colony was most likely contamination.
8th to 15th October -preparation for Biobrick submission to the Parts Registry took place. Failed transformations raise suspicions of a faulty Biobrick booklet. Thorough investigation of various DNA parts from all over the booklet proves this hypothesis. Due to faulty DNA shipment no parts can be submitted to the Registry as the deadline for variants was 8th October.

The network inference from the microarray expression profile, for protein concentration profiles, from promoter sequence data, etc, can be done in the DREAM (Database for Reverse Engineering Analysis and Method) project. Meanwhile, the network design can also be done to the required profile. So we will start from here!
So the aims for our project: 1.Present a structure frame for network design 2.Redesign the known networks to test the strategy 3.In silico, design a network with a interesting behavior 4.Realize the network in the cell
And the problems are really hard for our projects. Actually, everything we want to do is we have never done before. So we will try our best.
Week 4
The problems we faced may be harder than our imagination. First, the search space is too large to traverse. The number of potential topologies is , while K is the number of interaction forms and n is the number of species. It is an astronomy number if n >=3. Second, the non-linear system identification is still an unsolved problem in the present. The parameters can not be recognized exactly even the topologies are meeting the requirements. Some approximation should be done mathematically. First, the networks we designed are restricted to the simple network, which means the reactors are at most two kinds in one reaction. The searching space can be shrunk in this way, while all the dynamic behaviors can be simulated with this simple model. Second, we may need some restrictions to the interactions forms and the parameters. The more information is, the better system we can get by the design process.
Week 6
The frame of the software has been constructed as indicated in right figure.
week 9
From the analysis, we should get the information of a reaction from three aspects: topology, formula and the parameters. The optimized algorithms are required with the three different layers problems. For the bottom layer, the parameters are optimized with the known forms of formula. For the upper layer, we need genetic algorithm to look for the formula forms that meet the requirement. And for the top layer, genetic algorithm is also employed to optimize the topology. And I will work with the selection of the formula and the topology.
week 16
The genetic algorithm has been implemented with c++ and tested with some benchmarks. Next, we discussed about the data structures for the program, including the input form and input data, the output form and output data, the description of a reaction, and the items considering in formula. According to the discussion results, I began to implement the whole frame for the program"

Typically mammalian expression vectors have a multiple cloning site (MCS). The gene of interest (GOI) to be inserted into the MCS is therefore required to hold restriction sites compatible with the expression vector. The insertion of the GOI is achieved by digestion and ligation and this classical cloning method can be quite cumbersome. Furthermore, the integration of the gene of interest in the expression vector by restriction enzymes and ligases can have a low efficiency as well as provide a high number of false-positive transform ants (6).
Filamentous Fungi
Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, whose biological activities affect our daily life in many ways. The filamentous fungi are in particular of great importance in production of medicine, in the industry, in agriculture, and in basic biological research. Filamentous fungi for example produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which are of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences as a prolific source of chemical compounds for the development of new drugs. Some of the filamentous fungal species are pathogenic to humans, whereas others have value in the production of antibiotics such as penicillin. Fungi are therefore of great importance industrially as well as in our daily life.
Growth of filamentous fungi
The vegetative growth of filamentous fungi starts in the right conditions with the germination of a spore. The spore germination leads to formation of hyphae (7). A fungal hyphae is a long tubular modular structure composed of individual cells (8). Hyphae extend only at their tips and are typically divided into individual cellular compartments by the formation of septa as shown in the figure below (9).
Filamentous fungi grow by the polar extension of hyphae and multiply by branching (10). The branched hyphae form a network of interconnected cells called a mycelium (7). The mycelium forms a radially symmetric colony that expands over a large area until growth is limited by for example lack of nutrients (7,11). The fungal mycelium appears to be a formless collection of corresponding vegetative cells. However, the various cells within the mycelium interact to form an ordered network with different hyphae or cells playing distinct roles in the acquirement of nutrients from the environment (7).

The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is a model organism and therefore in contrast to most other asper"

Introduction
Our project goal is to maximize the photosynthetic productivity of a series of photobioreactors containing Rhodobacter sphaeroides under both high and low light intensities by synthetically regulating the size of the light-harvesting antenna complex LH2.   We chose to undertake such a project using R. sphaeroides due to its well-characterized photosynthetic and genetic system.
The antenna system functions to expand the spectrum of light available for photosynthesis by absorbing different wavelengths than that of the reaction center.  Essentially, it is like the dish around the main receiver of any antenna.  Marine bacteria, such as R. sphaeroides, evolved very large antenna complexes to absorb light in a natural environment, where there is great competition for photons.  As a result, the photosynthetic machinery is saturated at low light intensities in a synthetic non-competitive environment, such as a photobioreactor.  This causes up to 95% of incidental photons to be dissipated as heat or fluorescence by bacteria through a process called Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) (Mussgnug et al., 2007). In essence, these photons are being wasted as NPQ reduces light penetration into and across bioreactors and starves the shaded cells for for photons.  One method that has been shown to improve photosynthetic productivity in photobioreactors is the reduction of light-harvesting antenna sizes (Polle et al., 2002, Mussgnug et al., 2007).  Though, current approaches to this end are difficult to precisely control from the perspective of biological engineering and synthetic biology.
Our intention is to create a dynamic system that varies antenna size, is dependent on incident light intensity, and can be readily optimized using bioengineering principles. This synthetic regulation of the LH2 complex should result in bacteria grown under high light intensities expressing fewer LH2 complexes than cells that are more shaded, leading to a reduction of wasted"

Hardware
Having a qPCR test system is fine. But it is only useful, if you have the specific hardware device for it. Our cycler is constructed very simply: a drawer for the test itself has two clamps to fixate the tube, so it won’t move. Underneath the drawer-slot are the operators for our test system. These operators are heat-elements, thermo sensors and relapsing magnets. To get the blood from one chamber of the tube to the next, we use a pump-lever. This pump-lever is montaged above the test-tube and runs by a small stepper-motor. The lever drives on a gear shaft that rotates by the stepper motor. At the end of this lever there is a roller, which pulls the liquid forward. At the end of the device there are LED-diodes and photocells wired to an ARDUINO computer. The diodes radiate light with 495 nm wavelength at the fluorescent probe. The photocells measure the emitted light from the probe and give the data to the ARDUINO computer. This data makes it possible to derive the presence of Plasmodium types.

Introduction
Motivation
Studies of synthetic biology produced various E. coli whose functions are multiply expanded. To utilize such E. coli in the real world, it is necessary to place them in the proper spot and have them stay there ( Fig. 1 ). However, we have very limited technique to realize this. Solving this problem and utilizing transformed E. coli, we tried to create E. coli which have magnets inside their cells. Therefore, we focused on magnetotactic bacteria and introduced its gene to E. coli.
Fig. 1 Imagine if we can move E. coli as we want.
About magnetotactic bacteria
In 1975, a microbiologist Richard P. Blakemore first discovered a kind of magnetotactic bacteria, which is now known as Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum (MS-1).
He observed this bacterium under his microscope and realized that they move along the magnetic field lines of the Earth's magnetic field, and named this microorganism magnetotactic bacteria (or MTB) [1] .
After this, many other species of MTB were discovered, such as Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB-1), Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (MSR-1). And most of these MTB are able to thrive only in an oxic-anoxic transition zone [2] .
The most impressive feature of them is the magnetosomes ( Fig. 2 ).The magnetosomes are intracellular structures that consist of magnetic, iron-mineral crystals enveloped by a membrane vesicle known as the magnetosome membrane. The magnetosome crystals typically size from 35 nm to 120 nm. Inside the MTB, the magnetosomes are organized in one or more straight chains, parallel to the long axis of the cell, which function as the compass aid MTB to reach regions of optimal oxygen concentration [3] .

Additionally, using this system allows us to control exactly when the cultures will start to produce the pigment biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore the pigments themselves. This will help the bacteria to survive longer and produce more pigment in case the enzymes or pigments are toxic to the cells. We can choose to induce the system earlier or later, depending on the effects we see. Upregulated expression of the T7 RNAP will also lead to overexpression of the biosynthetic pathway, thus maximizing enzyme and pigment yield.
Melanin
We chose Melanin as our Key color, the black. It was selected because it has previously been produced in E. coli (Lagunas-Muñoz et al., 2006) . The gene we used was melA from the organism Rhizobium etli which had been previously submitted to the Parts Registry (BBa_K193600). We incorporated this gene into our new construct as described above (New Composite Part BBa_K2481108, Figure 2). melA encodes a tyrosinase that converts L-tyrosine to dopaquinone, which then undergoes an enzyme-independent polymerization into melanin (Figure 3).
Figure 2. melA epxression construct for use in E. coli BL21(DE3).
Figure 3. The pathway from L-tyrosine to Melanin with the use of the melA gene.
Indigoidine
The cyan pigment we chose was indigoidine and will be produced by proteins encoded by the indB and indC genes from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Figure 4). The indB gene codes for a putative phosphatase and the indC gene codes for indigoidine synthase. Together, these enzymes convert L-glutamine into indigoidine (Yu et al., 2012, Figure 5.) It has been previously shown that indC alone can produce indogoidine, but the inclusion of indB expression in the system will increase yields significantly (Xu et al.,2015). A previous part for IndC has been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry (BBa_K1152013), though this part originated from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"  The debate served the purpose of making the subject of gene editing accessible to other students, clarify open questions and create an active exchange of opinions.  This idea is to be further pursued, as one member of the debating club wants to call more attention to the debate of gene editing inside the youth organisation of one of the large German parties (Social Democratic Party, SPD).
Scientific Commitment
In recent years, the relationship to the next generation of scientists has always been an important aspect of our public relations work in our team. Therefore, we continued our past successes this year and invited six high school students with their teachers and a father to our laboratory.
We showed them standard methods of molecular biology, embedded in the background, to detect Bt corn in corn products they had brought with them. First, the DNA was isolated, purified and amplified with primers for Bt-gene primers. The PCR products were then analysed in an agarose gel and the results discussed.
Such experiments are an important part of the curriculum of secondary schools, as the equipment is usually not available on site. We deepen the current curriculum content, which is practically applied and thus no longer remains abstract. We overcome fears of contact with stigmatized genetic engineering.
In addition, our invitation offers teachers a platform for further training in advanced teaching techniques that are up-to-date and applicable. The feedback on our test day was overwhelmingly positive, so we will continue to implement this format in future iGEM years.
Interview with Boris Palmer
Our aim was not only to raise attention for synthetic biology and iGEM among people but also to connect with politicians in order to address the controversy of gene editing in the public.  We met Tübingens mayor Boris Palmer with whom we had a lively and interesting discussion about gene editing and its image in politics. Apart from that we interviewed him and asked him questions concerning that topic.
Boehringer-Ingelheim
To see how we could possibly expand our project to the future, we organised a visit to Boehringer-Ingelheim which is one of the world’s top 20 pharmaceutical companies with expertise in diseases of the central nervous system, among others. We wanted to see how drugs are developed and produced and communicate with leading experts. Unfortunately, it was only possible to arrange a visit at the beginning of the next year.
Interview with Heilbronner Stimme We gave the Heilbronner Stimme, a local newspaper, an interview about iGEM and the chances this special project provides. Also, it was an opportunity to teach people about the chances of Synthetic Biology.

COMMUNICATION
Introduction Analysis Audiences Goals Key messages Tactics and Inputs Planning Budget and evaluation Recommendations
Why a communication plan?
In our opinion it is very important for scientists to communicate their work. This is needed to inform the public about the scientific break-thoroughs in order to gain public perception. Communication is also relevant because scientific work needs funding. This work is funded by public money or by companies, therefore it is important to communicate about the work, the benefits etc.
During the iGEM competition communication plays an central role. We have to communicate with potential sponsors to gain their interests and to keep them satisfied to make sure they will continue sponsoring future iGEM teams. We have to communicate to the public in order to gain public interest in our project and also to inform the public that new scientific developments like Synthetic Biology could be very beneficial to society. We also want to promote our participation to the competition, our university, the iGEM competition, and Synthetic Biology in general.
We developed a communication plan which should be a systematic manual on how we should communicate with the outside world and inform to those who are not familiar with our project as well as the general public.
