Eren Şahin: Eren is a last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to carry out his knowledge and imagination into building creative and innovative applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates  seemed truly fascinating as well. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Lastly, when i am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out having great adventures.  Outside of school my favourite activities are “goy goy” and to take pictures. (By the way, the meaning of “goy goy” is to chat with friends:D).
Behide Saltepe (Evil Queen): This is Behide Saltepe from ITU MOBGAM iGEM Team. I am one of the vice presidents at our team. This is my fourth, and last, year at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in Istanbul Technical University. I met with iGEM competition this year, as my friends. Although I am interested mostly in neuroscience, I want to discover the facilities of synthetic biology as a different interest area for me. Also I believe that researching on a project would bring lots of experience us at all aspects. That’s why I am in the team! Out of the lab, I really enjoy dancing, especially Latin dances are my area of interests. During experiments, we are listening music, singing, and dancing, lab is so exciting for us! Most importantly, my favorite hobby is travelling in Istanbul, because I fall in love with Istanbul! It is so fascinating city with all its beauty!

Key deletion
nucA key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key deletion    system. We have been working on two different approaches. Here we are    presenting the first approach, which makes use of the BioBricks in the    registry. Central to this approach is the nuclease nucA from BioBrick BBa_K729004 . This system will degrade the genomic DNA and thereby  the    key from the genome if no special treatment is applied. For the design    of a nucA key deletion system we made use of the following BioBricks: BBa_R0040 _tetR, BBa_K729004 _nuclease, BBa_B0030 _RBS and BBa_B0015 _terminator. During the cloning process we expected to obtain    the following BioBricks: RBS-nuclease, tetR-RBS-nuclease and    tetR-RBS-nuclease-terminator. The key deletion is controlled by the    constitutively on promoter PtetR. RNA polymerase binds to the DNA    sequence and leads to the expression of the nuclease. If tetracycline    is added, it functions as a repressor, binds to the promoter and thus    leads to the inhibition of the transcription of the nuclease. If an    unauthorized party tries to grow the key-containing spores in regular    growth medium without the addition of tetracycline, the kill switch    will be active and the DNA will be digested by the nuclease. Therefore    the key sequence will be lost and the encrypted message stays safe.    Only an authorized user of CryptoGErM knows that to grow the B. subtilis , tetracycline must be present, and will be able to get the key sequence. During the    construction of our nucA key deletion system we encountered the problem    that the BBa_K729004 has an incorrect prefix and suffix. See plasmid    construction . Therefore we wanted to improve this part with the    correct prefix and suffix. Sadly we failed to complete this task.

In this project, we were able to characterize the designed promoter induced by mercury, through expression of the reporter protein, GFP. Even in low Hg concentrations (under 0.02µg/ml). And our bioaccumulation and bioremediation devices showed to be efficient. Both were capable of removing around 60% of Hg from medium.

Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.

Experiments: Protein Characterization
Experiment name: sfGFP visualization
What experiment will show: This experiment visualizes the sfGFP reporter protein in our PETase-sfGFP fused protein. It shows that our cells are expressing our fused protein.
Reason for doing experiment: Validates PETase-sfGFP expression and characterizes the PETase-sfGFP part
Experiment methods: Grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing our plasmid. Induced with IPTG following the protocol for “Expression of T7 Cells” in general protocols below. Visualized cells using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescent microscope and took pictures (see results page).
Controls: Also used an uninduced sample.
Experiment name: SDS-PAGE
What experiment will show: An SDS page separates the proteins in a sample by weight. We will be looking for a protein band at the expected size for PETase.
Reason for doing experiment: Running an SDS page will show us whether our protein is being expressed in our cells.
Materials: 5x Tris-Glycine SDS Running Buffer, Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™ Precast Gels, Coomassie Blue Stain
Experiment methods: After growing up expression cells and inducing them with IPTG, we then lysed the cells using either ultrasonication or freeze-thaw (see our general lab protocols below for more information). The cell lysate including supernatant was then run on an SDS page. We followed the Mini-PROTEAN® Precast Gels Instruction Manual and Application Guide for gel electrophoresis.

Mining genomes for quercetin-degrading enzymes
Four of our top-degrading strains, representing diverse phylogentic lineages, were selected for whole genome sequencing.
As of the wiki freeze, the genome sequences were not complete. So, as a proxy, we obtained complete genome sequences of their nearest relatives in GenBank.
BLAST searches against the genomes revealed the presence of several candidate quercitin-degrading enzymes, including laccase and XylE.
The results of these genomic analysis were passed to the enzyme group, where these enzymes form the basis of our synthetic stain fighting product.
Figure 7: Genome table. Genome sequences were analyzed for the presence of potential anthocyanin degrading enzymes as identified in the Enzymes Project. The genes of at least one of the six candidates were identified for each of the sequenced strains. The number of + signs indicated represent the number of gene copies in the bacterial genome.
Methods
Anthocyanin extraction
Vinis vitifera grapes were our source for anthocyanin extraction.
Grapes were peeled and the skins were collected, washed and soaked overnight in ethanol with 1% HCl.
By trial and error, we determined that 2.5 mL of this solution per 1 g of skins was the best compromise between efficiency and the quantity of solvent used.
The solution was filtered with Whatman paper, with the filtrate collected, and the solvent evaporated at 37°C for several hours.
The dry extract was resuspended in water (10 mL for 1g of grape skin).
Anthocyanin quantification by differential absorbance
Following Lee et al. (2005), we prepared one buffer at pH 1 (0.025M potassium chloride) and a second at pH 4.5 (sodium acetate, 0.4M).
100 µL of the anthocyanin solution was mixed with 900µL of each buffers and the color was allowed to develop over 20 minutes.
Absorbance measurements were obtained at 510 nm and 700 nm for each solution.
Anthocyanin concentration was determined as a function of the four absorbance measurements, using an established formula (Lee et al., 2005).
Protein quantification with Bradford assays
A stock solution of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was prepared in water at 1 mg/mL.
100 μL of standard dilutions of BSA solution were mixed with 1 mL of Bradford Re"

Do you believe you are exposed to air pollution at home?
Do you use any protection against air pollution at home?
How do you feel with the use of synthetic biology to adress a pollution issue?
Would you be interested in an affordable, biodegradable filter to eliminate particulate matters?
As we can see, most of the people are aware to be exposed to air pollution in their home. But only about 14% of them are actually protect themselves against this plague (excepted in Asia where most of the people use protections, either it being masks or air purifiers). In this global study, we realized that there was a real need for our device and that people all over the world (especially in Asia and Africa), were interested in a solution using synthetic biology. However, 57% of respondents who were interested in a solution based on synthetic biology thought it is not a safe science. We wanted to better understand the point of view of these people, so we asked a series of more in-depth questions on the subject, which we analyzed at the European level.
Collaborative Design of a representative sample in partnership with UChile iGEM Team
After numerous discussions with our partners from the UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team, we concluded that our results had a problem of representativeness, particularly concerning the age range. But our survey had the advantage of having many participants. So, we decided to extract a subsample of our survey, that would be representative of the European population.
According to Eurostat, whose main responsibilities are to provide statistical information to the institutions of the European Union (EU) and to promote the harmonization of statistical methods across its member states, we had the following distribution of the European population in 2016.

In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria. Using liquid or solid growth media that has been treated with antibiotics provides a selection control for those bacteria that have successfully incorporated the plasmid.
Basic Terminology and Concepts
There are some terms which will be commonly used to describe the preparation of antibiotic stocks. Familiarity and understanding of these terms is key to comprehend the protocol.
Milli-Q- Water that has been purified through successive steps of filtration and deionization. The standard used in our lab is typically 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C, measured in resistance due to the lack of ions. The filters used are 0.22 μm in size to ensure a high level of purity. This water is used for preparing our antibacterial stock to ensure purity.
LB – Lysogeny Broth, is a very standard and simple media to create due to its recipe consisting of 3 components - tryptone, yeast extract, and sodium chloride. This mix of anhydrous ingredients is added to water and then autoclaved, producing liquid media. The production of solid LB for plates is done by adding agar, a protein isolated from certain species of seaweed which coagulates the liquid into a gel like form when cooled. This is done prior to autoclaving and is poured into the plates while still hot, where it will cool into the plate shape.
Aliquot - An aliquot is a term to denote a certain quantity of something. In this case an aliquot of antibiotic stock would denote either 1mL or 0.5mL, depending on the antibiotic.
Antibiotic- Compounds which inhibit bacterial growth. They act either bacteriostatically by preventing reproduction of the bacteria, or bacteriocidally where they directly kill the bacteria. Generally bacteriocides work by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan in the bacteria's cell walls. Tetracycline is an example of a bacteriostatic, where it acts by binding to the ribosomes of prokaryotic bacteria and inhibits translation.
Autoclave- A piece of equipment used for sterilization. The autoclave performs much like a pressure cooker: it subjects the contents inside it to a high temperature and high pressure steam bath. Usually the temperature is 121 Celsius and at 15lbs/in2 20 minutes is enough to kill most microorganisms and render equipment sterile. When adding antibiotics to media, it is done after autoclaving so that the heat does not destroy"

Violacein: A Path Divided
Today’s industries are increasingly reliant on the biological production of fuels, drugs, and other materials, bacteria among the foremost type of organism used. However bacterial production has its limits; large and complicated molecules impose a heavy metabolic burden on cells, and production is limited by the fitness cost, or the decreased health of the concerned organism.
These limitations can be circumnavigated by mimicking nature: getting two or more organisms to work together to produce one product.One way of doing this is splitting the metabolic pathway between two cells.
One such pathway is the violacein pathway, involving the five enzymes VioA-E. This particular pathway was chosen for our project due to the fact that violacein is a pigment and easily detected.
Violacein is produced in nature by Chromobacterium violaceum and is used commercially as dye, and also has anti-viral and anti-cancer properties. So while we use this for the sake of a model system, violacein production itself has its own merits.
Splitting the Violacein Pathway
Other iGEM teams have produced violacein or the green intermediate in the pathway by putting the whole pathway on one plasmid in one cell. We have split the pathway by placing half the pathway on a plasmid in one strain and the other half in a second strain.  The intermediate is protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, or PVA. Our results have shown that PVA readily diffuses through both cell membranes.
What Violacein has been doing outside of 2012 UCSF iGEM
The 2009 Cambridge team used violacein as an indicator for biosensing in the E. chromi project.

The oxygen level is monitored by the electrode at the bottom of the resin and recorded for a minute prior to the illumination of the red LED light and a minute after, the rate of oxygen evolution then is interpolated. See Oxygen Evolution Protocols for details.
 
Figure 2: Oxygen level and rate of oxygen evolution graph generated through oxygen assay apparatus. At time 0, illumination of a red LED light on the sample containing PSII causes the oxygen level to rise through which the electrode detects electrochemically, and in turn shows that the protein is active in generating electrons.
 
Figure 3: Using 150μM to 500μM concentrations of various substrates including Menaquinonne, Decylubiquinone, DCBQ, etc., the effect of different substrates on the rate the oxygen evolution of PSII was investigated. This preliminary test reveals that DCBQ or Menaquinone allow for the highest rate of oxygen evolution which could be a potential molecule used to aid the conduction of electrons from PSII's quinone channel.

Today, I did research for the pH testing of L. acidophilus strain and MG1655 without any of the colanic acid genes to see how well they grow without the colanic acid genes.  In order to use the plate reader, we need to transform a RFP gene into L. acidophilus and MC1655. That is simple for MG1655, but for L. acidophilus conjugation might be nessarary, according to Prof. Steele.  The Registry of Parts have two plasmids that can mobilize between E. coli and Lactobacillus, but in the notes, they warn that certain strains are picky. So I am currently researching articles for acidophilus plasmids.
Another option is to use a chemical like Resazurin, which when the cells metabolize the chemical it becomes florescent.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

- A Trip to the Future and Beyond!
If you want change, look to the future! Such was the wording of our core philosophy. A philosophy that was carried out, by reaching out to the people of our society to ensure the engagement of the next generation, within the world of synthetic biology.
Ever since World War II, the West has seen an expansion and intensification of anti-scientific sentiment, which today primarily concern Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). We will for that reason explore GMO’s role in history, to see if a historical perspective will allow us reach a new understanding of these sentiments. You can read all about it here.

A Historical Perspective on GMO
From Food Concerns to Sustainable Energy
When talking about the history of GMO, we have the rare privilege of choice, as  depending on how you define GMO, One could potentially choose any historical period as their starting point. For instance, we could be examining the breeding of wolves to dogs, or simple agriculture, where the bad seeds are destroyed in favour of higher quality crops Rangel G. From Corgis to Corn: A Brief Look at the Long History of GMO Technology. Genetically Modified Organisms and Our Food. August 2015.
For the purpose of narrative, we will be starting our examination with the dawn of the 20th century. A time in which stale and rotten food lead to health concerns. Through several years, the public was continuously made aware of health problems regarding food in the United States. This culminated in the 1906 statute:, which allowed the inspection and ban of products JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. . During the time leading up to this act, the public grew to appreciate items labeled as pure.

Mathematical modeling: Introduction
Mathematical modeling plays a central role in Synthetic Biology. One of its mayor abilities: to predict the behavior of a biological circuit. Therefore, it is an important bridge between the ideas and concepts on the one hand, and biological experiments on the other.
The main idea is to interact with the experimental part of the project in two ways. On the one hand to characterize the constructed biobricks, and identify parameters of the models thus allowing to a better understanding of the biology behind. On the other hand, to direct the way in which experiments are performed, so as to verify a prediction done from the modeling world.
The first step, with a little knowledge, was to develop a mathematical model based on a system of differential equations. Then, the equations were implemented using a set of reasonable values, taken from the literature,  for the model parameters. This way, we could validate the feasibility of the project. Here, one of the main characters of the play came into the ""cheaters"" . We saw the “cheaters” could appear from an original population of “normal” microorganisms. This lead us to perform several experiments to measure the metabolic burden that arises when cells carrying a synthetic plasmid want to effectively synthetize the desired protein, as compared with cells that are NOT producing the protein. This could lead to increase the fitness of the “cheaters”.
Then we started the characterization of each part created in the lab. Some of the mathematical model parameters were estimated thanks to several experiments we performed within the project (others were derived from literature) and they were used to predict the final behavior of each construction.
Experimental procedures for parameter estimation are discussed and simulation experiments performed, using ODEs with MATLAB and Global optimization algorithm for MINLP's based on Scatter Search (SSm by Process Engineering Group IIM-CSIC).

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," stand in the way of patenting their own one. This is quite surprising because obviously one’s research cannot be patented if based on protected materials. This statistic is very interesting as it shows how much most of the iGEM community’s actors do not know their legal rights concerning the IP.
Opinions on the patentability of BioBricks
Two questions were asked to the participants :
Do you think BioBricks CAN be patented in your country ?
And do you think they SHOULD be patentable ?
To the first question both opinions were equally represented. Nevertheless, it would have been interesting to know the country for each answer, even if the IP legislation is quite similar in most of the represented countries.
However, to the question “Should BioBricks be patentable ?”, more than a half (56%) answered “no”. This is probably linked to the fact that most iGEM competitors already use them without paying a license, so that they completely oppose such an idea. It also points out that most iGEM team members support the iGEM knowledge policy, which makes us believe that they would be inclined to acknowledge iGEM as a commons and would favorably respond to the changes resulting from the common reflexion we proposed at the end of the first part of this human practice study.
Different ways to get to know the IP protection procedures
The iGEM competitors who planned to get their work protected used different ways to approach applying for IP protections. Three tendencies come forth : they did so by talking inside their team (to the graduate student advisor, to another team member or / and to a faculty advisor), but also outside of it (to an industry expert, to a member of the university’s commercialization office or to a legal professional). The last tendency was to search on the Internet.
These inclinations are more or less equally represented in this poll, so that it does not reveal many things. The only really interesting point which has to be put forward is that most iGEM competitors who want to apply for IP protections do make some research on it, which emphasizes the complexity of such procedures and the lack of knowledge they probably had.
Conclusion
Our work with the University of British Colombia made us realize how often the intellectual property rights interfered with the different iGEM teams’ project. Nonetheless, we were disconcerted when we found out the patents were not the main problem. Indeed, their source was copyrights and trademarks .
Besides, this survey deepened our main reflexion (q.v. part I) as it emphasized the problems due to the superimposition of the commons and the patent models. It also"

Hardware - DIY Lab-in-a-box
Outreach
To understand the context of the problem of DIY hardware, we first approached the Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) which is a community lab in Baltimore, MD. We wanted to know if DIY hardware is something that community labs are in need of, and if the type of equipment that we are designing were in need. We were told that due to our proximity to research laboratories and federal institutions such as the National Institutes of Health, that basic equipment that we were building were not a top priority.
We refocused our efforts towards an educational audience, where basic equipment are more in need. We had two audiences in mind: a high school iGEM team and an AP biology classroom with synthetic biology instructions. After writing our guide, we wanted to get feedback on the machine and get suggestions on clarity of the guide.
We visited Broadneck High School in Annapolis, MD, where we were able to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the Science Honor Society there. Then, given all the disassembled materials and the guide, they were told to try and build the machine again without guidance from us. We received valuable pointers on what parts were not clear, and the need to include techniques such as how to strip a wire. We incorporated this feedback into our guide. However, in under an hour and a few pointers, they were able to get a functional motor running.
Hardware - DIY Lab-in-a-box
Safety
Safety was a top priority during the construction of this project. A high speed centrifuge can become very dangerous if not handled properly. Since we are aiming our project towards high school students, it is especially important that we ensure the safety of the students using this box. We use controls such as software limits and safety built into the design itself in order to ensure proper use.
The centrifuge is the most conerning part of the project, due to its very high speed. When unbalanced and centrifuged for an extended period of time, the rotor can warp and break. We've extensively tested what occurs under unbalanced conditions and found that the point of failure is the glue holding the nut onto the rotor itself. During unbalanced motion or high heat from extended use, the glue will break or become loose, forcing the rotor off of the motor. This results in just the nut spinning on the motor by itself. The rotor also cannot penetrate or severely damage the styrofoam box even when unbalanced, only causing several nick, making the user safe from possible accidents."
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," accuracy of the properties of the gel and this way indirectly diffusion constants on which this model relies.
Conclusion
Considering the inaccuracies in model parameters due to literature errors, human errors and small errors in formulas, we cannot conclude anything quantitatively on the ideal dimensions of the patch from this model. However, since trends in the obtained data are discernible, we still think we can carefully draw some minor conclusions.
The lysostaphin showing up in the exudate had relatively low rates, not reaching the MBEC we calculated. Even at cell densities of 3 * 1016 m-3 (which is very high) not enough lysostaphin reaches the exudate while this amount of cells is definitely able to produce enough. We do see, however, that diffusion of nutrients and thus nourishing the cells is not a problem in the patch.
Future insight
We think, concluding from our model that with a different boundary condition lysostaphin concentrations will show higher values as if the cells were actually producing some lysostaphin. We think, using this new boundary condition that concentrations of lysostaphin in the exudate will be reaching MBEC, just like we found in experiments. Moreover, we think it is not necessary to have a thick hydrogel but rather a thin one. This will lead to more convenience and it will need less cells producing less lysostaphin in the patch because the layer to diffuse through is thinner.
Lastly, since nutrients will no longer be a problem, even though they easily diffuse through the gel. Taking into account the concentrations of nutrients in exudate and infected, open wounds that can already be treated and healed, we no longer see feeding nutrients to the wound as an obstacle. For designing a patch, it does not need a minimum thickness anymore to keep nutrients away from the infected wound. Only the fact that MBEC should be reached and the ease to handle should be taken into account. In conclusion, after establishing a new model continuing from this one, we should be able to determine accurate dimensions of our patch, bringing effectiveness and ease to handle together. We can already say that the optimal thickness of the patch will be as thin as possible, optimizing lysostaphin concentrations but not thinner half a millimeter, to optimize handling by nurses and doctors. Also, the stability and durability of the gel decrreases when the patch becomes thinner, this should also be taken into account. However, this should be researched by trial and error since such stability is extremely difficult to model.

We research the impacts acted by various concentrations of α factor to the amount of expression of mRFP as well as the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2、△far1+△sst2+△ste2，△sst2 containing the detection circuit.
Plan and method
We set the concentrations of α factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L. We sampled 5ml culture liquid of each of them at 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively after shake culture. Afterwards, the red fluorescence intensity was measured in microplate reader (584/607) which was calibrated by pure liquid medium. We set red fluorescence intensity/OD600 as Y-axis and time as X- axis for the coordinate system.
Results and discussion
Fig.6 fuorescense curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.7 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1 under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.8 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1+Δste2 under different concentrations of α factor.
For the strains △far1+△sst2 and CEN.PK2-1C, the red fluorescence intensity increased with the concentrations of α factor increasing, and almost none of the red fluorescence of the strain CEN.PK2-1C was detected. Moreover, the red fluorescence intensity of △far1+△sst2 is stronger than that of △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and CEN.PK2-1C.
Conclusion：According to the results above, the expression intensity of mRFP was induced increasingly by the increasing concentration of α factor. Because of the genes sst2, far1 knockout the strains △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and △far1+△sst2 could amplify the signal which was induced by the inducer. The stain △far1+△sst"

Excitation of RFP was at 561 nm, and emission was measured around 580 nm. Expression levels in both E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 ΔOmpR were studied to determine the baseline of the leaky expression not influenced by intrinsic pathways including the OmpR transcription factor.
Figure 18. Flow cytometric fluorescence measurements in arbitrary units as a function of time. Left: Cultures were grown in LB medium. Right: Cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. Fluorescence of RFP expressed by the the OmpR-regulated promoter on the high copy vector, pSB1C3, and the low copy vector, pSB3K3, in MG1655 WT and ΔOmpR MG1655 strain. All fluorescence levels were measured relative to the negative control WT E. coli MG1655, and the weak and strong constitutive promoters are included as references. Standard error of mean is shown, but are in several cases indistinguishable from the graph.
Fluorescence levels in the two different media display similar behavior, as seen in Figure 18. The main difference observed, was that the decrease in fluorescence over time was faster in LB medium than in M9 minimal medium, in concordance with the observations made in previous experiments. On a general level, the data revealed, that MG1655 cloned with the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the high copy vector exhibited a fluorescence level, equivalent to that mediated by the strong constitutive promoter. On the low copy vector, the POmpR-RFP reporter system yielded a fluorescence level comparable to the gene expression mediated by the weak constitutive promoter. On the other hand, expression levels in the MG1655 ΔOmpR strain were markedly reduced compared to MG1655, indicating that pathways including the transcription factor OmpR interfere with RFP expression under these conditions. Again, the fluorescence levels observed for the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the low copy vector were distinctly lower than for the high copy vector.
All things considered, the OmpR-regulated promoter was found to exhibit leaky expression comparable to the expression levels mediated by the constitutive promoters. When cloned into a low copy"

Results: PCR worked but with tons of side products so we will try to optimize the procedure. Expected product = 3Kb, notable side products = 2Kb, 4Kb. N.B. The samples were accidentally loaded while the gel was running so they are staggered on the gel.
thio kan-ZFB-wp-hisura overlap PCR (with loading error)
Gel stab PCR
DNA from the 3Kb e-gel band were removed using the stabbing technique and placed in 4 respective reaction tubes (diluted in 20µL water)
The 4 samples were separated into template dilutions of 20X, 100X, 200X, and 400X and phosphothio primers for PCR to amplify the desired 3Kb kan-ZFB-wp-hisura sequence. PCR results will be reported tomorrow.
Template PCR followed by PCR with primers:
PCR just the template (1µL diluted thio kan cassette and 1µL diluted thio ZFB-wp-hisura) with no primers, KAPA, 12 cycles, 60˚C anneal, 90 sec elongation

Our project required a system able to detect and then chelate dietary copper. We decided that we should produce parts to test these two functions separately.
Having characterised each we could have a better understanding of a system whereby dietary copper was detected and a chelator produced until the free copper concentration is reduced to a stable level.
Our copper chelators and copper-sensitive promoters belong in our list of basic parts whilst our promoter-chelators systems belong in our composite parts range. All can be found in our complete parts collection .
Copper Chelators
In order to chelate copper we searched for copper binding and storage proteins.  We decided that the ideal copper chelator would have these properties:
Should be able to bind multiple copper ions per peptide to increase the efficient use of cell resources.
They should be from the prokaryotic domain because eukaryotic proteins can have expression issues in Escherichia coli.
As E. coli naturally deals with copper toxicity by binding copper in the periplasm then exporting it, periplasmic proteins may reduce toxicity to the host.
Using these criteria we found"

Meetup Writeups:
True spirit of iGEM lies not in competition but in collaboration. With dawn of synthetic biology,  it became absolutely clear that future of biological sciences lies not in closed gate patenting but   in open source innovation. iGEM teams all over the world organize team meetups with other   teams where discussion, critique and feedback over the each team project is given by all. Such   discussions are extremely helpful as they provide a wide diversity of opinions and filter the   subtle nuisances before Giant Jamboree. Our team was invited for two iGEM meetups ­ one   Indian iGEM team meetup by IISER Pune and other an Asian regional meetup organized by   NCTU, Taiwan. Both of the experiences have been very informative as well as enlightening.   Details of individual meetups are described below.
IISER Pune Meetup July 16­17, 2015.
The IISER Pune iGEM team organized an Indian iGEM meetup during This meetup had  three of the four Indian iGEM teams (for the year 2015) participate in it, namely IIT Delhi,   IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. IIT Delhi had sent three representatives of their team, while two   of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During the first day   (16th July), there was an informal discussion session amongst all the teams, followed by IISER   Pune’s project presentation in the afternoon. While the second day (17th July) had the   presentations of our team (in the morning) and IIT Delhi’s presentation in the afternoon. IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in  awe, and in a way left the other teams with no choice but to further improvise their presentations.   All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive presentation,   which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer simulation   based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, and had it   divided into three sub­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet­lab work. While IISER   Pune wishes to compete in the Health and Medicine track of iGEM, IIT Delhi wishes to compete   in the"

There were some factors maybe impact the result:
7.1. the concentration of donor DNA was too low;
7.2. the genome of TOP 10 was modified but we still design experiment plan refer to the genome of MG1655;
7.3. We found that the TM of primers designed last time differs too large, that may be the reason of strange PCR result.

We then gave the following definition for synthetic biology: Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical issues in various areas such as health, environment, basic science or new energies. Researchers modify an organism, like a bacteria’s DNA, to give it new properties such as the ability to produce a medicine (synthesis of insulin), depollute, emit fluorescence or the ability to detect viruses.
We gave the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or hormone) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders.
Then we asked questions to evaluate the knowledge of people regarding synthetic biology and see if they would accept a solution based on it.
In order to improve the understanding of synthetic biology of the participant we gave him two examples of synthetic biology applications (two past iGEM projects).
Example 1: An example for the use of synthetic biology is iGEM Paris Bettencourt's 2015 project. They improved an Indian dish by adding vitamins and nutriments produced by living bacteria (originally obtained from the fermented food itself), to help spread those nutriments among Indian people. The bacteria are killed before the meal is consumed.
Example 2: Another application for synthetic biology is the use of genetically modified bacteria to bait and eliminate bee killing parasites.
We gave the following definition for GMO: A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMOs are used to produce many medications, genetically modified foods, to produce other goods and are widely used in scientific research.
How we educated with the survey
This questionnaire allowed us to know the opinion of more than 2300 people about air pollution and synthetic biology. We integrated this precious knowledge in the design of our device and our scenario. We the questionnaire had an educational purpose. Indeed, in this questionnaire we put many definitions to educate the participants. Several participants thanked us for doing so and emphasized the informative nature of our investigation. The questionnaire was therefore a way for us to educate more than 2,300 people worldwide.

Biofilms: Continued Growth of Biofilms.
Objective: Continue to determine what cleaners will destroy/degrade biofilms. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Results: The biofilms did not grow on any of the plates as there was no red ring. Using fresh RFP cultures might fix this issue because the cultures we had used were prepared earlier in the month.

Main Project Abstract
Fig 1 . Here is the potato.
Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli “Pneumosensor”, that will      work inside an in vitro diagnostic device. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. Pneumoniae. Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. It is also equipped with a new promoter for the specific and tight regulation of      target gene expression in E. coli. In addition, the team is documenting and characterizing existing CR-TA riboregulators for post-transcriptional     regulation of gene expression. Our work will help other iGEM teams more effectively incorporate this tuning tool into their project design.

Science days
The Science Days are hosted in the Europa Park, one of the biggest theme parks in Europe. Its purpose is to bring research and science closer to children and school classes, and appeal to their joy of discovery. In addition, adolescents, parents and teachers are informed about institutes, companies, and education possibilities. For young explorers, we again offered to extract DNA from bananas.
Based on the insights gained in the survey, we improved our interaction with visitors by highlighting the benefits of synthetic biology. We had great success which was shown by the huge interest people showed towards our project. A lot of them promised to keep track of our project and wanted us to keep them informed.

""LACTOBACILLI are considered to be catalase-negative1, or occasionally to produce very small amounts of catalase2. The lactobacilli isolated from dairy products have always been found to be catalase-negative3,4. During recent work on the microflora of Cheddar cheese, we have encountered strains of lactobacilli which possess both strong and weak catalase activity. Three strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, originally isolated by Sherwood3 from New Zealand Cheddar cheese, were found to be catalase-positive. Two of the strains gave strong catalase reactions whereas the other strain was much weaker (see Table 1)."" - http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v178/n4535/abs/178700a0.html
Nina: This information is good, since we thought that there would not be any chance lactobacillus would express catalase.
""Even though our activated engineered cells will eventually die from their oxidative burst, we want them to survive long enough to produce large amounts of the oxidase so they can produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide. If the cells were left to produce hydrogen peroxide without any protection, they would produce just enough H2O2  to be cytotoxic and then fissle, killing only themselves and little else. To avoid this problem, an E. coli catalase will be expressed by default, and then turned off shortly after pyruvate oxidase expression is triggered. We are accomplishing this regulation by putting katG (on of two E. coli catalase genes) behind the TetR sensitive promoter (pTet) and having TetR co-transciptionally expressed with the oxidase. The time it takes for TetR to accumulate in the cell provides the delay in repressing KatG expression. To ensure KatG is rapidly cleared from the cells, it has a C-terminal ssrA degradation tag, which should reduce the protein’s half life to the order of minutes. In this way, the cell can be temporarily protected from hydrogen peroxide, but large amounts can accumulate before the substrate is exhausted. The final strain will have deletions of both catalases, ensuring that we have complete control over catalase expression. "" - https://2008.igem.org/Team:Caltech/Project/Oxidative_Burst
Nina: an iGEM team that has already expressed ctalase in e.coli, maybe we can get their gene from hq iGEM.

Made 500 mL LB liquid media as well as 1 L LB + agar for plates.  Put approximately 20g each of LB Broth and Bacto Agar into the agar mixture, but it came out cloudy so we had to get rid of it.  For the autoclave we use, seeing as it is so old, we should now heat the agar mixture briefly to a boil on a hotplate first and then leave it in the autoclave for 25 mins.  The LB media came out just fine.
6/10/08
Re-made LB-agar plates according to method described above.  They came out rather successfully.  Good consistency.
With these plates, we then streaked out glycerol stocks of J63001 (EYFP) and J63002 (terminator) onto plates for growth overnight.
However, after realizing that J63006 had never been made into a glycerol stock, we attempted to transform cells with J63006 from the 2007 parts kit.  We decided against using the same part from the new 2008 kit because we would have then had to purchase Tris-HCl and make TE, which would have meant more money and more time.  Positive control for the transformation was a 3x flag provided by Diana.
We plated this transformation as well and put all of the plates into the incubator at around 11:30 pm.  Since we were unsure about how successful we would be, we made duplicate plates for each part. Our streaking technique was a little unique, but I had found it to work in the past.  You take out a dab of glycerol and add it to 1 mL of LB in a microentrifuge tube.  After mixing it uniformly, you then take a loop and sterilize it by getting it red hot.  After first cooling the loop in the agar of the plate, you then dip the loop into the liquid and get just a drop.  You apply this drop to the surface of the agar and streak as if you would streak a"

Introduction and Motivations
Our cellular model develops on the characterization of the EtnR1 and EtnR2 regulation pathway as well as exploring possible targets for future development and optimization of our final biosensor construct.
Using this model, we predicted the behaviour of our biosensor under it’s designed conditions. Should this match up to experimental observations, we can confirm that the EtnR1 and EtnR2 regulation network behaves as originally hypothesized. This would be a key milestone in the characterization of these unknown proteins.
The main modelling environment utilized in this project is the MATLAB SimBiology toolbox, a plugin designed specifically for computational systems biology. The toolbox converts the underpinning mathematics of systems biology into a graphical interface, making it ideal for gene regulatory network modelling. SimBiology will be utilized with a deterministic differential equation solver method.In other words, the computations are identical every time the simulation is run, giving the same solutions. This means no randomization of the results. In real life, there is some degree of random variation in the quantities - this is where a stochastic model would be useful. However, over a cell population these random variations average out to give deterministic results.
As the cellular model is quite versatile, it will be used to model the similar 2-component regulatory system by iGEM Hamburg team as a collaboration between our two teams.. This can be found on our collaboration page
The Signalling Cascade
Hypothesized signalling pathway
The signalling cascade is the unknown component of our model. While we have evidence to suggest it behaves as hypothesized below, it must be confirmed.  If the model is successful and can be compared against experimental values, we may be able to confirm the characterization  of EtnR1 and EtnR2.
To begin with characterization, the signalling cascade model has been assumed to act as a standard two-component signalling pathway. These types of systems have been characterized by well established mathematical models in the past (Chen, He"

XJTLU-CHINA,2016,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," food problem. The random mutation is similar to our mutagenesis project. Some local citizens showed worried to the mutations that may pose negative consequences in our daily life. They tend to be afraid of the super-bacteria that will be difficult to be treated. Stimulated by this comment, we paid much attention in particular doing the experiments. After working with the bacteria, we auto-cleaved them instead of simply flowing into water tank to avoid the mutation generated. When working in the lab, harsh rules were made including always wearing gloves in the lab to avoid being infected by bacteria accidentally.
 
Furthermore, since they are worried about the super-bacteria, we educate the public with scientific knowledge to clear their misunderstanding. The high frequency of antibiotic resistance has currently become an enormous threat to human being. The increasing number of multi-drug resistance bacteria has made current antibiotics hard to cope with because of the abuse of antibiotics by individual and hospitals. Thus, we strongly emphasize the significance of antibiotics use in daily life properly. In our project, we desire to generate more benefit mutations through our in vivo process. To modify our project, we can identify more possible mutations that can fight against the antibiotic resistance problem.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," manufacturing processes. This shows that impacts on human health should be our top priority when modifying our MFC.
Production constraints are the second most important category after we have shown the video. However, the only factor that can be related to our MFC is the low production yield which we think is beyond the scope in which we can improve during the time span of this iGEM season. As a result, the next focus on our MFC moderation will be on the possible pollutants that the MFC might produce during its electricity generation. We have identified that CO2 is the only greenhouse gas pollutant that will be released from our system. The modification of this will be discussed in the integrated human practices section of this project.
Amongst all the other choices, the social cost including the ethical issues on crop usage and land use seems to be relatively less important as Hong Kong have alternatives to these issues such as using kitchen waste as energy source instead of growing new crops for bioenergy or using offshore wind farm as an alternative to wind farms on land. As a result, the scale of our MFC system can have more flexibility than what we have originally thought to be limited due to the limiting living space available in Hong Kong.
Summarizing all the valuable feedbacks from our potential users and the different aspects of our project, we have arrived to the following conclusion:
Survey results indicated that concerns on human health and the production constraints are one of the highest concern in choosing a renewable energy type.
To address one of the public's concern on the environmental pollutant, MFC system modification to reduce CO2 emission was considered by integrating insights from Prof. Bookhart.
Further education on renewable energy may be required for the general public in Hong Kong before the implementation of a new renewable energy.

We proved that our designed yeast accumulates more salt from the environment than the wildtype organism.
In cooperation with General Electric we developed a membrane system to guarantee that no organisms are released to the environment in our application.
A sustainable application of our “SALT VAULT” that we evolved together with representatives from industry, research and public, is one of the results of the integration       of our Human Practices.
While developing our mutante and our application we took care of minimizing negative environmental impacts. Therefore, we created an organism carrying no antibiotic resistances and       developed systems to prevent environmental exposure.
Project Description
Motivation
On the African continent and in the Middle East,     the supply of fresh water is a major problem. But also in Germany there     is a contamination of rivers and groundwater by municipalities, agriculture     and, most of all, industry. The sewage is contaminated with various pollutants.     But in particular, industrial wastewater often contains large amounts     of different salts.
""The Werra between the Hessian potash territory  and its confluence with the Fulda is currently the most heavily polluted river in Germany""
Prof. Dr. Braukmann
The Werra, a German river, is considered one of the dirtiest in Central         Europe. The reason for this is an extremely high salt load. The value for chloride is about 5000% higher         than that of a comparable flow without an extreme introduction of sewage. The amounts of magnesium and         potassium are also far above the normal value.
The reason for the load is the introduction of lye from the mining industry.    At the Werra, potash salts are extracted, which are exported for fertilizer production worldwide. A     waste product of this potash salt recovery is sodium chloride, however magnesium salts and others as well.     These waste products are either disposed of on huge hills, pressed into the ground or led into the     Werra as the already mentioned lye.
Fig.2: The ion concentration in the Werra (green) compared to a similar river without salt introduction from potash industry (red).
This leads to a chloride concentration in the Werra that is over 2000 mg / L high.     This increased chloride content, together with other increased ion concentrations, leads to catastrophic     damage to the ecosystem. Before the destruction through the introduction of industrial waste water without     prior purification, the macrozoobenthos of the Werra was composed of 60-100 species.
Nowadays, the environment is dominated by only one species. The boosted river cancer"

Expression of mimABCD in response to acetone and relative compounds is regulated by mimR gene product whose gene location is upstream of the gene cluster and is divergently transcribed.[6] Furuya et al had tried to determine the specificity of transcriptional activation by mimR with exposure to certain molecules indicated in the figure 1.  As it has been seen from the figure, acetone is the compound increasing the transcriptional activation by mimR better than other molecules. Therefore we had decided to use mimR-pmimA transcription factor and promoter couples as sensor of acetone.
ChnR
Acinetobacter johnsonii  strain NCIMB 9871is bacterium that can convert cyclohexanol  and its derivatives(cyclohexanone and  ε-caprolactone) into adicipic acid. This degradation mainly depends on five genes. ChnA, alcohol dehydrogenase,  degrades cyclohexanol into cyclohexanone, which is degraded by ChnB into  ε-caprolactone. Presence of ChnC, hydrolase, contributes to hydrolization of ε-caprolactone, then ChnD and ChnE, alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase respectively, take an active role in formation of adicipic acid at the end. It has been found that ChnR protein which is a Xyls/AraC-type transcriptional activator from Acinetobacter sp. responds to the presence of cyclohexanone by inducing expression of ChnB protein. pChnB  is the region starting from 537bp upstream of ChnB to its start codon from Acinetobacter sp. cyclohenol gene cluster. pChnB is activated by ChnR in the presence of cyclohexanone. [7]
ChnR/pChnB system has been shown to be capable of creating a biosensor in Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIMB 9871.[8]  It is found that breast cancer patients release different amount of cyclohexanone to the environment, therefore we decided to use ChnR/pChnB system to develop a biosensor which is avble to diagnose breast cancer.

Introduction
As participants in the iGEM Competition, we have come to accept the ability to modify genes as an obvious fact, one that does not require much reflection on our end. At the same time, whilst we understand such possibility is granted to us by law, not many realise the extent to which law may incentivise, guide, shape and, at times, limit our efforts. It originates from politics, creates institutional procedures, gives life to new businesses, dictates the pace of scientific progress, and affects consumer choices. In this, law reflects the perceptions of its creators while its creators reflect diversity of the country’s citizens. In this, law is diverse.
In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second its bureaucracy, third law’s impact on business, fourth on science and finally on consumer behaviour. Willing to gain an even deeper understanding of GMM legislations, we have invited 15 teams from different countries to participate in these collaborative efforts. In the end, the final document has been created by 127 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks and 5 continents. Have a look at the fruits of the 3 months-long interactions, discussions and meet-ups.

On the one hand, this essay enables to allay the global unease concerning the idea of creation of life and the notion of ‘living machine’, because, according to our argumentation, no creation of life and no ‘living machine’ is possible at all. On the other hand, this essay shows some important aspects which are required for consolidating a clear and coherent epistemology of synthetic biology. Moreover, based on the conduced analysis of biological functions in our essay, the outline of a consistent biocentric ethic which also includes the products of synthetic biology, is possible.

1.2 Chronicle of the philosophical evenings
In this section we would like to describe the development of our arguments and thoughts concerning the epistemological roots of synthetic biology and the different arising problems. Through these 'philosophical evenings' we examined in detail if the expression 'living machine' can really be considered to be a proper term or if it is necessarily a metaphor. We inquired together if this novel categorisation and kind-setting ('living machine') is actually warranted or not. Although our chronicles might wake the feeling of straightforwardness, this was not really the case. In fact, we needed hours of discussions, sanguine brainstorming and intensive reading to archieve our final arguments. Clearly, not all of the team members were the same opinion through our deliberations and it took time to find our common premises and starting points. But once we cleared up our diverse positions, we were able to do a fine work together! Although we also wanted to describe these different aspects and opinions through our discussions, we decided to simply present the thread and fruits of our philosophical evenings.
First meeting - Introduction
After a short introduction to the definition, aims and different approaches of the synthetic biology ([1],[2],[3],[4]), we clarified some special philosophical terms in order to have a common basis for further discussion. During the first meeting, we soon realised that the synthetic biology grounds on a different epistemology than the fields of ‘pure sciences’ do.

Collaborations
The Lethbridge High School iGEM has helped our team immensely with design and coding of the Collegiate wiki. Constructive feedback was given during meetings, to which coding help was given by a member of the High School team. The Lethbridge collegiate iGEM team also assisted the Lethbridge High School team with their hosting of a wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams (Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, Lethbridge) were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of ligations, making competent cells, transformations, minipreps, and gel electrophoresis were taught to name a few.
In addition to our collaboration with the U of L High School team, we organized and hosted an Alberta-wide workshop designed to provide iGEM teams with experience presenting and give feedback on project ideas and techniques. The collegiate team from NAIT participated and offered assistance and feedback during the two day event. Experts from across North America were present, and the experience was beneficial for all parties involved. In concert with our High School collaboration, we forged an important link between our team and the Government of Canada agency for Agriculture and Agri-Food. As our project deals directly with crop protection, we have been fortunate to gain access to a pest species of Fusarium on which to test our constructs. As part of this collaboration we have had an opportunity to engage a wide network of faculty and support staff at the Lethbridge Research Centre and receive feedback and suggestions from individuals with decades of relevant experience.
In addition to these collaborations, our team has participated in several surveys that were conducted by other iGEM teams from around the world. In total, we participated in five surveys that were created by the following teams: Paris-Saclay, Nankai, NEFU China, BNU China, and Korea U Seoul. The BNU China survey related most closely to our own project in that questions were posed about agricultural disasters, pesticides, and our government’s policies on biosafety and farmer’s rights to use pesticides.

That is why we transformed E. coli JS200 with pHSG-EPPolI and pSB1AK3. We cultivated 25 ml LB in 250 ml shaker flasks at 37°C and 150 RPM.         Inoculation was done to gain an initial optical density of 0.1. The ampicillin concentration was varied between 0 g/l and 10 g/l.         Additionally kanamycin and chloramphenicol were added at adequate concentrations to grant plasmid stability. All Experiments were also         done with a JS200 strain containing the pHSG-WTPolI plasmid to determine possible differences when cultivated under ampicillin.
Figure 1: Growth curve of JS200 containing pWTPolI and pSB1AK3.Growth curve of JS200 strains containing pHSG-pWTPolI and pSB1AK3   The cells were cultivated between 10-16 h in LB Medium. The medium was supplemented with adequate concentrations of kanamycin, chloramphenicol and 0, 0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 g/l ampicillin.
Figure 2: Growth curve of JS200 containing pEPPolI and pSB1AK3.Growth curve of JS200 strains containing an error prone DNA polymerase I pHSG  and pSB1AK3   The cells were cultivated between 12-18 h in LB Medium. The medium was supplemented with adequate concentrations of kanamycin, chloramphenicol and 0, 0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 g/l ampicillin.
As you can see in Figures 1 and 2 higher ampicillin concentrations have a major impact on the growth properties of the strain containing the         error prone DNA polymerase I. However the strain containing the plasmid carrying the wildtype DNA polymerase I is almost not influenced by         a raised ampicillin concentration. The differences in ampicillin sensibility may be caused by the low fidelity property of the error prone          polymerase I . The different activities directly influence the ColE1-like plasmid pSB1AK3 and connected to this, the beta-lactamase presence in culture.         Based on this results, we decided that ampicillin is indeed an adequat selective marker for our system, as long as we keep the quantitative"

Ganoderma protocol continued: The 19-24 hours samples taken out and started the isolation procedure. Put in fridge with the other samples.
9/10/2018
Looked at transformation plates with Kyle to see if something might have transformed: He thinks that the media being coloured and the spores looking greener than usual on the transformants might indicate that something has been transformed.  New bricks were made to see if they secrete the colour into the bricks.
10/10/2018
The Ganoderma protocol was finished by centrifuging for 10 minutes at 10000 rpm. There was no pellet.
Liquid cultures of the suspected transformants were inoculated and incubated at 28°C and 150 rpm. The cultures were inoculated with both green spores and white spores to see if they secreted any kind of colour.
11/10/2018
As a last try, the Ganoderma protocol was restarted, this time with driselase as we hand received some the same day. There was no time to make new plates to incubate for 5 days, so we had to try with some of the old plates. Three tubes with 1 ml PDB was inoculated for continuation the next day.
12/10/2018
The three tubes were taken through the digestion steps and put in the incubator at 30°C, 85 rpm.
13/10/2018
The samples were taken out of the incubator. The incubator had been changed to 28°C, 100 rpm when we returned to the samples. The samples were run through the first steps for isolation of protoplasts.
14/10/2018
Samples were centrifuged according to protocol but there was no pellet.

By embodying the above ideas, we have designed the following possible integrated pathways.
Fig.10 Integrated plasmid.
A) GFP is directly linked to gdh by “TGATG” or haripin.
B) GFP is linked to gdh by “TGATG”, T7 polymerase and T7 promoter.
C) GFP is linked to gdh by “TGATG”, cI protein and lacI/cI promoter.
D) GFP is linked to gdh by “TGATG”, pchBA and emrR binding promoter. It also uses CIChE technique.
Before verifying the overall function of the intergrate plasmid, it is necessary to verify the operation of each part. So we separate them into the following modules. Module 4 includes Stop-Start Codon “TGATG”, Module 5 includes cI repressor and its promoter, Module 6 includes T7 RNA polymerase and its promoter.
Module 4: Stop-Start Codon “TGATG”
TGATG is one of the core components in our system. Although made up of five simple bases, it has great functional advantages.
TGATG could form a special unit named “Stop-Start Codon”, which means stop codon(UGA) is in close proximity to start codon(AUG). There are many similar combinations: UGA combines with AUG(UGAAUG/UGAUG), UAA combines with AUG(UAAAUG/UAAUG), UAG combines with AUG(UAGAUG). As for TGATG we use in SAM, the stop codon overlap with start codon.
Fig.11 Concept of “Stop-Start Codon”.
In the process of translation, ribosome ought to drop at stop codon, but it has some possibility that the ribosome could directly identify start codon"

We have joy, we have fun, we are WHU-iGEMers in the sun!
Welcome to visit the wiki of WHU-2012!
Our project, E. coslim, is aimed at groping an effective way for people to enjoy wolfing delicacies while not worry about gaining weight.
Working day and night, we finally submited 66 biobricks. As the saying goes, Rome was no built in one day. Every step to the MIT and every biobrick used to construct E. coslim are soaked with inspiration and perspiration of every teammate. While several weeks of sleepless night exhausted our body, our spirit sparkled with each other.
Do you want to be keep slim figure while enjoying your gluttonous feast? Are you dreaming of enjoying food without worrying about overweight? Now we WHU iGEMers sincerely invite you to come with us to explore the magic of E. coslim.

Strategy
In order to characterize the BioBricks we constructed three plasmids for each Gifsy phage using fluorescent proteins as reporter genes, see table 1. We used a BioLector microreactor system for our measurements. The BioLector is a microfermenting system that measures light scattering (a measure of cell density) and fluorescence simultaneously, which is ideal to characterize our constructs.

In the first plasmids (pIGR01 and pIGR02) we cloned a GFP reporter downstream of the pR promoter, because this would give us the level of GFP expression from the pR promoter when the represser is not present, see figure 2.
Figure 2 Characterization plasmid pIGR01/02, containing promoters and GFP reporter. Expression of GFP shows that the pR promoters are working as expected.
The next plasmids (pIGR03 and pIGR04) contain GFP downstream of pR and the repressors (GogR or GtgR) downstream of pRM, see figure 3. These plasmids would allow us to see if the repressors repress the pR promoter – causing expression of GFP to cease. If no GFP is expressed, the repressor system is tight.

We collaborated with HFLS_ZhejiangUnited , Worldshaper-XSHS , Worldshaper-Wuhan , Zhejiang University (ZJU-China) , Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) as well as Jiangnan University (Jiangnan) . We have cooperated with the iGEM teams mentioned above on InterLab study, public investigation and public activities and discussion of experimental problems, etc.
InterLab Collaboration
Our Interlab study was done in collaboration with two other teams (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS). Before beginning the experiment, we carefully studied and discussed the official protocol provided by iGEM measurement together. Worldshaper-XSHS lends us their 96-well plates when ours are not adequately prepared. Moreover, when our first submission was failed, we together with worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited to analyze the data and find what the problem is. Thank you for their help given to us. We resubmit our data and was accepted by iGEM measurement committee on August 16. On the other hand, we offered the plate reader for them to do the InterLab study.
Project Experiments Collaboration
Besides the interlab study, we have many collaboration with Worldshaper- XSHS, HFLS-ZhejiangUnited as well as ZJU-China, since all our four teams base at Zhejiang University Zijingang Camps. During the summer, we visit each other quite frequently to discuss the technical problem and public activities. We borrowed the distribution Kit 1 and 2 from Worldshaper- XSHS and lent Kit 3 and 5 to them. Furthermore HFLS-ZhejiangUnited offered us the part eRFP when we failed to transform it twice. Then Worldshaper- XSHS met a great difficulty on transformation as well which blocked them project for more than one week, we discussed the all technical details together and help them find out the problem probably from their E. coli competent cells.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html,", at random. Also, when sub munitions of a cluster bomb do not explode, they turn into de facto landmines. Because of that, it is logical that the ICBL and the CMC combined their efforts.”
Because landmines are not such a hot topic in the news anymore as a couple of years ago, we asked if the issue is as good as solved. “In the run up to the Mine Ban Treaty, the problem was huge. Over 20.000 people  died per year, as a direct result of landmines. However, the BMT is near universal now, so most countries do not have, produce or use landmines anymore. The near-universality of the treaty also impacts the unaffiliated countries, since landmines are a stigma nowadays; there is a universal norm not to use landmines. You can compare it to the attitude towards chemical weapons: when Assad decided to use these, this was universally disapproved. This stigmatization is why the universalization of the cluster munitions treaty is of the utmost importance.”
The success of the Mine Ban Treaty however has not caused eradication of the use of land mines. “Still every year people die because of landmines. The numbers are not comparable to those of before the landmine treaty, but every casualty is one too much. Landmines have recently been used in the conflict in Syria, by the FARC in Colombia and in Yemen. We have also received reports of the use of landmines and cluster bombs in the conflict in Ukraine. However, these are not verified and it should be noted that there is a propaganda war going on there as well: because of the stigmatization, claiming that the opposing party uses landmines is great propaganda.”
We also discussed the particular position the United States have with respect to landmines: “The US haven’t signed the Mine Ban treaty, despite years of encouragement. However, they are by far the world’s biggest donor for landmine removal and victim aid. They don’t use and produce landmines for years, and they even stated that it is their goal to sign the treaty ‘in due time’. I speculate that the fact that they want to reserve the right to use them is related to a possible conflict between North and South Korea.”
After we explained our project in quite some detail, Ms. Oosterwijk wondered whether our system would be able to precisely mark the location of landmines. “Many new methods to search for landmines have been developed, such as the use of dogs and rats, but in practice"
St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Omega-3-synthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," such, latter work was only carried out on genes from Synechocystis.
Then, Δ6, Δ12, and Δ15 desaturases were successfully ligated into two distinct pET-Duet vectors (vectors with two multicloning sites). One vector contained Δ12 and Δ15 desaturases, and the other was ligated only with Δ6 desaturase.
Protein expression was clear after transformation into cell strain BL21(DE3) and induction by IPTG. However, functionality could not be established. It was hypothesized that the naturally-occuring 18:1 fatty acid in E. coli is the wrong substrate for the desaturases. This fatty acid has its desaturation at the 11th carbon, not at the 9th position required for a substrate. Thus, the E. coli were fed 18:1 (Δ9).
Full characterisatin and quantification of the fatty acid composition in transformed E. coli was performed by fatty acid conversion to the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) followed by GC-MS analysis. In this way, lipid profiles of membrane assays and lipid extracts from cells were obtained.
After characterization, we ligated each of our desaturases into the submission vector pSB1C3.

Being one of the founders of the iGEM FAU Erlangen team, he plays an important role in our group. Just like Vlady, he did his B. Sc. In Integrated Life Sciences and is now doing his masters program in Cell and Molecular Biology. He was born and raised in Kraków, Poland, moved to Germany in 2000, and came to the FAU in 2011.
Günter Ellrott - The one who's not a biologist
Günter is our own personal physicist, after recruiting him for some previously planned project involving some analysis using physical measurement methods. As a physicist, he was mainly there to point out explanations for sponsors and non-biology audiences that were too complicated to understand. He was also responsible for all kind of programming and computing. One of his programming results was a short Python script that we used to find short sequences with a specified length that do not or as little as possible appear in a given genome. During his work he always remains the epitome of organization. He even managed to understand our biological goals and tasks in a surprisingly short time. When he is not programming, he spends his free time at standard formation dancing and voluntary work in higher educational politics. He was born in Duderstadt, lower Saxony, Germany and raised in Landshut, Bavaria, Germany and came to the FAU in 2011.

Ihab Boulas
After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time.

I’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students. I did my Ph.D. in Pam Silver’s lab in the Harvard Systems Biology department. My research interests include aging, evolution, metabolism and of course Synthetic Biology.

Paris_Liliane_Bettencourt,2010,Team:Paris Liliane Bettencourt#Project#SIP#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a multiepitope of several virulence factors of H. pylori. We prepared three implementations of this system in the form of recombinant proteins, engineered bacteria and DNA vaccines, demonstrated responsiveness of each of them in cell culture assays, cellular localization and even obtained significant antibody response in laboratory animals only weeks after vaccination. The second approach was to extend the range of activation of innate immune response to different Toll-like receptors by linking antigen to different TLR segments, which are constitutively activated by the addition of a dimerization domain. In this case we could direct localization of resulting fusion receptors to either cell membrane or cellular vesicles, which should assist in proper antigen processing and presentation. The power of this approach is that we could mimic synergistic activation of several TLRs by pathogenic microbes, while having the advantage of safety of a defined subunit vaccine.""
Cambridge 2009
""The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team has created two kits of parts that will facilitate the design and construction of biosensors in the the future. Previous iGEM teams have focused on genetically engineering bacterial biosensors by enabling bacteria to respond to novel inputs, especially biologically significant compounds. There is an unmistakable need to also develop devices that can 1) manipulate input by changing the behaviour of the response of the input-sensitive promoter, and that can 2) report a response using clear, user-friendly outputs. The most popular output is the expression of a fluorescent protein, detectable using fluorescence microscopy. But, what if we could simply see the output with our own eyes?  We successfully characterised a set of transcriptional systems for calibrated output - Sensitivity Tuners. We also successfully expressed a spectrum of pigments in E. coli, designing a set of Colour Generators.""
iGEM Ranking
To get a feeling of the major trends for winning projects and try to guess the potential winners, we determined a list of frequently ""winning"" SIPs. The idea is first to see what kind of projects are rewarded, then to try to see if a trend emerges by combining the last years' winners.   We attribute points (coefficients) to the SIPs of the winners using the following rules :
Grand prize : 5 pts.
Finalist : 3pts.
Other prize : 1pt.
Winner : 5pts.
1st Runner up : 4pts.
2nd runner up: 3pts.
