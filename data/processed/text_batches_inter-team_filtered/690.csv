3. Meetup with high-school teams and wet-lab teams.
High-school teams are dedicated to development of mobile applications. Without systematic knowledge of life sciences, they knew less about synthetic biology than us. Also, they needed advice on how to design software to meet the needs of synthetic biology community.
In summer, a meetup with high-school teams and wet-lab teams was held in the campus. At the beginning of the meetup we first introduced our project to high-school teams and wet-lab teams. Though it was still a proof-of-concept idea, the feedbacks that they gave us after they listened to our presentation provided us with insightful and meaningful suggestions.
In our presentation we introduced the game, Synbio Box, which was designed and implemented by us. The game combined basic knowledge in synthetic biology with the fun provided by the game. One of the feedbacks that high-school teams gave us is:

“It’s good combining entertaining games with serious scientific practices. Though I can’t understand what you do, but I can now understand                        synthetic biology a little bit via this funny game!”
The fact that the game, Synbio Box, was so attractive to high-school teams is beyond our wildest expectation. Maybe our project should turn “professionals-oriented” to “public-oriented” ?
4. A mini lecture to freshmen of life sciences.
iGEM is a competition for the future generation. To attract more freshmen to the iGEM competition, as well as engage them into the practices of synthetic biology, we held a mini lecture to the 2015 freshmen of School of Life Sciences, SYSU.
For the first part, Zhengyang Wen introduced to the freshmen some basic knowledge of Synbio. Then Weilin Xu introduced what is iGEM. Then came the Xiao Feng’s introduction to our project, and Yi Shi’s introduction to Synbio Box.
When Yi Shi was introducing the “Synbio Box” mobile game to them, they were so surprised to find out that, although the game is on Synbio, it is very easy to play!

Conclusions
Welcome! This year is Newcastle's first year participating in the iGEM competition! We are a small team of six students, three supervisors, and seven advisors, but we had high ambitions for our first year. Recognizing the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and poor methods of diagnosis in developing countries, we aim to use synthetic biology and bioinformatics to engineer a simple, safe, fast, and reliable biological diagnostic system to identify bacteria.
Overview
We aimed to develop a diagnostic biosensor for detecting pathogens. We wanted this to be cheaply and readily available for deployment in areas where access to medical resources, such as refrigeration and sophisticated laboratories, is limited or absent. We chose to use Bacillus subtilis as a method of delivery due to its ability to sporulate. The sensor bacteria could then be dried down as spores, which are very stable and extremely resilient to hostile environmental conditions, and rehydrated when required. The ambient temperature of much of the developing world is ideal for the growth of Bacillus spp. without the use of incubation equipment.
Gram-positive bacteria communicate using quorum communication peptides. Research has shown that these peptides are extremely strain-specific. We chose to engineer B. subtilis 168 to detect four Gram-positive pathogens by their quorum communication peptides. The different combinations of quorum communication peptides would be sensed by the engineered bacterium, and this signal converted into a visual output as fluorescent proteins such as mCherry, GFP, CFP and YFP.
Mapping multiple inputs to three output states is a multiplexing problem. The design of the genetic circuitry to do this is non-trivial and is not feasible manually. We therefore chose to use a biological implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN). Our team members wrote, designed and implemented a complete suite of tools that allowed the design and simulation of regulatory networks. We aimed to use this software to design an appropriate gene regulatory network that behaved as an ANN. An essential part of the approach was the use of computational evolution to design circuits with predictable behaviour even when the details of the required topology are unknown in advance. Models were encoded in the modelling language CellML because of its ability to model individual virtual parts that can be easily assembled, in a bottom up fashion, into a circuit which can be"

Allow the resin to resettle between each pipetting. Note: We recommend optimizing the amount of HisLink™ Resin used for low- (<1mg/ml) or high- (>1mg/sample) expressing proteins. For lowexpressing proteins, less resin should be used; similarly, for highexpressing proteins, more resin per sample can be used.

Abstract
        The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. In particular, the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a short light pulse from a laser, but still “selective” to not respond to ambient lighting. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification. For example, researchers creating biosensors may find our work very helpful.
General Overview
        Our project can be broken down into three parts: light input, signal amplification, and color output. We used LovTAP to receive the light input; we designed a switch based on Peking 2007’s Bi-stable switch to amplify the signal; and, finally, (after dabbling with some of Cambridge 2009’s E. Chromi colors) we decided to use mRFP1 as a color output.
LovTAP
Overview
In order to draw on a bacterial lawn with a laser pointer, we need bacteria to be able to respond to light. Previous iGEM teams have worked on many different ways to do this each with different advantages and disadvantages. We were struck by the simplicity and beauty of LovTAP. In particular, it functions by itself as a single protein; it is a brilliant example of genetic engineering; and, finally, it does not require any exotic supplements or specific strains of bacteria to function.
LovTAP Parts
As mentioned previously, LovTAP is a fusion protein. It consists of a light-response domain and a DNA binding domain, each of which are parts of other natural proteins.
Light response
        The light-response domain is LOV2, the photoactive domain (i.e. the light responsive part) of AsLOV2 (Avena sativa phototropin 1). AsLOV2 is a protein which allows Avena sativa to respond to 470 nm light. It does this by undergoing a major conformational change upon being struck by a photon with a wavelength near 470 nm. The absorption of the photon leads to the formation of a covalent bond between a flavin monon"

Aim: To assess the efficacy of our CRISPRi system (sgRNA) by shifting cells to arabinose media that necessitates expression of the araC gene.
Hypothesis: If our sgRNA targeting of araC is sufficient, then a progressive decrease in optical density with regard to the control nonsense sgRNA will be observed due to the inability for the cells to utilize arabinose as a carbon source for metabolism.

From inception, our project aimed to produce a cheap, portable and effective screening tool for diseases. A large barrier to this is the quantification of fluorescence from our genetic circuit. We therefore set out to build a cheap and portable fluorometer.
Our combined fluorometer and densitometer allows our paper based test to be used in the field, in remote areas or less developed countries. It also provides a way for high schools and community labs that cannot afford a plate reader to quantify fluorescence and optical density.

Previous designs
Initially, we built a fluorometer using the previous design by the Aachen 2014 and Denver Biolabs 2016 teams. Their fluorometer uses an Arduino board, 2 LEDs, 2 light sensors, 2 breadboards and an LCD screen.
The light sensors output a square wave with frequency proportional to light intensity. The Arduino uses this to calculate either optical density or fluorescence. These readings are displayed on the LCD screen.
Alleyn’s School kindly allowed us use of their laser cutter to produce the casing and their 3D printer to produce the cuvette holder (as mentioned on our attributions page ). Denver Biolabs' box design was fiddly to put together and was overcomplicated, so in the end we opted to not use it as we didn’t think the extra time, money and resources spent to make it were worth it.
The circuits in the previous designs were unnecessarily complicated. We simplified the circuit by removing excess wiring and components. This made the fluorometer far easier to build, troubleshoot and modify further.

Genome Scale Modeling
One of our main objectives for this project is to build a comprehensive, genome-scale model that details the function of the Lux system and its interaction with the host organism, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (s288c).
Genome-scale models (M-Models) represent an effort to bridge the gap between isolated systems (e.g. signaling pathways, glycolysis) to modeling whole systems of organisms1. Metabolic network reconstructions input the full range of known biochemical reactions in an organism to give comprehensive insight into how the components of the genome result in a particular phenotype. These elaborate models are usually encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
There are currently many M-Models available in literature, mostly detailing the networks of different strains of bacteria and the simpler eukaryotes2. The yeast strain of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (s288c) was one of the first to be converted into a network model. For this and for reasons of experimental simplicity, we chose this strain as our base model.
The UC system-wide biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) database features two different networks for the genome of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. The latest model reconstruction, iND750, consists of 1059 metabolites, 1266 reactions, and 750 genes2. In early 2007, a community of researchers came together to standardize the metabolic map of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. They collaborated to periodically update the model and make it available in the public domain (yeast.sf.net) for the years that followed. The latest version to date, version 7, includes reactions published by Aung et al. in 20133.
Ultimately, we decided to model the Lux system in both available models – BiGG and v7. After evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of both models, we were not convinced that either model provided a complete and accurate representation of the yeast metabolism. The v7 model would seem to be the logical choice, because it is frequently used and updated by the yeast community; however, we were concerned when we discovered many reactions and metabolites missing from the native fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is crucial to the Lux system,"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". Dr. Pineros area of expertise is in abiotic stresses and ROS production. He suggested we study root biology in hydroponics and measure the ROS production in treated vs. untreated plants for our testing. Furthermore, he gave us important feedback on containment: he suggested we use some sort of filter to contain the flow of nutrients in one direction and keep the bacteria separate from the plants. This manifested in the dialysis tubing we used to contain our bacteria. Moreover, his hydroponic set-up gave us some in-person contact with the type of system we wanted OxyPonics to be utilized for. This helped us understand firsthand what might work in such an environment, to build on the recommendations and suggestions provided through grower interviews.
JULY 6, 2017
Dr. Philip Benfey
After speaking with Dr. Pineros, we wanted more information about root systems and root biology. Dr. Roeder suggested we reach out to Dr. Benfey in Duke’s Department of Biology, who helped us learn about roots and ROS in root systems. He mentioned that our project was venturing into little-researched territory, and that the results could have important results on hydroponic crop growth. He also discussed some of the potential effects of ROS on root development. For example, reducing hydrogen peroxide levels leads to more rapid root growth in some plants, as well as distribution of superoxide and peroxide in the plant root tip and elongation cells. Dr. Benfey further mentioned some of the precautions we would need to take if we wanted proper plant development, namely if the bacteria need to be in a symbiotic relationship with the root and if it is possible to gauge the internal redox environment of the plant from the outside.
This knowledge provided support that controlling ROS has been shown through research to increase plant growth in a substantial way. OxyPonics is therefore a valuable innovation.
This interview was especially valuable in helping us figure out how to apply the knowledge we had accumulated so far into our product designs. We needed to see if our E. coli could live with plants in a hydroponic set-up, and through our interview with Dr. Maria Harrison we learned this was not the case, so we decided to contain our bacteria with dialysis tubing. When tackling the issue of being able to measure plant internal redox we referred back to our interview with Dr. Tim Setter where we learned that oxidants seep out of a plants roots, leading to our choice to put our bacteria in rings around the plants’ roots for highest ROS-sensing potential.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

On July 10, we joined in a meet up held by Southern University of Science and Technology.
Since we’re high school team, and the condition of our project at the time is kind of complex, a number of problems need to be settled urgently. We got the chance to have a talk with their advisor, Dr Hongmin Zhang. Through the process we mainly express exact problems that appeared in the experiments and discussed the feasibility of our assumption both with the professor and their team members. In this part of our conversation, as we still had to make a choice between our two available projects, Dr. Zhang helped us a lot on analyzing the disadvantages of experimenting on Trichophyton rubrum. This is a crucial turning point to our final decision and we appreciated a lot.
What deserves to be mentioned is that, as experienced competitors, they initiatively helped us reckon our rest of time and offered a schedule available for reference.
Our 2 teams then met in a hall and separately made simple presentations to introduce our projects. We learnt a lot especially in how a professional research team runs and how we should efficiently organize such a team and do management.
We then visited their laboratory in passing with a student introduced us some advanced device. They also offered us varieties of material we urgently need which is really a big help.
To sum up, SUSTech_Shenzhen team’s suggestions led us to clearly consider the direction of our project and this meet-up strengthen our great relationship each other.

The big picture
As described in
Description
, we wish to construct Escherichia coli cells that can assimilate ammonia and convert it into an innocuous substance. As the first step, we decided to overexpress the native enzyme glutamine synthetase, which condenses ammonia with glutamate to form glutamine.
Cloning glnA in pET43.1b
The glnA gene codes for the enzyme glutamine synthetase. We amplified glnA from the E. coli MG1655 genome and cloned it in plasmid pET43.1b between the NdeI and HindIII sites to form plasmid pET43-glnA.
Co-expression of indC
The gene indC codes for blue pigment synthase (Bps), which converts glutamine to the blue-colored compound indigoidine. Plasmid pRB5, which was obtained as a kind gift from Team Heidelberg, carries the indC gene under control of a lacI-regulated promoter.
We decided to co-transform plasmids pET43-glnA and pRB5 in E. coli BL21(DE3). However, we realized that both these plasmids have the same origin of replication (from pMB1), and would therefore not be maintained in a single cell. To circumvent this problem, we decided to clone glnA in a plasmid that has a different origin of replication.
Cloning glnA in pSEVA234
Plasmid pSEVA234 has an oriT origin of replication, and therefore will be able to co-exist with plasmids that have a pMB1 origin of replication. To clone glnA in pSEVA234, pET43-glnA was digested with Psp5II and XhoI to release the lacI-T7 promoter-glnA fragment. This was blunted and cloned in SmaI-digested pSEVA234 to form plasmid pSEVA234-glnA.
Demonstrating proof-of-concept
To demonstrate proof-of-concept, we have transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with

Following PCR at 66,5°C(50µL) had the wrong product (main product at 2 kbp); could be because of a different template concentration or not exact temperature.

Team Activity Tests:
Fig. 1: Measurements of ECOL in a CuCl gradient of 0,1 to 0,7 mM. The activity was measured via oxidized ABTS at OD420, (n=4).
Today we measured the activity of our ECOL laccase in a CuCl gradient to check whether another concentration than the one we usually incubated the laccases with might be more optimal. We chose a gradient from 0,1 mM to 0,7 mM (with an increment of 0,1) and measured the incubated samples as usual in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, 0,1 mM ABTS (ad 200 µL H2O), respectively. Fig. 1 shows that the chosen concentration do influence ECOL, 0,4 mM seems like the best choice for incubation before the activity measurments. Thus the spectrum of OD420 maxima is not immensely wide so that ECOL seems to be satisfied with any CuCl concentration.
Fig. 2: Activity measurements of TTHL via OD420.
Additionally we measured the activity of TTHL without constitutive promoter at 25°C and in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5). TTHL finally also shows some activity, our favorite fractions of Team Cultivations output are number 1 and 2. Unfortunately TTHL couldn´t be indentified"

Week 2: Monday 19th - Sunday 25th July
Monday
In the morning we did further research into the enzymes required for luciferase recovery. You can see the pretty picture of the luciferase cycle we made here .
In the afternoon we presented our proposals to our supervisors who said we could look at trying to optimise luciferase and LRE for E. coli (perhaps using mutagenesis), we shouldn't assume that anything with bacterial luminescence will work (after all, this is biology) and we should think about chassis design.
We also received a new toy of a low light camera, which Bill and Theo tried to get working - and succeeded, as you can see opposite. After receiving an e-mail at about 4pm saying we needed to give a 15 minute presentation the next day in Newcastle, Hannah and Anja started working on that too.
Tuesday
Today was the first day of the UK iGEM teams get together in Newcastle. We all made it (just about) on the 6.50am  train, arriving for a free lunch at 1pm and talks from each of the different teams through the afternoon.
We thought that we would all be pros at the team building exercise involving tower construction again, but only a few of the towers stayed up at all! A wet walk to La Tasca for dinner in the evening"

With these results, we had a good positive control plasmid for our following reactions. The reaction buffer for our CFPS reaction was now defined. The composition of the reaction buffer is depicted in the nearby table.
Nevertheless, we observed batch-to-batch variation in activity of our extracts, a phenomenon also described in the literature ( Takahashi et al. 2015 ). To exclude any batch-to-batch variation in following reactions, we set up a 5 L fermentation and harvested cell pellets to produce by far enough cell extract for the summer (details in the notebook ).

*: tRNA value is given in mg/mL. For optimal performance, K-glutamate and Mg-glutamate salt concentrations may have to be adjusted depending on extract and batch.
Several other issues were tackled:
To improve measurement of fluorescence, we started using a Tecan plate reader. The device was able to shake microplates and constantly heat to 37 °C, therefore we were able to measure kinetics of sfGFP production without interrupting the reaction.
To get reliable data, we used at least triplicates for every following CFPS reaction. We normalized on accompanied cell lysate from cells that had produced sfGFP.
Depending on E. coli strain and cell harvest, it can be necessary to perform a so called run-off reaction . This means heating purified extract to 37 °C before flash-freezing it to enable degradation of endogenous DNA. We determined that 30 min of run-off reaction resulted in best performance for our extract.
Exemplifying standardized CFPS setup
Measuring nearly every minute, we traced production of sfGFP in real time (see nearby figure). The experiment once again showed the beneficial effect of 5'-UTR previously discussed. With our construct, we were able to produce nearly as much sfGFP as was present in disrupted cells that had produced sfGFP in vivo.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

Regulations and Policy
Soil Regulation is an essential component in the overall design of our project since the overarching goal of the project is to be able to distribute the final design to stakeholders that include foreign countries. Several countries seems to show high malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. This requires that the final genetically modified product not only be able to fulfill its original purpose but also have minimal to no side effects, thus requiring carefully framed regulation policies.
In the United States of America, users of soil additives are only required to file for a permit if the additive is used for propagation. Additives used in/or out of plants are not regulated and bacteria (including Minecrobe), and other additives such as fungi, nematodes, phytoplasmas and viruses, genetically modified or not, all fall within the same regulation. The problem presented is that GMO bacteria are engineered specifically in a laboratory environment to fulfill a specific purpose and are needed in regulated amounts due to the possibility that the bacteria could present side effects such as causing nutrient imbalances.This calls forth for new regulations and guidelines to be created for project inecrobe, specifically for genetically modified organisms in soil environments.
Current regulation of GMO’s are more directly related to genetically modified crops which are found in the marketplace and thus represent a large capital world wide. However, regulation of GM crops and our Minecrobe will share several similarities. This includes being able to regulate transformation methods, constructs of the modified genetic structure, recipient organisms, donor organisms, and intended phenotype which all constitute an IGEM project. In the United States, such regulations are upheld by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration. New regulations that would be specific for genetically modified bacteria such as Mine"

- Performed a cesium chloride gradient on T4.  The gradient did not show any band and we aren't sure where the phage are in the gradient.  It is possible that we mixed the gradient before or after centrifugation which could have destroyed the band.

- Discussed and weighed out the T4 cesium chloride gradient for next class.   We also discussed a new gradient for T7. We are hoping this gradient will narrow down exactly where the mutant phage will band and where the wild type phage will band.  We feel that the phage will differentiate around the 1.3 concentration.  By creating a gradient with small steps both above and below 1.3 we should be able to separate the phage out.

We are having issues getting the T7 to band.  When we remove the gradient after centrifuging we are unable to see any band at all.  A spot test reveals phage are found all over the gradient.  We have had this same result several times and believe that the cesium chloride we are using could be the factor.  Our plan is to do a very broad test"
IngenuityLab_Canada,2016,Team:IngenuityLab Canada#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," PSII to lipid-detergent solution, 30 minutes at 4°C with gentle rotation, BiobeadsTM were added three time at 1hour interval for detergent removal and lipid bilayer closure to allow the reconstitution of the protein (Figure 4). Biobeads were removed by SPN Column Protein Assay via centrifuge in bench-top micro-centrifuge at 1000g for 1 minutes. Proteoliposomes were desalt on FPLC using a 5mL Hi-trap column. Fractions of 1 ml in the center 90% of the target peak were collected. The reconstitution of PSII was tested with pH probe pyranine, electron acceptor, and ionophore (Figure 5).
 
Figure 5: As proteoliposomes are exposed to light, a water molecule is split and H+ build up inside the liposome creating a gradient that allows for the detection of pH.  The orientation of the PSII is determined by alkalization or acidification of proteoliposomes as an indication of the location of water-splitting activity. The pH detecting Pyranine was incorporated inside the proteoliposomes, and the pH activity was testing my suspending the proteoliposomes in buffer (5mM MES, 50mM KCl, 2mM MgCl2, 2mM CaCl2 pH 6.52) that contained ionophore Valinomycin, electron acceptor DCBQ or DQ and Ferricyanide. The DPX quenches any pyranine outside the proteoliposomes in the buffer.
 
FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader was used to run the assays on Photosystem II (PSII) proteoliposomes. After adding 175ul of assay and 25ul of proteoliposomes sample, an initial reading is taken at λem = 410 nm and λexc= 460 nm. The reading ratio of 460/404 is used to determine the pH value for each sample. In this experiment, a ‘control’ sample that does not contain PSII was used to confirm that the proton gradient is only due to the protein splitting water activity in the liposome. In addition, the ‘control’ sample contained 3mM and 7mM CHAPS detergent labelled Rsat (lipid to detergent ratio~ 17.4) and Rsol (lipid to detergent ratio~ 7.5) respectively.

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," issue that many places around the world face, specifically Alberta. While our provincial economy relies heavily on the oil and gas industry, and we are very fortunate to have such natural resources at our disposal, these tailings must be monitored and dealt with cautiously. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of oil, oil sands, natural gas, and coal resources over their entire life cycle. They aim to ensure the reclamation of tailings ponds and speaking with them helped us gain insight on many different aspects of our project. We organized an interview with a Senior Tailings Engineer from Alberta Energy Regulator, and told him about our project and goals. A large concern for our project was using synthetic biology in an environment that is exposed to natural conditions; however, when discussing the issue of biocontainment with the AER representative, he advised us that biocontainment was not an issue whatsoever. This is due to the fact that tailings ponds do not support many living organisms aside from bacteria because they are so toxic (tailings ponds are relatively isolated environments). We also discussed and gained knowledge of the magnitude of tailings ponds, and were informed that they will continue to grow and must be taken care of. This interview helped us to confirm that our system would be very useful due to the fact that there is currently no concrete solution. The representative voiced his concern about the magnitude of tailings ponds, and the impact that our system could have on such a large volume. We aim to resolve this concern using mathematical modelling until further experiments can be conducted. Our interview with the AER representative allowed us to verify that our project would be highly innovative and beneficial to both our economy and environment.
Professor Rood
In order to address our questions of biosecurity and feasibility, we had an interview with a biology professor at the University of Lethbridge, Dr Stewart Rood. We were told that our project required improvement in the applied design; tailings ponds are massive, and it would be very difficult to extract enough metals from them to make a profit. “My biggest problem with the system is scale,” informed Dr. Rood. As a result, in the final few weeks before the giant Jamboree, we researched other potential real-world applications of our system, in order to discover what it could be most effectively used for. We realized that although our system would not be extremely helpful in remediating tailings ponds samples, it would be beneficial to extract metals for profit from them -- but particularly in mining tailings. Moreover, we re-acknowledged the use of our system"
KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Toulouse_-_-_TEXT.html," equation $\mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical  solver to the right solution.
In our case the $\mathbf{S}$ matrix comes from the in silico E. coli model K-12 MG1665. The model is contained in an XML file.  We told the Toulouse modelers our two reaction of interest:  $$ \text{glutamate} + \text{aKIC} \rightarrow \text{aKG} + \text{Leucine} $$  This reaction is interesting as leucine serves as repellent in our scheme. The second reaction of interest is:  $$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$ This reaction is important because AHL serves as the key to the motility system of cell B. Without AHL, cell B is unable to move away from cell A and form patterns.    Given this information the Toulouse team was able to locate the reactions of interest in the XML model file,  and simulate the cell metabolism. The results are shown in figures 1 and 2. All of the graphs shown above are in $mmol \cdot gDW^{-1} \cdot h^{-1}$. In figure 1 the effect of AHL production on growthrate was plotted and in figure 2 the effect of leucine production. We can also deduce the maximum possible flux of AHL and leucine. This is the flux that corresponds to a growth rate of 0. In our case these maximum values are:
For AHL: $ 150.71391 mmol \cdot gDW^{-1} \cdot h^{-1}$
For leucine: $ 528.17774 mmol \cdot gDW^{-1} \cdot h^{-1}$
Figure 1
AHL and Biomass production. Click to enlarge
Figure 2
Leucine and Biomass production. Click to enlarge
Yet, we are interested in the combined effect of AHL and leucine production on the growth rate. This is why Toulouse also modeled the effect of one biomolecule, but with the constraint that the other biomolecule is produced at maximum rate. The results of these simulations are shown in figures 3 and 4. We see that the production values are way smaller in this simulation. This is logical, since more resources are being used. It is impossible to reach the maximum production rates, while producing two biomolecules.

Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below we summarize the demonstrations corresponding to each subproject.
Introduction
From large scale mycelium growth and modeling, to functionalizing proteins bound to mycelium, our team was able to achieve many of our largest goals for the project. We were also able to coordinate a comprehensive mission architecture that accounts for the harsh and complex task of space travel with mycelium. Below we have demonstrated how we achieved some of our project’s greatest feats.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
In growing mycelium, we were able to grow bricks, plates, and stools in only a number of weeks (Figures 1 and 2). We were also able to grow many of these structures using a variety of interesting substrates, like wood chips, yard waste, and sawdust. We also managed to grow Mycelium on Martian regolith, using supplemental nutrients, an idea we believe is novel. Further, we were able to model the growth rate of mycelium in different conditions in order to determine the optimal growth parameters for mycelium (Figures 3 and 4). This information helped inform us as to how the mycelium would fair in Martian conditions. This turn influenced our mission architecture and the design of the habitat itself (finding ways of providing sufficient heat and moisture, etc).

Solid model
I Introduction
     Spatial factors have a great impact on the results of population interactions. To understand spatial effects better, we develop our discrete probabilistic solid model.
    Concretely, to achieve this goal we designed a fluid model based on Cellular Automaton (CA).
    What is more, we found that it will be much easier to consider spatial factors on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---Solid E.coli War based on our solid model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. Below is a small video of our solid E.coli War.
See more details on Solid E.coli War.
II Our method
    It seems we can use Partial Differential Equation (PDE) directly. However, it will be too complicated to execute PDE fast in program and also difficult for visualization of the changing process, not to say adapting it to our game.
    Therefore, we chose another method as our solid model fundamental: cellular automaton (CA).
    A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each"

The Constructor
Download The Constructor
The registry of standard biological parts is rapidly expanding. Since 2003 more than 15000 BioBrick parts were added by iGEM teams and labs from all over the world, making the life of a synthetic biologist easier and easier with each passing year.
The increase of BioBrick parts – especially of the composite parts – could facilitate fast cloning of the construct of interest. Unfortunately, optimizing your cloning strategy by searching the registry for useful composite parts is laborious and time consuming. Even though the search is time consuming it could be worth doing, since reducing the amount of cloning steps will significantly decrease the amount of time needed for the actual cloning thereby giving you more time for whatever else needs to be done.
That’s why this year’s Wageningen UR team set out to make a program, which automatically creates the most efficient cloning strategy for your construct of interest. The program developed is called “The Constructor” of which the general user interface is seen below.
Mode of action:
The constructor works as follows: for example, you want to create the following hypothetical construct of 1-2-3-4-5-6. A number in this construct represents what we call a functional genetic module (FGM). We classify a FGM as followed: a FGM starts with a promotor and ends with a terminator, the parts in between can vary. For example, the following subparts (R0062-B0034-E1010-B0010-B0012) combined will form a functional genetic module, because it starts with R0063 - which is the lux pL promoter and it ends with B0010-B0012- which is the rrnBT1-T7TE terminator. However, R0062-B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012 would also classify as a FGM, because it still starts with a promoter and ends with a terminator.
The hypothetical construct consists of 6 of these FGM’s. Because each FGM can function on its own due to the promotor and terminator, it doesn’t matter where it is in your construct"

My name is Feifan Xu, a junior student. It is my great honor to become part of iGEM LZU-China 2015. To be honest, I am a diffident guy more or less. So work like electrophoresis PCR or other molecule experiment are quite suitable for me. My primary job is parts construction. Besides that, the measurement of part expression quantity and a little MFC work is also my duty. I like swim in my free time. I love computer games too. After the experiment of the passing year, I find out a truth. The only failure is give up, if you keep fighting, hope is coming.

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Lab#Plants_-_-_TEXT.html," floral dip we'll need to wait approximately 1-2 months for mature CRISPR-Arabidopsis plants to be in a testable             state against the CaMV virus -- not in time to have them tested before the Jamboree. We were able to test our design in other ways, however.
Agroinfiltration Attempt
Agroinfiltration allowed us to induce transient expression of the potential pCAMBIA construct in Arabidopsis leafs. We were able to bring our agroinfiltrated plants to a plant testing facility in London Ontario and expose them to the             CaMV virus. Several days after exposure, we found the agroinfiltrated plant leafs were just as badly infected as he non-modified plant leafs. It was suggested to us that the double-insult of the harsh process of agroinfiltration followed shortly             after by viral exposure (virus is rubbed into the leaf vigorously), it's likely the leaves were simply overwhelmed by the entire process.
Protoplast Cas9 Expression
Protoplasts are plant cells that have had their plant cell walls stripped off of them. They will express any coding sequences downstream of plant-specific promoters that they are transfected by for 16 hours. By transfecting plasmids that have Cas9 coding             sequences downstream of plant specific promoters, we aimed to test whether the Cas9 would successfully express by performing a dot blot with protoplast samples and exposing to an anti-Cas9 antibody.
We used the original AddGene vector we purchased that encoded the plant codon optimized Cas9 under a CaMV constitutive promoter as a positive control (labelled as ""pC""), a GFP-expressing vector as the negative control (labelled as ""-C ""), and our tentative unconfirmed pCAMBIA construct that may contain the AddGene Cas9.
The first image is the dot blot exposure itself, and the second image is a visible light photograph of the same blot.
The third image is a simple viability stain we performed to confirm protoplast health and validate our protocol.
Although we also attempted to perform western blots on the protoplast samples, we didn't get beyond the ponceau stain stage (pictured below).

We gained a lot of helpful advice about running a new igem team. We introduced project to the other, sharing the preparing experience during this summer.
Also, it's our pleasure to share our knowledge in synthetic biology to team HSiTaiwan. Meeting with motivated high school students was really pleasant and nice experience. Thanks for giving us chance to collaborate with them.

Reporter
In order to show when our detector TALEs are bound to DNA, we had to find a suitable reporter component. After careful consideration, we set upon an enzyme/catalyst reporter because preliminary modelling with fluorescent proteins would not provide a strong, sustained output for our intended prototype. Fluorescent proteins would also require a complex prototype to excite the protein with specific wavelengths of light. In order to decrease complexity and cost of our device, we needed to a reporter with a higher output per reporter unit.
Based on conversations with industry and manufacturing criteria, we realized that our reporter would have to meet three pieces of criteria. Firstly, it would require rapid enzyme kinetics so that it could keep pace with production in meat processing plants and feedlots . Secondly, we needed a reporter with a visible colour output so that we could integrate it into a lateral flow prototype interpretable without unwieldy laboratory equipment. Finally, we needed an enzyme which could be manufactured in E. coli that would be durable in the field and cost effective.
Through some of our initial modelling , we compared several enzymes and found horse radish peroxidase.  We realized, however, that horse radish peroxidase could not be expressed in a prokaryotic system. To solve this problem, we decided to use Prussian blue chemically modified ferritin , which could induce similar colour changes in horse radish peroxidase substrates. Additionally, we were intrigued by how Prussian blue ferritin could be used to scaffold multiple detector TALEs to modulate sensitivity of the overall system. Through our literature searches, we also identified β-lactamase as a monomeric reporter which could be readily"

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Build Connections_-_-_TEXT.html," with diverse scientific backgrounds. Some of those present did biology research; others had backgrounds in engineering and computer science. Many of the members of the audience had not studied biology past high school but had strong science and math backgrounds. It was interesting to give a presentation to such an informed and diverse audience. We ended up focusing more on the biomath and engineering aspects of synthetic biology than we had expected because the audience directed their questions to those areas of our work. We learned a lot from the scientists in the audience who offered great interdisciplinary insights on our project. At the end, we administered a short survey to get feedback on the activity. For the open-ended questions, we coded responses post-survey.

Increasing Awareness of iGEM Activities: Meeting with the Boyle Society
On April 29th, members of the Boyle Society visited the William & Mary Bioengineering Lab, home to our iGEM team. The Boyle Society is a charitable giving society that has an impact on the funding for scientific research at our college. Our goals for the event were to present our iGEM project, teach participants about molecular and synthetic biology, and impress upon participants the importance of the scientific research that occurs at William & Mary.
Two groups of 25 participants (50 total) each visited the lab for half an hour. We briefly presented iGEM, our project, synthetic biology, and conducted a strawberry DNA extraction activity.
We received generally positive feedback from the participants; many said they were interested in science research at the College and enjoyed being able to do a hands-on activity with us. From our observations, it seemed that we chose the correct technical level of activity for most of the participants. Although we were working with adults, most participants had little to no science background. This meant that we had to adjust our level of explanation for both the activity and our iGEM project. Most of the participants who gave us feedback said that they did not entirely understand the science behind our research but found it to be interesting.
The outreach event went well as we addressed the three goals that we had set for the event. Since it was the first outreach event hosted by the 2017 team, however, there were some organizational challenges. In response, we created an adapted strawberry DNA extraction protocol based on our experience for what worked and what did not. We also made a checklist for how to prepare for the activity that we used in future outreach projects.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," can produce FT protein, but a big issue still remains:  how they can transport proteins to the outside of the cells? Many people might think cell lysis is the best way.  But in our project lysis is not very good, because it would possibly cause all fairies' deaths. We hoped to see the continuous effect of Flower Fairy E.coli, not just temporary. So, we adopted a method other than lysis which enables E.coli to transport FT protein continuously.
Proteins are required to go through two membranes
Fig.2-1 FT protein have two hurdles in order to get out of the cell
E.coli have two membranes: inner membrane and outer membrane. To transport FT protein to outside of E.coli, FT protein has to pass through the two membranes. So we searched for secretion systems to make FT protein go through these membranes.
TorA signal enables proteins to go through the inner membrane via Tat pathway
Fig.2-2 FT protein with TorA signal go through the inner membrane to the periplasm.
Wild E.coli have many secretion systems. In order to enable proteins to go through inner membrane, we decided to use one of these systems, called Twin Arginate Translocation (Tat) pathway. Tat pathway is more suitable than other secretion systems for our project, because by Tat pathway E.coli secrete proteins into the periplasm keeping proteins’ conformation and function. The following is  the mechanism of Tat pathway; a Tat transporter recognizes TorA signal, and proteins having a TorA signal at their N terminals only can get into the periplasm.
We improved usability of TorA signal BioBrick
We tried to combine TorA signal with FT protein. Searching previous iGEM projects, we actually found TorA signals as iGEM parts (such as BBa_K638402 ) submitted by other teams. These parts, however, have two big problems. One problem is that these parts do not have RBS. So iGEMers who use the parts have to spend additional processing time. The other problem is that stop codon appear between signal region and target coding sequence when these parts are combined with some other parts by standard or 3A assembly. In short, when iGEMers use these parts, TorA-fusion protein would not be expressed at all, or only TorA would be expressed.
To solve these problems, we produced new applicable TorA signal BBa_K797002 (Fig.2-2). Our part has two improvements. BBa_K797002 contains RBS and indels to prevent"

The epigenetic bistable has two main modules: reporter module and compaction module.
Reporter module
Reporter Module contains a GFP inducible expression system, flanked by tetR operator sequences. This module will be integrated and expressed from various regions of the S. pombe genome with different heterochromatin contexts, to test it effect on silencing. We expect that once the protein Sir3, Swi6 or CSD binds the targeting tetR operator sequences they will induce the compaction of the promoter, or at least, prevent its leaky activation, because of the spreading of the engineered silencing proteins and it cooperativity. Additionally, there have been introduce two boundaries or chromatin insulators each site of our system. They are transcriptional terminator that  act as neutral transcriptionally elements that prevent negative or positive influence from extending across chromatin to a promoter ( Fourel et al, 2001 ; Bushey et al, 2008 ; Bähler et al, 1998 ; Watt et al, 2008 ).

It is composed by nmt1 (no message in thiamine) repressible promoter, three alternative proteins (Sir3p, Swi6 and the Chromo-Shadow Domain of Swi6 “CSD” ( Cowieson et al, 2000 ; Haldar et al, 2011 ), fused to the Tetracycline Repressor protein"

OVERVIEW
The way we live today has been deeply revolutionized through rapid developments of low-cost drugs, novel chemicals and clean energies by various newly engineered microorganisms. However, the problem of high risks of potential ecological contamination and accidental commercial loss continues threatening the scientists, industrialists and the public as synthetic biology makes progress. Can the important strains be genetically locked up in the molecular level even when their physical lock boxes are broken up? The 2014 project of BIT-China, E.co-Lock mimicking the electronic combination lock, focused on the bio-security and bio-economy of all engineered microorganisms, is novelly designed to meet this challenge.
Layered AND Gates, sRNA regulatory System and Min System are the three main parts to build up the E.co-Lock. The layered logic AND gates are constructed and connected to realize different combinations of ""the password"" - here three different inducers. The sRNA regulation system is then implemented to control the order of the ""password"" by inhibiting the mRNAs built in the layered AND gates, thus to precisely mimic the password of a real digital lock. Currently, a three-inducer-password is built up and ideally in the future, many more layers of AND gates containing new inducers with newly synthesized sRNAs could be added up to increase the complexity of the password.Finally, Min system, representing a cell division inhibiting system, is re-designed to maintain industrial strains to an extremely low density given an initial locked state. In the future, other similar systems can be introduced to replace Min system to fulfill this function of inhibiting cell division. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under much more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.
Thus, when genetically locked up with E.co-Lock, important industrial strains or dangerous strains will be under better protection from suffering loss, even at the occasions of unexpected leaking out or stolen, only when right password is put in, when suitable inducers are added in set order, strains can multiply properly. Much better safety of microorganism can be achieved both ecologically and commercially.
BACKGROUND
Synthetic biology is a real interdisciplinary ﬁeld, involving chemists, biologists, engineers, physicists or computer scientists [1]. As an emerging discipline, synthetic biology really brought us a lots of challenges and opportunities. However, plenty of problems also occurred in society.
The biggest problems are biosecurity and biosafety.

Enzyme kinetics for potential reporter proteins
In the beginning of the project we were looking for a reporter system. The wet lab team has made a list of possible reporters that can be used in vitro. We wanted to ensure that the reporter system gave us a rapid output, was stable and did not require cellular machinery to work. We wanted to test this in silico before we tested it in the wetlab. We wanted to ensure there was concrete evidence to support our choice of one reporter enzyme over another. Given that it is much easier to do simulations using models than to do experiments in the lab, we simulated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and beta-galactosidase which are one of the most rapid reporters known in the literature. We programmed differential equations modelling enzyme kinetics in Mathematica to produce a interactive plot of output over time, with parameters such as initial enzyme concentration and initial substrate concentration being the parameters that can be adjusted.
Two screen shots of the interactive models are attached here (see Figures 1 and 2). By changing the sliders, the corresponding parameters will change, whose response is plotted in blue. By comparing to the red curve, which is plotted with those adjustable parameters held at fixed values, we can immediately see the effect of those parameters, such that a range of combination of the parameters can be considered for the evaluation of the reporters. To see the functional interactive models, click here .

Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
Placed  10mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution and 2.4g CMC powder into two different  200mL beakers. Prepared 100mL 1% w/v sodium alginate solution .
Sterilized  the two beakers (contained CaCl2 solution and CMC powder  respectively) and the alginate solution in an autoclave at 120kPa and 121℃for 20 min.
After  autoclaving, dissolved the CMC powder with 10mL distilled water and mixed  with 10mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution.
Mixed  1.5mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution and 1.5mL CMC solution with 0.6mL cell suspension,  then dropped the mixture into vortical sodium alginate solution. 
Results:  The droplets also couldn't be a normal sphere. However, when the mixture of the  same ratio was dropped into 1% w/v alginate solution without autoclaving, the  droplets could form round and transparent capsules.  Even the same  cationic solution with autoclaving still could produce normal  spherical capsules. Therefore, we judged that autoclaving had a  significant impact on sodium alginate solution. The alginate solution through  autoclaving became pale yellow and its viscosity decreased.

Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," Mechanism of fluorescent proteins
Luciferase
Luciferase is a popular choice as a reporter for gene expression because functional enzyme is created immediately upon translation and the assay is rapid, reliable and easy to perform. [1,2] The fluorescent output of luciferase gene is due to the chemical reaction between luciferase and corresponding substrate, which can be easily detected by the luminoskan microplate reader.
We used firefly luciferase(Fluc) gene purchased from Promega and NanoLuc luciferase(Nluc)  gene submitted by Team Tuebingen 2015 as another two reporters for our KaiABC system.

How did we design our measurement plan?
When reconstructed in Escherichia coli, KaiABC oscillator showed a periodicity of 24 hours [3] . To best verify our system can function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we planned to measure our system using different reporter at 3-hour intervals for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days respectively.
As for the measurement of fluorescent proteins, we not only used the common detecting instrument, fourescence spectrophotometer, but also make an attempt to record the fluorescent variation via the cutting-edge Leica DMi8 inverted microscope.
Another thing worth mentioning is that, we bought all of the luciferase assay system from company Promega, among them there was a new kind of NanoLuc luciferase system----Nano-Glo® Live Cell Assay System, which allows experimenters to detect live cell luminescent signals without lytic process, suitable for the 3-day assay. Despite there is no reference indicating that this product, a commonly used assay system in mammalian cells, could be used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we decided to take a try and have successfully proved its validity. Consequently, we chose Nluc solely to complete our long time luminescent detection .

PCR done of 4 colonies picked from KAN plate (with ECNR2 after recombineering with the KAN-ZFB-wp construct. Running an E-gel showed that the insert was not present. Since the KAN plates were old, it might be speculated that the plates were old, and so, the colonies were not selected for KAN resistance.
Primers were TolC_seq_F and TolC_seq_R.
Without insertion these two primers will create 449 bp sequence, and with insertion length will be 1650 bp
TolC insert check 1 7/14/11
Some of the original culture after recombineering, 1ml solution spun down, and resuspended in 100μl of LB, and plated on new KAN plates. To check, one of the old KAN plates was plated the same way and put in at 2:30pm. (These plates will be checked tomorrow morning.)
PCR done of a few of the rpoZ MAGE with stop codon insertions. Oligo name: rpoZ_MAGE_KO (Noah's oligo) (Noah's plates, after two cycles of MAGE, on both ECNR2 and ECNR2ΔTolC). The side product in the gel could be due to a low annealing temperature of 53°C, so we should do a gradient PCR (e.g.55-66°C) to get the most product the next time.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Design#_-_-_TEXT.html," with modified E. coli.
Design 4
A meeting with Dr Mike Allen from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory introduced us to the concept of Swirl Flow Bioreactors (SFB), which would allow us to mix the perchlorate with the E. coli as well as separating the oxygen, all in one chamber. We took the design of a typical swirl flow and adapted it to fit our needs of having immobilized E. coli and a cathode.
Design 5
In a second meeting with Dr Mike Allen, he also told us valuable information about how our bioreactor would be received within global markets. He informed us of his experience with selling and developing his own bioreactor, and from that, he advised that we focus more on the Mars travel side of the the bioreactor as there wasn’t much room in the market for a bioreactor on Earth.
During this meeting, we decided to remove the cathode from our design as it would provide the opportunity for unexpected chemistry, as well as sparks which would react badly with the oxygen we are producing.  This allowed our bioreactor design to simplify significantly and we started making quick progress.
Design 6
Our first SFB without cathodes involved four chambers, one to mix the regolith with water to extract the perchlorate, and three to consecutively reduce the perchlorate into oxygen until none is left.
Design 7
With a solid base, we began to tweak the design based on the needs of stakeholders.
3D printable to be made on Mars, and anything that couldn’t had to be light and easy to carry on a rocket.
Low power consumption in order not to drain the resources of the rest of the biodome.
Shielded from ionising radiation which would affect the E. coli. This shielding also needs to be light enough to take to Mars.
There must be a way to kill the bacteria in the bioreactor in the case of unwanted mutations or other unforeseen events.
Design 8
Our first remodel of the SFB involved cutting down the number of chambers requiring propellers in order to reduce the power consumption and resources needed.

Bio-Chess
iGEM Day ‘Gene Go’
1st iGEM Festival in UESTC
Overview
For the public, the biggest problem of promoting iGEM and synthetic biology is that they never heard of it before and it’s not an easily-understandable field for the public. To promote us in a more interesting and efficient way, we divided the public into 3 groups—Public, Children and Pre-iGEMers (High school students and Undergraduates). We have different positions for each of the groups and adapted different methods to let people all engage in synthetic biology and iGEM.
Public—Engage while playing （Bio-Chess）
Children—Stimulating interests (iGEM Day)
Pre-iGEMers—Propaganda (1st iGEM Festival in UESTC)
Bio-Chess
Design
People spend more and more leisure time on the game, including physical games and online games. We believe that if we can implant scientific knowledge and ideas in the game, people can learn the knowledge of the fields that they may not access in daily life while playing the game. This is more effective than letting people read those boring professional books.
To promote synthetic biology, we designed a board game named Bio-Chess, and produced it both in physical and PC version. It is inspired by the well-known game Monopoly and flying chess. We integrate the idea of genetic engineering into the game, combining this game with synthetic biology knowledge, making players familiar with the process of genetic engineering while experiencing the game.Let us have fun in Bio-Chess!
Game rules
The process of Bio-Chess is actually a simple genetic modification process. First, player moves to the appropriate position according to the points of the dice they rolled, collecting endonuclease and DNA Ligase and Learning PCR technology. After owning the corresponding materials and techniques, player sequentially goes to the laboratory to extract the target gene, the Research Institute to construct the expression vector, the Processing Plant to introduce the target gene into"

●
Started 500 mL liquid culture of CP
Tuesday, 8/23
●
The plates from the transformation yesterday do not have much growth at the 1:40 dilution they were plated at. We put them into the incubator longer to see if they would show growth over a longer time. 6 of the plates grew colonies and we will grow liquid cultures from these and perform a colony PCR. The other 6 plates did not have colony growth but the plates were bubbly so we think it may just be hard to see the growth. The SOC transformation from yesterday were placed into the incubator this morning and then moved to room temperature in case we need to replate some of our transformations. 7 of the plates showed colonies after extra incubation and we started liquid cultures from them and also run a colony PCR from them. 5 of the plates did not grow and will be replated in a 1:4 dilution to hopefully see growth tomorrow. The following 5 colors were replated:
○
PP
○
SO
○
TP
○
VV
○
MP
●
After we ran the colony PCR we ran a gel on the product to see where the bands were and to hopefully confirm we did our Gibson and transformation correctly
●
The gel showed the correct size for the colony PCR we ran which confirms we had performed looks like the Gibson and transformation were done correctly
●
We spun down the cultures we started yesterday from the DNA 2.0 chromoproteins and saw color in most of the cultures. The following cultures showed cell growth but did not show color:
○
VV
○
TP
○
MP
○
SP
○
DM
●
Both SO and LO are expected to be orange in color and it is hard to tell wether or not they worked or did not show color.
●
The remaining 7 cultures that showed color and the 5 that didn't we took about 20 ul of the pellet and placed into a PCR tube to perform heat testing on. We also placed 1 uL of .134 M EDTA into each PCR tube. The heat testing was done in the thermal cycler by putting the PCR tubes in for 30 minutes at 55 °C and increasing the temperature 5"

The HumHub Platform, a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams!!! Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
→ Why does iGEM need digital platforms for collaboration?
As iGEM grows in size and projects become more complicated, digital platforms for collaboration present a possibility for teams to work on challenges together, and for members of teams to collaborate on projects while not in the lab. Today, many iGEM teams use different established platforms to solve these needs. The communication between the different teams is complicated

To storage information in computers, we use flip-flops, an electronic device that switches between two different states, called 0 and 1. The core of our project is the development of molecular systems that reproduce an electronic flip-flop, allowing the construction of living memory devices closer to the robustness of informatics.
This project’s idea comes from last year’s experience in the contest. Various iGEM teams have based their work on the construction of flip-flop biological systems, in previous editions of the competition. However, positive results have been more difficult to achieve than expected. UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular running.
In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick standard sequences and their inclusion in the Parts’ Registry.

8. 700 µL of DNA Wash Buffer was added to each Hi-Bind column and the vacuumed through the column.
9. Step 8 was repeated.
10. The Hi-Bind columns were then put in the centrifuge with a collection tube and allowed to dry spin in order to remove any residual Wash Buffer.
11. The Hi-Bind column was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube.
12. 20 µL of autoclaved water was added to the center of the Hi-Bind column and allowed to sit for one.
13.  The tube was centrifuged at high speed for 1 minute.

Restriction Digest
Purpose: Digestion takes advantage of naturally occurring sequences in order to cleave DNA at specific sections. This is often utilized to isolate specific fragments of a plasmid so that new genetic material can be introduced.  Restriction sites are usually a six nucleotide sequence and it is important to choose restriction sites that are unique to the vector if cloning is being attempted; otherwise, it is possible that the plasmid will cut in multiple locations. Restriction enzymes can also be used to check and see if plasmid has the desired genes in it by choosing a enzyme that will produce multiple DNA fragments and then running it through gel electrophoresis to see if the experimental bands match the desired lengths of DNA.
Procedure:
1. The necessary restriction enzymes were identified by using ApE.
2. The following solutions were added to a PCR tube, adding the restriction enzymes last.
10x Appropriate Buffer - 5 µL
PCR Product - 2 µg
Restriction Enzyme 1 - 1µL
Restriction Enzyme 2 - 1 µL
ddH2O - to 50 µL
*The buffer may change based on the restriction enzymes that were being used. The Double Digest Finder was used from the New England BioLabs website. https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/interactive-tools/double-digest-finder.
3. The Double Digest Finder was used to determine the temperature at which the digestion would take place.

Screening Experiments
Two different experiments were conducted to investigate (1) the optimal anhydrotetracylcine level for inducing expression of bioplastic genes and (2) Nile Red as a screening technique for polymer production. To determine the optimal anydrotetracycline levels for phaCAB and cat2 gene expression, agar plates were prepared with 0, 5, 50, 150, and 200 ng/ml of anyhdrotetracyline, and Construct 7 E. coli were grown on them overnight at 37°C. The number of colonies on each plate was then compared the following day. To test Nile Red as a screening technique to detect PHA production, agar plates were prepared with various levels of Nile Red (0, 0.2, 0.5,1.0 μg/ml). Bacteria that were known to produce PHA (positive control) and negative control bacteria were then plated and grown overnight at 37°C. After sitting on the benchtop for a few days, they were examined under equal levels of UV lighting.

Polymer harvesting
To obtain in vivo PHA polymer, E. coli containing the desired construct were grown in 3 mL of LB broth overnight, of which 1 mL was then cultured in 50 mL of LB broth and grown at 30oC until the cells reached an optical density of .7 A (600 nm). Glucose was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the cells were harvested after 48 hour of incubation at 37°C. To harvest, the cells were centrifuged at 3500 rpm and suspended in saline (0.0067 M phosphate buffer) solution. The cells were re-centrifuged to obtain a washed pellet, freezethawed in dry ice, and then freeze-dried by lyophilization. The pellet was shaken overnight at 37°C in chloroform, after which bacterial cell waste was filtered out using Whatman paper and a vacuum flask. The polymer was then precipitated from the filtered solution by adding 10 volumes of ethanol, centrifuged,"

    Similar results of other 2 AHL pairs can be obtained by similar analysis.
    However, we do not need to be so frustrated, since we can determine part of two warriors that satisfy our needs of warrior as follows (Fig. 5) and then our model can tell us how to improve this gene circuit based on this circuit. ( Improved gene circuit )
Fig. 5 Gene circuit designed from Orthogonality test results. From experiment results, we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior I, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by itself, and we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I
     What's more, because we use RFP to indicate level of killing effect of warriors inside cell during orthogonality test, we are not sure about if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit (namely, if this indication is reasonable), so we have Killing test to verify it.
Note: The needs about warrior can be decomposed to four parts:
(1)Warrior I can be killed by warrior II
(2)Warrior I cannot be killed by itself
(3)Warrior II can be killed by warrior I
(4)Warrior II cannot be killed by itself
    We can just satisfy 3 of these needs now, like the circuit mentioned in Fig. 5. In other words, the best design we can achieve now is to construct one warrior that can be only killed by the other . Of course, the circuit in Fig. 5 is not unique for us to achieve 3 of these needs. However, it can already satisfy our needs to verify the credibility of Orthogonality test in killing test and give a better gene circuit. Therefore, during our project, we use it when we mentioned these two needs, not the other circuit.

OUR PROJECT TITLE
Project Description
The development of synthetic biology aroused the concerns of biosafety problems due to the great editing and recreation of genome, resulting in the difficulty predicting the behavior of synthetic organism. Accidental spreading of synthetic organism may pose a threat to our environment. In the past few years, several iGEM teams has discussed and reported the need               for a standard safety cassette for synthetic biology. Our teammates viewed this as an important issue. Some past teams also focused on this topic, such as xx using DNase e.t.c. We would like to design a better circuit, which is highly regulated and cheaper control to suit the goal.
This summer we investigated the innate function of CRISPR Cas systems in prokaryotes and               tried to apply its cleavage for the purpose of biosafety. In our project we design and engineer a               biological circuit called killing switch, which can perform destruction of DNA when the genetic               modified organisms leave the required conditions, and then transfer the system into ''E. coli''.

The BU Team came up with a schematic, and outline as to how the assay would work.
The only part necessary after the assay was scaled down would be a device that could read absorbance of microliters of volumes. A new device could be developed to do this or the assay could be sent into a 384 well plate instead of a 96 well plate to be read on a plate reader with the capacity to read a 384 well plate. For more information about the microfluidics chip please see BU’s Hardware Page."

E.colipse is able to detect UV light and also can distinguish between different UV intensities. As a UV sensor we incorporate the photosensor UVR8 isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana , which uniquely absorbs in the range of UV-B light. To be able to ""calculate"" the different intensities, we use a second photoreceptor LovTap  which absorbs in the range of blue light.

The synthesis pathway of 3-hydroxybutyrate is shown below.
○ Shikimic acid[Expand]
Shikimic acid is a highly functionalised, six-carbon ring with three chiral carbons and a carboxylic acid functional group [24]. Shikimic acid pathway exists naturally in microorganisms and therefore they can be employed to overproduce this acid from carbon sources such as glucose. The Shikimic acid pathway is shown below(Fig.3).
Fig.3 Shikimic acid pathway
○ Results
There are many kinds of acid in our acid synthesis parts, we don’t have enough time to test them one by one. So we chose gene LdhA, a gene coding L-lactate dehydrogenase and product L-lactic acid, as our model gene to test in our whole system.
To verified the LdhA gene, we constructed our gene into pET28a (Fig.4,5), and induced its over-expression by IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside) under 16 ℃ in BL21(DE)3.
Fig.4 The plasmid pET28a and gene LdhA
Fig.5 The constructed result of LdhA-pET28a
Meanwhile, we put glucose as the substrate of glycolysis (40% glucose solution, add 2ml to 48ml culture solution). After 12 hours fermentation, we measured the pH of the culture fluid. We use the pET28a(BL21(DE3)) as the control. We repeated this process three times and our result is shown in Table.1.

By announcing the tool “Biobrick Search” in August (See “ Community Page ”), it was used by a lot of teams, such as team UT-Tokyo from which we received feedback.
For example, since their team's main project is similar to team Tokyo-Tech's 2011 one, they've"

I plan on miniprepping the samples and then checking them on the gel.  In the meantime, I did another round of ligations using a different RBS, J61101.  We ran out of ampicillin plates, so only J61101+BFP+Term and J61101+RFP+Term were transformed and plated.
8/2:  This morning I ran a gel of my RBS (J61100) +_FP's+term uncut plasmids to check their size.  Ideally, RBS+GFP+Term should be ~3441 bp, RBS+RFP+Term ~2911 bp, and RBS+BFP+Term ~2940 bp.

On the gel, they seem to be the right base pair length.  To further confirm that the plasmids are the correct construct, I am starting a method of restriction mapping.  This technique is essentially doing a restriction digest and confirm the size of the insert that should be seen.  In this case, I am cutting with XbaI and PstI because I can then use the insert for ligation with a promoter.  I used our normal RD protocol.
8/3:  This morning, I prepped samples for the QIAcube to run a miniprep protocol of our overnight cultures.  Also, I set up a gel to run for my restriction mapping samples for J61100 + G/R/B_FP+term as well as my new RBS, J61101,+ R/B_FP +term constructs.

We are strongly inspired by the already established academic tradition of peer-reviewing to be taking place, as we estimate it to be the strongest means of verifying scientific research and its solutions.
We, in order to exclude financial motive, invite for more solutions that is suitable and safe and follow the World health organization guidelines on blood products and in-vitro diagnostics: biological standardization, before being put on the market [7].
Given the under-researched topic of snake venoms and their diagnostics, we see the academia as welcome opportunity to research further into this topic. This will enable for better and more well-founded solutions.
As funding these kind of incentives has been  a major point in our feedback from industry and academia, we have further dedicated a section under integrated Human practice
Faulty tests
Diagnosing diseases is never going to be perfect, and our device is no different. It will create false negatives and false positives, although we hope to keep these at a minimum. If our device is to be implemented in medical procedures, we would want a period of time by which the patient should be under observation by a doctor in the case of a negative test to prevent unnecessary deaths. On the subject of false positives we do not see any treatment alternatives, since time is off the essence when dealing with snake envenomings, postponing treatment to be 100% certain would likely cost more lives than it would save. It’s important to point out that our diagnostic device should be seen as a supplement along the overall clinical picture, but not as an all encompassing replacement for the current medical procedures for snake envenomings.
In addition, these tests should not be solely relied upon, as there is a chance of false negative results which can potentially lead to deaths.
Given the imperfection and need of further development, we hope our project will serve as means for the following: catalyst further innovation. Appetize support from major partners to see and opportunity to contribute further. We hope that then lead fates as it was the case with eradicating influenza as a major cause of death, which was a major priority US army [8].
