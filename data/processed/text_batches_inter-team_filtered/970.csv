Mass spectrometry
Cell preparation
For analysis by mass spectrometry, 3 ml of LB media containing chloramphenicol (1 micromolar) was inoculated with transformed bacterial cells (expression of the NRPS tested before by SDS-PAGE). Cultures were incubated at 37°C overnight until OD600 ~ 0.6. After centrifugation for 30 minutes at 3750 rpm and 4°C, supernatant was discarded and pellet washed with M9 minimal media. Again samples were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 ml M9 minimal media. Following an incubation time of 12 hours (OD600=0.6) cells were induced with IPTG (1 mM).
To assess product levels over time, 7.5 ml samples were taken at several time points (8.5 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 48 hrs). Each sample was spun down for 45 minutes at 3750 rpm and 4°C, and supernatant was separated from pellet.
Pellet was resolubilzed in 500 µl 1x PBS and lysed by ultra-sonification (3x20 seconds; on ice). Finally the sample has been centrifuged and supernatant decanted to 1.5 ml tubes. Frozen with nitrogen the sample was handed over for mass spectrometry.
Supernatant was frozen with nitrogen and lyophilized for 12 hours ( at ~-45°C and ~0,1 mbar) to remove liquid residues. The lyophilisate was resuspended in 500 microliters methanol and vortexed. Supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube, which was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sample was then handed over to mass spectrometry for further analysis.
Data Acquisition
Sampling
Two empty 3.2 mm die-cut sheets were prepared from Whatman 903 filter paper. Afterwards, 5 µl of the sample were pipetted on the sheets and dried in the fridge overnight.

Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Lab#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.
Please use this page to answer the safety questions posed on the safety page .

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#project description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ed strongyles react to a signaling compound. To find possible candidates for this compound a strategy is employed in which samples of infested host tissue are run through a battery of tests, and occurence of compounds is compared to a control of healthy tissue.
In our project we hope to perform studies to locate and identify this molecule. Since deworming drugs have no effect on encysted worms and killing of the relatively few grownups would induce cyst bursting, it would be important to figure out what the signaling molecule is for further study.
Modelling
Grass Sampling
Methods for detecting a strongyle infected field do exist, but they’re both tedious and time consuming. Our aim is to build reproducible and reliable models based on real world behaviour to reduce the area needed to sample. These models are based on the location and expected movement of the strongyles once outside of the horse.
Economic Modelling
A good model is a great tool to study the simplified behaviour of a real world problem. Often it can be more practical, time- and cost efficient to study the model of the real world system. We aim to showing the economic impact of strongyles and anthelmintic resistance.
In order to truly understand the expected market, cost and reach, we are opting for a predicting market analysis.
Global Worming and Society
Integrated Human practice
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will at least will contribute to the solution, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Raising Awareness
We’re attacking several angles to raise awareness for our project.  We plan to perform a market analysis of the problem, send questionnaires out to better judge the severity of the problem and to participate in local radio shows. We’ve even been published in a local magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
As our team is partly international we will try to spread the questionnaire to other countries besides Sweden, in hope of getting results reflecting the extent of the issue of strongyles on a bigger scale.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [19]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields"

This might have been because IPTG was added 3 hours after initial incubation whereas IPTG was added 4 hours after initial incubation for 9-mer cells. This hour would be significant since E-coli population doubles every 20 minutes. A cell pellet was not seen possibly because the cells were still pretty dilute in the LB growth medium, and the 1mL sample was extracted near the surface of the liquid. (Although a shaking incubator vigorously shakes the entire contents of the flask, a higher concentration of cells would most likely be found near the bottom of the flask.) Also, it's possible that a 12-mer protein, which by definition is three monomer units longer than a 9-mer, requires more time for the cells to assemble and replicate. We will consult the Silk Genetics team on this, and it will be interesting to see if these observations reappear when preparing the 15-mer proteins next week."

These included proline-leucine (pro-leu), N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine (CBZ-leu), and N-methoxycarbonyl-leucine (N-moc-leu). Pro-leu and CBZ-leu were our first two choices, and N-moc-leu was added as an option after pro-leu was discounted for reasons mentioned below. Two experiments were conducted to determine whether the three protecting groups were appropriate for our purposes.
The first experiment was an uptake test to determine if the cell is able to take up protected leucine from the environment. XL1-Blue strain E. coli cells were incubated in Luria Broth (LB) containing leucine, pro-leu, or CBZ-leu for 24 hours. The cells were washed and lysed, and the purified lysate was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine if the protected leucine was uptaken into the cell.
2mM, 1.5mM, 1mM, 500uM, and 200uM standards of leucine, pro-leu, and CBZ-leu were made in 0.1% formic acid. LC-MS conditions were as follows:
Wavelength = Diode Array (Many wavelengths)
Flow rate = 0.3 mL/min (between 0.2 mL/min and 0.4 mL/min)
Column temperature: 30° C
Injection volume: 10 μL
Isocratic elution using 35% acetonitrile and 65% aqueous (0.1% v/v formic acid) solution for 15 minutes & wash the column with 80% acetonitrile
Figure 1 shows the LC-MS identifying peaks for each standard.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Using the interaction between Phytochrome B and PIF6 they designed an optogenetic switch for enabling and disabling transcription of a chosen gene. It is based on the tetracycline operon and the transcription factor VP16. The tetO operator is located upstream of a minimal promoter which in turn is located upstream of the gene of interest. The tetR repressor binds to the tetO sequence. Fused to it is PIF6. Phytochrome B is fused to the transcription factor VP16. Upon illumination with red light, Phytochrome binds to the tetR-PIF6 complex. VP16 is now located in close proximity to the minimal promoter, which enables the RNA-polymerase-2 to start transcription of the gene of interest.  We designed a promoter part for the Dueber toolbox which consists of tetO and the minimal promoter region. This can be used as a promoter in a Lv1-ligation for any desired gene of interest (a GFP-tagged Pex11 in our example).

All knowledge is connected to all other knowledge.
The fun is in making the connections.
It is important for a scientist to know how to simply and clearly explain his knowledge in order to share it with everyone. Our team works on several projects to accomplish this goal. First, we met primary school and highschool students to explain them some science notions. We also worked with the popularization website ""Parlons peu, parlons Science"". Moreover, there are many things that we still don't know in synthetic biology, that's why it is important to pay attention to scientific meetings for going there in order to learn more about it.
Parlons peu, parlons Science!
Science is governed by the laws of physics and mathematics, often calling on theorems, demonstrations, and experimental data. Omnipresent, science is used to describe nature, to demystify biological processes, or even to solve problems of daily life.
Some might say science is not accessible to all. We do not agree. Indeed, it is difficult to understand all current scientific knowledge, especially when it is presented in books aimed at PhD students, experts, or researchers. But every scientific notion can be understood if it is explained in simple terms: this is called scientific popularization.
Parlons peu parlons science or #3PS is a free website where many scientific topics are published on differents supports: articles, videos, drawings, photos, podcasts and even songs! To add more contents, everyone (beginner or expert) can write what he wants in order to share with all their scientific knowledge. It enabled us to carry out scientific popularization in the fields of biology and biotechnology.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme was determined spectrophotometrically as a decay of absorbance at 310 nm at different starting substrate nucleotide concentrations. The graph shows the average values of three independent experiments.
Before starting the experiments with this chosen enzyme, a kinetics assay was first carried out. Spectrophotometric kinetic data based on decay of absorbance at 310 nm due to substrate nucleotide catalytic conversion was gathered using a range of starting substrate nucleotide concentrations. The Michaelis Menten curve for the CAT-Seq esterase was plotted using the acquired data. Data shown in figure 2, show perfect fit (R2 = 0.9449) to a standard Michaelis Menten curve. Next, Michaelis Menten plot transformations were performed in order to verify the Km and Vmax of the CAT-Seq enzyme. 3 Fig., display Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Woolf transformation plot. Both plots show great correlation (R2 > 0.7) to the linear function. Based on the equation koeficients in the Hanes-Woolf transformation, the experimentally determined Vmax value is 17.2 µM/min, Km value is 86 µM.

Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Woolf transformations for Michaelis Menten curve generated earlier. Both of the transformations were performed on data acquired from 3 independent experiments. Graphs show the fitted linear function and its correlation coefficient.
CAT-Seq library preparation employs PCR amplification for the addition of adapter sequences to 5’ and 3’ ends of DNA templates. 5’ adapters house T7 promoter and RBS (or any other regulatory sequence). Both adapters can be barcoded and include the restriction site, used to circulate the DNA.

KIT-Kyoto,2012,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," supervisors and instructors fully support the work done by this iGEM team.
Q.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A. We have two suggestions.
Firstly, to understand how ethical a project is and how safe equipments are, we should make Bio-safety Quiz, and the iGEM teams cannot get description kit until they complete the quiz.
Secondly, we should supply check list template of Bio-safety in wiki, and each iGEM team should fill out the check list on their experiment notebooks as a template and check it at the beginning and ending of the diary experiments.
Lecture class about experiments of genetic engineering
We took a lecture class about genetic engineering because we conduct experiments involving recombinant DNA technic for our project of iGEM. We learned its guidelines and laws received an instruction.

Penn_State,2012,Team:Penn State#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html," information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein codeine sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?

Following the binding of primers, the temperature is      increased to about 72 °C for the DNA polymerase to synthesizes      a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by      adding dNTPs that are complementary to the template in 5' to 3'      direction.

Gene synthesis - physically creating artificial gene sequences     (de novo DNA synthesis)
For over 60 years, the synthetic production of new DNA sequences     has helped researchers understand and engineer biology. Gene     synthesis is also accelerating research in well-established     research fields by providing critical advantages over more laborious     traditional molecular cloning techniques. De novo DNA synthesis     involves the chemical synthesis of relatively short but specific     fragments of nucleic acids. Chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does     not have the limitation of unidirectional nucleotide addition (5’     to 3’), as compared to the naturally occurring DNA synthesis and     PCR. To obtain the desired oligonucleotide, loose nucleotides are     sequentially added to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the     required sequence. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are     single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules.
The synthesis starts with a non-nucleosidic linker being     attached to a solid support material. The oligonucleotide sequence     remains covalently bound to the support material over the entire     course of the chain assembly via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group. The     chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which     the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic     cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal     nucleotide residue to the universal linker.
Synthetic genes offer several advantages over cloned native DNA.     These sequences are subjected to stringent quality checks to match     100% sequence verification by the private companies involved in     synthesis of synthetic DNA. Moreover, artificial DNA synthesis     allows the flexibility to researchers for changing enzyme     specificities and activities to suit the needs of their     experiments. Also, synthesis of specific sequences allows the     insertion of localization signals to target specific     protein/nucleic acid in vivo.

Details of our promoter: pBAD Strong
We decided to utilise the pBAD strong promoter ( K206000 ), which was created by the British Columbia iGEM 2009 team as a mutagenized form of the naturally occurring pBAD promoter.  The modelling was based upon and used references pertaining to the pBAD promoter, also known as the 'ara operon'. pBAD and pBAD strong are both arabinose-inducible promoters.
In the absence and presence of arabinose, the pBAD promoter acts as a repressor and an inducer respectively.  The gene products of pBAD in Escherichia coli allow the cells to take up and catabolize L-arabinose, a five-carbon sugar.  pBAD’s very basic structure is depicted below:
Figure 1: A basic structural outline of the pBAD and, adjacent, AraC protein, in the absence of arabinose. (Schleif, 2011)
The three enzymes that comprise the pBAD promoter cause the catabolism of the sugar arabinose as follows:
araA – arabinose isomerase which converts arabinose to ribulose
araB – ribulokinase which phosphorylates ribulose
araD – ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase which converts ribulose-5-phosphate which can then be metabolised via the pentose phosphate pathway (Patel, GU)
Adjacent to the three pBAD structural genes is the AraC regulatory gene. The dimeric (the compound comprises of two structurally similar subunits called monomers which together make a dimer) AraC protein actively represses transcription as well as the synthesis of the pBAD genes; this occurs when arabinose is not present in the environment.  The AraC protein binds to the half sites araO2 and ara I1 which creates a loop within the DNA, thus blocking the RNA polymerase"

Ethics Discussion
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.
▲
Getting started: Meeting with an ethicist
To examine the ethical implications of our iGEM project, we contacted Dr. Lily Frank .                         She is an assistant professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of                         Technology and is specialized in Biomedical Ethics. With Lily we discussed the                         potential benefits and dangers of synthetic biology, and she pointed us at some                         of the most controversial issues related to synthetic biology. For instance,                         Lily strongly recommended us not to choose an application which must be tested in developing                         countries. Instead, we should test our product close to home where the required                         infrastructure for safe testing is available. Furthermore, we learned that the                         relative novelty of synthetic biology  as a field combined with slow politics                         complicates risk assessment, as many of the potential benefits and risks are still                         uncertain or have been ignored.
Ethical frameworks
Lily was so kind to suggest some ethical frameworks to get started with our ethical discussion. She particularly recommended frameworks resulting from the European project SYNBIOSAFE (2009) and from work performed by the US Presidential Commission on Bioethics in 2010 (1) . As"

Tsinghua,2010,Team:Tsinghua#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,"Then we iGEM team members and all the other participants had a heat discussion, mainly emphasize on the public health and safety of products from synthetic biology. Opinions are divided on this issue. Some people think that food or medicine yielded by bacteria is safe or usable if they can pass the series of tests. Others are against this idea for we cannot well control the metabolism products of bacteria, more complicated than we think. On the other hand, we find the fact that diverse education backgrounds are somehow relative to the opinions held by them. Most people who have little knowledge of biology and microorganism are just reluctant to use products from synthetic biology, due to the uncomfortable feeling about bacteria. However, students from school of life science pay more attention to the biological function and the clinical assay result of the products. Another interesting issue we discuss about is the name of the bacteria we use. Because the Chinese name of E.coli usually leaves bad impression on the public, ordinary people may prefer products from Lactobacillus than those from E.coli. The name may be more important and impressive than function to some degree in public eyes. That’s a rather interesting phenomenon.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"INDY Seq, to achieve a full proof of principle. First tests revealed that polyU/spermine coacervates form in the reaction buffer of Cas13a (40 mM Tris-HCl, 60 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3), but as said, Cas13a does not show activity in presence of 1.0 wt% spermine. Therefore, the experiment was separated into two parts. First, Cas13a with and without target and crRNA was incubated with polyU for varying amounts of time, and subsequently spermine was added to a final concentration of 1.0 wt%. It was observed that after 60 minutes of incubation and subsequent spermine addition, no coacervates were formed in the tube containing activated Cas13a. On the other hand, if spermine was added to the tube with inactive Cas13a, coacervates did form (see Figure 23).
We can conclude that it is possible to prove the presence or absence of a certain RNA target with the naked eye using the CINDY Seq method. This conclusion can be drawn after at least 45 minutes of incubation, but preferably after 60 minutes (see Figure 24).
Figure 23: CINDY Seq gives a result within the hour. This figure shows the difference in turbidity between solution with and without RNA target after 0 minutes and after 60 minutes of incubation. It is directly visible to the naked eye that when activated Cas13a is given 60 minutes, it is able to cleave the polyU to such an extent that it no longer forms coacervates. As a control, also inactive Cas13a was incubated with polyU and did not show cleavage of polyU to the extent where coacervation no longer occurred. The tubes in which spermine was added after 0 minutes serves as a control.
Figure 24: Animated GIF showing the readout of CINDY seq at different timepoints. Mixes with active and inactive Cas13a and 0.1 wt% polyU were kept at 37  °C and supplemented with spermine (to final concentration of 1.0 wt%) at various timepoints. Previous experiments have shown that presence of 1.0 wt% spermine does not allow Cas13a to become active. At the first three timepoints (0, 15 and 30 min), coacervation is still visible in both tubes, indicating that there is still sufficient long polyU to coacervate. However, after"

How do we understand our human practice?
We are a software team which is not involved in any experiments. So the sustainability of software is the most notable issue, rather than ethics or social safety. After investigating and discussion, we found two ways to solve this problem.
√Finding science research groups or enterprises that show great interest in our software in order to get their help to continue our project development.
√Cooperate with people who are interested in our project. Voluntary efforts by these people will help improve and continue our project.
Investigate and solve the problem
①  We hold the iGEM Southwest Union of China
We found an iGEM organization for academic communication, which promotes the ideas exchanging of iGEM project and synthetic biology with students from other universities in southwest of China this year. On July 25, 2015, we invited Sichuan University , Sichuan Agricultural University, Southwest University of Nationalities，Chengdu Shude High School and Bio maker to participate in the party which is organized by us(UESTC).
Firstly, our instructor Huang Jian introduced the background, some components of iGEM and several precautions according to his experience in the communication meeting. Then, each school had its own report. Sichuan University iGEM experimental team introduced their own nitrogen and carbon sequestration technologies in microorganism. They also met a problem on SD sequence finding which influences the development of their project. However, we studied how to find out SD sequence in DNA sequence and analyze the strength of the SD sequence that affects translation issues to help them solve their problem. (For more information, go to the collaboration page) Another experimental team of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China shared their novel magneto tactic bacterium. What’s more, we not only shared our stories, presented the software development but also had a heated and intensive discussion on synthetic biology with students who were present. With the idea-exchanging more and more extensive, students from different universities gradually obtained a further and clearer understanding of synthetic biology, especially the minimal cell, the minimal gene set and the relationship"

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"How legislative tools, regarding beekeeping, are often perceived as repressive.
FAI insights about our solution proposal.
Detailed Description
Looking forward to expanding our international reach, we encountered the possibility to contact the Italian Federation of Beekeepers (FAI). Successfully, after exchanging some emails we were able to schedule a virtual meeting with the FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte. We were very excited to have the opportunity to share and also nurture our project with insights, concerns and regulations that came from the city that hosts the headquarters of many important multinational food companies and agencies, such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and The World Food Programme (WFP). Eight members of the team could attend this important reunion that lasted approximately 40 minutes.
FAI President Raffaele Cirone and his staff member Lorenzo Della Morte shared with us very invaluable information about how foulbrood is experienced in Italy:
Foulbrood incidence rate in Italy usually has a seasonal trend with the largest number of registered infections during the second semester of the year (July-December). Regarding the impact and incidence of these two diseases on Italian beekeeping, FAI Italian Federation of Beekeepers has consulted the National Centre of Reference on bee diseases, who elaborated an official data reporting 51 complaints of colony infections from 7 on the 20 Italian Regions, for the year 2017. The number of infected and then destroyed colonies is a few tens of units compared to the 1.300.000 colonies, which constitute the Italian beekeeping heritage.
From the FAI point of view, the data is not to be considered statistically reliable both for the low number of registered cases and for the missing complaints. In fact, in order to avoid the Veterinarian Police controls, many beekeepers often don’t report the infection and directly destroy the colonies in secret. According to FAI estimates the incidence rate of foulbrood can’t be lower than the 10-20% of the Italian beekeeping heritage in total.
The treatment methods used in Italy to treat AFB and EFB are the following:
For AFB:
Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Apart from the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) there are no official and authorized control methodologies so that the infected colonies must be burned. Furthermore, the apiary is subject to health constraints until the recovery plan has been ascertained."

Figure 4 visualizes MIC values for each bacteriocin towards each tested strain. The respective strains are listed in the x-axis and the MIC values are plotted logarithmic(2) on the y-axis. The lowest bar indicates the bacteriocin eliciting the strongest effect.
MIC values are visualized in the bar-chard in Figure 4. The bacteriocin eliciting the strongest effect is indicated by the lowest bar – thus the lowest MIC value. Compared to MIC values of traditional antibiotics (Table 3) i.e. ampicillin and chloramphenicol, the bacteriocins show similar effect. Importantly, the bacteriocins also show better effect due to inhibition of growth of strains, which the traditional antibiotics does not inhibit.
In Figure 4 it is seen that ThuricinS affect all of the strains at a concentration of 16.6 µg/mL. LacticinQ affects only S. aureus strains at a MIC value of 22.2 µg/mL. Laterosporulin inhibits growth of all strains with the lowest MIC being towards the MRSA strains, USA300 and CC398, at MIC 16.8 µg/mL. Even though the laterosporulin as a single bacteriocin affect P. aeruginosa, the Laterosporulin-ThuricinS hybrid does not effect P. aeruginosa. However, the MIC values towards hVISA, USA300 and CC398 (13.1 µg/mL, 13.1 µg/mL, 6.6 µg/mL respectively) are lower than the MIC value of their single bacteriocin form (ThuricinS"

Conclusion
An ideal sequencing run would mean that a lot of the material (depending on run time) has been read and converted into large amounts of ”passed reads” data files containing lines and lines of base sequences. However during our multiple sequencing runs a couple of re-emergin issues consistently showed up, therefore a lot of time was dedicated to troubleshooting this. It was later hypothesized that the source of poor sequencing was because of mRNA left in the samples due to inadequate reverse transcription. See cDNA synthesis
Low Throughput
Because it is impossible to have a 100% purely adaptor ligated mRNA sample we initially decided on that it would be acceptable to run the sequencing for a longer time with a below average throughput. However it was noted during repeated sequencing runs that the throughput was actually sub-par, showing that something in the sample(s) was consistently clogging the pores. This meant that only a fraction of our total material was actually"

Nanoresponder - Call to Action!
With ever increasing threats from emergent pathogens and multiple resistant bacteria, hospitals are cracking down with more rigorous monitoring and decontamination procedures to prevent pathogen spread.
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) vehicles and workers are often the first point of patient care, however, little is known about the importance of EMS vehicles for the transmission of pathogens, and detection methods lag behind those of hospitals.
We are Nanoresponder! A team dedicated to the advancement of pathogen detection and monitoring in EMS vehicles. We have taken a dual approach to pathogen detection: (1) Nanopore Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of DNA samples from EMS vehicles; and (2) A rapid single-domain antibody detection system to generate antibodies that may be implemented in simple and reliable testing kits for fast, on-site pathogen detection.
EMS Vehicle Microbiome Investigation
Upon conducting an in-depth review of literature surrounding EMS vehicle pathogen detection and interviews with EMS officials, we discovered that no published study utilizes a Next Generation Sequencing approach to pathogen detection in EMS vehicles and instead solely cell culturing techniques were used. This is surprising considering that many microbes are unculturable in a laboratory setting and would otherwise escape detection. Moreover, cell culturing techniques may require many days before test results are available.
Recognizing the need for high-throughput and inclusive pathogen detection methods, we developed a detection platform, utilizing the MinION - a novel NGS sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore Technologies .
The MinION Next Geneneration Sequencing Platform
In collaboration with our local EMS department, we devised a sampling strategy, DNA extraction procedure and amplification procedure that is compatible with the MinION sequencing technology.

7/14: Went to BU for a joint meeting, and presented our designs (so far) to BU.  Learned more about enzyme interaction, and will do further readings about the biology behind enzyme interaction.  Continued doing related works with citations.  Met Avi Mosher today from the Weiss Institute, who gave us interesting ideas about how graduate level biology research is done, and how our designs would be used in a more grad-school level research environment.  This is something to keep in the back of our minds when we’re designing for the future.  Can we use the tool to do research and find out information on genes that were previously un-researched?
7/15: Finished the first draft of related work.  Need to figure out more information about citations, and also find other related works and streamline the writing!  Also, we need to start thinking about presenting a poster for the science center poster session.

7/19: Worked on abstracts for the science center summer research grant.    Continued recruiting people for the usability study, and work on the scenario.  Started formulating questions to ask neuroscience students, who have used a previous iteration of G-nome Surfer in the past.
7/20:Crafted a survey to ask neuroscience students who are off campus about their previous experience with G-nome Surfer for the paper.  Also, prepared for the interviews for tomorrow!!
7/21: Today we interviewed two neuroscience students about how they used G-nome Surfer in an intermediate neuroscience class.  Since I took this class before, Megan and I both interviewed these students.  They were a wealth of knowledge and really, really useful information!  We had a better idea of what to expect from designing a usability scenario after interviewing these students. 
7/22: started doing research on particular genes for the pilot testing and usability studies with biology students next week, while the rest of the lab did transcripts for the two interviews.  Should we bring in a teacher to be interviewed as well?

Applications
A biofilm coating can be used for a great number of applications. We developed our hydrophobic coating keeping in mind that future development of our project could focus on adding other properties to a biofilm coating as well, creating functional coatings with different purposes. Utilizing the qualities of different biofilm forming bacteria or micro organisms and combining these coating properties with the ever growing stack of biobricks within the database could give rise to a variety of engineered biofilm machines, capable of transforming surfaces under many conditions.
Hydrophobic coatings
The potential benefits of hydrophobic coatings can be put to use in a wide variety of application areas; hydrophobic clothes, anti-fouling coatings, anti-corrosion coatings, hydrophobic paint and medical coatings for drug delivery or against biofilm formation. For these applications a lot of hydrophobic coatings have been developed. Not all of these coatings have been succesfully used outside the lab, so the search for a cheap, multi-functional hydrophobic coating is still ongoing.
Biofilm coatings
Although a biofilm is not ideal for all of these coating purposes (imagine a biofilm jacket), an hydrophobic biofilm coating could be applied in fields ranging from anti-fouling coatings on ships, peers and buoys, to coatings used to protect catheters and protheses from pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, with introducing our kill switch and our chaplin coating without living bacteria, a even broader range of applications can be taken into consideration as certain ethicial and safety issues are dealth with. A biofilm could be used as either a coating, or a coating machine: Growing, coating, dying and leaving behind a biobased coating.
The main advantage of a biofilm coating is that it is very cheap, applying it requires no technical pinnacles and it is more environmentally friendly than certain chemical coatings. Next to that, biofilms can grow on a wide variety of surfaces: They are found on your teeth, in catheters, in plumbing, in water cleaning installations (beneficial), in bioreactors and, if you're one of those students, on your bathroom floor.
So far there have been coatings with biological substances, but bacteria where only used to produce the coating material. In our project the bacteria will form a biofilm on the desired surface, which will then function as a coating. Our bacteria therefore execute the coating process themselves, which could save a lot of effort. In the"

Linear Discriminant Analysis
Based on the data presented in Figure 14, a cluster analysis based on linear discriminant analysis was conducted using iCG model. Figure 15 shows dot-plots for the forward and reverse models, presenting the linear discriminants of the reads each respective model was created with. The direct comparison of both models reveals that the model created upon the data of the reverse strand seems to perform better in terms of classification of the sequencing reads. Except for the groups containing A and G at the position of interest, which slightly overlap with each other, all other groups are well separated from each other. On the other hand, the linear discriminant analysis of the data of the forward strand was unable to properly separate the reads containing A, G and iCm from each other, mainly due to widely scattered reads of the iCm group. Both results coincide with the visual assessment of the signal traces in Figure 14.
Figure 15: Dot-plots of the linear discriminant models of the forward and reverse strand. Dot-plots of the linear discriminants of the reads used for the creation of the statistical models for base prediction at the position of interest in the forward and reverse strand. The data used for the linear discriminant analysis was previously filtered by removing 70 % of reads from each group, based on their deviation from the groups median signal in the neighboring sequence context of the position of interest.
Since a statistical model should not be tested with the very data it was created with, we prepared a new set of DNA samples to properly evaluate the performance of both models concerning the prediction of bases at the position of interest in their respective sequence context. For this purpose, we modified the RuBisCO plasmid that was used for the first sample preparation by cloning five different sequences downstream RuBisCO with Standard BioBrick assembly (part numbers , , , , ). Each of these plasmids contains a 25 nt sequence that is unique, while the remaining plasmid sequence is the same. These unique sequences can be used for identification assignment of sequencing reads comparable to the Nanopore barcoding approach. Starting with these five plasmids, we prepared new DNA samples according to the same procedure explained above. After ligation, all five samples were pooled in approximately equimolar proportion and further prepared for sequencing. After sequencing and basecalling of this pooled sample, the reads were assigned to their respective group by using iCG filter with the ""--barcode"" argument and each plasmid"
Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," surfaces (37 °C), type I fimbriae or the adhesin AG43 are involved in initial attachment, PGA stabilizes permanent attachment and also curli fibers, which contribute to surface attachment, can be a predominant matrix component. Bacteria growing in the environment or on abiotic surfaces at lower temperatures (<30 °C), form differently composed biofilms, using flagella for initial attachment and curli, cellulose and colanic acid as a matrix in the mature biofilm"" (15). Furthermore, a comprehensive study of various biofilm formation pathways in K12 E. coli concluded, following analysis of 20 different motility-related genes, that flagella are necessary for biofilm attachment, not only initially, but also during later stages of biofilm development (16).
With these findings in mind, we hypothesize that the unexpected effects of merRNA expression are indeed the result of the merRNA acting as a ribosponge and binding to c-di-GMP to lower its active intracellular concentration. This, in turn, increases motility, just as it does in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. However, rather than manifesting itself as a population of highly active planktonic bacteria, the up-regulation of motility genes increased flagellar expression which, rather ironically, enabled better attachment of cells to surfaces and facilitated robust biofilm formation.
Applications
Since generating more robust biofilms does not have beneficial applications in a medical setting, the  phagemid deployment of the merRNA was not pursued. There are some applications in which cells with robust biofilm characteristics can be useful, however. Facilitating the growth of beneficial bacteria in a biofilm state can help treat wastewater by destroying harmful microorganisms or even industrial products like gasoline. Additionally, engineering bacteria in a biofilm state will be more effective in microbial leaching applications (17). Since the merRNA is believed to modulate biofilm formation via increases in cellular motility, the merRNA may have uses in facilitating more motile strains of bacteria.

Local Schools
To share our understanding of synthetic biology  with pre-college students, we chose local high schools to begin. We organized  sessions where students were able to learn about synthetic biology and design  cells of their own.
Even though we  make the first part our priority, it does not mean we did not underestimate the  power of pre-college education. To share our understanding of synthetic biology  with kids, we chose local middle schools to begin. In our opinion, these are  the best students to start with because they can adequately understand what we  were talking about, and they have less pressure academically so they can do  more thinking.
A typical  session of ours starts with a presentation, where we briefly introduce the  concepts with pictures and flash animations for easier understanding. After the  presentation, we would do some games with the students, like putting bricks  together to form an organism (just like putting parts together for a machine)  to get the students more actively involved. Then we divide students into groups  for discussions and have them debate on interesting issues. Finally, we sum up  the whole session and give them take-home messages to remember the lesson.
Through our  experience in schools, we found a couple of tricks that we want to share with  other teams, especially teams from China. Due to cultural and educational  reasons, most students are relatively shy, especially when you appear before  them as “teachers”; and this often results in an awkward lack of response from  them when you start asking questions. This is why we must first work the  students up and make ourselves seem more friendly before actually start asking  them to participate in events such as discussions. Start with games, try some  jokes when they start to relax, and take notice of the more active students so  you can pick on them to answer some questions. Do not start the discussion  before you talked with them a bit more, if you start too early, most of the  students will only sit around and wait for the session to end; this is also why  you must also join their discussion, and lead them where you need.
Always remember  to have fun, and do not treat this as a chore! Kids are very sensitive and they  will feel it if you are not sincere, and they will not be sincere with you  either. So try to really enjoy it and have fun!

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," interact with the yenbox. The induction will then be lost and the expression level will return to its base level. [1]
By BioBricking and characterizing this system, we wish to make it possible to get a Y. enterocolitica density triggered response. Our goal with this system is to control our two other systems, the Targeting and the Killing system.
System Design
While stealing the yenbox together with the wild type promoter fused with it, we had no idea about the strength of the wild type promoter or if it would even work at all. Because of this, we created an alternative version where we replaced the wild type promoter with a standardised one (J23113). In the wild type version there is an overlap between the wild type promoter and the yenbox. Hence, we mimicked the same while creating our customized version where we had an overlap between the promoter and the yenbox. Since the strength of the promoter would correspond to the leakage in our system, we wanted to have a weak promoter to minimize the leakage. We chose the constitutive promoter J23113 ( BBa_J23113 ) from the Anderson library. Unfortunately, the promoter J23113 did not begin with the same two bases as the end of the yenbox. We were left with the option of either changing the two bases in the yenbox sequence or changing the two bases in the sequence of the promoter J23113. In the article by Ching-Sung Tsai and Stephen C. Winanas [1] they discovered that the binding between the activator YenR and the recognition region of the yenbox is not dependent on the entire sequence of the yenbox. Depending on which part of the yenbox that is changed or replaced, YenR binds to the yenbox with different strengths. However, it still interacts with the yenbox and induces the strength of the promoter. Based on this fact, together with the knowledge that the Anderson promoters are very sequence dependent, we chose to change two bases in the sequence of the yenbox.
We also stole the coding sequence [2] of the activator YenR, from Y. enterocolitica, which we codon optimized for E. coli using a IDTs web tool [3] and synthesized it together with the RBS B0034 ( BBa_B0034 ). Since we always want production of the activator YenR, it was coupled to three different constitutive promoters from the Anderson promoter library with three different strengths.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Catalyseur which is a pre-incubator helping students in the field of entrepreneurship. A very interesting discussion took place between Nicolas Delcey, Eric Marchadié and Pierre-Emmanuel Hladik. To adapt our final product to the market, we thought it would be easier to have our Cerberus produced by subcontractors that we would advise. So we started looking for protein-producing companies to deepen our entrepreneurial approach.
August 29th, 2018: Le Catalyseur, again
We did half a day of entrepreneurial coaching with Nicolas Delcey. Thus, we made an inventory of the project developments and we worked on the identification of the risk factors (probability and their potential impact on our project). This allowed us to proudly identify all the tasks and efforts made since the beginning of the project.

It can be assumed that the population of lac repressors in the cell is dominated by the repressor mutant rather than by the wild type, since the mutant is expressed from hundreds of plasmids, while the wildtype is expressed from a single gene on the E. coli chromosome. While the wild type repressor will dissociate from the repressor binding site upstream of the T7 gene, the LacI IS mutant will not. Since IPTG does not change the ratio of repressor to activator, it is difficult to explain why cells grew slightly denser at elevated IPTG concentration.
Figure 6: Cell viability at increasing IPTG concentration. BL21 DE3 cells holding the pET28a-RMF wildtype plasmid (control) and mutations R197A; R197F; T276A;  T276F; R197A T276A; R197A T276F; R197F T276A; R197F T276F were plated on LB-agar with kanamycin without IPTG, with 1mM IPTG and with 10mM IPTG
Since all mutants restored viability of cells at 1mM and even at 10mM IPTG, we assume that all mutants we have generated strongly repress expression under lac control. Although we have not been able to obtain sequences of the mutations yet, we are confident that all described mutants strongly repress lac-controlled expression.
Since RMF was deemed useful for several applications in synthetic biology, we decided to provide both, the coding sequence and an arabinose-inducible RMF generator as BioBrick. In order to produce BioBrick K142040 holding the coding sequence of RMF, we amplified RMF from pET28a-RMF using forward primer 5'-cgcggaattcgcggccgcttctagatgaagagacaaaaacgagatcgcctgg and reverse primer 5'-cgcgctgcagcggccgctactagtattattaggccattactaccctgtccgc and subcloned it into pSB1A7 using the BioBrick restriction sites. While the digest showed an insert of the expected size, sequencing unfortunately showed that the insert was not RMF. We were not able to repeat the experiment in time for submission of the BioBrick to the registry. The arabinose-inducible RMF generator K142041 , which could be used as a sort of “cellular stop switch”, has been ordered from Geneart, but has not been received"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

Signal peptides
How signal peptides work
A signal peptide, also called leader peptide, is the first part of extracellular proteins and can vary in length, its a short sequence fused to the N-terminus of a protein. The signal peptides we work with are 25 and 50 amino acids in length. The signal peptides enables the protein to be translocated through the bacterial plasma membrane via the SecY complex. [1]
Lactobacillus - A champion of protein secretion
One of the specific advantageous traits of the lactobacillus genus is that they are great at secreting proteins. Therefore we decided to synthesize the signal peptide usp45 from lactococcus lactis according to the Freiburg fusion standard to enable fusion with any protein. This peptide has been shown to work in lactobacillus reuteri together with GFP and will probably work in other lactobacillus species. [2]
One of the goals in our project was to make a probiotic bacteria express the protein miraculin (Mir in picture) which would work as a sweetener. However because it works by binding to receptors on the tongue and the protein is too big to pass through the cell membrane of the bacteria it needs to be actively secreted to work optimally. Fusing a signal peptide to the N-terminus of miraculin can solve this. We have synthesised miraculin fused together with usp45. Because we received the synthesised miraculin gene late, we did not have time to put it in pSB1C3 and send it to the registry. We have also not yet had the chance to transform and characterise it in Lact"

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"see picture below). With this concept, they were able to record a 1.4-fold increase in IAA output.
Project design of ZJU China 2012
NUDT China 2015 mopdified this project and devised a DNA scaffold with the use of TALEs[5]. They fused the IAA enzymes to TALEs and used different lengths between the TALE recognition sites to test is metabolic channelling was dependent on spacer lengths.
Different channeling designs by NUDT_China 2015 and their respective fold increase in IAA production
With these constructs, they could achieve a up to 10-fold increase in IAA output, with more output being registered at a spacer distance of 6 bp[5].
Other methods using crisprRNA as a RNA scaffold have also been reported with some success as well as DNA scaffold with ZFNs[6].
Our first approach focuses on dCas9. dCas9 is a mutated version of Cas9 where the endonuclease domains were modified so that the protein no longer cuts dsDNA[7]. This enables us to bind the IAA enzymes to DNA and thereby reduce the diffusion distance for the substrates.
We achieve this by fusing IAAM and IAAH to MS2 and PP7 like ZJU China 2012 did (we created the part BBa_ 2483000 for this, because ZJU China didn’t) and use sgRNA designs from iGEM Warwick 2016. They used these sgRNAs to bring transcription factors closer to promoter regions[8]. The sgRNAs contain signal sequences for the RNA-binding proteins MS2 and PP7, the DNA recognition sites were slightly modified and are included in the part BBa_2483004.
When dCas9 binds to the DNA scaffold, the IAA-RBP fusions bind to the signal sequence on the sgRNA. By bringing in specific scaffold DNA, we can control the distance between the IAA enzymes and achieve metabolic channelling.
The synthesis of everything is happening on a low-copy plasmid, pSB4A5. The scaffold DNA is on a separate, high-copy plasmid, containing many sgRNA recognition sites. We planned single, so called “target cassettes” for our scaffolds, which we assembled with themselves with 3A assembly 4 times. Three cassettes were designed with 6, 12 and 18 bp spacer between the PAMs.
Target cassette 1 and 3 with 6bp and 18 bp spacer, respectively.

Sodium citrate is used to complex the bridging calcium ions which then are replaced with sodium ions. Like this, the alginate is stepwise dissolved and can finally be washed away.
Step 6: But did it work? Let’s find it out by looking at the biofilm under the microscope. Certain dyes specifically interact with the bacterial nanowires created by our bacteria. These are known as a Congo Red or a Crystal Violet assay. In this manner, we can distinguish, whether the nanowires and thus our biofilm has been formed.
The Biolinker
The story of our DIY 3D Printer. From commercial 3D Printers, to modified inkjet printer to K'NEX toys.
Initial 3D Printer ideas
Our project started with the idea to develop structured biofilm formation. The most effective solution would be a retail 3D bioprinter, so we first thought to buy a 3D Printer. However the solution was not viable. For one, a retail 3D printer is expensive. Second, in a normal 3D printer, the printhead is heated, resulting in the death of our bacteria. Third, our proposed bioink has a different viscosity than the one used in 3D printers. Finally, for printing a continuous line, we need to adapt the printing speed which is hard to do with existing 3D printers. In conclusion, our research told us a commercial 3d printer was not optimal, so we started looking for other ideas.
After a thorough search on the internet, we found a lot of manuals to transform an inkjet printer into a 3D printer. Most of the inkjet printers use a piezoelectric Drop-on-Demand method. This method is based on spitting out the ink by using very small electric shocks, which our bacteria could survive. Another advantage of the inkjet printer over a commercial 3d printer is that is it much cheaper! We decided to buy such a printer, but then, problems arose. For example, the printer is impossible to reprogram by connecting it directly to a computer, as its software is embedded into the printer circuitry.
First version of K'NEX printer
A 3D printer is actually nothing else than a machine that can move in three directions and has something that extrudes the ink.

The cells were resuspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer, 20µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody. -
Upon successful expression of PotD-His 3 L cultures were grown up for protein purification purposes, under the same conditions. However, instead of allowing a further 3 hours growth after induction, the cultures were left for 12 hours at 37°C. This was to ensure that plenty of protein was being produced and since PotD is native to E. coli, leaving them to grow this long did not have a significantly detrimental impact upon the cells. We used His tag affinity and size exclusion chromatography to purify PotD. The fractions taken from nickel IMAC were concentrated to a volume of 500 µl and further purified using SEC.
Figure 3 - Characterization of PotD. A) Chromatogram showing the purification profile of the his-tagged bacterial protein, PotD. The fractions corresponding to the two peaks observed on the chromatograph were further analysed on SDS page gel. B) Coomassie Stain of the purified fractions (A12 + B12). 10 µl of each fraction was mixed with 10 µl of 2x Laemmli buffer and loaded onto an SDS gel which was ran for 1 hour at 100V and then stained.  These were then Western immunoblotted to confirm the presence of our target protein PotD-His.
Figure 4 - Samples from the SEC were ran on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody. The band detected in the blot corresponds to the expected size of PotD of 37kDa.
The next step was to characterize binding interactions between PotD and its ligand spermidine. This was carried out via tryptophan fluorescence; a technique which detects conformational changes of proteins by measuring changes in the emission spectra of tryptophan residues. Essentially, if there is an interaction occurring between PotD and spermidine, the spectra would shift indicating so.

• PstI restriction enzyme 1 µl
• KpnI restriction enzyme 1 µl
• Plasmid 500 ng
• Nuclease free H2O until 25 µl
3. Since we only use 500 ng of DNA, we intended not to run the gel and rather proceed to PCR clean up with Wizard SV PCR clean up kit from Promega. Otherwise, the yield will be really low after gel extraction.

Gibson Assembly of desA into pSB1C3
1. Calculate the number of pmols needed for each fragment if we use 50 ng and 100 ng of the vectors.
(50ng X 1000)/(2070bp X 650)= 0.037 pmols
(100ng X 1000)/(2070bp X 650)= 0.074 pmols
2. We used 3 fold of excess insert, so the number of pmols for plasmid will be 3 times the amount of insert we need (0.111 pmols for 50 ng of vectors and 0.222 pmols for 100 ng of vectors)
Amount of desA needed:
(x X 1000)/(1095 bp X 650) = 0.111 pmols
x = 79 ng
(x X 1000)/(1095 bp X 650) = 0.222 pmols
x = 158 ng

Again, we spent more time on literature research, specifically in regards to the proposed detection strategies; mRNA cis-repression and homologous recombination. We read more about the detailed mechanisms involved in homologous recombination. We learned that there is overlap between the RecA mechanism of natural transformation and the RecBCD mechanism during homologous recombination (Dillingham & Kowalczykowsk, 2008) . Another endogenous homologous recombination system that could be used is via the RecF mechanism. If all else fails we could resort to the Lambda Red strategy. The advantage of using RecBCD would be in using ssDNA which is produced by the RecA system during transformation, thus RecA + RecBCD would be the preferred mechanism for homologous recombination.
Reading about cis-repression we learned that our main objective will be to design a suitable cis-repressor (crRNA) sequence. The crRNA must be complementary to both the RBS and the target DNA, with a greater affinity to the target DNA to promote reliable de-repression. The crRNA sequence does not have to necessarily cover the entire RBS sequence - only enough to inhibit the binding of the ribosome. According to literature (Isaacs et al., 2004) the crRNA must bind to only a few of the nucleotides in the RBS sequence in addition to binding the 5’ UTR. Overall the crRNA sequence must be 19-22 nucleotides. The secondary structure is also important to consider - some bulges (i.e. mismatches) must be present in addition to an adequately sized loop to allow for reliable binding of the trans-activation sequence (the amplified target pathogen DNA sequence), otherwise the mRNA will be strongly repressed. Programs such as Mfold may be necessary to predict the secondary structure and thermodynamics of the system (Isaacs et al., 2004) .
We cloned several more parts; PlepA, Pveg, amilCP, LacI (+LVA), tetR (+LVA). The promoters that we cloned were PlepA and Pveg which are endogenous to B. subtilis, as well as a constitutive promoter. AmilCP is a blue chromoprotein that does not fluoresce and was cloned so that it could potentially be used in our reporter system. The repressors we cloned contain a rapid degradation tag (LVA) that will increase the proteins turnover rate and provide us with a faster response.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"The presentations were tailored to their audience to ensure the content is appropriate. In the natural sciences we presented to ‘BIO2071 - Research Skills and Bioethics’, a second year module taken by all second year Bioscience students at the University of Exeter. As these students are mainly from the Biosciences they had no prior knowledge on RRI. In this presentation we focused on what responsible research and innovation is and how it was integrated into our project.
We also presented to students from the Exeter Mathematics School. These students were of a strong mathematical background and had an interest in a career in research due to their attendance but did not have the biological knowledge that the biosciences students had, so we avoided the details of the biological work we have conducted. Similarly to the Bioscience students, they did not have prior knowledge in RRI.
Finally, we will present to social scientists from ‘BEM3009 – Ethics and Organisations’, a third year module taken by third year students in the University of Exeter’s Business School. This will take place after the Jamboree, but we are still dedicated to delivering this presentation. These students will have a very limited scientific background, so we will describe our project in basic terms. As well as scaling back the science we will attempt to connect with business students. These students will, in the future, be the ones to take our scientific research and move it into society. We will engage the students by asking what they would do with our technology, and what their ideas are on the next stage, as these are some of the future stakeholders. With this, we hope that our understanding of the business context will improve.
In order to gage the impact the presentation made in the first two presentations we delivered, a feedback form was given to each member of the audience. Initially we asked ‘What do you think responsible research and innovation means?’. Posing this question at the start of the presentation allowed us to have an idea of the knowledge that the audience had prior to the event. Following this question up we asked ‘How have your thoughts on responsible research and innovation changed after this presentation?’. By judging the difference in response before and after, we could gage how useful our presentation was as an educational tool in the importance of RRI. Further questions we posed were ‘How useful did you find this talk?’ and ‘Do you think responsible research should be incorporated into the education system in some way?’, which offered multiple choice answers.

Creating innovative approaches to difficult measurement problems
Our team had three key measurement achievements:
Characterization of an HSP BioBrick
Determination of electron donor metabolic impact via abiotin assay
Participating in the Interlab study
BioBrick Characterization
Part BBa_K873002 was distributed in the 2016 iGEM DNA distribution kit, but it had no data or previous uses on the registry. In order to improve the registry entry, we decided to create a protocol to further characterize the effectiveness of the HSP. A brief summary of our protocol and results is given below.
Combined BBa_K873002 with BBa_E0840 (GFP) to create a testable device
Transformed device into DH10B
Tested GFP fluorescence at 42C, 37C, and 30C to check HSP activation
BBa_K873002 had slight activation at 42C but fluorescence decreased greatly over time
Biotin Assay
For a part of our project this summer, we needed to find a way to measure the amount of reduced electron donors present in cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time there has been an attempt to measure reduced electron donors. After some modeling experiments, it was determined that biotin, which is produced in an electron donor-dependent synthesis, would be a good target for measurement. By using a biotin assay, we found that our reduced electron donor producing cells were also producing increased biotin. Check out our proof of concept page to see our data and conclusions from this innovative measurement approach.
The Interlab Study
Lastly, we participated in the annual iGEM interlab study. Check out our Interlab Page to see the results and read our suggestions for improvements.

HUMAN PRACTICES"
Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," of applications for our biosensor, such as a pre-check for the chemical analysis and local sampling. To enable the use of DeTaXion to these ends, multiple requirements had to be integrated into the applied design. Key values for this purpose were that the device has to be quick, safe, accurate and quantitative. More information on our applied design and the integration of insights of experts and stakeholders can be found on the Applied Design page .
Ethical issues among GMO’s and Detaxion
The use of GMO has increasingly come under scrutiny in a range of different fields, with public resistance mainly focussed on its appearance in our diet. Herein, the application of the GMO matters: use of GM animals for the production of pharmaceuticals is viewed far less negatively than use for food (PEGASUS. (2012). Final Report - PEGASUS (Public perception of genetically modified animals - science, utility and society). European Commission CORDIS, United Kingdom). Being a subject of strong debate, it is important to ascertain these ethical concerns for our project and product design, as our biosensor naturally is a GMO. As our sensor is best utilized directly in the field, it is implied that our genetically modified bacteria leave the laboratory to enter the outside world - safely contained within our device - leading to the primary concern of introduction into the environment. This introduction of a modified bacterium is potentially harmful, as it could disrupt ecosystems, introduce antibiotic resistances in other species, and have harmful health effects on humans. These concerns were echoed by Martin van den Berg (deputy director of the Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences), who stressed the importance of containment of our E.coli within our device to prevent introduction. Our device therefore contains a number of safety measures to prevent this, such as adequate sealing and storage, and stringent cleaning and washing steps. For more information on how we integrated these safety issues into our applied design, visit our applied design page . Bacteria themselves also contain a number of safety measures: it is firstly comprised of a weak lab strain, with poor survival chances as a result. The bacteria also contain a killswitch-system preventing survival outside of the device. With this approach, we ensure safe use of our device outside of the laboratory.
Ultimately, utilitarian ethics plays a large role in the public perception of GMO. If the public is sufficiently aware of the urgency and importance of achieving a specific goal, it will be more likely to be open to the use of GMO (Hersh, M. A. (2002).

Following 7h. incubation in 37 deg.C absorbance of each sample was measured and compared to samples inoculated only with H2O (Kyle, Harry, Aleksandra, Dainius and Jan).
*'''1st of July''':  ''B. subtilis'' EtOH resistance assay was continued in a narrow concentration range (Jan).   ''E. coli'' (DH5alpha) cells were transformed using BioBricks required for EtOH production (Aleksandra).   O/N cultures of ''E. coli'' and ''B. subtilis'' were set up to continue with the experiments tomorrow (Harry).
*'''2nd of July''':  Transformation was successful. Four colonies were selected and propagated into 5ml LB bottles supplemented with adequate antibiotic (Jan). After 8h incubation in 37 deg. C cells were pelleted and plasmids were extracted using Qiagen MiniPrep Kit (Aleksandra). Concentration  and quality of DNA was measured using NanoDrop.   ''E. coli'' cells plated for competitors were harvested and propagated into 50 ml LB medium. Following 4h incubation they were used to make competent cells for future transformations (Aleksandra and Jan).   B. subtilis resistance to heavy metals experiment was continued in a narrow metal ion concentration range (Harry).
*'''3rd of July''':   Since we propose using B. subtilis as a chassis for our waste water treatment bacteria, we first set about determining the concentration of different metal ions that the non genetically altered chassis can cope with. We initially observed cell density of cultures after 8 hours incubation with varying metal concentrations. Following this we recorded culture density every hour to obtain growth data for appropriate concentrations of metals, as indicated by the initial 8 hour cultures. These experiments continue... (Harry, Danius, Hugo)
*'''4th of July''':  The competent ''E. coli'' cells were tested by transforming them with parts for ethanol production. The negative control was performed to confirm that cells have no indigenous antibiotic resistance and that prepared antibiotic plates have antibacterial properties (Aleksandra and Jan).   Time-lapse measurements of ''B. subtilis'' growth in specified metal concentrations (based on previous data) were performed (Harry, Hugo, Dainius and Kyle)  Team started preparing poster (Kyle) and presentation (Dainius and Hugo) for the Young Synthetic Biologist meeting held in London over the next weekend"

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Introduction
Interlab is aimed to improve reproducibility and compare the difference between laboratories.                         To complete this job,we make three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference                         point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve. Completion of the                         calibrations will ensure that we understand the measurement process and that we can take the                         cell measurements under the same conditions. For the sake of consistency and reproducibility,                         we used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha like other teams. Later, we conducted the CFU experiment.                         We                         count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and two Negative Control                         (BBa_R0040) cultures.
Methods
—— OD 600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
We use LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a                         conversion factor to transform your absorbance (AbS600) data from our plate reader                         into a                         comparable OD600 measurement.
$$ Correction\ factor=\frac{ReferenceOD_{600}}{reading_{LUDOX CL-X}-reading_{H_2 O}} $$
—— Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the AbS600 in our                         plate reader. This measurement allow us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration                         which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
$\surd$ Prepare the Microsphere Stock Solution
$\surd$ Prepare the serial dilution of Microspheres

——Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein                         Protocol
We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the                         fluorescence in a 96"

Choosing a hardware-specific Copyleft license: CERN or TAPR
For more information on TAPR, see here .
For more information on CERN OHL, see here .
Overall, the Copyleft requirements ensure that nobody is denied the rights to access the product and its documentation, including all downstream versions. In this sense the two hardware licenses (CERN and TAPR) are similar. The most significant difference between the TAPR OHL and the CERN OHL is that the TAPR OHL attempts to deal directly with the patent aspect of hardware licensing, and currently is the only license to do so [1]. As mentioned previously, the aspects of hardware such as manufacture and use mean that it is not covered by copyright, and instead must be regulated under patent law*.
This makes the license extremely powerful if the original creator of the hardware patented their creation: they can waive their IP rights under the license and provide full access to products and derivatives. However, a problem arises when the Licensor does not have patent rights over the creation [1]. The cost and complexity of obtaining a patent is a significant obstacle that the creator must attempt to overcome if they want to patent their creation. If anyone else asserts IP rights over the creation under license, and is awarded a patent, then access to the creation is no longer universal under the TAPR OHL.

Internal Model
1. Introduction
We can think of many relevant questions in implementing a new circuit: how sensitive is the system, how much will it produce and will it affect the growth? As such, it is important to model the effect of the new circuits on the bacteria. This will be done in the Internal Model. We will use two approaches. First we will use Simbiology and ODE's to study the sensitivity and dynamic processes inside the cell. Afterwards, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) will be used to study the steady-state values for production flux and growth rate. This part will be executed by the iGEM Team of Toulouse as part of a collaboration.
2. Simbiology and ODE
In the next section we will describe our Simbiology model. Simbiology allows us to calculate systems of ODE's and to visualize the system in a diagram. It also has options to make scans for different parameters, which allows us to study the effect of the specified parameter. We will focus on the production of leucine, Ag43 and AHL in cell A and the changing behavior of cell B due to changing AHL concentration. In this perspective, we will make two models in Simbiology: one for cell A and cell B. First we will describe how we made the model and searched for the parameters. Afterwards we check the robustness of the model with a parameter analysis and we do scans to check for the effects of molecular noise.
3. Quest for parameters
We can divide the different processes that are being executed in the cells in 7 classes: transcription, translation, DNA binding, complexation and dimerization, protein production kinetics, degradation and diffusion. We went on to search the necessary parameters and descriptions for each of these categories. To start making our model we have to chose a unit. We choose to use molecules as unit because many constants are expressed in this unit and it allows us to drop the dillution terms connected to cell growth. We will also work with a deterministic model instead of a stochastic model. A stochastic model will show us the molecular noise, but we will check this with parameter scans.
The next step is to make some assumptions:
The effects of cell division can be neglected
The substrate pool can not be depleted and the concentration (or amount of molecules) of substrate in the cell is constant

846625169@qq.com Bioengineering Senior As a member of NEU_China_A, I have gained lots of experience on scientific researches and learned much knowledge about synthetic biology. As for our project, we choose E. coli as host strains, using genetic engineering and synthetic biology methods to express IL-10 with anti-inflammatory activity and myrosinase with anti-cancer activity. To achieve sensitive detection of inflammatory signals, a kind of promoter called pNorV is made to measure NO molecules in human intestines. The pharmacological activities of these functional proteins were finally tested by experiments with cell lines. In order to improve the efficiency, our team is divided into several groups to do experiments at the same time. I mainly participate in the work of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. In addition, I was involved in mathematical modeling and plasmid construction. From the initial discussion about the project topic to weekly meetings, experiments, human practice and other aspects of the project, we all worked together. I deeply realized the importance of teamwork from this valuable experience.

Patents and SynBio a Video by MIT iGEM2010 from Paul Muir on Vimeo .
Patents and Synthetic Biology: An Intersection of Ambiguity
The last half century has witnessed pivotal advances in the life sciences, ranging from the elucidation of DNA's structure to the mapping of the human genome.   It can be argued, however, that none has had a greater impact on our standard of living or economy than the discovery of restriction enzyme technology and its product, recombinant DNA. Facilitating innovations ranging from pharmaceutical products synthesis to gene therapy, these tools of genetic engineering birthed the biotechnology industry.   Yet, the industry and its life changing products would not have been possible without the input of pioneering entrepreneurs and their own key enabling technology- patents. Through the provision of a limited monopoly, patents provided incentives not only for further research by inventors but also development from early entrepreneurs to bring their products to market.
Thus secured a financial foundation, pioneering entrepreneurs quickly subscribed to the motto “clone a gene, make a million,” anticipating support from biopharmaceuticals and the traditional venture capital community. Indeed, commercial biotechnology started with high hopes. ""There's no question that [...] the entrepreneurs who began biotechnology businesses had very broad, grand ideas and big visions,"" says Jim Vincent, former chairman and CEO of Biogen, Inc.   With patents securing compensation on the most promising products, money poured into biotechnology startups such as Amgen, Genzyme, and Biogen, forming a $30 billion industry with over 160 drugs and vaccines on the market and another 370 currently undergoing clinical trials. With a market capitalization of over $300 billion and 200,000 employees working for 1,500 companies in the US alone, biotechnology's rise directly follows from the increased mapping and staking of biological intellectual property space.    Co-founder, president, and COO of Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc., Gail Naughton made it a point"
Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," are also many products used to lose weight, we search it on the internet and use the table to compare the differences between the medicine(Only two kinds of medicine, orlistat and lorcaserin, were allowed by government to use to lose weight in Taiwan now)and goods(Here, we choose the chitin and liposuction).
After looking for the above-mentioned table, we find that our product has many advantage. Not only does our project has no side effect, but it can also be used for everyone. However, all the products have to pass the examination of legalizing, if they want to hit the market. That's why we visited FDA.
Conclusion
It took us quite a long time to think about how to respond to the questions above, since last time we had a meetup with NCKU_Tainan, one of their team members had already ask us a pretty tough question similar like these problems that we barely couldn’t answer, “aren’t you guys supporting the world to consume more sugar?” At first, we kind of think that they are right. After all, there’s no denying that these  questions just hit the weak point of our project and present the realistic society problems our product might bring, but after a fierce argument between our teammates, we repositioned our project and have the conclusion in addition below :
 
Indeed. It is actually the way that gets straight to the point the most. However, it’s just like the reason why you prefer Mosquito-repellent lotion to wearing long sleeves and trousers when hanging out with friends in a hot day. You don’t like to sweat and become smelly, so you make the choice. Let’s have another example. If you have motion sickness, the most simple and direct way to solve it is get off the car, but that’s too inconvenient. As a result, you take motion sickness pills instead. The two examples convey the same meaning. Sugar is not merely an essential nutrient in our normal life, but it is also added into snacks、afternoon tea… and so on that people enjoy for relaxation. That is, avoiding eating sugar may probably not be very efficient to reach the goal of losing weight. At this moment, our bacteria come into use. 
But here comes a question. Eating sugar without absorbing it? People will definitely run into sugar’s hug rather than resist the desire.  
         Yes. Thus, instead of the medicines put on the shelf that everyone can purchase, our product will be prescription medicines for assistant purpose. Whether patients can take it to help control their weight or blood sugar depends on doctors"

Sequencing
To verify our libraries, we used different sequencing techniques. Thereby it is possible to estimate the actual diversity as well as the distribution of nucleotides at the randomized positions compared to the theoretical library sizes.
Sanger sequencing
Sanger sequencing was applied to check the correctness of assemblies and to examine the appearance of the different chosen bases for positions of the variable regions of our binding proteins, respectively. Plasmids were isolated from 24 colonies with Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively. This plasmid mix was sequenced in one reaction. Figures 1 and 2 show that these 24 colonies were enough to cover nearly all possible bases of Monobody randomized regions and all Nanobody randomized regions as designed.
