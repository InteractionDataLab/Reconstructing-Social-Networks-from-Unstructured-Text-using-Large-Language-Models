Sporulation Tuning Model
The expression of KinA has been modelled as seen above, therefore we can now proceed further into the Sporulation Tuning Model, which is built from the KinA Expression Model with COPASI.
To proceed with the modelling of our Sporulation Tuning Model, we have decided that in response to an unidentified stimuli, where KinA  autophosphorylates and then donates its phosphate groups to the response regulator Spo0F, the unidentified stimuli will be termed as 'sporulation signal'.[5]
Also, to simplify the modelling, the phosphatases that provide access for negative signals to influence the cell’s decision whether to sporulate or to continue vegetative growth,[4] such as Spo0E[1], YisI, and YnzD,[5] are not taken into consideration while building this model.
The following equations describe the model:
Equation 1
Equation 2
Equation 3
As Spo0F lacks an output domain and is incapable of activating transcription; it serves only as an intermediary in the phosphorelay. The phosphotransferase Spo0B transfers the phosphate from Spo0F~P to Spo0A.[4]
Equation 4
Equation 5
Equation 6
Equation 7
Equation 8
Equation 9
With respect to Equations 1 to 9, as seen above, the corresponding fluxes are as follows:
Fluxes
The phophorylated proteins Spo0FP, Spo0BP and Spo0AP will go through degradation, and the following equations, Equation 10, 11 and 12 describes degradation.

Gene construction & cloning:
The general cloning strategy for NrfA consists of the following steps.
1. The biobrick BBa_K1153001 (NrfA), previously submitted by KENT iGEM 2013 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.
2. Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.
3. (P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.
4. (NrfA) was doubly digested by XbaI and PstI to yield Xba-(NrfA)-Pst construct.
5. A linearized vector was prepared by double-digestion with EcoRI and PstI.
6. The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.

II - NosZ (Nitrous Oxide Reductase)-
Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration has been increasing since the introduction of the Haber Bosch process led to the widespread use of nitrogenous fertilizers. One of the pathways to its destruction is reduction to molecular nitrogen by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase found in denitrifying bacteria.
NosZ, a gene coding for nitrous oxide reductase, isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, is known to convert N2O to harmless Nitrogen gas (N2). It has two copper centers, a binuclear CuA center, similar to the one found in cytochrome c oxidase, and the CuZ center, a unique tetranuclear copper center now known to possess either one or two sulfide bridges[3].
The reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen requires two protons and two electrons, according to the equation N2O + 2H+ + 2e− → N2 + H2O, E°′ (pH 7.0) = 1.35 V; ΔG0′ = −339.5 kJ/mol
This is a challenging reaction to be catalyzed by a metalloenzyme, as nitrous oxide is not just kinetically inert to decomposition but also a poor transition metal ligand, due to its weak σ-donating and π-accepting properties. Although, there have been some reports of other enzymes, such as"

Our team came together in April 2017. We first went through a period of extensive research and brainstorming, determined to find a novel solution to a real-world issue. Once we settled on our project in June, we focused on preparing a detailed plan of the work during summer. We designed our parts, circuits and experiments, distributed tasks, managed our team and our lab. Since July, we have been spending long hours in the lab, trying to get CATE ready for the Jamboree.
All of this would have never been possible without the tremendous support and guidance of our advisors, supervisors and experts. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed to the completion and success of CATE!
Advisors
Our advisors gave feedback to our experiment designs, identified bugs in our codes and were always there to answer any questions we had – even during their vacation! They checked in regularly to make sure we were on track and reassured us when something was not working in the expected way. Daniel and Claude were part of the 2014 iGEM team of ETH Zürich, which is why they were not surprised about our many moments of despair.

Daniel Gerngross
Daniel helped us with the initial setup of the lab, double-checked our experimental designs and introduced us to the Ligase Cycling Reaction (LCR) technique. He helped us out with the plate reader experiments, somehow managed to like every single one of our social media posts and took awesome team profile pictures!
Christoph Stelzer
Christoph provided us with mammalian cell lines and a lot of advice in experiment design. He was always ready to run over to our lab in case we needed something.
Claude Lormeau
Claude was our specialist in computational biology and helped to define the strategy for our models. She was always around to discuss results and optimize the procedure. With her extensive experience she contributed to the successful implementation of the models and connecting the outcomes to the experimental work. She"

Modelling E. Coli’s behaviour as it swims up a chemotactic gradient is of course limited by inaccurate and unreliable data. The tumbling frequency for example, according to some papers in the seventies, is reported to be as high as several Hertz, whereas more recent papers have one Hertz being the maximum tumbling frequency. One paper, ‘Temporal comparisons in bacterial chemotaxis’ [4], informs of the fact that bacteria actually look as far back in time when swimming as 4 seconds, but usually take the previous second as their basis on deciding whether or not concentration has increased or not. It is for this reason we have chosen one Hertz to be the maximum rate at which bacteria tumble when moving down a chemoattractant gradient.
Although for some specific strains of E.coli the motion has been very well studied, the actual strain used for our project may behave differently, as they vary in motility. An example of this would be that some strains of E.coli swim as fast as 50 micrometres per second. Another example would also be that some mutant strains of E.coli tumble very infrequently and can check concentrations as infrequently as every 30 seconds. The only way to ensure accuracy and reliability in simulating how our bacteria behave is to actually experiment with our own strain and compare this to the model. The model can then be altered to fit the data, or we could attempt a more in-depth analysis to try and find the tumbling frequency behaviour and swimming speed of our own strain.
In order to design a simulation, some simplifications have to be made. In fact, our model has more simplifications than some models in literature. This chemotaxis model, for instance, neglects the fact that E.coli do not travel in straight lines but often take curved paths due to unequal firing of the flagella. Moreover there almost always is a slight curvature due to Brownian motion in the fluid. In a static fluid there are usually minute convection currents due to local temperature variations. These currents can transport bacteria against their own will, as we have seen for ourselves under the microscope. The model also does not consider the fact that E.coli change in size, and regarding the collisions the bacteria are simply modelled as hard spheres of 2 micrometres diameter that cannot overlap. The collisions simply result in a change of direction and there is no conservation of momentum or kinetic energy, or modelling of the physics of the collision. The tendency"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

For the CFU, from 3 mL of overnight cultures of the positive and negative controls, “starting samples” were  made by diluting the cultures until OD600 = 0.1, then indicated serial dilutions of consequential 1:10 dilutions were made until dilution 5 was reached (8 x 10-5 factor).
The dilutions from 3 to 5 (8 x 10^-3, 8 x 10-4 and 8 x 10-5 factors, respectively) were cultured aseptically for 20 hours in LB + chloramphenicol agar plates. A total of 36 plates were obtained in total. CFU/mL calculations followed, and after counting colonies, the number of colonies were multiplied by the final dilution factor and results were delivered.

Start of IMAC Purification
4mL of lysate was added to the resin saved from last time's run through of batch purification. However, due to a miscommunication, the resin from last time was suspended in strip buffer instead of 1X binding buffer. The resin was not re-charged yet with nickel and therefore unable to function properly. The lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, was added to this ill-prepared resin, and the supernatant collected after the first centrifugation, fraction 1, appeared extremely green. The resin was white instead of the usual blue, indicating that the resin beads were not charged and therefore unable to bind Histidine-tagged proteins like our Tamura. The supernatant was still collected into a tube. The resin was washed thoroughly with about 10mL of DI water, spun for 2 minutes at 700g and 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was collected and discarded. Next, the resin was charged with about 10mL of charge buffer, fully incorporated by spinning on a rotary spinner, and then centrifuged for 2 minutes at 700g and 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was once again discarded. Finally, 10mL of 1X binding buffer was added to the resin, and the same process of incorporation and centrifugation was carried out.
The lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, was re-added to the freshly prepared resin, and batch purification proceeded as usual. However, after the first centrifugation step, the resin appeared white and the supernatant appeared blue. This qualitative observation was unprecedented. The resin was no longer charged and the nickel beads had somehow spun off and became incorporated into the supernatant instead. The Falcon tube's contents were vortex-ed  and re-spun on a rotary spinner. We tried centrifugation two"

Synthetic Biology : Reflexion proceeds in the UK,by Claire Mouchot, September 2009,
French ambassy in the United Kingdom
The development of synthetic biology is closely related to the development of IT and nanotechnology, as we can see in this schema :
""Is This (the Good) Life? Engaging the World of Synthetic Biology"",
Bart Walhout ( Ethical Aspects of Synthetic Biology, table-round)
It is obvious that without IT, there is no gene bank, no international access to information, which are the two main skills that increased the speed of progress in SynBio… One of the innovations in SynBio is the multidisciplinary workforce. Because of the large aspects of application and the implication in the creation of an artificial life, SynBio workforce needs biologists, engineers, chemists, IT specialists, social, ethical and economic experts. This is an important asset that proves the impact that SynBio can have on the scientific world. But this underlines that creating life and controlling it is a huge and difficult power that needs the contribution of all the scientists’ communities. The domains of application are almost unlimited, because the objective is to create synthetic life, with various aims.

Sensing
The expression of human sweet taste receptor in yeast
In the sensing part, the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) T1R2 and T1R3 were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae due to its ability to regulate a wide range of cellular processes such as the senses of taste and smell. Moreover, we constructed a mRFP-based assay to achieve proper detection of sweetness responses.
So we had to achieve two goals:
1. To express T1R2 and T1R3 in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
2. Construct a response signal circuit to confirm that our receptors can detect the sweeteners.
Results:
1. Synthesized the gene of human receptors T1R2 and T1R3
2. Expressed the heterologous GPCR in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
3. The engineered yeast with T1R2 and T1R3 can sense the sweeteners.
Details of the results:
1. The gene synthesis of T1R2 and T1R3
GPCR sequences are extracted from NCBI’s NR database. The sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 (ID: 83756 and 80834) responds to diverse stimuli associated with the human sense of sweet taste, such as sucrose, d-tryptophan and aspartame. In reliable expression in Saccharomyces Cerevisiaei, we finished the codon optimization and reverse transcription of protein sequences into DNA sequences on the website http://54.235.254.95/gd/. The sequences of our receptors were established into the parts BBa_K2368003 and BBa_K2368004.
We synthesized the human receptor genes T1R2 and T1R3 using building block which based on overlapping-extension PCR. The PCR result was showed as Fig.9.

Cost analysis
Our test is much cheaper than existing solutions, especially when you consider the final product will be a multiplexing assay which will test for many diseases simultaneously.
Qiagen PAXgene blood RNA tube: 1 @ £752 / 100 kits [11]
£7.52
Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit: 1 @ £1115 / 250 kits [12]
£4.46
Taking a blood sample inc. labour [13]
£3.42
Medical lab technician’s time: 15 minutes @ £8.45 / hour [14]
£2.11
Paper-based toehold switch biosensor: 50 @ 1.7p / 1 μl switch [15]
£0.85
Other lab equipment e.g. sterilisation: tubes: gloves (approx) [13]
£0.30
Total
£18.66
We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," resistance is becoming increasingly problematic and inspired a large proportion of our work in Human Practices .
The components of biofilms differ among bacterial species, but many of them have been found to serve a specific purpose. Three structures observed commonly in different biofilms are: exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and a variety of biofilm-associated proteins [8] .
The vital role that biofilm plays in persistent infections provides a solid rationale for making them our primary target.
Figure 1: Overview of the typical components of S. aureus biofilms
Our Project
Our vision is a functional wound dressing which will be able to disperse early-stage S. aureus biofilms in chronic wounds. The scaffold for this dressing is formed by spider silk – a material not only known for its high tensile strength, but also for being biocompatible and largely non-immunogenic. Those features make it an ideal candidate material for potential wound dressings [9] . Since the synthesis of spider silk itself is extremely complex and would constitute a project of its own, we were very lucky to receive ready-made, recombinant spider silk from our adivsors.
To actively fight the biofilm, several biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins' will be attached to the silk via Sortase A, a transpeptidase isolated from S. aureus. This constitutes a broadly-based approach which will hopefully forestall any bacterial escape or resistance mechanisms.
Figure 2: SMITe targets several key components of biofilms with spider-silk-attached combat proteins.
However, our mission is far from being limited to chronic wound treatment – products similar to our wound dressing could find applications far beyond the medical field.

Demonstrating dispersal of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilm
Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is released by bacteria through autolysis (self-degradation) and serves as a matrix component of biofilm. eDNA is involved in various biofilm processes including adhesion, aggregation of bacterial cells and as a nutrient source. Enzymatic degradation of eDNA can weaken the biofilm and make the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics and biocides [10] . Numerous studies have shown that biofilm-degradation can be achieved by a variety of DNases, enzymes that cleave single-stranded and double-stranded DNA [11] . In our project we aimed to degrade biofilm formed by S. aureus which has previously been shown to be susceptible to DNase treatment [12] ."

Referring to potential production platform of n-butanol in E.coli[9] , we designed a combined part to degrade E-3-methyl-2-hexenoicacid (E-3M2H).
    This gene cluster expresses three enzymes, of which atoD and atoA from E.coli and adhE2 from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The function of atoDA mediates reductive conversion of 3-methyl 2-hexenoic acid to 3-methyl-2-acetyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA as the CoA donor, for fatty acid activation and its subsequent degradation.[9] AdhE2 catalyzes reduction of 3-methyl-2-acetyl-CoA to 3-methyl 2-hexenol at the expense of NADH.[10]

pTEF1(m10)
Here, we demonstrate that the cell autonomous portion of our circuit behaves as designed. Each line represents a different version of the rtTA autonomous circuit as shown above. The circuits differ by the constitutive promoter driving rtTA expression; five mutants of pTEF1 were used to drive rtTA expression, creating a library of Doxycycline responsive circuits. In this graph, one can see that pTEF1(m7) driving rtTA results in the least sensitive circuit. At a doxycycline concentration of 0.3µg/µl, we achieve the greatest resolution between different cell autonomous circuits.

Community Response
In this figure, we show that we have successfully constructed a community averaging circuit in yeast. The blue histogram corresponds to yeast cells with pTEF1(m7) driving expression of rtTA, while the yellow histogram corresponds to yeast cells with pTEF1(m10) driving expression of rtTA. These two yeast strains were mixed and grown in the same well to produce a divergent population as shown in the divergent GFP peaks. This genetic divergence is averaged upon alpha factor signaling as shown in the overlapping RFP peaks.
Future Directions
To allow us to tune intercellular communication, we plan to add the following feedback loops to our base circuit above:
Positive Feedback: Mating Factor Alpha
MFα
AFRP
In this positive feedback circuit, we express mating factor alpha under an alpha factor responsive promoter (AFRP). This generates a direct feedback loop where more alpha factor sensed effects more alpha factor secreted.
Positive Feedback: STE2
Ste2
AFRP
In this positive feedback circuit, we express the mating factor alpha receptor, STE2, under the control of an alpha factor responsive promoter. While yeast endogenously upregulate STE2 in response to alpha factor, our circuit would exacerbate that effect. Compared to the MFalpha positive feedback circuit (on the left), this feedback circuit is less direct as it upregulates a receptor that senses alpha factor. This does not change the local concentration of alpha factor, and may be thought of as a ""selfish"" feedback loop.
Negative Feedback: BAR1

In this negative feedback circuit, we express BAR1, an alpha factor degrading protease, under the control of an alpha factor responsive promoter. With BAR1, we expect to be able"

We decided that the theme of the exhibition was “transgenic and human health” and the main contents went about disease therapy, biologic pharmacy, disease detection and environment improvement, corresponding to the projects of the teams. Accomplishing the designing and printing of posters a week ahead and the putting-up and arrangement of the exhibition one day ahead, we prepared the exhibition carefully.
In the following days, we arranged team members from each team to be responsible for the maintenance and explanation of the exhibition. On the last exhibition day, we withdrew the posters and cleaned the exhibition hall together.
We SCU-WestChina also introduced our project in the exhibition besides the knowledge about GM. We hoped that the viewers could know more about hyperuricemia, as well as our project, so that they could share their ideas and suggestions with us. What’s more, we handed out the handbooks on hyperuricemia to the public coming to the library. It’s honor to us if the public can know something about hyperuricemia and the GM.
It meant a lot to us to hold the exhibition on “transgenic and human health”. Firstly, we introduced the public the benefits brought by GM products, in which way the public can know about more aspects of GM, so that they can consider it in a dialectical and rational way instead of a one-sided, extreme one. Secondly, we popularized the knowledge of hyperuricemia, which made contribution to the awareness and importance of hyperuricemia. Thirdly, optimistic feedback and advice on our project were collected. Fourthly, this exhibition enhanced the communication and cooperation between the iGEM teams. You know, the exhibition wouldn’t have succeeded without wonderful collaboration and teamwork.

The theme this year was “Transformation of human / animal health related microorganisms”. This competition built a stage to broaden academic horizon, enhance scientific research literacy and share ideas about synthetic biology for all the students in Sichuan University.
Assisting SCU-China, we did some work in the competition. We introduced projects of Vilnius-Lithuania 2016 and Groningen 2012 to the competitors and answered the questions about the projects. We also suggested some methods to design a brand-new project. As judges in the thesis defense part, we marked, commented on and questioned about every project involved.
We thought that ACMA was quite a good chance to spread synthetic biology and iGEM competition, and competitors"

On Saturday, September 15th, we hosted the first ever New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University. We hosted a total of four iGEM teams for the afternoon and each team gave a practice presentation in preparation for the Regional Jamboree in Pittsburgh. Teams from MIT, Wellesley, and Brown-Stanford joined us for an afternoon of presentation feedback and fun!
As a part of the NEGEM meeting, audience members filled in anonymous feedback forms for each presentation. The questions focused on the content of the presentation, including questions on the project's motivation, results, and figures. The forms for each team were collected and returned to the teams so they could use this feedback to improve their presentations in time for the Jamboree.
We'd like to thank everyone who came out and joined us for NEGEM! It was a lot of fun to see everyone and to see the results of all of your hard work this summer. You helped make this meeting a success and we hope to host NEGEM again next summer!

Goals
The goal of this project is to produce various mutants of a 3-dimensional protein fusion capable of self-assembling into a tetrahedral cage structure (PDB: 3VDX). These variants will have thrombin protease sites (LVPRGS) introduced in selected locations, allowing for dissociation of the cage structure upon thrombin treatment. Ultimately, we aim to develop a controllable system allowing for both drug-loading and release using the protein cage scaffold.
Achievements
We used Pymol software to model our protein cage and determine where to insert out thrombin cut site mutation.
Using the design restriction listed below, we narrowed down 13 possible locations for the insert
We successfully cloned and expressed one of our mutant cages and our wild type cage.
We ran dynamic light scattering on both but did not see correct size cage formation.
Design
Following is a list of our insertion sites. Sites marked with asterisks are preferred sites. Sites were selected by examining the DSSP secondary structure to ensure minimal disruption of existing alpha-helices or beta sheets, ensuring sites were sandwiched by glycine residues, and using PyMOL to check if the site would be accessible to the protease. Top candidates are based on two main criteria:
1.  Geometric accessibility by protease
2.  Speculated extent of conformational changes by insertion (minimum preferred)

Copper-binding models showing the concentrations of free enzyme (CUT A), formed complex (CUT A – Copper complex), and free copper. The change in concentration of free enzyme and formed complex over time as the enzyme binds to free copper is quite evident, and the result shows that the higher the initial concentration of copper (i.e. the higher the concentration of CuSo4), the faster the rate of change. However, there is no detectable change in the concentration of free copper at all regardless of the initial concentration. Why? We realized that this is because our copper concentration was too high compared to our enzyme concentration. The lowest copper concentration we used in the experiment was 0.2365 molar, whereas the enzyme concentration used was 1 micromolar, or 1E-6 molar. The tiny amount of enzyme is too insignificant to cause a change in the concentration of free copper.

With further research in elementary kinetics, we realized that our enzyme, CUT A, is capable of binding to six copper ions simultaneously. Previously, we have assumed that there is a 1:1 ratio of enzyme to copper ions. This assumption turns out to be false. With multiple binding, the new equations are as follows (where n represents the number of substrates each enzyme can bind to):
Results and Interpretation:

Copper-binding models where each free enzyme (CUT A) may bind to six substrates (copper ions). Compared with previous results, the rate of change of the concentrations of free enzyme and ion-enzyme complexes are faster, but there is still no detectable change to the concentration of free copper. This is expected as the difference between the copper concentration and enzyme concentration is too great (of a 6th order). Successful removal of copper ions will require a much higher concentration of enzymes.

The neuroscientific research of C.elegans reveals that in this nematode, a pair of olfactory neurons, AWA and AWB, affect their preference for different olfactory cues. Our project is based on these two neurons ,we aim to figure out the logic connection between the neuron network and the learning ability.
The first thing is to figure how the olfactory neurons affected behavior change. To realize this purpose, we applied two hypothesis: the neurons are equivalent with different types of receptors; even same each olfactory neuron might be dedicated to a characteristic response despite the receptors it expresses. These hypothesis were supported by the experiments done by other scientists, the experiment showed that use a promoter that express in one of the pair of neurons we can transfer an exogenous receptor onto the neuron, and the transferred receptor will lead to avoidance (AWB) or preference (AWA). That is to say, if the stimulations are not sensed by other receptors, we can control the preference of them towards different stimulations by changing different receptors on these two neurons.Because of these ,we can apply our receptor to these two neurons to get our purpose.
Next, we need to construct a system inside the worms which can induce them show specific response to the inducing signal.Then we can induce them form the learning behavior.Meanwhile, the former research of learning ability based on C.elegans were more focused on chemical signals like olfactory inducing, heavy mental stimulus. These can demonstrate the existence of the learning behaviors but seems tenable as the reliable experimental data, since the residue of the stimuli are hard to erase. Thus we choose optogenetic method to  realize this goal.
To study the nematodes’ behavior with optogenetic method, a pair of channelrhodopsins, the red-light sensitive Chrimson and the blue-light sensitive CoChR, are applied in our study. The channelrhodopsins intensely used in previous research, ChR2 and C1V1, have large overlap which indicates the large risk of cross-activation . CoChR"

Introduction
The need to feed increasing urban populations is placing unprecedented pressure on the agriculture industry. To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods; the run-off from these fertilisers coupled with the food mileage required for crops to reach our cities is having a devastating environmental impact. In addition, for every 1 °C increase in atmospheric temperature, 10 % of farmland used for crop production will be lost [1]. This destructive cycle impacts consumers, farmers, and the environment.
In the coming decades, urbanisation is expected to increase considerably. Today, 54 % of the world population lives in urban areas. By 2050, this share is forecast to increase to 66 %. That equates to an additional 2.4 billion people living in urban centres [2].
[3]
One way of protecting our crops and the land we use for agriculture is by growing within controlled, contained environments. Growing indoors is already a well-established practice; greenhouses are widely used and guarantee a safer, and more predictable method of growing. By carefully controlling the parameters within these environments, we can artificially create the optimum growth conditions for a specific crop, maximising yield.
The need for sustainable agricultural solutions has never been greater. It is our contention that by combining these artificial and contained growth systems with the efficient use of space in our cities, we may relieve some of the pressure being placed upon the agriculture industry by increasing urban populations – leading the paradigm shift towards an urban future where sustainable agricultural solutions are commonplace.
Newcastle iGEM 2018 proposes an alternative route.

Science Fair
Feria de la Ciencia (Science Fair) in Seville, is the principal activity of the project Ciencia viva, Ciencia compartida (Living Science, Shared Science) which is developed by the Sociedad Andaluza para la Divulgación de la Ciencia, SADC, (Andalusian Society on the Popularization  of Science). In Science Fair multiple educational institutions, research centers and  university schools are invited to spread and share their projects, experiments and  scientific knowledge with the general public, especially primary school and high-school students. The objective of this annual event is to promote learning and spreading of science, to stimulate research and to favor the exchange of experiences and education between professors, students, families, scientific community, companies and the man in the street. The projects that are exhibited in the Science Fair belong to different scientific fields: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Technological Development, etc.  Moreover, each year the Fair is focused on a subject matter.
5200 square m assigned for scientific exhibits, 85 stands, 26 scientific institutions, companies and universities, 20200 visitors. These were approximately the numbers of the IX edition of Feria de la Ciencia , which took place on May 12nd to 14th, 2011, at the Pabellón del Futuro of the Isla de La Cartuja, in Seville. With the topic “Everything is number”, it tried to show the public how numbers and math are part of our everyday life and all disciplines of knowledge, from Ecology, to Literature, as well as Economy, Biology and so on. Also, it celebrated the International Year of Chemistry and the International Year of Forests.

Ischemic and hypertensive heart disease were the leading causes of death in the world over the past decade. Over 7.4 million people were dead of these diseases in 2012 and the number is increasing. Patients and their families suffer from the diseases. It also left a heavy burden to government and society. This summer, we tried to solve the problem with our knowledge in synthetic biology.
The discovery of Nitric oxide (NO) as an endogenous signaling molecule and as a mediator of the cardiovascular effects was acknowledged by the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1998. NO activates sGC by binding to its prosthetic heme group and thereby catalyzing the synthesis of cGMP. As a critical second messenger molecule, cGMP regulates many vital homeostatic mechanisms, i.e. endothelial cell permeability, vascular smooth muscle contractility and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
Understanding of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway has initiated significant translational interest, but this was almost exclusively embodied by the use of NO donors and PDE5 inhibitors. NO donors are not ideal for chronic treatment of heart diseases because of partial patient response, development of tolerance over time and short retention in the plasma. The use of PDE inhibitors is also likely to be limited as the efficacy of such molecules is dependent on endogenous cGMP generation. We therefore thought that it may be beneficial to ‘think outside the box’ to target the NO-sGC-cGMP axis using molecular medicines.
3. Project
3.1 Over Expression of sGC
Dysfunction of NO signaling is related to many pathological disorders, such as myocardial hypertrophy, arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis and restenosis. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a critical enzyme in NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, which catalyzes the production of cGMP from GTP. In this project, we aimed to up-regulate the concentration of cGMP by the overexpression of sGC to enhance the function of NO signaling pathway. SGC is a heterodimeric protein, contains two subunits: α and β. Both α and β subunits have a few different isoforms. We overexpressed the α3 (GUCY1A3) and β3 (GUCY1B3) isoforms because they are the most abundant forms in the cardiovascular system.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics#fuben_-_-_TEXT.html," When going forward, perhaps sometimes we should also track backward, and the farthest we can go with rationality is the state of ``one'', whereas the ``Tao'' before that is not a thought explainable by scientific language.
     The verse could also be interpreted as a simplified paradigm on the formation of human perceptions. There is ultimately one thing, one idea, or one event that lies at the bottom of a series of issues, and this one thing was the first thing that entered the human psyche and anchored there. The rest, and the later, are but metamorphoses or projections of this one, and we cannot say we truly know ourselves if we do not delve that deep. However, the road to the depth is arduous and tricky; it's like the layers of dream in the movie Inception: the deeper you go, the more irrationality and instability you counter.
     The bottom belongs to the realms of psychology and some more arcane disciplines. ""Our psyche speaks in metaphors, in analogies, in images"". Such as, the myths. Though, should the word ""myths"" even stand shoulder to shoulder with the word ""science""? Perhaps not; they make an odd couple. For they differ too greatly in almost everything from contents to methods. However, with the phrase ""ethics of science"", then, maybe. And in some cases, definitely. Because ethics is fundamentally about humans, and since humans are composed of LARGE chunks of irrationality only plus SOME evolved rationality, we think some irrationality SHOULD be employed when it comes to the exploration of human problems. Science is a great feat, but it is not all of the story.
     Then we will use an example to demonstrate how to put this theory into practice. After all, the whole framework didn't reveal itself until we have finished with our project.
4. When ""Rewire"" goes Haywire---Ethical Concerns of our Project
Our project has a lot to do with artificial evolution, and artificial evolution has a lot to do with major ethic concerns of synthetic biology. The ""shoulds"" and ""don'ts"" about synthetic biology itself mainly ask one question regarding its ending: will the organism that you create end up beneficial, or malignant?
     People trust evolution, because it has been there for millennia. It makes humans what they are today, and it's so slow we almost think we will not see the day when it finally has anything to do with us during the short span of a lifetime.

Our project aims to use engineered tubulin proteins to screen microtubule-stabilizing anticancer agents(anti-microtubue agents). The strain we use to express the α-C-luciferase and α-N-luciferase is E.coli Trans5α, E.coli TransB(DE3) and E.coli Rossetta(DE3), which are not known to be pathogenic in immunocompetent individuals. Our product proteins are also easy to be degraded in the natural environment. They work in the lab condition and can show more light when microtubule-stabilizing agents exist, for this kind of agent can conspicuously stabilize the tubulin polymerization in vitro.
After a series of experiment accidents, experiment safety is now a noticeable problem in Chinese colleges. As a consequence, though our organisms and plasmids are relatively safe, we take many measures to ensure the safety of our project. First, we only culture the engineered strain in lab and the whole process is under strict control. This prevents the gene pollution. Second, we strictly follow the rules of experimental equipment we use, especially the High-Pressure Steam Sterilization Pot and the centrifuge, which take a risk to have accidents. Third, we follow the lab rules all the time:
No slippers and pants would be permitted in lab. Close­toed shoes will be worn at all times in the lab.
Gloves and medical mask is ordered when working in the labs, especially with some aerosolizing agents, such as SDS.
Hands must be washed before leaving the lab area. And lab coats will be worn when working with bacterial cultures.
No food or drink will be allowed in the lab.
All bench space will be wiped down with 75% EtOH before and after use, and be exposed to UV for twenty minutes before use.
All unnecessary equipments will be unplugged and removed from bench after use.

Luckily, the Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities (IETA) was held in Shenzhen on Oct. 13-15th. There is a software company fulfilled this proposal. It is worth mentioning that two leader of their team are people suffering from hearing disability. The application, named Deaf Life, can help with real time communication for hearing-impaired people and thus improve living quality of them. It was said on their website that, Deaf Life is not only a way for more people to pay attention to the hearing-impaired group, but also to attract more hearing impaired people to express their own ""voice"", to display their own talent and highlights. It also allows them to live better in our society, to the world, when communication with other groups is no longer an obstacle.” ( See more ).
On Oct. 13, excitingly, current Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the IETA and was especially interested in Deaf Life. He expressed his favor on entrepreneurships by people with hearing loss and also encouraged the public to care and support them.
The exhibition of Deaf Life on Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities. This APP drew great attention. They displayed the picture of the moment that Premier Li signed on the cartoon card for them in the middle of their exhibition.
We designed a lot of activities in common. As for now, we promoted their APPs on our social media. We will invite them to our school for a talent show and other activities. In addition, we sent them our booklets introducing ear caring tips and calling on public awareness on hearing loss.
He Yuhao chatted with the developer of Deaf Life APP.
We sent our booklets to Deaf Life group and team member, He Yuhao, together with other SUSTech students, took a photo with the establisher of Deaf Life and the cartoon figure of Premier Li of China.
Multiple Integration
At the beginning of our project, we set up our goal as sound visualization. We prepared for every part of our project based on papers we searched. We found that the sound receptor is the biggest problem for the construction of the whole system, while there is no direct receptor of sound on cell membrane.
During our Human Practice consultation, one of the professors, Fangyi Chen, who studied on artificial cochlea gave us a hint about looking for mechanically gated channels in human ears. Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent"

In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR Y42F mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM). For the Y42F mutant we observed the decrease of the specificity compared to the wild-type tetR sequence.
The enoLOGO we obtained for the Y42F mutant:
The measured binding affinities show no symmetry conservation and the contribution of the outer bases equals that of the inner.  These experiment will have to be repeated in order to get a clearer idea of the binding affinities.

II. Engineering Design: Implementation to Wastewater Treatment Plants
The wastewater treatment plant filtration system could be either a two or three step process. The first stage removes large waste particles for the second stage that biodegrades organic materials and remove toxic microorganism, and the third stage filters out fine particulates. We chose the second step or the aeration tank to be the optimal stage where our microbes can function, as it is the stage that deals with filtration on a molecular or microbial level.
(Center for Sustainable Systems, 2016)
After having discussed with professors and different experts at the water treatment facilities that we visited, we decided not to place our engineered microbes directly into the wastewater due to safety concerns. Instead, it would be better to use an external extension, containing our active microbes, that wastewater can pass through for microplastic particles to be degraded by the E. coli. Then the microplastic-free wastewater can flow back out into the wastewater tanks.
We chose the “Ram pump” as the most fitting extension for this design because it:
safely contains microbes in its closed system.
functions through fluid pressure and the Bernoulli’s law: does not require electricity or external power source to pump water.
Can easily be adapted or installed to the aeration tank or other sources of microplastic release, such as the washing machine in future projects.

   Comparing to technology equipped by clinics and hospitals, The use of adjustable aptamer and genetic modified microbes made JACOB more economical, adaptable, and stable. The integration of automated proceeding made JACOB more user-friendly and portable. JACOB does not need professional physicians reading results, behaving like glucose meter but less risky. In China it is likely to be deployed in units of household or local communities. Similarly, for United States the Food and Drug Administration classified the core mechanism of JACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though, Chinese in vitro diagnostic market is relatively new and have few competitors. Those few players can no longer support the concrete increasing demand for medical cares. Chinese government had ratified a great number of acts as well as guidelines and simplified documents examining and approval process to encourage innovation in the field of medical devices, which offers our team a great market environment.

“Gene doping will probably already be happening given the huge amount of money going on in this industry.”
Sports Coach Stirling
Due to lacking figures on actual gene doping use, unfortunately we cannot say gene doping is happening for sure. However, in this case the question should not be whether it is already happening, it should be whether we can afford not to worry. That is what we wanted to solve, because responsible innovation starts with anticipation.
Gene doping is a real problem. As the science improves the usage will expand. Testing is going to have an impact, in lots of diverse ways. This group have expertise and are willing to engage in transparent, open debate. I think @wada_ama and many others should talk to them. https://t.co/zrO6GQFSVz
— Paul Dimeo (@pauldimeo2) August 30, 2018
In the meantime many (conventional) doping cases keep being revealed. Doping use is not only a risk for athlete health, but also has a big impact on his or her competitors. We interviewed Moniek Nijhuis , a former professional swimmer, who participated in many competitions including the Olympic Games, winning many medals. In the video we made, she tells about her experiences with doping and what it did to her when two years after a competition it was discovered that one of her competitors had been using doping. All these reasons sum up to ADOPE, since every athlete deserves a healthy and secure future and a fair chance.
2. Current Gene Doping Detection
Up until now no gene doping detection methods have been actively implemented. However, several research groups have been working on the topic, both with nested PCR and WGS.
2.1 Nested PCR
Last year, an Australian research group published one of the first detection method for gene doping ( Wilkin, T.et al, 2017 ). This method relies on a technique called nested PCR. Nested PCR is PCR modified to reduce non-specific amplification due to unexpected primer binding. To do this, nested PCR requires two sets of primers that are used in two successive rounds of PCR. Here, the second primer set allows for amplification of a secondary target within the product produced in the first round.
However, gene doping consists of a plethora of possible changes in a plethora of possible genes. Currently more than 200 genes have been identified that are involved in the development of physical performance ( Moran et al, 2017 ). Together, they form a technical challenge that requires enormous versatility in the detection method design. This is where nested PCR, requiring 4"

There are biotechnology engineers from several countries of the world that belong to YB, for example, Mexico, United States, Philippines, Russia, Germany, Egypt, United Kingdom, among others.
As an undergraduate student, being part of YB has several privileges. These privileges are possible due to the outstanding student community that is part of this group. YB also allows members to meet people, share knowledge between students from other countries, join different organizations, plan events to involve the community, attend to events all around the world, between others. As well, this group is going to be made a civil organization in Sinaloa, Mexico so it could be an official national group.
We were amazed at all the benefits we could acquire and everything we could learn by joining YB. We decided to become part of it and try to give something back to people in our city, our state, and our country.
By joining, we hope to learn from students who have been part of this group for a longer time. We want to represent the young scientific community in order to keep engaging people into synthetic biology and actively participating with the society involving biosecurity topics, national and internationally. For now, Chihuahua’s YB team is still growing so when we are still thinking of ideas we want to do to involve the society. For next semester, the plan is to register Youth Biotech as a student group in LiFE since iGEM Tec-Chihuahua is registering as part of it, which will provide us with more facilities to work with the support of our college.
Below you can see a picture of the team members who decided to join Youth Biotech!

""The rich and almost infinite array of life on this planet also underpins our own survival.""
These were the words that the United Nations Environment Executive Director, Erik Solheim, said and that iGEM Tec-Chihuahua adopted to make a positive change in the society. We have noticed of the biggest concerns people have about science. This concern is that science and new technologies can cause a tremendous catastrophe on the environment.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food.

When R1, R2, R3, R4 and PA, PB in figure above  represent different protein coding gene or different promoter, as shown in the  table, various logic gates are realized.
3.2.2 Final design
 This complex pathway achieves the 'AND-gate'  mentioned in logic gate design. When there is no signal input, cI is expressed  constantly. If we add only signal B (3OC12HSL, which can activate Plas  promoter), Hybrid promoter Plas/cI is repressed by cI, thus no RFP can be observed.  With only signal A (3OC6HSL, which can activate Plux promoter), Plas/cI  promoter cannot be activated without signal B. When signal A and B are present  together, because of the activation of Plux by signal A, lacI is expressed and will  then inhibit the expression of cI, Plas/cI will be activated by signal B  without cI, then RFP can be seen.

While China's energy reserves are among the highest in the world, China is also the world's second largest energy producer and consumer country: after the United States and Russia, the energy production output of our country ranks third in the world, and the basic energy consumption accounts for one-tenth of world’s total consumption, which ranks second in the world. However, the level of energy resources per capita is much lower than the average level of the world.
Government
Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and the society. President Xi Jinping, at a speech at the UN office in Geneva earlier this year, stressed that ""ecological construction"" would become an important aspect of a shared international future. We have held innovation, coordination, green, open and share as our concepts of development; and we have already incorporated ecological environmental construction into the national development strategy. Energy is the basis for everything which can joint three spheres together.
Administration
National Energy Administration held mid-2017 working meeting, and pointed out that the first half of energy development was a good trend. We achieved our goals such as constantly optimizing the energy structure, supplying effective continuous improvement, making efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation and development, strengthening the construction and operation of agglomeration energy market more orderly and comprehensively promoting international energy cooperation.
They have put together projects to help people access green energy.
Corporation
There are hundreds and thousands of small energy plants struggling for finance, as most capital usually goes to big operations. To help them, Chinese government built a bridge so financiers could work out funding issues.
Professors & Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of Resources and Environment. He told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which was conducive to the smooth development of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in our experimental design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Evolved Synthetases for the Incorporation of Propargyllysine and p-Acetophenylalanine
For our toolkit, we decided to use the non-canonical amino acids p-acetophenylalanine (AcF) with a ketone group and propargyllysine (PrK) with a propargyl group. Propargyl groups can be used to form a covalent bond to azide groups in a click-chemistry reaction and ketone groups could form a covalent bond to hydrazide groups. Our aim was to provide two orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-synthetases (aaRS) which could incorporate these amino acids through the amber codon. Furthermore, we want to provide an aaRS which incorporates AcF through the less used leucine codon (CTA). This way, both amino acids could be incorporated simultaneously and at a specific position during translation.
We received plasmids from the Lemke group from EMBL in Heidelberg containing an evolved tyrosyl tRNA/ synthtase pair (tRNA/TyrRS) from Methanococcus jannaschii for the incorporation of AcF and an evolved pyrrolysyl synthetase from Methanosarcina mazei for the incorporation of PrK, both in response to the amber codon. We used Gibson Assembly to clone the tRNA/aaRS and the tRNA from these plasmids into pSB1C3 and replaced cutting sites for EcoRI and SpeI with site directed mutagenesis to provide these synthetases for the iGEM community. Furthermore, we changed the anticodon in the tRNA of the TyrRS tRNA to the anticodon for the less used leucine codon, so the new aaRS incorporates AcF in response to the codon CTA. An alignment of both evolved synthetases with the wildtypes is shown in Figure 1 (PrK-aaRS) and Figure 3(AcF-aaRS).
Figure 1:Alignment of the amino acid sequence of PrK-aaRS and the wildtype Methanosarzia mazei Pyl-RS.
The alignment of the wildtype PylRS from Methanosarzia mazei and the evolved synthetase for the incorporations of PrK shows only one amino acid exchange at position 124. Although this is the aaRS with the least amino acid exchanges of our toolkit, it turned out to be the most"

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Philo_-_-_TEXT.html,"ilemma, ‘playing god’, biosafety, biosecurity, etc). We did not only meet for lab meetings, but for philosophical evenings as well: Together with scholars from diverse fields of science, we discuss core philosophical aspects of synthetic biology, focussing on the ontology of the products of synthetic biology (see 'Chronicle of philosophical evenings' ). What do we actually mean by expressions like ‘living machines’ and ‘artificial life’? To answer these questions, we studied modern approaches of philosophy of language (e.g. theory of conceptual metaphors), philosophy of technology (e.g. ICE-theory for the ascription of technical functions), philosophy of biology (e.g. organisational account of biological functions) and diverse bioethical theories (e.g. Taylor’s biocentric position). Through our deliberations, we came to the conclusion that many apparent ontological and ethical problems concerning synthetic biology and its aimed products are actually epistemological and semantical ones, which arise due to its ‘intentional epistemology’ and the unreflective use of innovative metaphors such as ‘living machine’. Our analysis pointed out important epistemological deficits of synthetic biology such as the unjustified methodological principle of ‘knowing by doing’, a tailor-made notion of life and the metaphoric character of its main terms. Pablo Rodrigo Grassi, one of our team members, took the challenge and collected the different thoughts of our discussions building a coherent text:
'‘LIVING MACHINES’, METAPHORS AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS – Towards an epistemological foundation of synthetic biology
SHORT ABSTRACT
The analysis of the innovative term ‘living machine’ in this essay describes a novel argumentation, which combines advanced theories of philosophy of technology and philosophy of biology and allows us to make clear distinctions between organisms and machines. Out of the exposed accounts in the essay, is it justified to assert that living beings emerge and develop ‘naturally’ and are, in their development, under no circumstances dependent on human agency. This makes any ontological distinction between ‘living machines’ and ‘living organisms’ and between ‘artificial life’ and ‘natural life’ pointless. Therefore, it is not warranted to use hybrid expressions (e.g. ‘synthetic life’, ‘living machines’, ‘genetically engineered machines’) as proper terms; however, their usage as metaphors may be warranted. This essay argues for the reflexive and not constitutive use of metaphors in the language of the synthetic biology in order to avoid faulty inferences. On the one hand, this essay enables to allay the global unease concerning"

Public Concerns
In August, we go ""beyond the bench"". In order to get some feedback from non-professionals and assessing our project in a more exhaustive view, we went on street, introduce our project to the public and let them express their concerns. Among more than 40 people from all works, we collected more than 100 question relate to safety, policy, environmental impact, etc. Although we answered these questions briefly on the spot, we admit some of them was we had never considered before. Thanks to these questions which made us see our project in a different view, we generated lots of brand-new aspiration to improve our project as well as assuage public misgivings. Take the safety guard for example, a great number of respondents asked us about the potential dangerous of our battery: Will it explore or leak? Will it cause gene pollution?These inspired us to design the genetic circuit(Click here to for more detail) that works a safety guard.

We received a mobilizable plasmid (pK18mob) carrying Kanamycin resistance gene and OriT. Our purpose in to combine its conjugative capabilities with the Crispr/Cas9 system, so the final killer plasmid will be able to conjugate and to cut           a target gene (the RFP gene and Ampicillin resistance gene). So, from the pK18mob, we have inserted the Crispr/Cas9 system : the Cas9 gene, and a single guide RNA.
We have design two single guide RNA, to target the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene by Crispr/Cas9 system. The sequence was design in Benchling, and carry : cut/ligation sites at extremities, promoter pJ23119, the guide RNA           and the terminator. Three DAM site (GATC) was cleaned, to avoid methylation. This sequence was synthetized by IDT.

Construction Step 1: integration of Cas9 gene
From the plasmid pCAS, we have cut the Cas9 gene (4469bp with its promoter and terminator) with NEB digestion enzyme, and we have inserted it by ligation (with T4 ligase) in the plasmid pK18mob (3793 bp, received from C.E.N). We verify             the presence of Cas9 sequence insertion in our cloned bacteria by performing a Miniprep and an enzyme digestion to linearize the plasmid, and check its size.

Super Soldier Bacteria: Manipulation of Contact Dependent Growth Inhibition Systems
Antibiotic resistance is a well-known and pressing global health concern. In more recent times, there has been a stagnation in discovering new classes of antibiotic, particularly for gram-negative bacteria. Throughout the mid-1900s, scientists were rapidly discovering the current major classes of antibiotics using the Waksman platform, which entailed systematically screening soil and fungal microbes for growth inhibition. However, the recurring problem of rediscovery and failure of subsequent high-throughput biochemical assays led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon their antibiotic development programs. Current antibiotics are generally broad-spectrum, acting against symbiotic gut flora in addition to pathogenic invaders. Therefore, specificity has recently become a target in modern antibiotic development in order to bypass challenges of both rediscovery and indiscriminate killing.
The core of antibiotic development lies in targeting a molecule or pathway essential for bacterial survival. Bacteria themselves have already developed several mechanisms to both communicate and compete with other bacterial strains occupying similar niches, which can be exploited for the creation of new antibiotic drugs. While some systems rely on secreted signaling molecules, direct cell-to-cell contact is also used to mediate intercellular interactions. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one such system that allows CDI+ bacterial strains to outcompete closely related CDI− siblings by synthesizing and translocating a toxin through the membrane of strains expressing the appropriate receptor. The CDI system is common in many strains of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, making it a potentially suitable target for future antibiotics.
This type of growth inhibition was first seen in E. coli strain EC93, in which toxin delivery is mediated by the CdiA/CdiB two-partner secretion system and the outer membrane protein BamA, which is a conserved receptor among all strains of E. coli. EC93 is protected from its own toxin, located at the C-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities.

We are much honored to have Dr. JD Huang and Dr. JJ Wang as the frontiers in molecular biology research to share some of their views on genetic engineering and synthetic biology with us.
Here below are some extracts of our discussion.
HKU-HKBU = HKU-HKBU iGEM team; DR.H = Dr. JD Huang; DR.W = Dr. JJ Wang
HKU-HKBU: This year is the second year for our joint-universities team to enter to the iGEM competition. Why you decide to form a team to compete at iGEM again this year?
DR.H: We believe that providing hand-on experience to students is a much more effective way of learning than just asking students memorizing thousands of things from the book. They will understand and appreciate more when they formulate the questions, design the experiments, and perform experiments by themselves. .  In this process, they are applying their knowledge to make something real. Meanwhile, they will learn more cutting-edged developments in the research field and hopefully to develop their interest to purse research career.
DR.W: Adding to what Dr. Huang have just said, going to the MIT and doing a presentation in front of many experts is a dream to many others. This kind of achievement will be very impressive at one's CV, no matter if they choose to purse Science as their future career or not. We want to provide students with this opportunity to broaden their horizon and interact with many outstanding scientists. We hope to keep this competition as an annual event at our department.
HKU-HKBU: What experiences/skills do you hope our students can gain from this competition?
DR.H: Mainly, we hope the student can learn how to think logically. From brainstorming, planning and performing the experiments, they all require many patients and logical thinking . Students cannot learn how to think by just reading textbook but this kind of competition provides an opportunity to sharpen their mind.

Introduction
Science and technology have always been prompted by a desire of solving social issues. Thus, science would be nothing if it does not exist a relationship with people.
In this page we are going to show how we have faced integrated practices and we will give an answer these questions:
How your project affects the world and how the world affects it?
Is your work good enough for the world?
Integrated Human Practices
Feedback receiving: the key to the success
When creating a new scientific device, the existence of political, economic and social frameworks leads into the necessity of an in-depth analysis of how your creation would affect the world and how the world affects it.
As a result, our first step was to identify the real-life problems that could be solved with Printeria and so classify its application fields. To do so, we decided to employ a tip given by Israel (researcher at UPV)  the MIT market segmentation table . This table allows you to classify all users you think your product could be interesting to buy on the basis of several questions. Using it we analyzed Printeria potential users in accordance with our project values.
You can read the resulting market segmentation analysis and how it helped us to focus our initial approach by clicking here:
Market Segmentation analysis
As a result, Printeria main applications fields can be summarized as:
Education
With a friendly-user software, Printeria is designed to be an educational tool
Research groups
Printeria automatizes protocols, and enhances the experiments reproducibility.
Bioartists
Printeria offers a compact and friendly toolkit for the bioartist entire disposal
Thus, our main concern was how to fulfill the different stakeholder demands. Following our interdisciplinary spirit, we searched for continuos input"

    We measured more about the characterization of an existing part BBa_K515102(PA2652, malate chemoreceptor) .We did capillary assay to detect the response of E.coli to malate and succinate and different concentrations of each attractant and compare the result with our part BBa_K1405004 .
    We gave The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University a lecture, which covered synthetic biology, how to form a high school iGEM team and our program. After classes, they showed eagerness to participate in next year’s high school program and asked us to give more classes after the trip back from Boston. And visiting our lab motivated them to practice and learn more about synthetic biology. We also want to help them to build a senior high iGEM team in future.
    Collaborated and supported the iGEM14_Peking .We helped them to standardize a biobrick BBa_K1378001 expressing MlrA, a 28kDa protease found in Sphingomonas sp which can cleavage microcystins(MCs).
    Collaboration with iGEM14_Peking : As both of our teams focused on E.coil motility, we helped them with a motile model in which E.coil will diffuse freely to the algae. For more collaborations see our collaborations page.
Human Practice
    Bioethics analysis: We did surveys on environment impact using traditional nitrogen fertilizer and molybdenum fertilizer, and estimated the efficiency of our E.coli fertilizer. Integrated with our investigation of peanuts farmers, we evaluated the economic potential of our E.coli fertilizer.
    We communicated with Vice Professor Wang from Peking University Health Science Center to discuss Chinese Health Law, for E.coli related to environment health.

An experiment is designed to demonstrate that the genetic insertion does not damage the olfactory receptor neuron pairs. This is achieved by testing worms’ response to diacetyl and 2-nonanone. We assume that if the neuron pair is unaffected, the modified worms will respond to the chemicals as the wild types do.
To warrant the success of the experiment, we have 2 plans to form a chemical concentration gradient in the microfluidic chip.
Plan A: Use layer1 to mix the chemicals from the inlets.
Plan B: Input the liquid to the side channel in layer2. (Fig.1)
In this model, we only concern the situation in Plan A because theoretically this method can lead to more stable concentration gradient than Plan B dose.
Fig.1 The microfluidic chip We inject the chemicals in inlet 1 and water in inlet 2 to form the concentration gradient in layer 1 or inject the chemicals in side channel 1 and water in side channel 2 to form the concentration difference.
Considering the time consumption of the diffusion process, we need to determine the Delaying Time (the interval between the time of adding chemicals and the time that it forms desired concentration gradient in the bottom later and the worms can be added) in our experiment.
The Delaying Time is determined by two processes:
• We inject the certain chemical into the first layer to form a concentration gradient (Fig.2).
• Gas molecules diffuse downward across the PDMS layer and"

Project Description:
Our project for iGEM 2010 involves building a biological concentration band detection sensor and demonstrating its usefulness in building a bio-clock and color display unit.
The concentration band detection mechanism makes use of a pair of of promoters with different efficiencies to detect the quantitative value of the input signal.
The interplay between the sender, the repressor and the receiver.
Band Detect:
Previous Work
Being an engineering competition iGEM promotes building on previous projects.The Cambridge 2007 and 2009 teams built upon each other to produce the Sensitivity Tuner using phage activators and promoters.These Sensitivity Tuner's can detect different levels of a input signal and generate a corresponding output. You can find details of how the teams built and characterised their parts in the last years website .
Detecting specific Bands or concentration ranges
The sensitivity tuners do a pretty good job of detecting a signal above certain specific values each. However, they will still get activated when the next sensitivity tuner detects the input signal. For example, the construct BBa_I746370 will start detecting at 0.85 uM while the construct BBa_I746371 will start detecting at 0.92 uM. Both the constructs will detect the input signal at say 0.95 uM. Although this is good enough for detecting chemical concentrations, it will have to be able to detect specific bands to be able to perform concentration band specific actions.
The below diagram explains how we plan to use two sensitivity tuners in combination to get the band detect behaviour.The sensitivity tuners which detect different levels of the input signal will repress the output at levels below or above the band detect.
Proof of Concept and Characterization:
Generally speaking, there are two type of constructs to characterize: the sender system and the receiver system"

--CB MM TR-- Researched articles on the environment of waste water treatment plants and the possible genes we could knock out to prepare for our presentation on N.multiformis metabolism optimization.
http://www.jstor.org/stable/25035171
http://www.jstor.org/stable/25034119
http://aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_17/issue_5/0749.pdf
The first paper makes leucine out to be present in both raw sewage and sewage effluent. The second paper confirms this.
Focused our efforts on a unique gene knock out that would make N. multiformis reliant on the environment of the bio-reactor to grow.
The 2 gene kill switch is a terrible idea. If any mutations are made in the kill switch, the whole thing will fail. If any mutations are made in the repressor gene, the thing will die, meaning that evolution will keep this thing having the repressor switch I guess. In the one gene kill switch model, if any mutations are made, it will also fail. So yeah, a better plan is needed.  That plan is….auxotrophy! We’ll have to knock a whole gene out, which will be very hard for it to replace. This gene will be something that makes an amino acid, likely. This amino acid will then be derived from the bioreactor during its normal life span, so that if it ever leaves the bioreactor, it will starve to death. Dr. Grose said that glutamine would be a good AA to try, so we’ll have to dig some and talk to the metabolic team to see what kind of glutamine needs/synthesis capabilities this thing has.
Reading over a few articles now to see what the environment inside the bioreactor is like:
Asparagine has two pathways to create it. Asn supposedly has function in metabolism and storage of Nitrogen. That being said, we don’t want to knock it out.

Usage & Output
As a positional argument, the script needs a path to a folder where the results shall be saved. Additionally, the paths to directories containing reads filtered by iCG filter need to be passed to iCG model. At least the directory containing filtered reads with the unnatural base pair and one arbitrary natural base pair is required for program execution. A basic, abstract program execution looks as follows:
python2 iCG.py model PATH/TO/RESULTS -UBP PATH/TO/FILTERED/UBP-READS -NN PATH/TO/OTHER/FILTERED/READS
In the destination folder, "".model"" files containing the statistical model of the linear discriminant analysis are saved. These can be passed to iCG predict for base prediction of new Nanopore sequencing data. Dot-plots and statistics for the linear discriminant models are saved in subdirectories named plots and stats accordingly. Furthermore, plots of the signal traces at the position of interest are created for each group of reads used for model creation.
Further help regarding the usage of iCG model is given in the help pages that are accessible by passing the argument -h or --help to the program on execution. They explain every positional and optional argument in detail, including their default values.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

Ding: And there is a BBa_E1011, but it is codon optimized mRFP-1 gene in yeast. Ding: But I do not need this optimization. Ding: (screenshot, to show the information on the box on the right of the page) Ding: Actually I have found this part in the information box on the right of the page. Ding: Of course it is excellent overall, I have constructed a device according to the guide. Ding: (screenshot, to show the finished device) Ding: This device has only one part different from the actually constructed part.
Chen: I will check the database after a while. Chen: To see if there is something missed and update the database. Ding: You need to update at all time, this year many new parts will enter the iGEM part database. Chen: Would you like try some other functions? Ding: OK. Ding: I enter a common gene RFP but I unexpectedly get no result. Ding: It is really a problem.
Chen: Thank you for your remind. You know there are so many genes in the world, Restricted by time and finance, and even the quality of machine, we can not analysis all genes in the world. Ding: I can understand it. It is hard to integrate so many genes' data. Ding: But I do think that you should upload the common genes in the synthetic biology researching process like genes of fluorescent protein, different kinds of enzymes and so on. Chen: OK, because we are not major in biology, so we did not think about this when we did the text analysis. Chen: It is unavoidably imperfect for this edition. We will perfect it in the future. Ding: Yeah, it is just a suggestion.
Ding: I have not found any problems in the System page. Ding: In summary, this software is excellent, I guess it is the first software focusing on the searching of iGEM part. Ding: What you need to do next is enlarge the database, remove some bugs like unable to load picture, and change the part editing page, which I think is not so friendly. Chen: OK, thank you for your feedback. Ding: You are welcome.

BBa_K2868000
Composite Part T7 CsgA-6xhistag expression
Designed by Cale Lester. This composite part consists of a T7 promoter with RBS (BBa_K525998), followed by a coding region for csgA (BBa_K1583000) with a His-Tag expressed at the end, an ochre stop codon, and then a BglII cut site followed by a T7 terminator (BBa_K731721). The construct constitutively produces the amyloid-forming E.coli curlin-precursor protein csgA when restriction ligated into a backbone plasmid of choice. The his-tag allows for the protein product to be purified with standard his-tag protein purification methods. Because of the T7 promoter and RBS, for protein production this construct must be used in T7 cell lines like BL21 that produce T7 RNA polymerase. The SalI and BglII cut sites also allow for the replacement with a desired coding region after the construct is successfully in a plasmid backbone.
BBa_K2868011
Composite Part T7 CBD-6xhistag expression
Designed by Cale Lester. This part contains the genetic machinery to produce a chitin binding protein that is linked with a his-tag, with a T7 promoter and TE1 terminator.
BBa_K2868014
HHTC-Re
Designed by Advait Patil. This is a version of the peptide computationally designed by Kozisek et al. (Chemistry, 2008) to bind to copper (HHTC). This metal binding domain has had amino acids replaced for specificity, and has a flexible GSGGSG linker attached to allow for spacing for proper folding of the constituent domains in any fusion proteins being created.

Discussion 2: Risks and chances of community labs

Results discussion 1
Forecast
Within the next five to ten years synthetic biology will not change our life or our society completely. This scenario is mostly envisioned by some American scientists whose companies need big investments. Thus they have a crucial interest in the upkeep of “radical visions”. It will take much more time and development until synthetic biology could have such a big impact on society like computers, the internet etc.
Acceptance
Until now the socio-cultural advantage of synthetic biology is the possibility of lower production costs for already existing products. If somebody had to choose between two similar products he would not select the one manufactured with synthetic biology, except when the price difference is significant. The only chance to increase the acceptance is to provide additional products which cannot be made without synthetic biology. The consumer can see directly the benefit for his life and thus the benefit of synthetic biology.
 
Results discussion 2
Legal aspects
Against the general opinion in Germany that community labs can be founded easily, there are detailed laws concerning the fundation of a lab at home. These laws are very strict and make the establishment of  a biohackerspace rather difficult.
Risk
Community labs include the threat of bioterrorism. But this seems to be an emotional fear rather than a rational one. The creation of bioweapons has several big limitations. To get them weapon-grade, deep expertise and very expensive equipment is needed. For common citizen, both things are close to impossible to achieve. Community labs won't change this situation.
Advantages
A great benefit of “open science” is the verifiability of companies and scientific work. Broadly spread community labs would give the people the chance to make chemical and biological tests of water quality, food, medicine etc. It can largely increase the consumer protection if everybody is able to check the statements of companies etc."

6 Conclusion
Effect of pH on fluorescence output for cells with and without colanic acid
Background
RcsB (biobrick BBa_K200000 is the gene responsible for generating a colanic acid capsule around our bacteria. Having a colanic acid capsule around them will protect them from being degraded by the high acidic nature of the stomach environment.
Aim
Here, as proof of concept, we have designed a simple experiment that will show that colanic acid has a protective effect on our growing bacteria in acidic environments (simulating gastric conditions). The method is described below.
Experimental Method
In a multiple well plate, 2 different types of cell cultures were grown, both containing the BBa_I13522 construct, which is a constitutive promoter expressing GFP.  The differences were:
Some cultures contained colanic acid (chemically induced by p-Fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FPA))
Some cultures did not contain colanic acid.
Growth rate of the cell cultures and levels of GFP expression were monitored over time, at different Ph values in order to decide if induction using colanic acid provides extra protection to the construct.
Result analysis: GFP expression
Figure1: Illustration. Our bacteria contain a constitutive promoter expressing GFP and we are testing the levels of fluorescence
Colanic acid cells
Neutral pH
We can see that in the presence of water, cells with colanic acid give out a fluorescence output around values of 350000 to 400000. Cells can survive without difficulty at this pH so the output remains fairly constant.
Figure 2: Effect of neutral pH on cells with colanic acid for 3 different wells
pH - 3
When the pH is decreased, the fluorescence decreases after 70 minutes (Unlike what happens at a neutral pH). Overall, cells induced with colanic acid give out a higher fluorescence output than those that do not contain it.

CGU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CGU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"film could attract ink particles. The results shows that the biofilm may have the potential of attracting ink particles. Which makes the biofilm a candidate material of replace the flotation step in the reprocessed paper making. Flotation is another step which would cause enormous fiber lost. We are trying to build up a new paper manufacturing line, from the printing and ink producer to the customers. This will give an enormous change to human civilization and the environment.
Business Model
By improving the key steps of reprocessed paper manufacturing, we are looking forward to improve the whole paper making environment. We are creating a new business model that has new deinking and flotation technology, and also the participation of upstream and downstream factories and retailers. The ultimate goal is to reduce the deforestation caused by paper industry. If all the paper fiber can be reuse, and all customers accept to pay at a higher price to maintain this eco-friendly industry, we can reach a world without deforestation. To reach this goal, commercial and education promotion is necessary. The society must accept products with a higher price to support the changing process, the solution is to make eco-friendly a fashion, this will gives the product more value than it was. So the advertisement and atmosphere could bring big changes due to the behavior of people’s purchasing habits.
Society
All company should have responsibility to make the society better. Companies should participate in different kinds of service like education, long-term care, public science, emergency rescue, etc. The education of public would increase the buying motivation of all eco-friendly products. Meanwhile, education isn’t limited in adults but also children, this would not only leads to a better world, but also create Sustainable development cycle.
For educational purpose, we are planning on publishing story books and animation about eco-friendly and nature. For different types of customers, the promotion and education plan should fit to each one’s life. Building up an environmental as a fashion is important, once the customers would spend a relative high payment to buy an environmental friendly product, it would be easier to motivate the manufactures to change their production line. Making “eco-friendly’’ a fashion is an important issue to protect the earth. That is, only when company interacts with the society, the society can be better and the company can be more powerful."

Tongji iGEM×Fablab Shanghai Open Night
Tongji-China
We were delighted to be invited to participate in the Tongji iGEM×Fablab Shanghai Open Night，and together with the igem team of SJTU-BioX-shanghai, Fundan_China, Shanghaitech,Tongji_China, and the residents of the community to carry out a unique interactive show.
On July 30, we invited SJTU iGEM team to our school, visiting our laboratory and communicating with each other. Since this is the first time for our school to take part in iGEM competition, we have some problems on details such as project designing, modelling, human practice, whether the collaboration we carried out meet the requirements of iGEM, visa requirements, the Giant Jamboree and others, and as a university which has taken part in this competition for several years, SJTU gave us many valuable suggestions. They reminded us that LED light resource cannot provide full-spectrum emission peaks, and provided us with some advice on human practice and visa applying, which was of significant help for us.
We strived to use the simplest language to present our subject, so that non-professionals could also understand what we were doing. Women in the community who hold children, young people, even small children were also our audience.
To make everyone participate in different projects displayed, there was Q&A part followed. we have increased the mutual understanding of diverse subjects.     on the one hand, we understood the limitations of our own problems and shortcomings, on the other hand , we had better understanding of the spirits of the iGEM competition which is interpreted by different school.
After the Open Night and we exchanged our ideas. We also set up a live webcast and gave LIVE to iGEM teams in other provinces."
