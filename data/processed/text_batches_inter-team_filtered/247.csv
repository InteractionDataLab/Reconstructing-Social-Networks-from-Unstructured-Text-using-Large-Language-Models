You may plate one sample on an LB plate with antibiotic such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol, and another one on a plate without any drug. In this case, bacterial colonies will grow only on a solid medium without antibiotics.
    b.Positive control: protoplasts transformed with an empty plasmid
    This is a test control for a successful transformation and should yield lots of colonies on the plates supplemented with an antibiotic (here: tetracycline or chloramphenicol). If this transformation works well, but you have problems with the plasmid containing your target gene, the problem is most likely associated with your construct.
3.Induction of protein production
    3.1 Test protein production
    a. Prepare an overnight culture inoculated with B. megaterium single colonies from a plate (medium including antibiotic such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol) grown 14 h at 37 °C while agitation at 100 rpm.
    b. Inoculate fresh medium with overnight culture in a dilution of 1:100.
    c. Grow the recombinant B. megaterium cells in baffled flasks to an optical density (OD578nm) of 0.3 - 0.4 at 37 °C under vigorous shaking (250 rpm).
    d. Take a sample as control before induction.
    e. Induce the xylose inducible promoter by addition of 0.5% (w/v) of (D)-xylose.
    f. Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm.
    g. Withdraw samples every 30 to 60 minutes for OD578nm-measurement and protein analysis (up to 6 hours after induction). For extracellular protein analysis take 2 ml of cell culture. Intracellular protein analysis requires a higher volume than 2 ml of sample.
    h. Centrifuge each sample to harvest cells and cell free supernatant.
    i. For extracellular protein analysis store the cell free supernatant at 4 °C, and for intracellular protein analysis completely remove supernatant and freeze the cell pellet at -20 °C.
    3.2 Analysis of intracellular proteins
    a. Resuspend cells in 30 μl of lysis buffer.

We tested the 4 selected biosensors and control group with 0, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 μM Cu2+ induced for 20 min, and the result is shown below with logarithmic coordinates.
Fig. 4-7. The leakage expression of different promoters
Fig. 4-7. The leakage expression of different promoters
The figure shows the response ranges of biosensors with different promoters within 20 min. For most biosensors, the fluorescence intensity increases as copper ion’s concentration increases from 0 to 100 μM. However, when the concentration exceeds 100 μM, the responses of most biosensor become slow, and the fluorescence intensity decreases. A reasonable explanation is that high concentrations of copper can inhibit the biosensor's response within a short time.
Fortunately, we still found a biosensor who met the requirements of an excellent biosensor. EP-5 has a less leakage and a higher sensitivity. Its fluorescence intensity is lower than the control group by 17 units with no induction and is higher by 21 units with 100-μM-Cu induction. By aligning the sequence with the CUP1 promoter, we found altered bases mainly located at both sides of UASs and a deletion of one base even occurred between two UASs. We suspected that the change of sensitivity and leakage expression mainly due to the change of spatial distribution and the increase of A/T concentration, which both could influence the binding procedure of transcription factors.

DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
In our characterization of both primary and improved promoters, we found the effect of induction is not as obvious as expected (Previous iGEM team’s results). After reading some references, we found the activation process is related to the acetylation of H3 and H4 located at the CUP1 promoter, which showed nucleosome reposition and transcription factors binding might be the main reason for the activation. However, our biosensors were ligated on plasmid pRS416, which usually exists in the nucleus in a supercoiled state. There is only little possibility for a plasmid to binds to histones, so the transcription process shows less activation than that on a chromosome.
In the future, we plan to construct this biosensor on chromosomes to see whether the result will be more positive. Meanwhile, we will continue enlarging the response peak"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," and subsequently travelled to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, CRISPR/Cas9 was intended to cut and replace the faulty region of the HBB gene.
Procedure and Results
The team injected 86 embryos with CRISPR/Cas9, along with the other molecules required to replace the faulty DNA. The researchers then waited for 48 hours, by which time the embryos would have grown to roughly 8 cells each. Of the 71 embryos that survived, 53 were genetically tested. This revealed that only 4 of those embryos had seen their HBB gene corrected.
""If you want to do it with normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%"" says Huang, commenting on his results. ""That's why we stopped. We still think it's too immature"". In addition to their low success rate, his team found that CRISPR/Cas9 had caused a surprising number of off-target mutatinos in these cells, something that would have had potentially fatal consequences for a viable embryo. Huang suggests that the abnormal environment of the doubly-fertilised egg cells could have been responsible for the large number of off-target effects caused by CRISPR/Cas9, a case not observed in the experiments using human adult cells or animal embryos.
A Community Divided: The Backlash
Some feel that the report, published in scientific journal Protein & Cell, has crossed an ethical line. ""No researcher has the moral warrant to flout the globally widespread policy agreement against altering the human germline,"" Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the non-profit Centre for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, wrote in a statement. Edward Lanphier, president of Sangamo BioSciences in Richmond, California believes that the low success of this investigation should be enough to prompt a ban on such research using human embryos; ""I think the paper itself actually provides all of the data that we kind of pointed to,"" he says.
However, many people have arguments to support Huang's research. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, claims that the technology is not immature at all, and that the CRISPR/Cas9 ""kit"" used by Huang was not the most up to date version available. John Harris, a bioethicist at Manchester University believes ""It's no worse than what happens in IVF all the time, which is that non-viable embryos are discarded"". Harris sees no justification for a ban on research in this area, and argues that the technique could eventually be used in clinics, just so long as the potential harm of the treatment is outweighed by the"

Overview and Aims
CA1:Calibration Curves
TOP10 Growth
* To produce a calibration curve to aid in the normalising of absorbance values.  The relation of absorbance reading to number of cells varies with different cell strains. We are therefore doing one for Top-10.
CA2:External GFP fluorescence
External fluorescence
* To relate how the fluorescence observed can be correlated with number of purified GFP molecules
CA3:Internal GFP fluorescence
Intracellular fluorescence
* To relate how various intracellular concentrations of GFP leads to different observed fluorescences. This allows us to relate measured fluorescence from cells to actual GFP number

CRISPR-Cas9 induced PEX10 knockout
We have now observed that the colonies from pIW357 transformation into Y. lipolytica PO1f after SC-leu selection and outgrowth on YPD have different morphologies, a rose like shape, and a pearly shape. In consultation with Cory M. Schwartz we found out, that the pearly colonies are probably colonies with the PEX10 knockouts. We immediately restreaked, and made colony PCR and sent for sequencing. Unfortunately we will not get the final results before after the wiki freeze, but who cares, it finally works!!!
pSB1A8YL
This time the construct seems right! Now only the fluorescence microscopy will tell us if our construct works.                                   Aaaaaaaaand - it does!!!! Little autofluorescence on the negative, and clear, strong GFP signal from Y. lipolytica cells with the construct integrated! Luckily this data came in on the day of the wiki freeze!
Substrates
Both S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica show growth on oleic acid, one of the main components in canola oil. When S. cerevisiae can grow on this there must be some other reason it will not grow on canola oil waste. This shows Y. lipolytica to be at growth on complex waste streams.

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Recombinant Expression_-_-_TEXT.html," domains, and subsequently are combined with native silk proteins to form crystalline fibers, have shown some success (Sponner et al., 2005). In vivo co-spinning simulations have previously been conducted using the transgene in silkworms, producing functionally fluorescent N-terminal – GFP- C-terminal fusions that successfully incorporate into endogenous Bombyx more silkworm silk monomers (Kojima et. al., 2007). These N-Terminal and C-terminal regions are not only easier to clone due to their non-repetitive structures, but additionally allows for storage and assembly of endogenous ampullate spidroins (Askarieh et al., 2010). Composite silkworm-spider silk chimeras have shown improved mechanical properties, and may increase the ease in high-yield production due to the easier manipulation of silkworm silk monomers (Teule, et. al. 2012). Yet, this process still relies on the use of transgenic silkworms, which have longer developmental cycles, require larger storage and nutrient conditions, and difficulty to harvest relative to bacterial counterparts (Murphy et al., 2009).
An ex situ co-spinning process has been developed for the production of composite N. clavipes – B. more silk fibers with functional protein fusions in bacterial chassis (namely, laboratory strains of Escherichia coli ). This process results in the construction of a transgene that can be modularized using restriction enzymes to incorporate a wide range of functional peptide binding sites or other proteins, including avidin-biotin binding domains, RGD-cadherin motifs, albumin binding domains, or antibody affinity domains (Jansson et al., 2014). Specifically, this composite structure focuses on the ability to express functional sfGFP in silk fibers as a marker for successful co-spinning, and verifies proper NC-sfGFP expression using SDS-PAGE analysis.
A Standard Registry part encoding sfGFP (BBa_K515005) flanked by conserved N. clavipes N- and C- silk heavy chain terminal domains (NC-sfGFP) has been produced. This part is ligated in the standard registry pSB1C3 vector backbone, and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli cell cultures. Expression of the fusion protein is induced using IPTG, and extracts are purified using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) using a Ni-NTA Sepharose resin bed designed to pull down polyhistidine tagged protein constructs.

DREB1C: Cold Induced Stress Promoter
Plants experience a wide range of abiotic stresses due to their sessile nature. Plants have evolved many biochemical responses to stresses that range from cold and drought to salinity and osmotic factors. Substantial research has revealed a complex network of genes that work together during stress conditions. A key player in the abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis is DREB1 (Dehydration Response Element Binding Protein) a family of three related (A, B, C) transcription factors that bind to DRE (Dehydration Response Element), a cis-acting element that functions in ABA-independent gene expression, specifically as an up regulator of rd29A. Researchers have demonstrated that rd29A is up regulated in response to salt, drought and cold conditions (Shinozaki, 1998).
Plant cold stress responses in Arabidopsis have been shown to contain several pathways that are specific to abiotic stresses. The DREB1 family has been shown to be most strongly expressed in response to cold stress, salinity, osmotic, and drought stresses. Specifically, DREB1C has been shown to be most active in cold stress response, while DREB1A and DREB1B show expression patterns in drought and salinity as well (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2009). Promoter regions for the three DREB1 proteins contain six homologous sequences, or boxes, that correspond to specific binding motifs. While the specific mechanism of cold induction is not yet clear, DREB1C promoter analysis has shown MYB, and MYC binding sequences(Shinozaki, 1998)as well as evidence that the CAMTA3, calcium dependent protein, is involved in up regulation of the cold response (Thomashow, 2009).
While DREB1C up regulation shows significant increase in plant cold tolerance, an over expression results in dwarfism and stunted growth."

Antibiotics - Different antibiotics are used in order to “kill” bacteria which are not wanted for growing in the cultures. In our case, kanamycin is used so that only the desired bacterial strains with a pET28a plasmid will grow on the agar plates. For the BioBricking part, chloramphenicol is used to ensure that the every bacterial strain contains the pSB1C3 vector.

Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project. During this year’s final defense, we held a live on www.bilibili.com and invited team members from Shandong to watch it.
Figure 1. Timetable
From Marth to June, we held group meeting almost every week to study the outstanding projects in 2017 iGEM. Students were required to do presentations in the group meetings to help themselves understand the design and experiments, and A comprehensive test was used to determine the team member and reversed team member in this year. Experiments were started in July and continued to the last day before wiki freeze, with human practice and collaboration keeping in line with it.
Thanks to the attempts at standardizing team structure did by former SCU-China iGEMers and the help of our instructors and college, we generally form an inheriting structure, though it may cause that we have many team members every year. After a whole year’s competition, several junior students become group leaders who take control of the team organization, experiments and so on. Most sophomores in the team are developed form the reversed team member in the last year and they become the main part of our team if they determine to remain and pass the test mentioned above. Freshmen were encouraged to participated in winter training and were required to attend the group meetings. Experiments were mainly completed by juniors and sophomores while human practice was mainly accomplished by freshmen under the leadership of senior grades students.
Nowadays, SCU-China is not just an iGEM team but also a platform for students in Sichuan University to practice the experimental skills, to learn and understand the synthetic biology, to work together and to complete the project designed by ourselves. With the encourage of college, our education parts of human practice become easier to accomplish (see human practice). By integrating the competition into undergraduate education of college, we receive the great support from our Life Science College every year and we sincerely hope such"

Team Alberta had a great summer. Our exceptional wiki displays our contributions to iGEM and synthetic biology as we both learned to work with a new organism, Neurospora crassa and developed a standard assembly method for creating constructs for Neurospora. Our innovations will allow for the expansion of synthetic biology. For more information on our advances, see BBF RFC 82 .
Progress on our biodiesel development was delayed as we created our new standard. Team Alberta submitted DNA for two parts to the registry but has many parts in the works awaiting characterization and assembly into the biobricks format. It is our hope that our contributions to the development of Neurospora as a suitable chassis for synthetic biology will not be overlooked for sheer number of parts and that our successful advance to Finals will allow our Team to complete the characterization and development of our parts for future iGEM projects and for the advancement of synthetic biology into a new and exciting chassis.
Team Alberta contributed to three workshops with Team Calgary and Team Lethbridge. These workshops allowed for growth of the iGEM community within our province as well as for the expansion of ideas. Two of the workshops were geared towards project development and the last workshop was an opportunity to present our project to the other teams and receive feedback and ideas.

Best Human Practices Advance
Human practices are at the core of Team Alberta’s project. We aimed to remove the much divided food vs. fuel debate by using industrial and household waste products and convert these wastes into value-added fuel. The economic viability of our biodiesel is clearly conveyed in our Cost Analysis. Team Alberta recognizes the importance of outreach in the synthetic biology community. We hosted several high-school aged groups in our lab and one group of children grades 4-6, educating them on the concepts of synthetic biology and de-mystifying current practices.  In addition, Team Alberta met with several prominent figures from both the provincial and municipal governments to discuss synthetic biology and the future of alternative energy in both our city and our province.
An idea is good, but a working concept is better. Team Alberta laid down the foundations for developing a bioreactor. We plan to have a completed prototype before the Finals Jamboree in Boston.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," “Playing God”.
Safety is important at two stages- both during the development and production process, but also during the usage of the end product.  During the development process of the iGEM project all the safety requirements met the high standards imposed by the Technical University Delft and Dutch regulations. Yet, an important aspect rose by Mr. van Poel is that if (eventually) the ELECATRACE will be produced at a larger scale, all the developers should respect the same procedures. In this sense, our iGEM determined a set of safety requirements that can be followed by any scientists trying to replicate our work. This also applies to the one who will eventually produce it if it is to be produced on a large scale.
Next, the team should keep in mind the safety concerns related to the application. For instance one major threat is the fact that bacteria can escape from the laboratory.  In this regard, the E.coli strain needs proper investigation, to make sure it doesn’t pose any harm if it is released in the environment.  Justice is another important consideration metioned by Mr. van Poel. While some application might have beneficial impact for some people, others might suffer from negative externalities.  Sustainability is also mentioned as playing an important role.
Apart from the general issues, specific issues related theapplication includethe usage of gold nanopraticlesin the development of ELECTRACE. Many nanoparticles rousesuspicions for their toxicity and the real risk is often not known.
In addition, reliability of the biosensor is alsovery important. Given the fact that most of the experiments are done in the lab, there must be a tradeoff between the false positives and false negative. For this application false negative are worst than false positives. On the other hand, too many false positives will make the application unreliable, and it might not be used in practice.
We asked Mr. van Poel what would be the best ethical theory that could serve as a framework to assess our project. He advised our team that the most suitable method will be to evaluate the values of our application (i.e. safety, sustainability) and to look at conflicting values.
At the end of the meeting, we asked the opinion of Mr. van Poel, what would be the best method to persuade the mass-market on the beneficial applications of synthetic biology and to overcome the (possible) reluctance of people in using a synthetic biology approach in landmines detection.  His advice was to keep the process as open and transparent as possible. This advice is aligned with the iGEM contest that is an open source competition"

Project Riboregulator Abstract
Regulatory RNAs are RNAs that regulate biological processes on genetic and metabolic levels, and their importance has been established through the discoveries including those of RNA interference (RNAi) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). The elucidation of their mechanism has enabled their reverse engineering, transforming them into versatile tools in synthetic biology.
Riboregulators belong to a class of regulatory RNAs that controls translation by pairing of cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) RNAs. They have received attention from at least 7 teams during the early years of iGEM. For example, Farren Isaacs in 2005, iGEM 2006 UC Berkeley team and iGEM 2007 Caltech team contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry. Though there are more than > 100 riboregulator BioBrick records, comprehensive characterization information is missing. This hinders the iGEM community to compare and contrast different riboregulator pairs and evaluate their performance. For example, if we want to use the CR and TA devices that Berkeley 2006 made, we would not know which one to use and whether the device would work, because documentations were not put down in the Registry or wiki page and were therefore no longer accessible.
In light of this situation, iGEM 2014 HKUST team decided to embark on ""Project Riboregulator"", and we aim to:
Provide Characterization information on riboregulator BioBricks so that teams and labs will be confident in using these devices.
Summarize available information of existing riboregulators into a Feature Page and promote their uses.
Create a Catalog Page for all identifiable regulatory RNAs;

Best Education & Public Engagement
Special Prize
Lecture Series
The iGEM competition is primarily about research, but public relations work is also a very large component.
The biggest problem of synthetic biology is that even though it is a big player on the market, it seems like only a drop of information has leaked to the public.
This lack of knowledge leads to fears on all sides. Society seems to be mainly aware of possible risks and over the top doomsday scenarios that probably originated from genetic engineering discussions going south and overblown and over budgeted Hollywood movies. However, scientists fear the restriction their work will suffer due to new regulations that might be implemented. We think that an open and fact-based discussion can be very helpful for this issue. By educating the public, the advantages synthetic biology could bring can be shown to them. Also, there are a lot of things that still need to be discussed like the improvement of security and safety of the environment.
Therefore, we have made it our mission to inform everyone who is willing to learn about the topic of synthetic life sciences and genetic engineering. With a total of 4 lectures the topic was critically questioned and illuminated from different perspectives. Our goal was to sensitize the population to important and topical issues and help them to distinguish between truth and lies.
At the beginning of each lecture, we captured the general mood about the upcoming aspect of synthetic biology with a few questions. After the lecture, we asked the same questions again to analyze whether the lecture changed the opinion of the audience.
The first lecture was presented by our advisor Tim Blomeier and offered the audience a good"

Our 2016 iGEM team used existing Biobrick parts from the Uppsala team (BBa_K1033906) and also the Endy Lab (BBa_M0050-LAA, M0052-DAS). We were trying to further Edinburgh’s work by expanding upon their experiments with GFP and the degradation tags. We sought to do this by replacing GFP with the tsPurple chromoprotein and characterizing the ClpXP system. We attempted to characterize these previous parts but ran into some obstacles while working with them.
We first obtained the tsPurple sequence from the 2013 Uppsala iGEM wiki page. We ordered the sequence online from IDT, hydrated it, and proceeded to carry out the 3A assembly procedures to create our constructs. We had the tsPurple with no degradation tag, tsPurple with the LAA degradation tag, and tsPurple with the DAS degradation tag. The degradation tags were obtained from the Endy Lab sequencing and correspond to strong degradation for LAA and moderate for DAS.
We sought to improve upon the LAA and DAS degradation tags by showing their relative strength in degrading the tsPurple chromoprotein and we also sought to improve upon the characterization of the tsPurple gene so that its relative degradation may be present for anyone who needs it."

To explore these ethical questions and find out the public’s opinion on our project, we sent out a questionnaire to over 150 people, asking: If your doctor recommended a treatment for an infection, which involved the use of bacteria that had been engineered to treat the infection, would you use it? We also asked this question to a number of medical professionals during our visits to hospitals and clinics.
Whilst the majority of feedback was very positive, we did encounter some valuable criticism, as shown in the graph below. Most medical professionals we spoke to had positive responses, though one nurse had reservations about our idea.
This proportion of negative feedback, although small (6%), highlighted to us that our dialogue with the public needed to be improved, as well as telling us that getting our treatment recommended by doctors is the key to getting it used as common practice. We believe that, through improving people's understanding of our project, we can convince pessimists that genetic engineering is now a force for good. This also led us onto holding talks to student groups, which you can find in the Outreach section below. Nevertheless, this is very encouraging data for our project, and again highlights the importance of gaining support from doctors for this to become a realistic treatment option.
We also approached the public later on with a variety of different delivery option for them to choose from, including the idea of introducing free-living, genetically engineered bacteria into the urinary tract, alongside different catheter-associated treatments. 44% of the 50 people we asked were most happy with the free living bacteria, due to its effectiveness at treating the infection. This was by far the most popular option, followed by 20% opting to have the bacteria sealed within a catheter, since this balanced efficiency with safety.
The public’s biggest concern for this option is side effects from the engineered bacteria colonising the urinary tract. However, over 2/3 of the people who raised this concern said that they would be happy to use the method if they got a clear explanation of how it worked from a health care professional. Additionally, the concern was outweighed by the public’s opinion of having a safe kill switch, and that this treatment is the most effective. Again, full results can be seen here .
Safety Considerations for Free-living Bacteria
For the idea of introducing our engineered bacteria into the human body to be feasible, there need to be sufficient safety considerations in place. Whereas for the physically contained options, ensuring that if the bacteria escape, they die is important,"

Try to Synthesize 6dEB Naturely
Background:
6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, is a complex product synthesized through the action of a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS) by the soil bacterium S.erythraea [4].
Therefore, the enzyme system, which is in charge of synthesizing 6dEB, is also called deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS). The DEBS involves three polypeptide chains, including DEBS1, DEBS2, DEBS3, which have independent functions [6]. Correspondingly, the gene which codes DEBS, eryA, is divided into three, including eryAⅠ, eryAⅡ, eryAⅢ.
From the article of Pfeifer in 2001[4], it is feasible to synthesis and functional expression of the gene cluster eryA in E.coli, using the method which is mentioned in the article.
Now, let’s have a base understanding of DEBS [4].
DEBS1: containing Module 1 (KS-AT-KR-ACP) and Module 2 (KS-AT-KR-ACP)
DEBS2: containing Module 3 (KS-AT- ACP) and Module 4 (KS-AT-DH-ER-KR-ACP)
DEBS3: containing Module 5 (KS-AT-KR-ACP) and Module 6 (KS-AT-KR-ACP)
Besides, the whole PKS chain includes a Loading Domain on the N-terminus and a TE Domain (thioesterase)"

Part1:Construction of DDE equation
The ara operon is regulated by the AraC protein. If arabinose is absent, the dimer AraC protein represses the structural gene by binding to araI 1 and araO 2 and the DNA forms a loop. The loop prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter of the ara operon, thereby blocking transcription .When arabinose is present, arabinose binds AraC and prevents AraC from interacting. This breaks the DNA loop. The two AraC-arabinose complexes bind to the araI site which promotes transcription. When arabinose is present, AraC acts as an activator and promotes the translation of Cre. Then we use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells. The description of the system contains the above mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. readmore

We also characterise the biobrick of BBa_K274004
Firstly ,we found out that there's a point mutation in this plasmid. This mutation occurs in the Xba I restriction site which takes a lot of time for us just to digest it in order to ligase this part with our interested parts.
The following figure shows the unusual gel electrophoresis result which the Xba I restriction enzyme couldn't recognize the restriction site. As it is shown in the figure above, it is very obvious that the band is on the same position as the undigested one.
Figure 13. Compare our part before and after digestion to show the point mutation of Xba I.
In order to correct the mutation, we then design a primer as follows:
Figure 14. Design a primer to correct the point mutation.
This primer include the precise sequence of the Xba I restriction site. We then do Polymerase Chain Reaction to extend the remaining sequence and amplify the exact plasmid that we want.
Figure 15. Compare our part before and after digestion to show we correct the mutation successfully.
Last and the most important, we also notice something that this part is actually vioABDE instead of vioABCE.  In previous time, we failed in every attempts to clone out
vioC
from this part. We then decided to do DNA sequencing to make sure every single sequence is correct. Afterward, we found the exact sequence of vioABDE instead of vioABCE.
So far, we have already partially finished assembling our circuits. To achieve our goal, we will try hard in remaining days"
UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," we would have also incubated cells expressing Intimin-SpyTag with purified GFP-SpyCatcher, Intimin’-SpyCatcher with purified GFP-SpyTag and Intimin-GFP-SpyTag with Intimin-SpyCatcher cell lines for 15min pre and post light induction to visualize cell-protein binding and cell-cell interaction via fluorescence microscopy. We also included a His-Tag within all SpyCatcher construct variants to enable in-vitro analysis of complexes formed with SpyTag variants.
B. Post-translational light control of cell adhesion
As a quicker induction of cell aggregation, we aimed to develop a post-translational light-induced activation system in which cells are constitutively expressing either Intimin’ fusion proteins with SpyTag or an inactive version of SpyCatcher on their cell surface that can only bind cells expressing intimin'-SpyTag upon UV light (365nm) exposure (see Figure 5). SpyTag (13 amino acids) and SpyCatcher (138 amino acids, 15 kDa) form covalent isopeptide bonds and originate from CnaB2 (immunoglobulin-like collagen adhesin domain) of the FbaB protein, found in the invasive strains of S. pyogenes.
Only upon light exposure, the photocaged SpyCatcher will be able to bind SpyTag resulting in faster response than transcriptional induction of cell adhesion.
Figure 5: Post-translational light control system for cell aggregation. Cells are constitutively expressing an inactive photocaged version of SpyCatcher on their cell surface that can only bind cells expressing intimin'-SpyTag upon UV light (365nm) photolysis.
This is achieved by incorporating a photocaged unnatural amino acid (UAA), Ne-methyl-L-lysine (see figure 6), in place of the reactive lysine in SpyCatcher required for the covalent bond formation with the SpyTag aspartate residue. Upon exposure to UV light (20min, 365nm), the “cage” group in the unnatural photocaged amino acid is cleaved off revealing the native amino acid and a biologically active protein. This approach also adds a layer of bio-containment as cells will only function when externally supplied with UAA [5,6].

As depicted in figure 7, we introduced an amber stop codon (TAG) in place of the reactive Lys 31 residue (Lys31X) in SpyCatcher fused to"

Support by sending our Promotor Construct
We contacted SVCE_Chennai after reading their collaboration proposal on the iGEM Collaborations page. We realized we had many similarities in our project as both of us were working on pH as well as temperature regulated systems. The alkaline inducible promotor alx was actually the same. A Skype conference between both teams was organised, which gave us the chance to talk directly to each other and express any difficulties we were faced with so far. Since they had some issues with changing pH in their media, we helped them out by giving them some useful suggestions, like our protocol about what base we use and the concret amount of it to raise the neutral pH of LB and M9 media to 8,5 to induce the promoter.  Since they had some amplification issues with their gBlock, we also shipped them our alx gBlock so that they could work with it. At the end of the summer, they send us their data about how the promoter activity increased with the pH and as we had similar results, we came to the conclusion that our experiments were successful.
Augmented Reality at the Giant Jamboree
After seeing the post of the iGEM team Franconia on the official Collaboration Site, and declaring it as a very creative, interesting and amusing one, we decided to support them. They organise an augmented reality game for smartphones with the help of QR codes distributed throughout the Giant Jamboree. A ""plague"" breaks out at the event and the QR codes represent either ""cure"" or “infection” for the respective scanning smartphone. The goal of the game is that at the end of the conference, all virus outbreaks are cured. With little effort, this game can create a very special component of the Giant Jamboree 2017 and this is why we want to support and be part of it."

ZJUT-China,2018,Team:ZJUT-China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," discussion about the interlab study we did this year and now we have some feedbacks.
1.The interlab study protocol is very detailed and clear, we followed almost every step. But in some attempts, we tried to dilute the cultures in 96 wells plate, which is easier and quicker. So we do think improvements could be made to adjust the protocol.
2.The Excel sheets provide us an easy way to process our data. However, we still wish to know the meaning behind every function. It took us some time to search online, things would be easier if there is a guide.
3.The protocol tells us some principles of the experiment and it’s unbelievably helpful for us to complete the whole lnterlab study.
4.The kit needs a handbook to help those teams who participate in interlab study for the first time.

On August 8, 2018. We had a meeting with team jiangnan_China, team DLUT-China and team LZU-China in Jiangsu Normal University. By then we have already finished the interlab study successfully, but team jiangnan_China and team LZU-China met some difficulties. We provided them with some guidance and advice.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

Introduction To FY-07
Our Design
Description
0. Abstact
In the process of oil recovering by water injection method, it will form large water channels in the bottom. Water mainly flows through these channels, which stops brushing the oil hidden in the minor channel branches in soil, so that the remaining oil will be trapped into the branches. Our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (which is separated from a oilfield produced water and able to produce cellulose naturally), so as to controllably produce rhamnolipid and cellulose. Rhamnolipid is a biosurfactant with the ability to emulsify oil, so the oil can be easily washed out. Cellulose can clog large water channels, helping water enter into the gaps of soil and wash out the oil within them. Our project is aimed at improving oil recovery rate in the oil harvesting process using this kind of bacteria.
1. Motivation
Petroleum is the blood of the world industry and the pillar energy for the rapid development of the world economy. Oil, however, is a kind of non-renewable and limited energy resource. In recent years, Chinese demand for oil resources continues rising, some areas even appeared the situation where there is insufficient supply of oil resources. In order to meet the normal supply of domestic oil, crude oil has a high degree of dependence on foreign countries. In this condition, the oil recovery factor needs improving, while the fact is that in China the reservoir is sponge-like and heterogeneous whose pores vary in size and the crude oil is contained in the pores, which considerably increase the difficulty of oil recovery. Some oil fields are even abandoned after little exploitation compared with the whole oil content. Thus it is necessary to propose an efficient way to enhance the oil production. Before this, let us have a glance at conventional oil recovery measures.Primary oil recovery means the crude oil moves to the ground automatically by the earth’s crust energy. And then there is secondary oil recovery, in which crude oil is driven by efforts provided by other things such as water"

1. We have submitted 11 biobrick parts to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
2. Three new biobrick parts (our favourite parts) BBa_K537001 , BBa_K537002 and BBa_K537003 , have been fully characterised.
3. We have generated theophylline riboswitches that are able to successfully regulate the expression of CheZ and the Reporter proteins (Venus and mCherry).
4. The riboswitch-CheZ constructs that we submitted are ideal for N-terminal fusion to proteins of interest. These proteins, when fused to CheZ, can be shuttled towards sources of theophylline via chemotactic mechanisms that are restored by the riboswitch.
5. The two theophylline riboswitches that we have made (BBa_K537002, BBa_K537001) have been characterised using multiple experimental approaches. Datasheets for these riboswitches have been created by the team.
6. The riboswitches are modular devices that can be made to regulate the production of any downstream coding sequence. This is extremely useful in various synthetic biology applications.
7. A 46-fold and 8-fold increase in CheZ expression was shown for theophylline riboswitch 2 (BBa_K537002) and theophylline riboswitch 1 (BBa_K537001), respectively.
8. We managed to show that the activation of the theophylline riboswitches was sufficient to induced a theophylline concentration-dependent chemotactic response in non-motile, CheZ deficient E. coli mutants.

(C is a coefficient used to regulate the degree of regularization)
Coordinate descent:
The core task of this classifier is to minimize the cost function, coordinate descent is one of the methods. After trying several methods we've found that coordinate descent algorithm is the most appropriate one for our issue.
Given a differentiable convex function \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) , this method assumes that if there’s a value x0 that minimize the f(x) on each coordinate, then f(x0) is the minimum value of this function.
Coordinate descent starts with initial variable values: \(x=(x_1^0,\ x_2^0,\ x_3^0,\ ...,\ x_n^0)\), then loop k times for every coordinate respectively to find the minimum value.

Results showed that when transcribed correctly (Fig. 2A), sgR-1 and sgR-4 could successfully mediate the digestion of target DNA by Cas9 protein, while the negative control adding no sgRNA showing no digestion output. The binding efficiency was estimated to be between 20% and 70%, while the binding efficiency of sgR-1 is significantly higher than sgR-4 (Fig. 2B). Those results indicated that sgR-1 could be a better choice to be used in their project.

Secretion
Lactobachill has to have the ability to secrete our anti-inflammatory                       molecule to stop the IL-6 pathway once it has sensed an increase in the                       nitrosative stress levels of the body. To do so, we investigated in the literature                       about different secretion pathways that bacteria use and we came up with the                       Sec-dependent pathway, shared between many bacterial species. The transport                       of material from the cytoplasm to the extracellular matrix through this                       pathway is completely dependent on the Sec protein. The latter detects specific                       sets of signal peptides attached to proteins and carries them to the cytoplasmic                       membrane, where the peptide is cleaved and then the protein is released to the                       perisplamic region. We realized that if we attached one of these signal peptides                       to our heterologous protein, our microorganism would be able to secrete it.                       Before we adventured ourselves into the mysterious waters of using                       synthetic biology on the Lactobacillus genre, we wanted to try this strategy                       first in our model organism: E. coli as a proof of concept. To do so we designed                       two genetic constructs where two different secretion peptides (NSP2 and NSP4)                       were attached to the N-terminus of the fluorescent iLOV reporter protein,                       followed by a histidine tag to facilitate purification of the reporter and further                       detection assays. Both constructs are shown in the following figures:
Figure 1. Genetic construct for the characterization of the NSP2 signal                       peptide. The T7 promoter precedes the iLOV fluorescent protein which has the                       Sp2 attached to its N-terminus and a His tag attached to its C-terminus.
Figure 2. Genetic construct for the characterization of the NSP4 signal                       peptide. We can observe that the expression of the iLOV reporter is regulated                       by the T7 promoter and that the protein has the Sp1 in the N-terminus and a His tag in"

Fundraising
As high school students, we need to spend much more money than we first expected, so we started fundraising on the website http://www.qschou.com. We initially decided to collect ￥25002, fortunately we have got ￥26613 so far. In the web page, we introduced iGEM to the public. Besides, we described some of the parts of our project, such as the aim. We posted some pictures about our team members when they were doing experiments in the lab as well as conducting human practices. We also appreciated the support of sponsors. :)

Kevin transformed the CBAR product into DH10B and plated it. Hannah worked on developing a document that condenses all of the protocols used in the lab. Victoria worked to develop new primers for building the main construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Chris and Hannah began work on new Chemically Competent DH10B cells. Hannah completed PCR runs for her new primers that arrived today.
Tuesday, June 26, 2012 The transformation from the CBAR reaction Kevin did yesterday proved to be successful, and produced many colonies. Six of these were chose and cultured. They will be tested to see if they contain the complete construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on ligating components for the Codon Optimization Project. They also grew cultures containing components they would need later on in the assembly. Hannah ran PCR on some new segments of her final construct that just came in. These were later run in a CBAR. This new set of components would be better and produce the desired construct.
Wednesday, June 27, 2012
The cultures from the CBAR for the Multidirectional Promoters Project were mini-prepped and tested to see if they contained the correct components for the final construct. The gel to check this unfortunately did not set correctly and the cultures needed to be redone. Fortunately, Kevin had made a backup. Some additional colonies were also cultured to expand the search. Hannah worked on the sequencing primers for the Multidirectional Promoter construct. She also continued work on a document combining all of the protocols we use in the lab. Kait and Victoria completed digestions and ligations for the construction of their construct for the Codon Optimization Project.
Thursday, June 28, 2012
Cultures from the Multidirectional Promoters Project CBAR reaction were mini-prepped, again. 4 additional colonies were prepped to expand the search for the correct construct. These were then digested in preparation for use in a gel to confirm length. Hannah ran PCR on components for the Multiple Start Codon construct. She also inoculated cultures with colonies from one of her new CBAR reactions. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on their own PCR runs to make the new Codon Optimization construct.
Friday, June 29, 2012
Hannah ran another PCR for one of her new G-blocks. She then mini-prepped cultures from her CBAR reaction. Some of the colonies seemed to be red, indicating they had taken up a plasmid with at least some of the desired components. Kait and"

EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH
An interview with David Jorge, the Delegate of Students of the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) and student of the School of Agricultural Engineering and Environment took place. There, an idea to complete the new technologies education of Agricultural Engineering degree arose.
In order to tackle this situation, a group of ‘Spontaneous Generation’ was proposed to be created, inside a program which embraces the major part of students groups in UPV. Thus, ChatterPlant and Open Agriculture devices were considered to complement the student's education, contributing not only in agriculture itself but also in social areas.
FUTURE APPLICATIONS
After studying the social acceptance of ChatterPlant, it was considered how it could affect to the evolution of the cities. In the next 20 years, society could radically change. FAO have really interesting studies and predictions about it. In them, it is shown the evolution of the cities to transform into megacities.  If the pilot project works, ChatterPlant could bring different benefits to future society in different ways like:
Climate and temporary-independent cultivation.
Higher quality of the product.
Reduction of fruits and vegetables shippings from productor places to far consumption cities.
Gathering all this information, we realize that we had to contact with architects. It was thought that contacting with architects involved in ‘Asociación de Sostenibilidad y Arquitectura’ (ASA) an urbanism association focused on  working with sustainability, would be necessary. That is why two meetings were performed. Firstly a meeting with Daniel Ayala, vocal of the association was performed, and secondly a meeting with Eva Álvarez, architect and teacher of our university, also member of the Spanish association of sustainability and architecture were done.
The main conclusion obtained was:
Application of ChatterPlant in communities to make them self-sufficient, obtaining more sustainable cities.
This application could be carried out in several ways:
In private houses and communities.
In neighborhoods.
In business with the scaling up of the project.
In public buildings as the next step of Urban Orchards.
This possibilities were studied. Implantation of ChatterPlant could be done in building basements, in special community rooms, in a given building of a neighborhood, to make all of them self-sufficient. Another possibility is having a business with a large ChatterPlant extensions to feed a great part of the city. Finally, in every free space of urban environment. This last"

Characterization of BBa_C0051, one of the most widely used and studied parts
Bba_C0051 cI-Lamba, the promoter in disguise During the construction of one of our larger pieces of the spatial oscillator, the ON switch, we stumbled upon an unexpected phenotype.
The RBS-RFP in this picture is actually RBS-RFP-F1610, but for simplicity purposes and purposes of explaining what's going on, we have illustrated it as RBS-RFP
The Problem
Our scanned image of our plate with colonies containing RBS-C0051 ligated to RBS-RFP-F1610.  Click above for the full-screen image.
Our intermediate ligation of RBS-C0051 to RBS-RFP-F1610 produced a red phenotype but it has no promoter! Sequencing results available here.
Since Bba_C0051 is a highly studied and widely used part in the registry, it presents a huge problem not only in the context of the spatial oscillator but also in the 76 parts that utilize it throughout the registry.
This exciting new find causes many problems in our design and must cause malfunctions in a huge number of parts entered and used in the registry.
The Investigation
We began by sequencing the DNA of the red colonies from the ligation of RBS-C0051 to RBS-RFP-F1610 in order to rule out the presence of any promoter or mutation. The sequence analysis revealed that we did indeed have the correct sequence.
Further investigation into Bba_C0051 showed that the part not only contained the coding region, cI, but it is also followed by an LVA degradation tag and a barcode. When looking further into the RBS (Bba_E1010), we found that it also contained an LVA degradation tag and a barcode after the RFP coding region.
We then conducted a number of experiments in order to determine which part or combination of parts contained in the construct caused this unwanted promoter-like behavior.
After determining the cause of the unwanted transcription, we continued to conduct a number of experiments in order to measure the results.
A Starting Point
Our scanned image of our plate with colonies containing RBS-RFP-F1610. No abnormalities here! Click to enlarge.
The previous step in the construction of the on switch was RBS-RFP-F1610. Sequencing results available here.
This construct clearly exhibited a white phenotype. No abnormalities here!

Collaborations with Other iGEM Teams
We collaborated  with two iGEM teams, National Yang Ming University (NYMU) and American School in Japan (ASIJ).  We mentored the ASIJ-Tokyo high school iGEM team, which is a new High school iGEM team this year. We taught them how to start and structure a new team, what lab and online resources to use for experiments, and how to set up a lab notebook. In return, they helped us test our nanoparticle calculator by running simulations from the standpoint of a patient, doctor, and manufacturer.
We also continued our long standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). Three students from our team have been interning on the NYMU-Taipei team (they are members to both teams) to learn about synthetic biology and some basic lab techniques.  Two of these students will be presenting for the NYMU_Taipei team presentation. NYMU-Taipei also hosted a summer camp for our team members, where they taught us about different aspects of iGEM. In return, we helped them increase the efficiency of their model using equations from their literature research and ran simulations using their experimental data. Finally, they also gave tremendous advice on troubleshooting our cloning procedure during the summer months when we ran the majority of our wet lab experiments. We really value the relationship we have with NYMU and look forward to more collaborations in the future.
These collaborations not only created opportunities for us to help each other with problems, but also allowed us to exchange ideas and stimulate creativity. It is also fun to share stories about lab work, successes, and even failures.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#drylab_-_-_TEXT.html," in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.
Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and manufacturing of fishBIT for mass production. Additional testing will be conducted as we plan to apply for FDA approval of the device. The HMS will be prototyped extensively to develop a more efficient design, and its mobile app will continue to be streamlined.
Components
The fishBIT system combines the simplicity of standard fish tags with the novelty of a synthetic biology treatment.
The plastic harpoon region is designed to ensure that the tag remains in its host under most forces. Its center has been hollowed out to allow contact between the host interior and our synthetic biology treatment. Moreover, this plastic is an FDA-approved biocompatible material to minimize risks to the host.
The silicone-based biocompatible tubing houses the treatment gel. It also serves as a marker to determine how much gel has dissolved.
The bright red gel consists of the entericidin protein contained in FDA-approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). This copolymer dissolves readily in most fluids, and its properties can be easily altered. Furthermore, both the protein and the gel are both environmentally safe; the peptide is ubiquitous and the gel degrades easily.
Our tag applicator is designed to be used just like conventional applicators, but with added comfort and easier handling.
fishPHARM is currently working on an alternative, more efficient applicator that is inspired by firearm trigger mechanisms.
Each fishBIT starter kits comes with 20 fishBIT tags, a tag applicator, a vial containing our novel flavocide, a needle, a syringe, and an information booklet.
Fabrication & Assembly
The fish tag was 3D printed instead of manually fabricated for increased prototype precision. The Freeform Pico 3D printer from Asiga was used to print the fish tag for its high resolution printing abilities. The fish tag applicator, however, was machined in Cornell's Emerson Lab machine shop out of aluminum. A tube with an inner diameter of 1/16"" and outer diameter of 1/8"" was attached to the back of the fish tag to hold the hydrogel. A syringe was used to insert the hydrogel into the tube, and a clamp was placed at the end to prevent hydrogel escape. The fish tags and applicators, along with the peptide hydrogel, was packaged into a starter kit for distribution to fish farmers.

BLASTing against the Biobricks
When setting off on an iGEM project, it is important to know what parts you are interested in using have already been biobricks and are available in the initial distribution. Searching through the huge numbers of parts by text query is pretty laborious and you sometimes miss the parts you're looking for. Instead, we thought that searching the Registry based on the sequence of a part would be a more direct route.
We coded a python script that will take a sequence and use the BLAST executables to find the most similar parts (or parts of parts) in the current registry.   The code for this program is available on the iGEM Software github repo: NYC SOFTWARE REPO
Our goal was to offer a web-based method for easily browsing through these parts, but at the time of the wiki freeze we do not have this online. Check This Location to see our progress.
Or check out the BLAST utility currently residing on partsregistry.org -> Registry BLAST . This tool will compare you query sequence against those in the Registry, but the interface of the output is relatively simple and is not interactive.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.

Interview
Part I
The meanings of CUPID project
“How your work affects the world and the world affects your work?”
Through Human Practices, iGEM teams consider whether their projects are responsible and good for the world. This concept runs through our project obviously.
This year, we focus on desertification control by seeking alternative  solutions. In the process of designing project and carrying out practices, we learned about how to solve practical problems on combating desertification, and constantly adjusted and optimized our project.
In September 2017, we got in touch with the key laboratory of desert and desertification, Chinese Academy of Sciences.They provided us the desert sand samples which we need badly for our experiment.
We kept a long-term and friendly connections with the them and received many insightful suggestions and disacssions to better improve our project.
“CUPID” means “Cyanobacterial cellulose prevent increasing desert”. We hold the strong belief that our work will contribute to the desertification control in the world.

The isolated plasmids were digested with NcoI for 1h 20 min and further analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.
Results
Restriction of the isolated pMa12 with NcoI; the lanes contain the digested pMa12 in the order of the picked clones 1 - 15; clone 9 was negative; the lanes between the restrictions and the marker contain the isolated pMAD but it appears to be empty.
The most clones contained a plasmid that has only one NcoI restriction site. The expected size of the pMa12 should be around 6.6 kb. All fragments are of the expected size.
13.40 Restriction of pMa12 (isolated from Clone 10) with SacI and NcoI
Aim: create fitting ends to anneal the promotor oligos.
The isolated pMa12 of clone 10 was used for a restriction with SacI-HF and NcoI. The restriction leads to fitting ends for the designed oligos which are the promoters we are about to test: PargJ and PykuO. The restriction is incubated at RT over night.

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"1) Lactate-pyruvate interconversion
Lactate is constantly being converted into pyruvate and vice versa within the bacteria. According to the work of Hakala, Glaid and Schwert (1995) , the interconversion process can be modelled as follows:
where [Py], [L], [O] and [OR] refers to the concentrations of pyruvate, lactate, diphosphopyridine nucleotide and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide respectively. t stands for time. All of the remaining variables are constants. Hakala, Glaid and Schert (1995) 4determined these parametric constants to be
Note the assumptions inherent within the constants. By the conservation of particle number, it is clear that:
2) Lactate interaction with LldR
LldR represses the production of alanine racemase inside the bacteria when bound to either O1 or O2 promoter sites. However, upon being bound to lactate LldR will cease blocking the O1/O2 promoter sites. This interaction can be modelled by:
The disassociation constant of the lldR-lactate complex was taken to be 1000 (μM)2. It is believed that the rate reaction constants should be on the order of μM, so all of the relevant constants have been set that.
3) Production of alanine racemase
Before the production of the alanine racemase can commence, the mRNA sequence of the alanine racemase must first be transcribed. This reaction is modelled by the following equation
where [mRNA]  and [P] are the concentrations of the mRNA and freed promoter respectively. kt and kdeg are rate constants of transcription and degradation respectively, both of which are estimated to be 0.1 μM/s. The production of alanine racemase is then modelled via
where [alr] is the concentration of alanine racemase. kp is the production rate constant and kdeg2 is the alanine racemase degradation rate constant. Both rate constants are also estimated to be 0.1 μM/s. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, a bug remains in the model. The von Neumann numerical instabilities inherent within such models are typically problematic. At this moment, the issue lies with the result of a transient solution – transient states of the model can cause numerical singularities quickly. More work must be devoted to deal with this matter.

Progress and Lab Work
Introduction
In order to effectively model genetic circuits, databases of parts with known characteristics are essential. Without such databases, computationally designed circuits may not be feasible to implement in vivo. Unfortunately, parameters such as promoter strength, RBS affinity, transcription, translation and decay rates are hard to find in the literature, and those which do exist are rarely measured under standardised conditions.
Several efforts to produce parts libraries are currently underway. As part of our contribution to synthetic biology, we decided to create a promoter library for B. subtilis.
Novelty in this sub-project
The novelty in this sub-project lies in the generation of a large number of B. subtilis promoters, based upon carefully considered variations to an existing promoter region. We chose the promoter region of the transcription factor SigmaA, since it is the most widely-used promoter in B. subtilis. Over 300 genes are controlled by SigA. Their promoter regions have highly conserved -10 and -35 regions, surrounded by variable sequences.
Design

We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 4). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 4: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets. A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the E. coli DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site. B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ (the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output, for the four simulations (Figure 5). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low"

Interview conclusions were:
Science and art should start walking in the same pathway. It is very important for all different disciplines to start hybridizing. Scientists should count a little bit more one creative people to give a fresh and a different point of view.
Ana is always into trying new things so she would love to use Printeria for exploring the idea of working with microorganisms.
Printeria should think about working out of the petri dish. Not just using colourful bacteria for painting but trying to mix them with different compounds. Or even, in the future, for synthesizing fibres or even textiles out of bacteria.
Printeria could be sold not as a product for our daily lives but for science schools or even to institutions that do fab lab. So, if anyone wants to use Printeria for an art project, you just go to some of these institutions, you pay a fee and you can use it for a given amount of time.
Safety by design
Paris-Bettencourt 2012 team was right when they said in their page ""How safe is safe enough?"": “Biosafety is an exciting design challenge, an essential enabling technology for synthetic biology, and a fundamental ethical obligation of all bioengineers”.
This sentence describes perfectly what we did with Printeria.  Printeria was designed to ensure safety for all audiences, to be safe enough for the world. In the next table you can see different safety problems we saw with our instructors help, and how we solved them.
Table 2. Safety problems solved in the design of Printeria.
Safety Problem
Solution
Sterilization of the PCB
How do we clean the PCB without damaging the metalic and plastic components? Well, we decided to copy what flow cabins do. Based on this  we decided to use UV led lights to achieve this objective. Furthermore we have programmed an especial reaction that use little droplets with HCl and ethanol to clean and ensure we have perfectly sterilized the PCB.
Sterilization of the microfluidic tubes
The reaction fluid is going to pass through microfluidic tubes and it will contaminate them, to reverse this situation we will use the same special program wich usses droplets with ethanol and HCl.
Protection of the user
We want the user to see what is happening inside Printeria but also we want them to be protected if something wrong happens inside. Thats why we thought that a metacrilate box that cover the machines would be a nice option. Besides, it is useful to pin up the elements which will be part of Printera.

Retail Price
Our manufacturing cost is upwards of £120 per unit therefore the Darwin Toolbox will have to retail upwards of £400 for the revenue to cover the total cost, including yearly overheads as well as unit production cost.
Operating expenses
Break-even Analysis
At this point in the start-up, our financial predictions are estimates. We modelled the break-even point based on 3 different scenarios with combinations of our total cost - considering unit production cost and overheads - and revenue.
Table 1. Break-even point analysis
The ideal scenario for our start-up would be low total cost with high return, allowing us to break-even with the production of 450 boxes a year.
Graph 1. Break-even point analysis of low total cost, high return
Limitations
There are several limitations to our modelling of the break-even point:
We assume that our overheads will be constant, whereas this is very unlikely as within the first year we will be manufacturing boxes ourselves and conducting focus groups to improve the product.
We have excluded reagent supply to avoid making a multi-product prediction and assuming that the amount of reagents and boxes would both be constant.
We have not made allowances for changing financials environment

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"L of our bacterial cultures. We used the following protocol.
We performed CFU analyses each day by depositing 5µL spots of contaminated media on specific MCK plates. The results are presented bellow.

2 Experiment
3 Conclusions
4 The Temperature-Based System for E. coli: SafetE.coli
4.1 Overview
Controls
Figure 2.1 - Negative Control
Due to the lack of time, we were not able to conduct these experiments in triplicates and for a longer period of time, which would be required to obtain solid results from which conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, these experiments allowed us to formulate some preliminary conclusions. First, in our negative control (corresponding to samples of uncontaminated environments plated on MCK plates without antibiotics), we observed a very limited number of bacteria in all our samples except for the freshwater sample. This number also appeared to be stable in time, suggesting that the population of the micro-organisms that grew on our plates remained stable during the time of our experiment.The important bacterial growth observed for the non-filtrated freshwater is surprising and inconsistent with the results obtained for the other samples. It will be necessary to repeat this experiment to check whether this is observed reproducibly.
Before interpreting the results of our contamination experiments, it is important to remember that we did not observed the growth of any micro-organisms from the various environments tested when antibiotics were added to the MacConkey medium.
Figure 2.2 - Positive Control
We used LB medium for our positive control. We can see that during the first few days, the E. coli population is growing, before stabilizing. It should be noticed that for Day 9, we have only one measure, because of manipulation errors (wrong dilutions) with the samples LB+ PhB1393 and LB+PhB1396.
Figure 2.3 - Isotonic water
Figure 2.4 - Sterile water
Our controls of E. coli strains in isotonic water or sterile water shows that they survive perfectly well in these environments.
Figure 2.5 - Filtered fresh water
Figure 2.6 - Filtered sea water
When we filtered our water samples, we eliminated all the micro-organisms present in these environments. We observed that on the whole, the number of laboratory E. coli bacteria in these two environments remain stable for the length of the experiment.
Experiment
All the environmental samples contained various organisms (as demonstrated by the pre-test), so these three experiments are close to the environmental conditions (as the temperature or light"

Figure 14: Design of EspP autotransporter-based cell wall proteins presenting biotin or biotin-binding proteins for gram-negative bacteria.
The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig. A [25] ), and here we ""bricked"" it down into RFC[10] and RFC[25] BioBricks. At first we tested different inducible bacterial promoter systems (e.g. ""TetR repressed GFP""; BBa_K577893 ) that are available in the parts registry, but when we saw that two of the available systems did not work in our own hands, we decided to built the system on our own. We used the Tet-Repressor generator that was available on the distribution plates ( BBa_I739001 ) as we believe that it is very important for the standardization in SynBio to use available parts. Downstream of this repressor generator we designed and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA [26] ) from E. coli that has a 3' RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick. As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter. In our project we used the same extracellular domains as for the eukaryotic receptors: enhanced monomeric Avidin (eMA; BBa_K2170204 ), single-chain Avidin (scAvidin; BBa_K2170205 ) and a composite part composed of a N-terminal Biotinylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and a C-terminal NanoLuciferase (together shown as BAP; ; BBa_K2170118 , see Fig. B). Further downstream our design features a A3C5-epitope tag that can be recognized by a high affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [27] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli [28] [29] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator. For the termination we again chose a well working terminator from the distribution"
Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"metrical digest reporter (K880003) in the vector pSB3C5 based on the inversion region found in K137058 was co-transformed in 10-beta E. coli (NEB) with strong, constitutively expressed FimE (K880005-K137007) in the vector pSB1A2.   Colonies as well as broth subcultures of co-transformants were analyzed for inversion using the asymmetrical digest assay [1] .  The asymmetrical digest reporter and fimE are present within the co-transformants; however, the asymmetrical digest reporter remains in the uninverted state (Fig 5, lane 3).
Fig 5.  A representative electrophoresis gel of the asymmetric digest assay of K880003 co-transformed with FimE.  Lane 1 is a 100bp Ladder (NEB), lane 2 is K880003 transformed alone, lane 3 is K88003 co-transformed with FimE, and lane 4 is FimE transformed alone.  Uninverted K880003 yields a 357bp band as seen in lane 2 and 3, while inversion induced by FimE is expected to result in a 255 and 238bp band.
Observation of IRR and IRL Orientation:
Scrutiny of the DNA sequence provided a possible explanation of the negative results.  As constructed, verified by sequencing, the orientations of IRL(K137010) and IRR (K137008) within the inversion region of K137058 were orientated 180º when compared to the natural fimS region (Gally et al., 1996) and a previously engineered recombinase systems (Ham et al., 2006).  This resulted in the IRL and IRR being oriented such that the external half-sites are localized adjacent to the inversion region, while the internal half-sites are located externally (Fig 6).  We hypothesize that this 180º orientation of the IRL and IRR is the determinative factor to the inversion negative results.

In fact, N1 and N2 interact with each other to form a blocked di-domain (N1G1N2). The binding of N2 to the tip of the bacterial F-pilus releases N1, which becomes free to interact with its receptor TolA (TolAIII).
The C terminus (CT) of g3p anchors the g3p in the phage coat by interacting with phage coat protein 6, at the tip of the phage. Its seem that phages are released from the bacterial membrane by a two-step mechanism involving a short C-terminal fragment of g3p.
N1, N2 and N3 domain are linked by flexible glycin-rich domains (G1 and G2). G1 is composed of four tandem copies of the sequence Glu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser. In a recent study it has been showed that it may have an active role in F-pilus-dependent infection.
Fusion of peptides or proteins to the N-terminus of intact g3p does not compromise infectivity of the phage, but insertion of polypeptides between N2 and N3 appear to reduce the infectivity.

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," at the Luxembourg's garden
Marin and Carla went with their camera to the Luxembourg's garden in Paris to interview parisians and know more their opinion about synthetic biology. A very unique and sometimes funny experience to get in touch with the public this way. A great way to spend a sunny saturday in a very parisian style: in the gardens. Marin was in charge of editing the video.
Communication
Naiane was in charge of the social networks such Facebook and Instagram. Marin was in charge of Twitter. Naiane was as well in charge of the photography. She also contacted the Paris-Saclay Media in order to promote the iGEM Competition and our team's project inside the Paris Saclay Complex.
Carla designed the team's logo and the marketing strategy with the romantic thematic ""Get DNA Closer"".
Project and Biobrick design
In order to build our project we had to do a lot of bibliographic work and meet researchers who helped us to develop the project.
Dr. Olivier Espéli, a reseacher and an expert in Genome Dynamics studies at the Collège-de-France, accepted to receive Victor, Manhaz, Marion and Philippe. The main purpose of this meeting was several to exchange informations concerning the guideline of the project, more precisely: to discuss about a reporter system (visualisation tool) and which area we should target (for instance: ter site or replichores right).
Dr. David Bikard, a reseacher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and an expert on CRISPR/Cas9, received Victor, Caroline and Léa. He helped our team by choosing which orthologous dCas9s to use in our project, in order to maintain the sgRNA/dCas9 recognition specificity.
Caroline, Léa, David Bikard and Victor
Our project was split in two parts: Visualisation and Linking Two DNA Strands. For the visualization part, Caroline, Charlène and Léa made all the bibliographic research and designed the biobricks.  Maxence, Victor, Coline and Manhaz were in charge of the linking tool part of the project.
Financial support
Yacine and Carla were in charge of contacting different companies which could potentially support the Paris Saclay's project and the trip to Boston. Alice, Marion and Fabio met a scientist from Mondelez Company who asked a presentation of our project ""Get DNA closer"".

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,": design of our dumbbell-shaped probes and gRNAs, preparation of                           our probes, Rolling Circle Amplification and Cas12a assay for detection. The final paragraph deals with our conclusions and future improvements of our assay.
Probe and gRNA design
As shown extensively in Detailed Design , we were able to understand the reasoning behind the dumbbell-shaped probes designed by Qiu et al., 2018 and Deng et al., 2014 . We translated the analysed structure to our probes for Cas 12a, designing 6 new probes which were tested in addition to 4 probes from the above-mentioned                       groups. This implied modifying the template structure in order to contain the PAM sequence for LbCas12a, as well as designing specific gRNAs.
All the probes and their amplicons were successfully tested with available softwares ( NUPACK , Mfold ) and the absence of unwanted                       minor secondary interactions was verified in all cases.
Probe preparation
The dumbbell-shaped probes used for Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) of miRNA were prepared starting from linear DNA oligonucleotides (details on the sequences can be found in the Design ).                             A phosphorylation step was performed in the presence of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase in order to obtain the phosphorylated 5’-end necessary for the ligation. Ligation was then performed using T4 DNA ligase, with the unsealed DNA                             templates being digested by means of Exonucleases I and III. Agarose gel analysis suggests that the probes were successfully ligated (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Agarose gel for the ligation of probe 2. 1st lane: 100 bp ladder, 2nd lane: non-ligated product after digestion by exonucleases, 3rd lane: ligated product after digestion by exonucleases. Ligated probes are                               resistant to exonuclease degradation.
Amplification
By the end of our project, we were able to show that our probes could successfully trigger amplification in the presence of let-7a-5p, with results comparable to those achieved by Deng et al., 2014 and Qiu et al., 2018
The presence of the amplicons was verified by means of agarose gel electrophoresis: as shown in Figure 2, different designs of our probes were able to start the RCA reaction in the presence of miRNA being in solution with a concentration                       of 1 μM. For lower concentrations the results on the gel were not as clear, but amplification"

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," crop does not contain a resistance gene specific to the infecting race of Pgt, the fungus is said to be virulent. (Identification of wheat gene Sr35)
In order to test for the presence of Pgt spores, we propose a two step mechanism: detecting and profiling.
The detection aspect of our project will produce a signal alerting farmers of the presence of Pgt spores, regardless of virulence. When the germinate, Pgt spores form infectious structures that contain branching filaments called hyphae. Ribitol is a byproduct of metabolism that is unique to the hyphae of Pgt. (http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-97-1-83;jsessionid=Zt-p98IKAXdL_e4fAQ0Ny6Cy.x-sgm-live-03) By transforming E. coli B-12, which does not naturally respond to ribitol, with a plasmid carrying a promoter induced by ribitol directly upstream of a fluorescent protein, we aim to detect the presence ribitol and therefore Pgt. (A non-antibiotic marker for amplification of plant transformation vectors in E. coli)
The profiling component of our project aims to distinguish the virulence of the race of Pgt present. The resistance genes present in the wheat crop can be expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and engineered to produce a signal when they recognize the avirulence factors. We hope to demonstrate this recognition using the Sr35 resistance gene and the AvrSr35 avirulence factor, however it can be applied to various genes specific to the crops. (Variation in the AvrSr35, yeast two hybrid, biomolecular)
Coupling with the two mechanisms together, we are able to discern for both the presence of Pgt as well as if the strain is virulent to the crops. If a signal is produced in the detection step but not profiling, the race of Pgt is virulent."

Teams of previous years constructed various composite parts containing two or more enzymes of the synthetic pathways (e.g. CrtEBI, CrtEBIY), but they are not available on the 2009 Distribution Plates.
We put K152005 under control of constitutive promoter (R0011) and transformed the construct into E.coli TOP10 cells. However, the plasmids seemed unstable (the colonies streaks on solid agar plates were inconsistent in colour) and the pigment production was low. This indicated that a different strain of E.coli might be needed for pigment production.
Create our own devices by standard assembly
Given the information at hand, we decided to adopt the following general strategies:
Create a lycopene-producing device (with enzymes CrtE, CrtB and CrtI) by standard assembly of Biobricks K118014, K118006 and K118005.
Create a β-carotene-producing device (with enzymes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI and CrtY) by standard assembly of Biobricks K118014, K118006, K118005 and K118013.
Put the above two constructs under constitutive promoter (R0011) and arabinose-induced promoter/Pbad (I0500) and test the effect on colour production.

After constructing our devices, we conducted restriction digest (cut with enzymes XbaI and PstI on Biobrick prefix and suffix, respectively) to check that the sizes of the inserts were correct. The results are as follows:
Biobrick Number
Size of insert (kb)
Size of backbone (kb)
