Figure 12: Meeting with Prof. Thomas Noll and Ole Weigelt Group picture after a beneficial meeting about possible marketing and commercialization strategies for our EluX technology. From left to right: Yannic Kerkhoff, Prof. Thomas Noll (co-founder of Xell AG), Ole Weigelt (co-founder of Xell AG, lawyer and tax consultant) and Christopher Whitford.
Prof. Noll and Mr. Weigelt both stated that our idea has a high innovation potential and could be used as a new purification method. As examples they named the very fragile factor VIII and proteins A and G due to their expensive column material. Since the iGEM idea is based on making your research open source, sharing your results with the whole community, Prof. Noll and Mr. Weigelt said that an intense scientific analysis of the method is more adequate as commercializing it. Both encouraged us to pursue our idea properly and to continue the work even after the competition either by ourselves or by handing over our results to other students of our university, who could analyze this technique in degree theses.
Both experts pointed out how multifaceted our concept is, as it includes basic molecular biology, cell development, photometry, linker design, cleavage kinetics and media optimization. Eventually, Mr. Weigelt and Prof. Noll advised us in testing the range of wave lengths and light intensities suitable for the cleavage of the target protein without harming either the target protein or the affinity tag. We thus started some investigations into how the UV-light could potentially harm our proteins.
Meeting with Dr. Florian Richter
For our modeling part of the project, we decided to use the powerful ROSETTA software. One of the protocols necessary for our work, the Enzyme Design Protocol, was developed by Dr. Florian Richter from Bayer AG. As the protocol is very complex, we asked Dr. Richter to give us an introduction to the protocol and discuss possibilities to model the evolution of a tRNA synthetase to a non-canonical amino acid. Hence, we joined Dr. Richter on the 28th of July in Cologne. Besides providing some technical details, he gave us many valuable tipps on what to consider, theoretical challenges, and required time. Specifically, he advised us on relying not just on algorithms, but also using our chemical expertise to sort through sequences of possible synthet"

Collaborations
Collaborations and the exchange of knowledge were important aspects during our iGEM participation. Therefore we had an intensive collaboration with the iGEM team Groningen (Netherlands) and laid a high priority on the exchange with the Rathenau Institute also located in the Netherlands. In addition we also took part in the Interlab Study of this year´s iGEM competition.
Interlab Study
Background:
The aim of the Interlab study was to evaluate three devices consisting of different Anderson promoters fused to GFP in two different backbones: the high-copy plasmid pSB1C3 (100-300 copies/cell) and the low-to-medium-copy plasmid pSB3K3 (20-30 copies/cell). The devices were distributed by iGEM and the flourescence evaluation method was free of choice. For more details check: Interlab Study@iGEM
The devices:
Device one: BBa_I20260 consisting of J23101-B0032-E0040-B0015 in the backbone pSB3K3
Status: ready for evaluation

Development of the Project
 
In order to test the expression of foreign CDI systems in DH5-α and Enterobacter aerogenes, we need to express each CDI system on a plasmid. We first received two recombinant E. coli strains from the Hayes lab located at the University of California, Santa Barbara: EPI100 with  pDAL930, containing the CDI system from EC869, and X90 with pDAL660, containing the CDI system from EC93. Our next objective was to transform electrocompetent DH5-α with pDAL930 and pDAL660 to see if we could express foreign CDI systems in DH5-α. We performed competition and aggregation assays on the transformed DH5-α, using the strains obtained from the Hayes lab as positive controls and ampicillin resistant DH5-α as a negative control. Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing two CDI systems derived from Enterobacter aerogenes in DH5-α individually and performing the same set of assays. These CDI systems must be isolated from genomic DNA and constructed into plasmids using Gibson assembly and overlap PCR. We plan on fusing the CdiA and CdiB genes from Enterobacter aerogenes with the CdiA-CT and CdiI genes of EC93, and inserting this chimeric construct into a pSC101-derived pSK33 backbone. Successful colonies are screened using CPCR and sequencing.
 
Protocols
 
Competition Assay
Purpose: verify inhibitor strain is properly expressing CDI system
Inhibitory strain (CDI+): bacterial strain transformed with designated CDI system
Target Strain (CDI-): native bacteria without immunity or bacteria containing appropriate receptor
Positive Control: strain confirmed to properly express the CDI system and can properly inhibit the target
Negative Control: the inhibitory strain lacking any CDI system
At each mark, plate ten-fold serial dilutions in a M9 salt solution or SOC from 1:1 to 1:1,000,000
Not all dilutions may be needed; determine experimentally
Plate 100 µL of the culture on each plate

DNA binding to TALEs
The target DNA's are colored red, non-target DNA is green, TALEs are black and after binding (i.e. saturation) they turn blue. The sliders under ""global settings"" are parameters needed before the simulation runs. Given that a simulation can take 30 seconds to complete, they should not be changed frequently as it will take longer to show the results. The sliders under ""display settings"" are parameters needed after the simulation runs. Their responses are much faster and are best played by clicking on the plus sign to the right and hit ""Play"". If you only see a grey box, you may need to install the Mathematica CDF Player. The download link can be found here . Otherwise, the data from our model, as well as images of the app we designed, can be found on the quantitative modelling page .
Enzyme kinetics of horseradish peroxidase
The sliders above the plot are parameters you can adjust to this kinetic model of horseradish peroxidase. By moving to the right you increase the corresponding parameter and immediately you should see the response on the plot, colored blue. The red line is plotted at the initial conditions when you run the model. It is included so that by comparing against it you see the effect of the change in the parameters. For a quick feel of the model, click on the auto-run button on the upper-right corner.

Linkoping_Sweden,2015,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Knowledge Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," allergic to nuts or peanuts.3 43% of the                     participants, estimated that 5 % of the Swedish population 4-18 years old have nut or peanut                     allergy. While 33 % of the participants estimated it to be less common, 1 out of 100 children or                     less, and 24 % estimated that nut and peanut allergies are even more common, 1 out of 10 children or                     more. There was no significant difference in estimations made by those who have and have not studied                     immunology or allergology.
LiU iGEM aims to create awareness that nut and peanut allergy, actually are more common than many                     think. Food allergies over all are an increasing health issue in several countries in North America,                     Europe and Asia, and the number of children affected have been estimated to have doubled between the                     years of 1997 and 2011.4,5,6
Participants were asked whether they thought that nut and peanut allergies are more or less common                     globally than in comparison with solely Sweden. 66 % of the participants thought that the ratio of                     nut and peanut allergies in Sweden were above the global average, which was the correct conclusion.                     It has been estimated that 4 % of the world population has some kind of food allergy, but the                     prevalence of food allergies peak in the Western countries.7,8,9
Severity and symptoms
Participants were asked to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening                     acute allergic reaction. Symptoms presented to the participants were hives, cardiac arrest, facial                     swelling, dizziness, stomach pains, elevated pulse and heart rate, runny nose, itching throat and                     breathing difficulties. All symptoms presented are symptoms of a more or less severe allergic                     reaction. The symptoms of anaphylaxis varies from person to person, but usually starts with an                     itching throat, followed by stronger symptoms such as swelling of the lips, stomach pains including                     vomiting and diarrhea, dizziness, chest pain and breathing difficulties. Severe anaphylaxis causes a                     drastic drop in blood pressure and elevation in heart rate which in its turn can lead to                     unconsciousness and cardiac arrest.10 The survey showed that it is rather common knowledge that                     anaphylaxis affects the respiratory tract and causes breathing difficulties. As well as that some of                     the first symptoms are swelling and itching of the face and throat. But it is rather few that know                     that the critical symptoms actually are those that affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular                     systems. It is important to understand the severity and recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis"

Sample C,D,E,H,J,L and N to be transformed.
Day 4
Growth and Culture of Bacteria
Plates incubated overnight show that vectors corresponding to C,D,E,H,J,L and N were taken up [however, later we find that ligation had failed, and so gBlocks C,D,E,H,J,L and N were never inserted]. There are at least 5-7 colonies for each biobrick.
Choose three colonies from each plate. The colony should not be too small or too large and should be reasonably spaced from the others.
Separately incubate each colony in test tubes overnight.
This process would significantly increase the amount of plasmids containing biobricks that we want. Plasmids can be extracted later.
Transformation of J and G (24/06 PCR Product) into competent E. coli cells
Competent cells are already made in stocks and can be found in the -80℃ freezer: we don’t need to prepare them again. J and G comes from repeat PCR done in Day 3.
Primer Design
Since A, B, F, G, I, K, M have repeatedly failed to be PCR-amplified, longer primers were designed to replace the old primers for the PCRing of these gene sequences.
Primers that would give the sequences new restriction sites to allow their insertion into pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB expression vectors were also designed.
Day 5
Plasmid Extraction
pSB1C3 shipping vector containing gBlocks from Day 1, as well as blank pSB-1C3 shipping vector, pBAD/HisB expression plasmids, and pBAD33 expression plasmids were extracted from overnight cultures of E. coli DH5 using E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I.
(refer to pages 10-12 for Mini Kit protocol. Some special notes:
All optional steps were carried out except equilibration step.
After centrifugation in step 2, the tubes were pulsed before the excess supernatant was removed through pipetting.
Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step 6 the tubes need to be tightly capped once solution II is added.
The precipitate formed in following step 7 does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension"

Results
lamB- Infection
lamB - cells were successfully infected by λ phage while constitutively expressing the lamB receptor.  Furthermore, the level of infection directly correlated with the level of lamB expression , suggesting that phage infection was limited by the presence of lamB receptors.  Next, lysogens were selected using chloramphenicol resistance. The presence of the lamB/tetA construct within the lysogens was confirmed with colony PCR. This plasmid was successfully removed via tetracycline counterselection [10]. This procedure successfully established a lysogenic strain lacking the lamB receptor and thus immune to phage infection.
Figure 3 - λ Infection of Constitutively Active lamB Constructs. Constitutively active lamB (Table 1) was used to augment the lamB- phenotype in JW3996-1 cells. Cells were titered with a known high concentration stock of phage 1x1010 phage/mL. The efficiency of infection of lamB constructs can be seen through the observed phage concentration after titering. Zero plaques were observed for the J23113+33 construct.
Figure 4 - lamB Infection vs lamB expression level. Infection levels for the constructs in Figure 3 plotted against the expression levels recorded in the registry for the Promoter/RBSs used.
rcsA Induction
Overexpression of rcsA led to induction of λ lysogens. rcsA was placed downstream of an AHL inducible promoter and overexpressed through induction with 10 nM AHL. Following induction, phage concentration in the supernatant was recorded through titering. This concentration was compared to the phage concentration in the supernatant without rcsA overexpression, given by a construct where rcsA is not driven by a promoter. The data show a 40 fold increase in phage concentration between the promoter-less rcsA construct and the strongest AHL induced rcsA construct (Figure 5, columns 1 and 4). The promoter-less rcsA construct should accurately represent background phage levels for the lysogen absent of any rcsA expression.    Further work was done to characterize the response of the AHL inducible switch under three different RBSs.  The data show induction efficiency is directly correlated with strength of rcsA overexpression ("

Overview
Based on modeling work, we find that negative feedback can contribute to the network’s adaptation to DNA copy number variation. So we analysed the following three-node networks, A and B. The difference between A and B is the output nodes of network A has negative feedback. We transfected this two circuits into mammalian cells (Hela cell). By testing the mean value of EYFP (Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein, the output of our circuits), and the relationship between the EYFP and the DNA copy number, we can prove the hypothesis.
Construction
We constructed the following circuit A ,B and C .The circuit A corresponds to the network A ,while the circuit B is the implementation of network B. Circuit C is used as a control design to testify the function of A and B. In circuit A, as we can see, the input is miR-21, which can repress the plasmid pz371 and K1116002(The plasmid’s information can be found in parts). K1116002 induced by rtTA and Dox, serves as an auxiliary node, producing the LacI gene to inhibit the expression of EYFP. EYFP(Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein )is used as output. Besides, the miR-FF3 restrains the expression of LacI. The reason that we get the most of post-transcriptional control can be seen in Supplementary text. In circuit B, however, the plasmid K1116003 does not have FF3 target, leading to the contrast between circuit A and B. We can see miR-21 can’t target at pZ349 and pZ331 in circuit C , that is, there is no input in circuit C. The miR-21, used to distinguish cancer cell from normal cells ,is endogenous in Hela cell.

miRNAs function as posttranscriptional regulators which have distinguished features compared to transcriptional regulators, intervening late in gene expression process, with the capability to counter"

Parts
Here is a summary of all the parts we submitted this year. Details and characterization data for each can be found on the respective parts.
We improved two TALE proteins from the Slovenia 2012 iGEM team and submitted them in an inducible system (LacI) with a His-6 tag such that they can be easily expressed and purified. We also submitted binding sequences for these, both in separate plasmids, and on the same plasmid.
We also designed two of our own TALEs (TALE A and TALE B) to bind to pathogenic E. coli genomic sequences.
We submitted the E-coils and K-coils which can be used as connectors for scaffolding proteins that cannot be fused together. We submitted these coils in the Friedburg assembly backbone such that other teams can easily create fusion proteins with them.
We submitted two new reporters: beta-lactamase and ferritin to the registry. We also submitted these with 6-His tags in an inducible system (LacI) such that they are easy to express and isolate.
We submitted our fusions of: TALE A with beta-lactamase and TALE A with ferritin in order to have detector-reporter constructs.

DESCRIPTION
Cloning
The pUC19 part and the gBlock fragments was amplified using primers with USER tails, and fused using USER cloning (See Figure 3).
The USER reactions was transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells, and purified. The identity of the product was checked using PCR, restriction analysis (see Figure 4) and sequencing (data not shown).

DESCRIPTION
Testing
After having confirmed the identity of the plasmid, we set out to test its functionality. This was done by: 1. Testing the plasmids replicability and selectivity in Y. lipolytica and 2. testing the plasmids cloning capabilities in E. coli.
1. Replicability and selectability in Yarrowia lipolytica
The pSB1A8YL plasmid was purified from E. coli DH5α, and transformed in Y. lipolytica PO1f cells. The transformants was selected on selective dropout media not containing uracil, thus only yielding uracil autotroph transformants. A negative control was included substituting the plasmid for Milli-Q (MQ) water.                     The transformations only yielded colonies on the plated containing the cells which were transformed with the plasmid. To ensure that these results indeed meant that our plasmid was stably replicating in the Y. lipolytica cells"
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," probiotic bacteria producers of metabolites and macromolecules that are able to maintain and promote human health. LAB have been classified as food grade microorganisms, which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and fulfill criteria of the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
Over the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in the use of LAB as a synthetic biology chassis. For instance, in therapeutics, LAB are used as live delivery vehicles for DNA, peptides, single-chain antibody fragments (ScFvs), antigens, cytokines, enzymes and allergens to treat or prevent infectious diseases, cancer, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases, diabetes, and so on. (Figure 2) In iGEM, several teams have tried to ameliorate LAB to be new chassis in synthetic biology. In 2013, Uppsala-Sweden team designed and tested many promoters, reporter genes, vectors, toxin-antitoxin systems, and signal peptides to make Lactobacillus new probiotic chassis in synthetic biology. They submitted about 70 parts in different series which are subsequently widely used by many iGEM teams. Moreover, many teams have applied LAB in different tracks for different tasks. Lactobacillus bulgaricus was used to build a sustainable and savory drug delivery system (Massachusetts Institute of Technology-USA, 2008). The lycopene and astaxanthin pathway of Lactobacillus casei. was engineered by Uppsala University-Sweden in 2013). Lactococcus lactis was used to create a smart bandage that can heal burn wound and fight against bacterial infections (Groningen University- Netherlands, 2014).
Figure 2 Current applications of lactic acid bacteria
Lactococcus lactis and L. lactis NZ9000
L. lactis is one of the best characterized LAB with detailed knowledge on genetics, metabolism, and biodiversity. L. lactis is of crucial importance for manufacturing dairy products, such as buttermilk and cheese. L. lactis has once been named the official state microbe of Wisconsin, the number one cheese-producing state in the United States. In addition to its traditional use in food fermentations, L. lactis has increasingly been used in modern biotechnological applications, including cancer, diabetes, vaccination, infection protection and animal diseases. L. lactis has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human"

 Human Practices
Yuxian Zhang, Longjing Pan, Jianzhe Yang were mainly responsible for human practices and Jianzhe Yang, Changyu Li, Yinsong Xu, Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang also make contribution to it. They had made the following contributions ：
Support project：
Longjing Pan and Yuxian Zhang carried out a variety of questionnaires to survey the current situation of treating straw and citizen’s attitude toward clean energy. To make our project more practical, they interact with expert in Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to learn more information about agricultural waste and bioenergy. They also interviewed synthetic biology expert, Dr. Junbiao Dai to optimize our pathway.
Public Engagement：
Yuxian Zhang and Changyu Li organized a large event of Education of Public Engagement called “Gene go”, interacting with more than 300 families in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. They are also making effort in high school students, inspiring their interest in synthetic biology. There are other team members designed some product such as “Gene Card” online programed by Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang, Crazy Lab designed by Yinsong Xu and Plasmid Rubik made by Longjing Pan. Collaboration and meet-up is in the charge of Yuxian Zhang and Jianzhe Yang to combine universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves.
 Modeling
Zijian Wu was mainly responsible for modeling. In order to maximize the production of butanol and hydrogen, it is necessary to optimize the fermentation of butanol and hydrogen. He first screened out the significant influence factors of the fermentation reaction. Next, he used response surface methodology to establish a functional relationship between the product and the significant influence factor. He used Box-Behnken to design test points to get the data he needed. He finally found the optimum conditions for the fermentation reaction.
 Art Design
Xieyi Liu and Jiayi Yin were mainly responsible for art design. As art designers, they focused on cooperation and contacted with Human Practice, Wiki and experiment. Their work included our team logo, team uniform, the design of the page and illustrations of Wiki as well as the posters and PPTs required for meetings such as Southwest Alliance and CCiC. They also joined in the design of our educational product, such as “Crazy Lab” etc.

Overview
Due to the complex circuit design of our subject, the numerous combination of promoters and gene elements lead to the effect on the whole system in case of the malfunction of any parts, making it difficult for us to locate the malfunction. Therefore, we decided to adopt the method of debugging the program usually employed by computer programmers.
1)Verify the function of each part.
2)Combine the parts into two large modules of upstream and downstream circuits to verify the function.
3)Assemble the upstream and downstream circuits to verify the function of the whole system.
However, due to time constraints, we cannot complete such detailed and complete functional verification of various combination designs in just a few months. We have completed the functional verification for most parts and some of the upstream and downstream circuits, but time does not allow us to combine the upstream and downstream circuits for final functional verification. This is undoubtedly regretful, but we have provided concrete ideas for future experiments to help us complete the improvement of the subject. We also put these future experiments on our Wiki.
Demonstrate
Upstream circuit
The upstream circuit mainly designs a signal path to enable cells to receive specific external signals and activate the downstream core circuit to realize the threshold function.  Therefore, the upstream circuit can be replaced considering different situations. Here, we provide an upstream circuit design as a reference and other researchers can design their own upstream path to their own needs.
Customizing the signal path of cells in response to external signals
There is a wide type of extracellular signals. Cells receive extracellular signals and respond to the signal molecules accordingly. We hope to customize a kind of receptor so that it can recognize the signal molecules and regulate downstream gene expression [1]. We choose synNotch as an ideal receptor.
Similar to some signal molecules, take Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in our realistic system as an example, the GFP is also protein but more stable and has no impact on the system. As for visibility and operability, cell surface-expressed GFP as a model of extracellular signal molecule is a better choice. Therefore,"

Zinc finger protein Gli-1 DNA-binding domain ( BBa_K165007 ) from Brown University in iGEM 2008.
We added His tag sequence at N-terminal side and N-terminal split CFP sequence at C-terminal side of Gli-1 DNA-binding domain and deposited it as Gli1_link_nCFP ( BBa_K323016 ), cloned it under T7 promoter for production in E. coli BL21(De3)pLsS strain and deposited it as BBa_K323058 . We enclosed a detailed description of Gli-1 back to its original datasheet, results of its isolation and purification (SDS and Western blot, CD analyses) and characterize its binding properties with several binding assays (binding in vitro to its target DNA sequence monitored with SPR, binding in vivo tested with beta-galactosidase assay).

We renamed this part into zinc finger HivC (a mutation variant of Zif268 zinc finger) according to work done by Reynolds and co. (2003). We enclosed a detailed description of HivC back to its original datasheet, results of its isolation and purification (SDS and Western blot, CD analyses) and characterize its binding properties with several binding assays (binding in vitro to its target DNA sequence monitored with SPR and EMSA assay, binding in vivo tested with beta-galactosidase assay).
Vio operon ( BBa_K274002 ) from Cambridge in iGEM2009
We analysed the products of violacein operon by thinlayer liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Results of our experiments show that violacein operon produces functional enzymes that synthesize three main compounds, namely violacein, deoxyviolacein and deoxychromoviridans (this was confirmed by comparing compounds with violacein standard and mass spectrometry).  BBa_K274002  produces a large amount of deoxyviolacein and smaller amounts of violacein and de"

While running our course in iGEM, despite the help and mentorship of our instructors, we were left with challenges and difficulties                  that only people in our shoes can understand. By this mean, we were in touch with many teams via social network. We communicated                  with teams to help each other out in overcoming the hardships together and met brilliant people. Thus, the collaborations with the                  other iGEM teams: “LACAS BioBots, Warwick, Saint Joseph, iGEM Dusseldorf, iGEM Marburg, iGEM UPF-CRG Barcelona, iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania,                  iGEM Michigan State University, iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM Oxford, iGEM Oxford, iGEM Imperial, Bilkent UNAMBG, Acıbadem Istanbul,                  Bielefeld” which are mentioned below in a more detailed way emphasize our joy and efforts spent during the exchange of ideas and knowledge.

For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  An SDS-PAGE gel will be ran to analyze the results of yesterday’s purification.
Procedures:
All samples were obtained and put on ice.
Using 2x loading dye, 5% BME was added.  142.5uL of 2x dye to 7.5uL of BME.
15uL of each sample was mixed with 15uL of dye.  10uL of dual color ladder was mixed with 10uL of loading dye.  Aggregation was observed in the whole cell lysate and in the elution fractions. All samples were boiled for 10 minutes, and centrifuged for 10 seconds to collect at the bottom.  The aggregates were noticeably gone.
The SDS-PAGE apparatus was assembled, and 1L of running buffer was made from a 10x solution.
20uL of each sample was added to the wells. The gel was ran at 100V for 30 minutes to ensure even running, then at 120V until the dye front was near the bottom.  ~1.5 hours.
The gel was cut out, and stained with coomassie for 1 hour.  Destaining took place for 2 hours, with changing the destain buffer every hour.
Conclusions:  Since the destain wasn’t completely done, the gel was left in destain on the bench overnight.
Results:
Below is the gel.  From left to right:  Ladder, ladder, whole cell lysate, unbound proteins, wash 1-3, elution 1-3.

It appears that a preliminary purification worked, though more washes can make it cleaner.  To avoid the observed aggregation, more lysis buffer may be used next time.

1.SNP Treatment
In the preliminary experiments, we treated HEK 293 cells with 10umol/L sodium nitroprussiate (SNP), a NO donor, for different time periods. Cellular concentrations of cGMP were examined using a commercial Elisa Kit. As shown below, cellular concentration of cGMP increased after SNP treatment and peaked at 20 minutes. We used this condition as a positive control in our later experiments.

The sequence encoding a fluorescent reporter was inserted after the antibiotics-resistance gene, rather than directly after the alpha3 and beta3 gene, to avoid any potential influences on the function of the part.

Vector Map of Bata3 subunit
Fig.3 Lentivirus vector cointaing guanylate cyclase 1 beta3 subunit gene
Confirmation of DNA Sequence：
We confirmed the construction of hGUY1A3 gene and hGUY1B3 gene encoding the α and β subunits of sGC, respectively, into Biobrick format flanking by required restriction sites ( BBa_K1720000 and BBa_K1720001 ).
Transfection：
HEK293 cells were transfected with the designed devices. Vectors carrying α subunit of sGC was inserted with mCherry gene as a reporter (red) while vectors carrying β subunit of sGC was inserted with EGFP gene as a reporter (green). Both red and green fluorescence were observed under fluorescence microscope. The transfection appeared to be successful!

As the feasibility of such a device are not yet well-defined for the team members, we also consider to implement that on 3D agar plate grid, that could be printed by a 3D printer. The exact form of those devices is still under discussion.
We are also searching for the molecules that could fit our problem. The family of serine recombinases offers a wide variety of site specific and unidirectional recombinases. It is, however, not well explored. Some problem may arise with riboswitches. Moreover, we have to find three orthogonal signaling molecules. Some perspectives have been opened, like looking for non-bacterial communication systems or using artificial quorum sensing system. These steps are still under discussion.
A first draft of our schedule has also been presented.
BSSE Open House Day
On May 10th the public in Basel had the unique chance to get an insight into many different scientific laboratories and the work done there. It was the joint open house day of D-BSSE of ETH (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering) and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. The many different labs opened their doors to the public and many scientists were present to give interested people some details about their daily work. So did the ETH iGEM team 2014. The team was present with a poster showing the history of iGEM, the previous ETH iGEM teams with their projects and general information about synthetic biology. Additionally there was a slideshow giving a best-of photo collection of last years jamboree.  The goal of this day was to inform the public about synthetic biology in general and specifically about the spirit and the many different projects of iGEM.  Many people showed strong interest in truly student driven projects and are curious to follow our team wiki for the next months. Below some impressions of the day.

Jiangnan_China,2018,Team:Jiangnan China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,") Co. Ltd
    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," dispensers of their device through Neptune’s Control user interface. This interface displays a visual of their chip with controls to open or close valves, set a dispense rate for any given dispenser, or increment the dispensed liquid volume one unit of resolution at a time with only the click of a button. Through this page, a user may change the preset specs of each servo-syringe combination if he or she decides to change their setup. The control feature may be used to control any device using hardware formatted for use in Neptune regardless of the current project being designed to enable quick control adaption to different project environments. It is also through the control page that the user will establish connection to the arduino so that commands may be sent to pumps to operate valves and dispensers.
3DuF Integration | Becca Wolf
3DuF is a microfluidic design CAD tool which is part of a project led by Josh Lippai (see mentor section below for further details). We decided to leverage the JSON visualization features which 3DuF has to offer in Neptune to display a visual of the user’s chip for intuitive interaction with valves and dispensers on their microfluidic device in Neptune’s Control user interface. 3DuF is integrated into Neptune’s front end operation to this end. 3DuF’s version upkeep within Neptune is designed to handle the primitive features which are used in chip design bu Fluigi (see mentor section below) outputs.
Neptune-Arduino Integration | Johan Ospina & Becca Wolf
Neptune can be used to operate the valves and dispensers of a microfluidic chip through an Arduino Mega. In order to be able to send commands to the arduino to be interpreted and acted upon by firmware, Neptune opens a serial communication connection with the port the arduino is connected to. This is done quite simply by the user through the Control page and is as simple as selecting the port and pushing the “Connect” button. Neptune will then send commands specified by the user in the Control page to the arduino through UART.
Firmware-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
The way in which Neptune communicates to the Arduino Mega which powers the control of the microfluidic chip is standardized throughout the Neptune UI-firmware interaction. Commands are sent to the arduino through the Neptune Control page in the form of an 8-digit code where the first 4 digits indicate the index of the pin on the arduino which the servo-syringe combination is connected to, and the last 4 digits indicate a PWM value which indicates the position which the servo should rotate"

Stanford,2010,Team:Stanford_-_-_TEXT.html," Our output system is more efficient than two individual sensors and, most importantly, can pass its results on to other parts and devices. A ratio sensor performs a calculation that a user does not need or will not be able to.  A ratio sensor frees up a wavelength channel on the measurement device, and, more importantly for the future, allows the computed ratio to be passed on to another part. A useful ratio sensor that could be utilized in a broad regime of biological applications needs to be operable and accurate in micro-environments; the Stanford team's ratio sensor is engineered to function within E. Coli, which is fully operable over a range of environments.
With the Stanford 2010 team's ratio sensors, synthetic biologists will be able to create more responsive genetic machinery capable of solving all sorts of problems. You can see some example uses of our circuits on our Applications page.
Why Two Designs?
Our team engineered two different ratio sensing systems because we envision wide range of applications that is too great in scope for one type of ratio sensor to cover effectively. In some instances, only one ratio may be important, and the sensor should be able to clearly delineate whether or not the ratio has passed that threshold. For example, detecting if a biologically significant event has occurred requires a switch-like behavior. In other cases, researchers may want their bacteria to respond with greater nuance to the chemical environment, or simply report on the state of that environment. In this case, a sensor capable of responding over a range of possible ratios would be more useful than a single switch.
In order to satisfy these two needs, our team created:
An sRNA-based sensor that reports the relationship between the present ratio of the chemicals and a single desired ratio via the presence or absence of signal.
The two input chemicals each bind to a receiver upstream of an sRNA and a reporter protein. Each sRNA is complementary to a specific RSID that includes the RBS of the opposite reporter protein. When the sRNA's bind to their target RSID sequences, they cover the RBS, preventing the translation of the reporter protein. The sRNA/reporter protein pair that received the greater stimulus from the environment wins out over the other reporter protein and determines the cell's output. Note that in place of a reporter protein, our system can be hooked up to any biological part.
A kinase-phosphatase sensor that reports the exact ratio via the intensity of the signal
The two input chemicals each bind to an inducible promoter upstream of a coding sequence, either the sequence for the kinase or the phosphatase. The coding sequence for the transcription factor is"

Human Practice
For iGEM this year, we are working on our project, “Increasing Bacterial Isopropanol Resistance through Bioengineering”. We are developing a way to increase isopropanol production by increasing its resistance to E. Coli, the bacteria we chose. By increasing isopropanol production, we can create more alternative energy sources for the world to use.
 
Our iGEM team has participated in many community outreach services. Over the summer, we held a Southeastern iGEM team conference at our school where we practiced presenting our projects. The Duke and East Chapel Hill iGEM teams joined us. Recently, our group set up stands at the Schiele to teach the community, especially younger students, about bioengineering. At the Schiele, we made DNA necklaces out of wheat germ so that we could show younger kids what DNA looks like.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," With this new information, we developed a novel approach to assess the vehicle microbiome and monitor cleaning processes, the first of its kind in Canada.
Once we determined sampling locations, we designed a two pronged approach to help solve this problem with specific design criteria in mind. Our design strategy involved the following principles: 1) comprehensive; provide a complete picture of the vehicle microbiome, 2) portable; an easily accessible tool that could be transferred to different vehicles, 3) easy to use; no additional training would be required of the first responders, 4) standardized; develop protocols and methods that could be duplicated by others for similar or related applications, 5) rapid; first responders could quickly identify pathogens, and 6) specific; accurate in regards to the types of pathogens identified and detected.
Based on our design criteria, our team developed a single domain antibody library and custom bacterial-two-hybrid selection system to identify sdAb variants that recognize human pathogens. We sequenced our samples collected from the ambulances using the cutting edge MinION sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We then surveyed the results of our findings and identified opportunistic pathogens (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia), human commensals, and uncultured bacteria. The results of the microbiome sequencing influenced our choice of targets to select single domain antibodies against. These antibodies would be used in the design of an antibody based detection method to allow first responders to quickly identify the presence of harmful microbes, in turn allowing for the assessment of cleaning standards."

Using the same approach for homologous recombination as in the dormancy system, a DNA fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance cassette of the pSB1C3 vector, was made for later selection of recombinant G. sulfurreducens. The PCR product was ligated with fragments retrieved from the 500 bp upstream and downstream regions of the chromosomal pilA genes of the G. sulfurreducens PCA strain, creating the fragment seen in Figure 15.

Determination of Noise Levels in Constitutive Promoter Family Members
Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that a strong constitutive promoter was suitable for the expression of the photocontrol device.
To assess which of the constitutive promoters would be suitable for a uniform expression of the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , and the antitoxin RelB, BBa_K2449028 , the expression levels and the noise of four different members of the Anderson promoter collection and their RFP reporter systems, were studied by fluorescence microscopy. These were, in increasing promoter strength, BBa_J23114 , BBa_J23110 , BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23102 .
Additionally, the change in RFP expression levels and noise during growth were tested for the promoters with the highest and lowest relative promoter strength by flow cytometry and qualitative analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Combining these two techniques, the expression and noise levels for the promoters were determined as follows:
The weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , exhibited a relatively low expression of RFP, indicating low gene expression and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
Both medium strength promoters, BBa_J23110 and BBa_J23106 , displayed a moderate level of both noise and protein expression of the RFP reporter.
The strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , exhibited a comparatively high expression of the reporter RFP and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
For further information about the experiments and a proposed cause for the increasing noise level, read here.
As the strong constitutive promoter exhibited the most uniform expression, this was chosen to regulate the expression of the photocontrol device genes. With the modelling results in mind"

This was my approach to designing the protease sites -Phillip
Using the DSSP algorithm from PDB, the parts of the protein with no alpha helices, beta sheets, or turns and five or greater amino acids are the following.   30-35, 64-72, 123-129, 131-139, 216-220, 228-233, 298-302, 331-336, 417-422 Revised sites in terms of location. Bold indicates insertion
Top candidates are based on two criteria: 1. Exposure at the surface for protease accessibility  2. Speculated to have minimal conformational changes by insertion In general, original proline residues on the side were kept, in case they were involved in transitioning between secondary structural elements.  Also, insertions were flanked  with glycines in order to allow extra flexibility.

    Because we use nisA as promoter to express our parts, 0.5 ng/mL of Nisin is required to induce cell expression in all the following steps.
    Demonstration of msmK gene
    Copy msmK gene from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group with PCR. Construct msmK overexpression strain L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK with electrotransformation. Take strains L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 from glycerin tube kept under -80℃, dilute 1/25 in 2 x 10 ml fresh medium (30 °C). Grow until the OD600=0.4. Count their number of colonies per ml at pH 4.0 (More details can be seen in protocol).
    We can get the following results:
Fig 1 Number of colonies at acid stress (pH 4.0).
Fig 2 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.
    Demonstration of composite part msmK-cspD2
    It has been reported that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L. lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation.
    The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer. The process of acid stress and cold stress is similar with the above demonstration process.
    Acid stress
    Deal with the samples under pH 4.0 with nisin as an inducer.

The ligation products that were incubated over night were transformed to Top10 competent cells according to the protocol .
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
The first attempt at measuring fluorescence was made in adherence with the protocol proposed by the USTC team of 2009:
1. The overnight cultures of E.coli Top10 carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 and I13401 (LB, 37 ℃, 160 rpm) were measured for OD600 (see table below) and diluted 1:100.

4. The fluorescence and OD600 were measured for 16"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," well because the thermsister can only cause a change in voltage. While a theoretical approach can be used to calculate the temperature, we decided to do an experimental calibration instead, due to the sensitivity of samples to temperature. Three temperature points were obtained by comparing the analog input with the temperature in the box. This was input into the program to create a standard curve.
Shaker Test
The shaker was tested using a constituively RFP expressing system. A starter culture was incubated and split into three categories: positive control - a commercial incubator shaker, experimental group - our lab-in-a-box shaker, and negative control - our lab-in-a-box incubated without shaking. A n of 3 was used per group.
Immediately after taking the samples out of the shakers, it was clear that the samples lacked strong RFP expression like the positive control. However, the turbidity was greater than the negative control, and there was expression seen in one of the experimental samples. Pelleting of the cells resulted in a clear decrease in pellet size and red fluorescence compared to the positive control but still much better than the negative control.
Measuring the RFP fluorescence and the optical density, it was clear that the cells did not fluoresce at all compared to the commercial shaker, but still had half of the optical density. This shows that while there was growth, it was not in log phase, when the promoter of the RFP cassette would have been activated.
We miniprepped the cultures in a commercial centrifuge to test if the optical density may have been due to contamination, which could have increased optical density but would not have the plasmid DNA that matched our RFP expression vector. We found that plasmid DNA recovery proportionally matched the optical density.
While our shaker did not result in strong RFP expression and log phase growth, we believe that other methods of induction such as IPTG would cause fluorescence because it does not depend on log phase growth. It would also be beneficial for replication of plasmid DNA for sequencing and other assembly procedures.
We have demonstrated that:
The miniprep protocol requires only 10,000 RCF to isolate plasmid DNA effectively.
The lab-in-a-box centrifuge can reach up to 12,000 RPM, generating 11,290 RCF
The thermsister responds linearly to changes in temperature to maintain a constant temperature.
The shaker can induce some expression of genes under a log phase promoter, and grow culture with around 50% plasmid DNA recovery.

Met with Dr. Zainul about our project
Test would have to be administered in a lab
Only on an at risk population (family history, heavy alcohol consumption, etc.)
Would need to get the protocol down and license to sell it to a lab
Not all private practices have centrifuges, so doing the test with a visually detectable indicator won't work
Not all private practices have UV lights, so the draw of this being fast may not be as great as we thought
Maybe consider light chromatography
If this can be done in a private practice, we'll need a sort of stick test, similar to the glucose and protein tests for urine
Can consider coupling GPC-1 binding to secretion of a selected product that can bind to an external indicator that can be poured into the solution, like phenolphthalein

Penn,2011,Team:Penn#project#our-system#_-_-_TEXT.html," Sender Cell.
When choosing a promoter for Renilla, we selected the CMV promoter. This promoter is known for its extremely high and robust levels in Mammalian cells. Because we took a long time in the summer to set up our lab and get started, and we had an abundance of CMV ready for Gateway cloning, we were unfortunately not able to report experience with the Registry Biobrick for CMV (BBa_I712004).
We characterized the Sender Cell expressing Renilla under the control of the CMV promoter. We did this by quantifying the emitted light from Sender Cells in an iVIS Lumina II imaging system, finding that it produced much stronger luminescence than the positive and negative controls, and much stronger than another luciferase (Aequorin).
The Receiver Cell
The goal of the Receiver Cell was to be able to successfully receive a blue light signal from the Sender Cell and translate this input into a further output of blue light. First, we needed a component that was highly sensitive to 480nm light and could translate this into an intracellular response. This component would also need to instantaneously trigger a second luciferase or fluorescent molecule. We found a suitable receiver protein which is routinely used in the neuroscience field: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). ChR2 is a membrane-bound ion channel that is gated by 460-480nm light. Upon application of light, the channel opens and allows cations to enter the cell. This concept paired well with the luciferase Aequorin, which not only requires Coelenterazine to produce light, but also requires 3 bound Ca2+ ions. This pairing was the basis of our Receiver Cell – the light-gated opening of ChR2 would trigger Aequorin luminescence in the presence of Coelenterazine. We subsequently learned from a recent Nature Neuroscience paper (Kleinlogel et al., 2011) that a point mutation in ChR2 can dramatically increase calcium permeability (this mutant has been named CatCh). We secured CatCh and co-transfected it with Aequorin, both being controlled by separate CMV promoters (so that we would not sacrifice expression of either during initial experiments).
We first attempted to characterize the final system of Sender Cells activating Receiver Cells using an iVIS Lumina II imaging system. We did not see a significant increase in Aequorin luminescence in the Receiver Cell after pulsing with blue light, so we started trouble-shooting by testing the components of the receiver. Aequorin alone worked –"

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

ICT-Mumbai,2017,Team:ICT-Mumbai#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a ligation reaction of both was was set up in 1:3 molar ratio. We sent out all three genes for sequencing.
Week 7: Interlab study begins!
While we were awaiting our sequencing results, we began our interlab study. All the test devices and controls were reconstituted and transformed from the kitplates. All of them were inoculated for making glycerol stocks the next day. Since our plate reader was under maintenance, we performed the measurements later.
Week 8: Making way for proteorhodopsin!
In order to make the GS-GOGAT cycle work, we needed proteorhodopsin (PR) that would produce ATP with the help of the proton gradient. However, this activity of PR is seen only in the presence of retinal. We found both, the gene for PR (BBa_K773002) and a device for retinal biosynthesis (BBa_K1604022) in the provided kitplate. For PR, we decided to use an araC regulated promoter (BBa_R0080) which was also present in the kitplate.
We reconstituted BBa_K773002 (Plate 2, well 1P), BBa_K1604022 (Plate 7, well 17K), BBa_R0080 (Plate 3, well 5G) and transformed in E. coli DH5α competent cells.
Colonies were found only for BBa_K773002. BBa_K1604022 and BBa_R0080 gave no colonies. We repeated the transformation for these two parts, this time we increased the incubation time for each. We were successful.
Week 9: Eureka moments!
We learned that farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) an intermediate in the carotene biosynthesis pathway is is also the starting molecule for a fragrant compound, limonene. Catalysed by limonene synthase (LIMS), FPP is converted to limonene. To our surprise we found the gene coding for LIMS+rbs (BBa_I74211) is present in the kitplate. We planned to clone this part downstream of BBa_K1604022 so as to obtain limonene.  Thus, we reconstituted and transformed this part from well 4I of plate 4 in E. coli DH5α competent cells. Colonies obtained were inoculated for making glycerol stocks and miniprepped the next day.
Week 10: Gene deletions!

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

②In  turn, they have helped us in the measurements of the parts. We send their  sample of K1361007, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by  twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100.  And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104,  a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the  better fit of promoter, they helped us measure the cell growth curve of each  part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to  monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
The  results are as follows:

Collaboration  with Nankai University(NKU)
We  hosted the 1st  iGEM Exchange  Conference Of TJU Team and NKU Team on Oct. 14th at the Nankai University.
The conference contains three parts: The introduction of Work  Project, Prospect and Mutual Aid.
First of all, mediators of both teams introduced their project.  Nankai University Team introduced their project called Super Petroleum Magician  which is an anaerobic rhamnolipid-producing engineered bacterial strain for  microbial enhanced oil recovery.
And Tianjin University Team  gave a speech about their program named Transfibre which is also called CsgA, a  kind of special fiber that can bind the electric circuit and play the role as  the conductor as its function.
In the experiment part, they helped us to detect our target protein  (CsgA) using SDS-PAGE. Here is the result.
From the result, we could see that the interest protein from cells  was about 15 Kp which was same as what we expected, from which we could infer  that interest protein unsurely existed.

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#ConceptualFramework#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,".) are a very interesting way to construct a mathematical representation of a system, and specially interesting when we are talking about paratransgenesis, as we have a lot of different aspects in the problem. Using differential equations, we can correlate them in an easier way.
Unlike thermodynamic models, differential equations describe the variations of a system, i.e., how a class of interest varies in some unit, for example, the protein expression in time. This describes these variations in a continuous way, that is, we can see our class, like population size or protein in medium, variation in every single variation, as small as you want, of the unit, in our example, time.
Given these properties, D.E. are classically used for ecological modeling, since we can describe, for instance, population dynamics in time or in space. Thus one of most important models of Ecology was constructed using differential equations, the logistic growth.
Then, to first start building the model, look at your biological system, so you can determine your variables and parameters, as also define their relations (A good way to do it so is building that scheme suggested before, because it simplifies your perception of the model). It is necessary for all assumptions in the model to be very clear, like having some population as a constant or if you’re considering mutations in the system, for example. Then, knowing these assumptions and having the parameters/variables and their relations, you can already write the model! (Some basic differential equations will be shown later).
An interesting point to highlight is that, until now we exemplified the construction of these equations depending in only one variable like time, but we can also build them depending on two or more equations. In this case they are called partial differential, so you can write your equations depending on two variables, for instance, space and time. Thinking about proteins, you can think about the expression and its dynamics in the medium.
To clarify these ideas, let’s set an example. Consider this simple circuit:
Here we want to understand the expression of this protein in time. So we have as the first equation the protein over time, called here dP/dt. The protein expression depends basically on the RNA translation, θ, the RNA itself and some degradation μP. The other thing here that varies in time is the RNA, dmR/dt, since can vary with activation and repression. So RNA depends in some basal production, called here γ, the inducer, Ι, the repressor Χ and, probably, some degradation term, μmR. So we can draw a visual representation of this system"

A three-stage algorithm is designed to solve the  problem (workflow is present in Figure 4):  A set of sequences that fold into the S1  structure at low temperature is found.  Sequences  that cannot fold into the S2 structure at the high temperature are screened out.  After these two stages, sequences meet the  structural requirement are obtained.  However,  regulation temperatures of the obtained sequences remain unmeasured.  The third stage is designed to screen RNATs to  meet the temperature requirement.
Figure 4.  Workflow  of designing an RNA thermometer
Verification of the designed RNATs’ secondary  structure
The first step in verification the in silico design is testing the designed structure in vitro.  In-line probing method is adapted to measure  the RNATs’ structure (10).   The results are as shown in Figure 5.
 
Figure 5  Result of the in-line probing.  The sequence of the RNAT is 5’-GAAUACAUGUUAAUUAUGCCAUCCAGGCAUACAGAAGAAGUUAAU-3’ and the regulation temperature of the RNAT is 39.5℃.  RNAT loaded in lane 1, 2, 3 was incubated at 46℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  RNAT loaded in lane 4, 5, 6 was incubated at 42℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  RNAT loaded in lane 7, 8, 9 was incubated at 37℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  The red boxes mark sections that melt when temperature rises.
When temperature rises, sections marked by the red boxes melt thus bands appear.  The results show strong evidence that the designed RNATs can fold into desired secondary structure.
 
Verification of the designed  RNATs’ temperature-sensing regulatory function
Then,  rectification of the temperature-response regulatory function in vivo should be taken in verification of the in silico design.  GFP is adapted as reporter gene in measuring  the RNATs’ temperature-response regulatory function.  The results are shown in Figure 6.

Streamlines
For simulating complex fluid systems, the Lattice Boltzmann method became the de facto standard in last years. This relatively new method works in two steps:
Collision step
Streaming step
Collision step computes all distribution functions of a node's mass and streaming step moves that specific mass to another node (in a defined direction).
The simulator implements square lattice LBGK model (D2Q9), which is expressed as (collision step):
$$f_i(\bar{x} + \bar{e_i}, t + 1) - f_i(\bar{x}, t) = - \frac{1}{\tau}[f_i(\bar{x}, t) - f^{(eq)}_i(\bar{x}, t)], i = 0, 1, ..., 8$$
where \(f_i\) is distribution function in direction \(i\), \(\bar{x}\) is current position, \(\bar{e_i}\) is position change in direction \(i\), \(\tau\) is relaxation time and \(f^{(eq)}_i\) is equilibrium distribution function in direction \(i\). The direction \(i\) represents 2D direction of momentum. Node density \(\rho\) and macroscopic flow velocity \(\bar{u}\) can be calculated:

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Practices#An iGEM Critique_-_-_TEXT.html," that's you, the iGEM teams. Without you, iGEM is a waste of effort. It's your work, it's your organization that is really the key to iGEM.
Randy Rettberg
iGEM 2005
And I agree with this wholeheartedly. We, as teams, have invested countless hours to work on projects that we find exciting and invigorating. Not because we hope for medals or awards at the end of the year, but because we love doing it, and iGEM gives us the means and opportunities to do so.
Participating in iGEM is often the first time that university students get the chance to do science — real science, from the ground up. Coming up with ideas, planning out how to design plasmids and constructs, creating experiments and collecting data. For aspiring scientists and engineers, this is all pretty exciting. Compared to most other university level team competitions, however, iGEM is incredibly expensive.
As can be seen below, we've summarized the average cost of a team to participate in the iGEM competition in 2015, and how quickly the expenses can accumulate.
Expense
Cost (USD)
Single team registration fee
$4000
Giant Jamboree attendance fee (10 people)
$6950
Accommodation for the four nights (10 people, iGEM discounted rates at Sheraton Boston)
$3428
Transportation (10 people; depends on proximity of team to Boston; some flights cost over $2000 USD per person)
$2000 — $20,000
Wet Lab chemicals and equipment
$15,000
Total
$31,378 — $49,378
Estimated expenses for the 2015 competition.
To put it succinctly: this is an exorbitant price to pay.
In my mind, the iGEM Competition exists to educate students about synthetic biology: connecting individuals with other students and organizations from around the world that share their passion for genetic engineering; giving students the chance to peel back the curtain and experience science themselves, first hand; and preparing future scientists, mathematicians, engineers, politicians, and artists for what this branch of science can become. I do not believe it exists to only offer these opportunities to those who can afford it, and requiring such a high barrier of entry only serves to keep this opportunity from those who cannot.
I am not the only one who feels this way. Similar figures and views are expressed by Vilanova and Porcar

The digested samples were then run on a 1,5% agarose gel for approximately 20 minutes
Results: Because it failed the first time, this experiment was repeated, with the same results (see notes section)
The first gel
The second gel
The gels do not show any sign of a successful digest. Because the restiction enzymes only cut in the prefix and suffix of the FlhDCmut operon, it is not surprising that we do not see any bands of approximately 10bp length. However, the digestion should be very clearly visible in the plasmid backbone, as we should be cutting out RFP, which is approximately 1000bp long. The plasmid do not appear to have been digested by the restriction enzymes. 2 bands are visible, but they are both much longer than expected, in fact they appear around the length of the complete plasmid. So this experiment appears to have been unsuccessful.
Notes: First troubleshooting session led to a repeat of the experiment, as we found that human error must have been the reason for the failed results, because it was the first time i performed the experiment. However, when the repeat of the restriction digest yielded the same results, we took a closer look and found that the combination of restriction enzymes was wrong. They were the combination we will use when we begin the assembly... In this case we want to insert the biobrick (FlhDCmut) into the plasmid backbone (pSB1C3, in which case we need to use the same restriction enzymes on both"
Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase hypothesis that dominated our thinking, I suggested to Dr. Johnson that we should forget the idea of extracting luciferin and luciferase and, instead, try to isolate the luminescent substance whatever it might be. I was, however, unable to convince him. He did not agree with my idea, which had neither theoretical backing nor experimental support. Because of the disagreement on the experimental procedure, I started to work alone at one side of a table while, on the other side, Dr. Johnson and his assistant Yo Saiga continued their efforts to extract a luciferin by grinding luminous tissues with sand. It was an awkward situation.
The basic principle of isolating a bioluminescent substance is to extract it from the tissue under conditions that reversibly inhibit luminescence, or that cause a selective inactivation, consumption, or removal of a component necessary for light emission. In the case of a luciferin- luciferase system, for example, the luciferin is usually extracted with methanol, which stops luminescence by inactivating the luciferase. And the luciferase can be obtained from an aqueous extract after the luciferin has been exhausted by several minutes of spontaneous luminescence reactions. If a cofactor is involved in light emission, its removal or exhaustion can cause a reversible inhibition of luminescence, as in the case of the firefly bioluminescence system that requires ATP as the cofactor.
In the case of the jellyfish Aequowa, however, the presumed lack of luciferin and luciferase severely limited the range of techniques usable for the extraction of the lightemitting principle. I did believe that jellyfish luminescence requires molecular oxygen like all other known bioluminescence systems (later proved to be incorrect!), but we had no other information about the luminescence system or cofactor requirements. In an effort to find a way to extract the luminescent principle, I tried to inhibit the luminescence of the squeezate by using the anaerobic conditions that were created by vacuum or by the addition of reducing agents, but nothing worked. The results forced me to assume that the jellyfish system, like that of Cypridina, requires a very low oxygen tension-a level less than that attainable in my evacuated container. Furthermore, all of the known enzymatic cofactors, such as ATP, FMN, and DPNH, showed no effect on the luminescence when added. Finally, the only recourse was to try various chemicals available in the stockroom of the Lab, with the hope that"
