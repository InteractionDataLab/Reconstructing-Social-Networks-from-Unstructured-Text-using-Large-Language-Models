Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Online Material caused worried remarks because it precisely describes how to assemble a virus from small oligo nucleotides. The authors jusifyed their project by declaring that they:
""made the virus to send a warning that terrorists might be able to make biological weapons without obtaining a natrual virus"" 17
Reconstitution of the Spanish Flu
At the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the group around Tumpey et al. ; 200524 published that they had sequenced and recreated the pandemic Spanish Flu Virus of 1918 which killed 20-50 million people. The publication of the sequence provoked several very different responses that can only be partially be quoted here. The controversial noticed outrider of the Synthetic Biology Craig Venter seen in the new virus
""the first true Juressic Parc scenario"" 2
The Institute Professor at the MIT Philip A. Sharp supported the publication because he:
""belive[s] that allowing the publication of this information was the correct decision in terms of both national security and public health"" 12
Wheras v. Bubnoff; 200525 critisizes the CDS for it's careless regulations for the shipment of viruses and the willingness to propagate highly virulent viruses. This causes in his opinion the risk of possible accidents resulting in the release of the virus to the environment.
Availability of molecular biological techniques
The knowledge required for the creation of a genetically engineered virus can easily be accessed from all over the world in online gene banks and publication databases and could be potentially be used for a destructive purpose 20 . In 2007, Scott C. Mohr published the first part of his manuscript Primer for Synthetic Biology14 . This open accessible document explaining the basics of molecular engineering addresses people interested in genetics but coming from a non-academic background. This development called ""garage biology"" or ""biohacking"" is a clear indication for the tendency to have knowledge about molecular biology available in society, as it was seen with programming and computer hacking from ~1980 on.
Availability of synthesized DNA
One of the reactions to the publication of the genome sequence of the Spanish flu strain from 1918 was v. Bubnoff, 200525 who pointed out the lax handling of the reconstituted virus sequence, the ease of availability and the low effort that has to be invested to recreate a virus:
''""Scientists in Canada are planning to work with the virus, although they will not request it from the CDC. [...] Reconstructing the live virus from its DNA would then take just a few days, he says.''

Human Practices
Running an iGEM team within Genspace is itself an exercise in Human Practices.
We were the first-ever community biolab- opening our doors to the general public in December 2010. For the past five years we have been welcoming citizen scientists and the intellectually curious to our lab space to experience modern biological science hands-on. Our lab classes in synthetic biology won “Best Social Study in Synthetic Biology” at SB5.0 in 2012. We have several events (lectures, group labwork, workshops) every month that are open to all, and anyone over 18 can become a Genspace member and work on a project in our facility provided they comply with all safety guidelines and are working with organisms appropriate to BSL1. We believe that the best way to communicate synthetic biology is to engage as many people as possible in its hands-on practice.
This is exactly why we consider running an iGEM team in such a public space an exercise in Human Practices. Day to day our iGEM team was forced to engage members of the public who would come through Genspace. Our iGEM team often would find themselves explaining our project to visitors of Genspace. All this culminated in answering many questions about our project, addressing people's concerns, teaching people about the Gowanus and as well getting valuable feedback from the community. In this way our team worked day to day in an open lab setting, a lab literally open to the public.

Testing of the Synbiota RDP System in a Community Lab Setting
Citizen scientists in community labs wanting to practice synthetic biology encounter unique barriers to access. The labs are often less well equipped than university labs, and may have less mentoring capabilities. Thus we welcomed the opportunity to test out a new, more user-friendly system for assembling a long string of DNA parts. The Synbiota Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) system owes its origins to BioBytes, a project which won the award for Best Foundational Advance for the Alberta 2009 iGEM team , The system was further optimized as an easy-to-use teaching kit, Genomikon, which was the Alberta"

La transduction se définit alors comme une infection abortive par le virus recombinant défectif, pour la réplication, qui introduit seulement une information génétique fonctionnelle dans la cellule cible. L’avantage de ce type de vecteur est qu’il est naturellement un vecteur d’information génétique, il a ainsi toute capacité à voyager dans le torrent circulatoire, à reconnaître un marqueur cible et à pénétrer la cellule d’intérêt pour y intégrer le gène thérapeutique. Mais il possède également des inconvénients : sa forte immunogénicité, la possibilité de recombinaison du génome viral in vivo et son industrialisation.
Autre type de vecteur viral, bactérien cette fois-ci, les phages. Ces virus particuliers ont d’autres caractéristiques que les virus eucaryotes. Ils fonctionnent de la même manière, ce sont également des vecteurs naturels d’information génétique. En revanche, originaire du monde procaryote, ils sont beaucoup plus sûrs à utiliser, plus simples à produire, mais aussi beaucoup moins efficaces face à un environnement eucaryote. Leur génome doit intégrer des séquences spécifiques leur permettant d’augmenter leur efficacité de transfection. Ils possèdent, tout comme les virus eucaryotes, une facilité à intégrer une information génétique d’intérêt thérapeutique au sein de leur capside et une facilité à cibler un marqueur cible. Néanmoins, ils pénètrent très mal les cellules eucaryotes et leur immunogénicité est aussi très forte.
Pour finir, les derniers vecteurs de classe biologique, les bactéries. Ce type de vecteur, des plus originaux, n’est que très peu étudié et développé uniquement en laboratoire.

To construct the promoter libraries, the bases were randomized by using oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) as shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. After PCR reactions, the blunt ends were ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs) to give the mixture of the modified plasmids. To obtain sicA variants, error-prone PCR was performed. Random mutations were introduced by PCR reactions with 13PCR buffer supplemented with 7mM MgCl2, 0.3mM MnCl2,

Thursday, 8/18
●
The plates we transformed grew overnight and less dense than yesterday but still pretty dense. We think the reason for the large growth is because we used T7 express LysS competent cells instead of the regular T7 express competent cells which increases growth. Individual colonies were picked and started liquid cultures with these colonies. The plates were then placed in the 4 °C fridge for storage
●
Spun the 13 cultures down that were made Monday. The following cultures worked:
○
CupidPink
○
Prancerpruple (barley worked)
●
Because not all of the cultures worked we redid all but CupidPink and placed the cultures to incubate overnight the cultures we redid in LB+Chlor with IPTG were:
○
VV
○
BB
○
SP
○
LO
○
SO
○
TP
○
PP
○
DM
○
VP
○

○
AE Blue-CBD-His Tag (We used LB+chlor for this and no IPTG)
●
We performed 12 restriction digests on the Gibson products of the DNA 2.0 chromoproteins from Tuesday 8/16. The protocol we used was:
○
1 ul EcoR1 Prefix
○
1 ul Pst1 Suffix
○
1 ul Gibsoned product (12 different of these)
○
5 ul Cutsmart
○
42 ul MilliQ water
●
We than ran these restriction digests at 37 °C for an hour and then 65 °C for 20 minutes.
●
We will run both the restriction digest and Gibson product on a gel to compare them and see if our Gibson was successful which we will determine if the restriction digest band is at the proper length and the Gibson product is at the proper length
●
After looking at our gel we do not think the restriction digest worked because the band was in the same location as the band on the Gibson product that was run without being digested. We think this occurred because there is something wrong with the Cutsmart we are using because other people in lab are having issues with outsmart
●
Tried to get specter readings from CupidPink that was spun down this morning from liquid culture. Unfortunately the specter readings were not successful because we need to do extracted protein instead of the cells straight fro culture

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Trial3_-_-_TEXT.html," Calgary on Sunday, May 24. We presented questions about iGEM to a panel of experts. We also got one on one ""speed-mentoring"" with the experts as well as an exclusive group meeting with each of the four experts. Meeting the University of Lethbridge team was also quite cool!
After meeting with the experts, we decided to put the literature review on the back burner so that we could proceed with actual, physical experiments.
Week 4 - May 25 to 29
This week, we focused on perfecting our silver staining techniques. We are currently troubleshooting our gels because the stain comes out quite dark and with a lot of background staining.
We also started reaching out to local start-ups and companies looking for sponsorship and further funding.
Planning our wiki and how we want it organized also took place this week.
Week 1 - June 1 to 5
This week, we worked on and finalized the DNA sequences to be sent to IDT.
We also continued perfecting the silver staining techniques outlined by our principal investigator. Unfortunately, we are still experiencing difficulties in background clarity. We tried to switch out the vessels used during staining because we thought that residual silver was affecting our gels. However, even new pyrex containers did not make a difference in our final stained products. We are thinking now that the BioRAD Silver Stain Plus kit that was provided for us contains defective reagents.

End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," metal electrodes (Fig.1 A). One of the droplet population is being produced on a chip (Fig.1 B) and at the same time, the other is being reinjected in a form of emulsion (Fig.1 C). The droplets in emulsion are being “ spaced ” by using additional oil flow. Tuning the flow rates of the two droplet populations allow us to have the produced-reinjected droplet ratio 1:1. When the two droplets reach the electrodes in a chip (Fig.1 D), an electric field forces them to coalesce into a single one. The droplet coalescence is a result of the drain of spacing oil between them. This comes from the combined effects of viscous forces and the oil draining created by an electric field.
Our model presented here relies on a balance of energy. The energy terms are those for the kinetic energy and the energy dissipated as a result of viscous forces . In the next sections we explicitly present each of the terms, which are making an impact to the energy balance.
1. Determining the drainage rate
In this section we derive the approximate relation for drainage of oil separating two droplets before their coalescence. We use the relation for pressure difference \(\varDelta p\) the one as used by Barman et al.
(1)
Here \(\gamma_{WO}\) is the interfacial tension of oil-water interface. As we will find later, it is changed by adsorption of surfactant molecules. Notice that all voltages applied for the energy terms rely on voltage created at the electrode tip \(U_{tip}\)  and not purely on applied voltage \(U_{app}\).
The action of electric field also changes the interfacial tension through a change in contact angle . Authors postulate the differential equation for oil-film drainage rate \(dT/dt\):
(2)
Integrating the differential equation (2)
We integrate this differential equation by using the mathematical methods of partial integration and guessing of coefficients.
The equation (2) is rewritten in the following form:
(A)
We mark the multiplicative factors of \(T\) as \(a, b\). Then split the right side into “possible” terms with unknown multiplicative factors:
(B)
We solve the system pf algebraic equations to find the coefficients A, B, C. These are found to be \(A=1/ab\), \(B=-1/b\), \(C=-1/a\). The explicit solution for the integral is the following:

. However, given the extensive research that had to be conducted to arrive at this position, the team began to consider how we might be able to push for systemic change.
Funding
As a result, consultations were sought with Lan Le (Research Ethics and Compliance Support) and Brad Walsh (CEO of Minomic International Ltd., which can be read about in our Journal . These consultations, in addition to speaking with Carl Stubbings (Head of Commercialisation, Minomic International Ltd.) at our team’s symposium, brought to our attention one other important impact legal protection has on science – it plays a major role in determining to which research money flows. Lan spoke about how legal (and ethics) approval was becoming a prerequisite for any grant funding, while Brad and Carl spoke about how legal protection allows them to capitalise on their investment into research – which is essential for them to have more funds to reinvest in research. Further research into this area revealed that the link between possible legal protection and funding is quite substantial

. For our iGEM team, in applying for grants we found that our research wasn’t eligible for many opportunities, with substantially more opportunities available for research into direct medical applications, where there is a better chance of making a profit.
Figure 2: UNSW iGEM team meeting with Brad Walsh - CEO Minomic.
Creative Options: Policy Submissions
As a result, our team is convinced that the current balance between legal protectionism and encouraging innovation is off – one more voice in what is a continuing public policy debate in Australia
1
. However, in considering how we could creatively contribute our voice and experience to the conversation, the team has discovered a ‘missing link’ of communication between science and the law, despite their many points of intersection. Scientific researchers outside of big corporations often do not contribute to the debate about how to best construct the law which they use every day – with the clearest example being the 2016 Intellectual Property Arrangements public inquiry receiving only two submissions from this group of scientists out of 620 pre- and post-report submissions. One possible way to re-establish this link is by writing to government, which is why the UNSW team’s creative solution was to write a policy submission guide and example submission .

The policy submission, and suggestions for improvement, were critically evaluated and analysed in light of comments from Dr Alexandra George and the Pasteur Paris iGEM team."

Survey
Survey
According to this, the general public basically understand the early disease detection. It also reflects that they pay close attention to their physical health. We put forward the following suggestions: the reports for early disease detection should be increased in the network, television, newspapers, magazines and other media, and the propaganda are supposed to be strengthened for the early disease detection, so as to let the public further understand the early disease detection and pay more attention to their own health. In addition, if the home disease detection apparatus come out, out of the care for the body, people will surely buy such apparatus, which will make it convenient for us to examine the body.
With the faster pace of life, there will be a huge change in the physical examination. This also indicates that a more convenient and efficient new physical examination will be welcomed and loved. At the same time, after the birth of the home disease detection apparatus, because of the reduced detection cost and the shortened detection time, it will be highly welcomed in the crowd.
From these data, we can roughly know the deepest public concern, which is that the results may be rough, and not trustworthy. In the hospital physical examination, although it will take some time and money, its results can be trusted. And due to the constraints of time, space and size of the home disease detection equipment, it cannot let users completely be convinced of this. This will give researchers a problem, which is how to ensure the test results are the same or has little difference with the hospital physical examination’s results. If these problems can be solved, this kind of home instruments will certainly be popular among people.
Questionnaire of iGEM_BIT
iGEM (international genetic engineering machine) is an annual international contest held in Massachusetts Institute of Technology in America, which is about the totally new field, or biosynthesis. The BIT (Beijing Institute of Technology) team is working on a project about disease surveillance this year. Now we need to know some information about you for our scientific research. Thank you for spending time on helping us finish the questionnaire. Please fill in this questionnaire according to your actual situation.

Vector selection
The lab of Peter G. Schultz kindly sent us the plasmid carrying the genes for the tRNA/Synthetase pair (pESCTrpLeuRSBH5T252A) orthogonal in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and capable of integration the photolabile unnatural amino acid 4,5-Dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-serine.
Check Genes
Introduction
Here we introduced the tRNA/synthetase plasmid into the organism we sought to express subtilisin E in, in order to be able to integrate the noncanonical amino acid into the protease .
For all agarose gels we used 1% agarose and 1kb Thermo scientific ladder 08
Day 1
Transformation
Unfortunately, the tube was open upon receipt and no traces of dried DNA material were visible. Thus it was decided to transfer competent cells directly into the tube during the process of transformation in E. coli DH5alpha.
Day 2
Overnights
We made 5 ml LB + Amp overnight cultures of three different colonies grown on yesterday’s transformation plates.
Day 3
Cryo Cultures and Plasmid Isolation
We prepared cryo cultures with 1 ml of yesterday´s overnights and isolated the plasmids from the remaining culture. Nanodrop
We measured the concentration of the isolated plasmids: 1: 202 ng/µl 2: 214 ng/µl 3: 263 ng/µl

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.   Combined: http://www.healthcentral.com/common/images/1/19473_13187_5.jpg Cardiovascular: Obesity and other health conditions associated with obesity, including hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  http://www.beltina.org/health-dictionary/obesity-cardiovascular-disease-bmi-table.html Diabetes: Patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant, in which high levels of blood fats, cholesterol and triglyceride levels inhibit cells from absorbing blood sugar needed.  http://www.bubblews.com/news/560642-cause-of-type-2-diabetes Musculoskeletal disorders: Those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26.4 had rate of osteoarthritis of the knees 6 times greater than those with a body mass index of less than 23.4.

Background
“
Character 1: An annoying monster
Hyperuricemia is an annoying monster. It is a representation of abnormally high levels of uric acid in the blood and is best at attacking human joints, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and even joint deformities. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg of evil damage. It can also damage the kidney, cause abnormal renal function, cause chronic kidney diseases such as renal stone and renal colic, and is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver. „
“
Character 2: Knight of limited ability
The various forces currently battling hyperuricemia show their deficiencies: side effects, drug resistance, painful treatment processes, and so on. Therefore, we all look forward to the hero who can truly defeat hyperuricemia.„

The Urate Oxidase will be the hero, an enzyme in organisms that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid in purine metabolism. It can oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxy iso-uric acid, an unstable compound that is readily converted to allantoin in organisms. Allantoin can be easily metabolized by the kidney, thus lowering the body's blood uric acid level. When uric acid oxidase attacks hyperuricemia, the target of action is uric acid itself, so it will not hurt the body. „

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system.

(about 1xTAE: dilute the 50x TAE to 1x TAE: add 10mL 50x TAE and 490 mL double distilled water to form as a system for further use)
Plastic wrap can be used to pack the bottleneck.
Use microwave oven to heat the solution about 5mins until the agarose is all dissolved and the solution is boiling and clear. It would be better if we shake the flask again after heating 2 mins.(CAUTION: HOT! Please use wool gloves when picking and placing flask.)
Let the gel cool down about 2 mins.
Pour the gel into gel tray with the appropriate comb inserted in the side of tray and wait till the gel solified(It may costs about 10 mins). Then remove the comb
Put the gel into gel box with the 1XTAE just immerse the gel exactly. Please let passages stay towards the negative pole(Often black).
Carefully add samples with 6X loading buffer and marker into passages. Dosage is based  on the depth and width of passages.
Set electrophoresis conditions: 90V 600mA and 30mins and then turn on the power.
Disconnect the electrodes.
Utilize the devices that contains UV light to observe the gel and analyze the result.
Save the result in the computer for further use.
Gel Extraction
Preparation:
Check out whether ethyl alcohol is added into Wash Solution.
Check out whether Buffer B2 has sediment.
Adjust the thermostat water bath at 50 degree centigrade.
Procedure:
Cut up the effective bands under UV light and put the fragments into EP tubes with series numbers.
Measure out the weight of tubes of gel.
Add Buffer B2 3 to 6 times the volume of gel and then incubate the EP tubes in thermostat water bath about 50 degree centigrade about 10 mins.
Optional: If the length of the DNA strip is shorter than 500 bp, it would be better add isopropanol one third volume of Buffer B2.
After gel is all dissolved,  pour the solutions into absorption columns and centrifuge columns at 8000xg about 30s.
Add 500 ul wash solution in a centrifuge at 9000Xg about 30s and pour out the solution.
Do the step 5 again.
Centrifuge the empty columns at 9000xg about 1min.

NH3 Sensitive Promoter and TnrA
PSB1C3-TnrA-pAlst-RFP CLONING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 1800 bp long.
As the result of Colony PCR experiments, we observed bands are either negative or less molecule-weighted than we expected. We made liquid cultures of the not negative colonies, and isolated DNA from these colonies after incubating for 16 hours. we did cut-check with EcoRI and PstI enzymes in order to control occurring DNA’s.
After  cut-check, we observed less molecule-weighted bands again. Therefore we decided to control our ordered G-Blocks and did a PCR experiment with CMV forward and SV40 reverse primers. The gel  image of this PCR is shown below.
TnrA-pTnrA-RFP PCR
After that PCR, we observed less molecule-weighted bands than normal.
pET45 -TnrA-pTnrA-RFP CLONNING
We questioned if the plasmid is incorrect because the results of PSB1C3 cloning weren’t matching with our expected results. We cut the G-Block with BamHI and XhoI and ligated it with pET45-b which was cut with same enzymes. We transformed this ligated product into BL21 bacteria strain, which has T7 RNA polymerase.
In order to control if the cloning is made correctly, we did a colony PCR with T7 Promoter reverse and T7 promoter forward. If cloning isn’t made properly, the band should be at 360 bp line and if is made properly the band should be at 1779 bp line.
In colony PCR results, we observed lower molecule-weighted bands than expected, again. In this case we realized that this gene sequence was wrong.
We didn’t have enough time to order and clone this gene so we didn’t continue to do this"
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Moudle_-_-_TEXT.html," net distance travelled on average by particles in a time t if they have a diffusion constant D. We calculate the probability that a particle will be found at a certain distance from the origin, and then calculate the average by weighting each distance by that probability.
The number of particles in a slab of thickness dx and area A at x, where the molar concentration is c, is cANAdx. The probability that any of the N0 = n0NA particles is in the slab is therefore cANAdx/N0. If the particle is in the slab, it has travelled a distance x from the origin. Therefore, the mean distance travelled by all the particles is the sum of each x weighted by the probability of its occurrence:
The average distance of diffusion varies as the square root of the lapsed time. If we use the Stokes–Einstein relation for the diffusion coefficient, the mean distance travelled by particles of radius a in a solvent of viscosity η is
The viscosity of water is 0.891 cP (or 8.91 × 10−4 kg m−1 s−1)
Diffusion Coefficient
The picture shows the flux of particles down a concentration gradient. Fick’s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point.
If we divide both sides of this equation by Avogadro’s constant, thereby converting numbers into amounts (numbers of moles), then Fick’s law becomes
In this expression, D is the diffusion coefficient and dc/dx is the slope of the molar concentration.We can obtain the diffusion coefficient by experiment methods. However, considering we have no time left, this job needs to be done immediately in a theoretical way

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#DNA Based Model_-_-_TEXT.html," The first five columns are the end-point (t = 3600s) concentrations of the respective species. The last three columns are metrics representing the dynamics of hirudin production. Initial hirudin Rate is taken to be the average rate over the first 10 seconds, which is useful in knowing the response delay. hirudin Rise Time is the time it takes to reach 90% of steady state (in this case, the end-point), which is a common way of measuring a system’s dynamic. The last is the just the maximum derivative of hirudin concentration.
The sensitivity analysis is done by perturbing each parameter by 2% higher and lower than the original value and calculating the change in output relative to the change in parameter.
The sensitivity of each parameter to each output is normalized to represent the ratio of the relative change in output to the relative change in the parameter. We see that changing the reaction kinetics of cruzipain will have a large effect on the final concentration of TetR, which is as expected. To find the best parameters to increase hirudin production rate, we see it is sensitive to the parameters k_TX, k_TL, ka_RNAP_DNA and K_Rib. Hence, changing the promoter strength or ribosome binding site (RBS) strength could increase the production rate.
However, a better method is to add amplification to our system.
2. Amplification
Due to the slow rate of directly expressing hirudin. We decided to include an amplification step into our system. This is achieved by producing TEV instead, which will then cleave a sterically inactivated form of hirudin to release hirudin.
This is modelled by adding the following reactions and replacing the translation product with TEV.
$$ 5. mRNA + Rib \to mRNA + Rib + Hirudin$$ $$ NEW~5. mRNA + Rib \to mRNA + Rib + TEV$$ $$ 20. Hirudin_{inactive} + TEV \leftrightharpoons Hirudin_{inactive}:TEV \to Hirudin + TEV $$
[Fig 7]
The graph shows that using an amplification step will greatly increase the speed of the release of hirudin. The threshold time is reduced to 11 minutes from 31 minutes. Even though the production of TEV is slower as TEV has a longer sequence, it was still able to accelerate the release of hirudin.
As 11 minutes is very close to the common blood coagulation initiation time"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2015,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HumanPractices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," of the biggest ethical issues of synthetic biology. However, we did intend to start a conversation about using these products in everyday life. Our discussion with the students showed that most of the people lacks the information regarding this topic – during our survey almost 90 % of the applicants said that they would be glad to hear more about that on the news, social media and other information channels.
Vilnius 2015 iGEM team together with the students from Kaunas Techology University (KTU) gymnasium.
In addition, our team gave a few examples that students have not known about before, such as insulin or other drugs. Many of them admitted that they lack general knowledge about synthetic biology. More or less amazed by how much we use genetically engineered products without even thinking, students admitted that GMOs can be and are very efficient in everyday life. Of course, there are many important ethical and scientific issues, related with independent usage of GMOs in our society. But what we can do is start talking about them.
We also talked about previous iGEM projects and we gladly noticed that students were really interested. They were especially amazed by the projects like colonising Mars, creating vegan cheese, aiming to cure cancer. During discussion, many students were thrilled by the idea, that we can use bacteria and biotechnology to cure some very serious diseases – such as AIDS, tuberculosis, cancer. They said that this genetical engineering is completely different than the one with food – so if scientists can focus on disease treatment, they definitely should do it.
Finally, we told students our story – how we came to be a team (the first one in our small country), what are we doing and how are we going to achieve our goals. As the matter of fact, we asked them what do they think about our project in the light of those excellent previous iGEM year stories. Most of students thought that we are aiming a very significant problem and that it is rather exceptional that we use synthetic biology to terminate the processes, built up by the same synthetic biology.
From students we got many interesting ideas, where could we use our bacterial system. They were really passionate about the iGEM competition and some of them even considered creating a high school team next year. We, on the other hand, had a lot of fun travelling to and from schools (which were, by the way, all over the country) and talking to young, but very serious and eager generation.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," into recent findings of research regarding interdisciplinarity, deriving strategies for an effective interdisciplinary teamwork and exercises in interdisciplinary communication and reflection of the interdisciplinary teamwork in iGEM.
To sum up, it is important to repeatedly find common ground in aims, visions and actual teamwork to reach a shared understanding. It is crucial to invest time.  One should be aware of additional work that comes with interdisciplinary collaboration. In different professional languages and terminologies, identical words can have various meanings. Consequently, one should adapt professional languages, use colloquial speech and reduce speed. One major requirement of successful interdisciplinary teamwork on SD is self-study to enhance ones’ understanding of the other disciplines’ way of thinking and methods. While working in an interdisciplinary team the share of knowledge is crucial for success. This includes knowledge regarding non-disciplinary insights to sustainability, discipline-based knowledge on sustainability as well as practical skills and experiences. Moreover, having a good relationship is key to prevent conflicts. It is important to take a step back and to reflect the interdisciplinary team process, especially during discussions. Furthermore, one should differentiate between the person and the discipline in conflicts and in the design of tasks and roles. No one likes to be judged by ones affiliation and consequently related stereotypes of disciplines.  Finally, one can deploy a professional moderator.
Study Career Day at the SDS am Heidberg school
During our initial lab phase I had the possibility to speak to promising pupils at the SDS am Heidberg, a local high school, about studying life sciences and studying in general. After a brief introduction into what studying means and how it will impact your general life, moving from home, financing your own life, how lectures are designed, how many internships are included. To conclude my talks, I presented some of my favorite parts of university life of course featuring iGEM.
As someone who is involved in many different activities in our university I can safely say that iGEM is one of the if not the most rewarding course you can participate in if you are interested in MINT at our university. Therefore, I recommended iGEM and similar scientific projects to the young adults before me. While I was introducing our current project, many of them asked questions about studying and science in general. I spoke to some teachers as well, however it will take a long time to establish iGEM in German high schools, if that ever happens, the financial burden and distance might still be too steep to make it a viable option for many schools and universities alike.

British_Columbia,2017,Team:British Columbia#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". Code was written with this in mind and values are taking as command line parameters and passed to the corresponding functions.
The model starts by searching the gene input for all PAM sites, creating a list of all protospacer sequences (and therefore sgRNA sequences) available in the gene. The model then runs each sgRNA sequence through the biophysical model, searching for sites on the rest of the genome where the sgRNA could also bind. For each protospacer, including the the target protospacer and all off-target sites, the model calculates the binding affinity of the sgRNA sequence. The model does this by checking each nucleotide pair in the sgRNA against the protospacer. Each sgRNA:DNA nucleotide pair is used to reference a matrix of energy data and weighted based on distance from the PAM site (Fig. 2, 3), calculating the free energy for each pair. This procedure is performed on all protospacers for each guide sequence obtained from the gene, generating the Gibbs free energy and the partition function for each sgRNA.
The information for each guide is compiled and exported into an excel file (Figure 4). With this file, the guides can be ranked on their partition function, allowing the sgRNA with the highest affinity to the target site to be chosen. The automation we built into our software allows the process of choosing guides for any genome and targeting any gene to be fast and without human error.
There is much optimization could be done to reduce the runtime of the code that currently takes an inconvenient length of time. Many of the function calls repeat and perform work that could be done once at the start of the thread. This kind of data processing is very open to Multi-threading which could reduce the run time by an order of magnitude for most consumer laptops and significantly more on a server.
Model Usage
A terminal command can be used with our interface to run the model with a set of genomic data. The code can be found on our github page. Genbank files are inputted as a standardized source file format containing annotations for genomic sequence information.
Example:
python Cas9.py -q genome.gbk [genome_n.gbk] -m MODEL.mat -t target_seq.fasta -p 0
This will start a full run of the script examining all candidate sgRNAs that could be used to cut the target gene, along with their respective ∆G, and partition functions. The output is written to a CSV file with the fields: guideRNA sequence, target sequence, position, dG_Target, % partition function and information about the source files used.

Week 18
With the team we decide to concentrate our research in one of all the Mussel foot proteins: the Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). Esmee and I did a deeper research about the properties of Mfp-5. At the end of the week we had already concluded in our final idea and its subprojects: cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, and the regulation of the adhesive properties of Mfp-5. On Friday afternoon the team had a meeting with the other three Dutch iGEM teams in Amsterdam.
Week 17
After a weekend that we had enough time to relax and think all our possibilities, we conclude in the topic of our iGEM project. In the beginning the idea was to combine both topics. Finally, the adhesive Mussel foot protein (Mfp) ""stuck"" in our minds... From Wednesday we started the literature research about our topic and its prospects. On Friday we gave a detailed presentation for our ideas in the Department of Biotechnology. In between, we had relaxing time going for a boat trip with all the members of the team, followed at the end of the week from some drinks in Beestenmarkt.
Week 16
This was a week full of brainstorming meetings...On Monday we had a meeting with our supervisors and advisors. We finally reached around 150 topics. Our goal until the expire of the week was to come as closer as possible to our goal: our final topic!!! On Thursday we decide to continue with the four most prevalent topics. Esmee and I were responsible for the topic: Adhessive Mussel foot protein. On Friday we gave a presentation for each one of these topics in front of advisors, supervisors and some guests. We finally end the week with the two best ideas for us!
Week 15
Lesley Robertson, the Biological Safety Officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences met us in her office. She explained us about the safety issues and the regulations that we have to follow while working in the lab. At the end of the week we had our second brainstorming session. All of us were very creative and we came up with many new ideas for topics.

Background
The international Genetically Engineered Machines or iGEM competition is an initiative of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT). From 2005 on this competition in synthetic biology has been organized and grown from five participants in 2005 to 80 participants this year. Basically the iGEM competition likes to address the following question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The three main reasons to begin organizing iGEM were [1] :
1. To enable the systematic engineering of biology
2. To promote the open and transparent development of tools for engineering biology
3. To help construct a society that can productively apply biological technology
In practice, the first two reasons comprise constructing an open source library of standardized biological parts.  These parts of standardized stretches of DNA are called BioBricks. These BioBricks can be used to make sensory systems, oscillators, or other applications that can be performed by bacteria. The standardization of the parts is achieved by placing a known standard sequence before and after each part (pre- and suffix) that is made. The prefix and suffix consist of three known restriction enzyme sites, this means every part can be cut and pasted if the right combination of restriction enzymes is used. Of course this requires the restriction sites to be absent in any of the stretches of DNA between pre- and suffix. At present, there are thousands of these BioBricks. These make up promoters, terminators, regulatory elements and protein coding sequences of different sorts are some examples of what the BioBricks are. Within this setting student teams from all over the"

How Glycogen Synthesis Works
The glycogen formation in E. coli is performed by three enzymes:
glycogen synthase (encoded by glgA)
branching eyzme (encoded by glgB)
ADP-glucose pyrophophorylase (encoded by glgC)
GlgC uses glucose-1-phosphate to build ADP-glucose that is needed by the GlgA to elongate glycogen chains.  Through autophosphorylation, the glycogen synthase GlgA also acts as the starting particle, just like glycogenin in eukaryotes.  The branching enzyme GlgB forms alpha-1,6-branches using existing chains.
In order to increase the glycogen formation, we built expression plasmids of the genes as well as a polycistronic version . Our constructs were later characterized using a variety of methods.
BioBricks
Summary
In order to share our constructs for glycogen synthesis with the iGEM community, all three synthesis genes were cloned into pSB1C3, sequenced and submitted as new BioBricks.
BBa_K1585310 (B0034.glgA) was synthesized with prefix, suffix and overhangs to pSB1C3. After a PCR amplification, both the gBlock and the backbone were cut, ligated and transformed into E.coli DH5α. The purified plasmid was then sequenced and submitted to the registry.
BBa_K1585311 (B0034.glgB) was synthesized with a similar design. Due to DNA synthesis limitation, the gene was divided"

Phages - Project Description
Figure 1.1: Project overview
Antibiotics are a very powerful way to cure bacterial infections, but their power withers as more and more bacterial strains become resistant to different antibiotics. The great power of evolution leads to chromosomal mutations that not only make bacteria resistant to natural antibiotics, but also to newly developed synthetic ones [1] .  Bacteria also have a very effective way to share those resistances with each other, not limited by species boundaries: the transfer of plasmids by conjugation (which will be investigated in more detail in the second part of the project). Multiresistant bacterial strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis hinder the usage of antibiotics against infectious diseases, because they cannot be killed by ordinary antibiotics and can give their plasmids to other pathogens, which then become resistant themselves.
Nevertheless, there are"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a biological system. We have already held the first 2 lectures in which many Life and Physical science have actively participated.
During the first lecture we have introduced a concept of synthetic biology as a road to biological engineering and how it can lead to achievements in medicine, material science, pharmaceuticals and similar fields. We have then discussed how we can improve and adapt nature’s systems for our needs, as well as limitations of our knowledge and how much we lack towards creating truly complex biological systems, such as artificial cells. Also, students were introduced to basic concepts of biological parts, their assembling into pathways and intentional design of novel components.
The second lecture elaborated on dynamics of biological processes, e.g. operons, their regulators, riboswitches and feedback loops. Also, we discussed recombinant DNA technology concepts, synthesis and sequencing of nucleic acids, and techniques that are important to understand before starting to engineer a biological system.
Now we are taking a short break because of Giant Jamboree after which we are coming back with the third lecture. We have prepared an overview of modelling and engineering principles which will familiarize students with the key principles of system design (modelling, simulation, verification, standardization and optimization). The main idea of this lecture is to give an understanding on how we can take separate biological parts, characterise and merge them to create a certain well-defined system. We will also discuss biological switches and design principles of biological oscillators, as well as how we can exploit naturally existing feedback systems.
The last lecture will be for reviewing all the concepts presented previously and to consider how we could design multicellular systems. We also chose a couple of papers on practical application of synthetic biology to discuss authors’ approach to planning, execution and interpretation of results. Furthermore, we are planning to address the ethical questions regarding synthetic biology, such as uncontrolled release, human or animal genetic modification or creation of artificial life.
In conclusion, this year we have decided to accelerate the spread of synthetic biology in Lithuania. We have set ourselves the goal to achieve that by revamping the Synthetic Biology Organisation. A 5 year strategy plan was developed in order to make the organization more goal oriented and efficient. Then, the strategy plan was initiated. We have redesigned the brand of SinBio in order to attract more people, participated in radio shows, hosted an international microorganism day and create a lecture cycle for Life and Physical science students. We hope that this initiative will immensely accelerate the growth of the general and professional synthetic biology community in Lithuania."

Aproximately this is the interval from 3 to 5. We also see that this interval gets smaller as we increase the voltage. The interval also becomes smaller with increasing volumes of V1. We have also found that three-droplet merging should be present at the very low and the very high values of V2/V1. We have then experimentally tested these parameters and have successfully reached almost 100% effective droplet merging using volume ratio of 3 to 5. We have then proceeded to use the parameters in our CAT-Seq workflow.

Due to bad cleavage efficiency at the PstI restiction-site in nearly all PCR-products the cloning of the CBDs ( CBDcex(T7) and CBDclos(T7) )and especially the insertion of GFP_His to the CBDs took a lot more time as expected. This was because, while designing the primers, we missed to add additional base pairs from the cleavage-site to the termini to increase the efficiency to standard. When we got aware of the problem, cloning got a lot quicker and more successful.
As the project went on and the T7-constructs didn't seem to work one suspected reason was that a stop codon (TAA) that accidentally resulted between the RBS and ATG could be the reason for that. To solve the problem we started to"

CONSULT Dr. Xu
At the beginning of our project design, we met a tough problem of choosing chassis. We had two choices, B. subtilis and E. coli. The B. subtilis is a kind of Gram-positive bacterium and is more similar to our prototype---Clostridium cellulolyticum, but the E. coli is more versatile and widely used.
We summarized our doubts and consulted Dr. Xu Chenggang, an expert in C. cellulolyticum research. Then we got the advice of comparing more differences that related to our design and he recommended us several useful software. In the process of blasting and comparing enzyme system between them, we found that E. coli has no exoribonuclease that can digest mRNA from 5’ termini, which will be of great benefit to our whole design. With the help of expert and our deep research, we confirmed our chassis and went on with further design.

Then in September, we joined the CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee) held by SYSU-CHINA, which is a communicating platform for Chinese iGEM teams. About 30 teams and 300 iGEMers from all over China gathered together. We shared our design with other iGEMers and were glad that we received many specific responses, from constructive project design to detailed data process skills. Then according to those suggestions, we modified our original design and added two supplementary proof experiments, which was essential to the integrity of our project.

INTEGRATED HUMAN                     PRACTICES
Purpose
Brainstorm
In order to make sure that we have enough time to a better preparation, we started recruiting                         players in mid-March. We hold a group meeting every week to conduct ""Brain Storm"". In the first                         few weeks, everyone can come up with his or her own interesting ideas. After a few weeks'                         ""Storm"", we identified the final project purpose. After that, we started with different entry                         points according our purpose, reviewed a large number of literature and reviews, and reported                         them regularly. At the same time, we realized that we needed to make sure our project is                         meaningful for the society. Therefore, we did some surveys.
Survey
During Brainstorm, we basically determined that this year we want to build a cell-detector of                         antioxidants. In order to evaluate whether this has the significance of implementation and                         whether it is the core of people's attention, we conducted some surveys.
We designed a questionnaire about antioxidant products and the way to test them. And we also                         tried to clarify whether the public is familiar with synthetic biology.
After the investigation, we gained a lot. We were very glad that more and more people around us                         knew and started to pay attention to synthetic biology and had a strong interest in                         biotechnology. This really excited us. As for the part about antioxidants, we also had some                         positive results. According to what we learned, about 60.77% of people had used products                         contains antioxidants, such as vitamin C, astaxanthin capsules. However, most people questioned                         whether these products really have antioxidant effects. And they hoped to establish a set of                         antioxidants detection method in living cells so that it can be more accurate and efficient. At                         the same time, about 89.3% of the people made clear that the establishment of this kind of                         system will be helpful when"

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content3_-_-_TEXT.html,". There is a threshold of oxide stress which is the critical value between normal cell and cancer cell. As a normal cell, its oxide stress is lower than the critical value while the ROS production value is over the threshold. On the one hand, when the oxide stress in our internal environment increases, normal cells may mutate to cancer cells if the ROS value is higher than the threshold value. On the other hand, cancer cells may die because of the accumulation of ROS. So the key point is, when ROS value higher than the maximum, we can kill the cancer cell while ROS value lower than the threshold we may push normal cells to change into cancer cells. So the level of ROS is in a specific range which we can measure using chemical methods.
Think about a proper range of ROS's concentration. Is it familiar to you as we mentioned a similar problem when talking about advantages of oscillatory system as biosensors? H2O2 is a kind of ROS. The oscillation will happen only when the concentration of is H2O2 between the maximum and the minimum. By regulating our circuits to let it respond in the proper concentration range which matches the ROS range of cancer cells, we can use the oscillatory system as a biological cancer detector.
In our experiments, we found that we can regulate flow rate and some parameters of microfluidic chip such as the depth of the well, the width of the channel and the concentration of H2O2 to change the period and amplitude of the oscillation. So by changing parameters of microfluidic chip, we can get a proper concentration range of H2O2 if the oscillation works. From then on, we can extract some cancer tissue to detect the ROS concentration in the microfluidic chips or get some suspected tissue on chips and diagnose whether it contains cancer cell.
2 Periodical Killer
2.1 Drug delivery
Our circuit also has a great potential application in periodic drug delivery. It is amazing when we realize that the oscillate circuit can control the drug to release in a specific period and the concentration of the drug is related to the amplitude. It is well-known that nowadays drug-release is a very hot research field. Many efforts are focusing on how to modify or delivery drug using materials such as synthetic polymers, liposome or nano shell which can respond to differences between different intracellular environments. Our oscillatory gene circuits provide a more biofriendly way for drug release. Our future plan is to make some deep exploration in this field.
2.2 Protein Synthesis
What else, a resonance may happen among the oscillators which results in a peak synthesis of protein under some conditions."

Introduction
Currently, hormone detection methods are costly and time consuming. It can take many days to collect, store, test and analyze a sample. For example, the commonly used Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit can cost $500-$1100 per 96-well plate. Each test performed using this kit is usually done in triplicate. Costs for lab technicians, supporting equipment and storage also add to these costs and hormone researchers may spend tens of thousands of dollars for these tests. Hormones in a sample may also degrade before they can be appropriately processed, which may lead to inaccurate results.
The Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team is in the process of developing a method of detecting hormones using the concepts of synthetic biology. Our system is designed to detect hormones without extensive sample preparation, eliminating long waits for lab results. Eventually, we hope to expand on this and develop a real time assay. This will allow researchers and medical practitioners to observe fluctuations in hormone levels in real time, obtaining more critical information about hormones and their physiological effects. Our assay will also be modular, allowing the user to monitor multiple hormones with the same system. We are actively working on the research and development of our idea. With the help of the University of Lethbridge Industry Liaison Office and Office of Research Services, we are also in the initial stages of patenting our method.
In order to achieve our goal, the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial team has incorporated the company Synbiologica Ltd. We have developed a business plan around our idea. We have since participated in the South Venture Business Plan Competition (University of Lethbridge) and the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge (Community Futures Lethbridge). We received first place in both of these competitions. We also participated in the TEC Edmonton Business Plan Competition and though we did not win, we received extremely valuable feedback. Our team has also attended local business development workshops and conferences and we will be attending the MEDICA Conference in Dusseldorf, Germany, this November.

Hyperparameter Optimization
Hyperparameter optimization is often times a very time-consuming and difficult task. However, the extremely quick training and cross validation runtime of our algorithm allowed us to test out a lot more hyperparameter optimizations than other machine learning algorithms. Grid-search is a commonly used hyperparameter optimization concept which performs cross-validation on every possible combination of a supplied set of hyperparameters and finally returns the best combination of all hyperparameter values.
Unfortunately, even with our fast algorithm, too many possible combinations of hyperparameters took far too long to evaluate on our working stations. Hence, we narrowed down the search-space using randomized-search. Randomized-search has a probability of 98% of finding a combination of parameters within the 5% optima with only 60 iterations, with a much lower runtime [] .  The results of the randomized-searches allowed us to fine-tune our model with carefully selected grid-search parameters. Our final parameters are shown in table 2.
Table 2: Hyperparameter of the XGBClassifier.
The final hyperparameters chosen after multiple randomized-searches with subsequent grid-searches. The hyperparameters resulted in the best average AUC on all alleles.

Results
We evaluated our tool on all 65 alleles provided by the IEDB database using 5-fold cross validation. Furthermore, we compared all of our calculated AUC values with the currently best performing tool  NetMHCPan. The detailed results can be found here MHCBoostvsNetMHCPan .
Discussion
MHCBoost's performance is already very competitive when compared to the absolute state of the art - NetMHCPan. Considering that we developed MHCBoost in a matter of weeks, whereas NetMHCPan has been continuously refined over the last 10 years, our performance is very respectable.
To further explore the demonstrated potential of our tree-based approach to MHC class I binding prediction, we're planning to perform hyperparameter optimization using bayesian optimization. Bayesian optimization offers a fast, but powerful hyperparameter optimization for large sets of supplied hyperparameter and therefore an alternative to randomized-search and grid-search.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of plasmid DNA. We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve. Still, there was an unknown source of salt contamination in the plasmid sample.

Another busy week of lab work! Several teammates spent their week with our new best friends: E. coli and Y. lipolytica. We only have a little over a month until the Giant Jamboree! It’s crazy to think about how far our team has come. Speaking of, we received an invitation to speak at TEDx Oakland! We’ve been busy preparing for the TEDx San Jose talk, and we’ve even more excited now knowing that we have two opportunities to discuss our project with the community.
After testing both primers and genes, we identified that the reason our gibson was not working properly was because lox-ura-lox was not what we expected. When we ran it on a gel, we saw two bands, one correct and one incorrect, meaning that our gene was contaminated. This was a horrible realization to make so we started making preparations for a backup plan. Our backup plan would use the D17 plasmid the riboswitch team had been using as a base. With D17, we would attempt to insert lox-ura-lox via KLD reaction and eventually insert our desired plasmid into Yarrowia.
Having observed positive results of a team member using electrocompetent E. coli cells we decided to use these cells to perform our transformations with. We transformed the electrocompetent E. coli cells the DNA of our ADR, and Delta7 plasmid. We transformed with electrocompetent E. coli three times during the week and each yielded unsuccessful results, made evident in the absence of growth on the plates.
To analyze our results, we first tested the legitimacy of using electrocompetent cells and performed a transformation using the chemicompetent E. coli cells and the ligated Delta7 and ADR plasmids; the results were still unsuccessful. The next step we took was to adjust the protocol again, adding the enzymes and DNA at once within one tube, rather than adding them later in a separate enzyme mastermix.
We made inoculations using the E."

E.coli Photography
Green

Blue
The core idea of photography is this: bacteria receive color light and produce corresponding fluorescent protein or chromoprotein, so a photographic system should contain two subparts containing light sensing subpart and imaging subpart. Because all color lights can be conbined by three primary light, which is red light, green light and blue light(RGB light). We decided to construct three types of photography system based on RGB light, which is called E.coli photography, in E. coli firstly and found an approach to tranferring the system to C.crescentus , a kind of adhesive bacteria that improve the stability and resolution of photography.
In order to achieve our goal, we engineered three light-sensing systems wherein transcription from an output promoter is controlled by different light wavelengths.
The three systems are differently designed but they have the same result-----Different-colored lights activate expression of corresponding florescent protein.
Each TCS comprises a light-switchable sensor Histidine Kinase (SK) containing an N-terminal phytochrome-family photosensory domain and a C-terminal bifunctional kinase-phosphatase signalling domain.
Green
In the green light-inducible system, the SK CcaS is produced in a green-absorbing ground state, termed Pg.
In dark, no light activates the whole circuit so there is no florescent protein produced. Absorption of red light switches CcaSPr back to Pg, which dephosphorylates phospho-CcaR, deactivating transcription.
Fig.1
Absorption of green light flips CcaS to a kinase-active red-absorbing state (Pr) that phosphorylates the response regulator CcaR, which then binds to the cpcG2 promoter and activates the transcription of GFP.
Fig.2
Red
In the red light-inducible system, The SK Cph8 is produced in a kinase-active Pr state .
In dark, Chp8 phosphorylates the response regulator OmpR, activating the transcription from the ompC promoter thus producing more lambda CI. The increase of lambda CI repress its transcription of downstream promoter for RFP.

To wash, add 750 µL Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (sequencing, blut-ended-ligation) let the column stand 2-5 minutes after addition of Buffer PE. Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 mL collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Elution
To elute DNA, add 50 µL Buffer EB (10 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick column, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of loading dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#ModificationFr_-_-_TEXT.html,"internalisation du vecteur cellulaire
Une fois au contact de la cellule, le vecteur cellulaire a deux schémas d’action possibles.
Le vecteur se fixe puis il se détache de la cellule.
Le vecteur se fixe puis il se fait internaliser au sein de la cellule.
On peut modéliser cela en fonction du temps et des Constantes d’Association (kon), de Dissociation (koff) et d’Internalisation (kint).
On obtient ainsi:
Avec kon = 5.10^3 M^-1s^-1, koff = 8.10^-3 s^-1 et kint = 5,78.10^-4 s^-1.  Si l’on calcule la constante globale K’, telle que IDP = K’ x t, on obtient K' = 361,5s^-1 Ainsi plus de 360 phages sont internalisés par seconde au contact d’une paroi.
Si l’on compare le temps nécessaire pour internaliser un phages, par rapport au temps d’attente avant que la cellule n’entre en apoptose suite à l’entré d’un vecteur cellulaire (1 heure), il apparait logique de négliger l’internalisation des vecteurs cellulaires (IDP = cte =  360 phages/s ) dans l’équation finale.
Ainsi, avec une efficacité totale de la diffusion des phages, et un temps d’internalisation négligé, on peut dire que la constante d’efficacité λ est égale à 1.

Victoria_Australia,2009,Team:Victoria Australia#Passport#Spring Workshop_-_-_TEXT.html," give a little history and background on the roots of Synthetic Biology, the evolution of iGEM and the BioBrick concept. After a quick lunch it was back to the drawing board as we went through the navigation of the competition itself – forming ideas, setting achievable goals, using the iGEM website interface and construction using the BioBricks provided. We were then led by our kind hosts at Tokyo University through the awe-inspiring Ueno park to a restaurant where the teams could mingle over food and sake.
Day two started with the breakfast of champions - sticky rice balls wraped in seaweed filled with seasoned meat from 7/11 and hot coffee from a vending machine (where you can also purchase liquor if you insert a valid ID). The workshop (much easier to find this time) continued with detailed instructions on BioBricks and the procedure for submitting to the registry. Thoughout the workshop, participants are called upon to be a part of “team example” where they can go through the steps in real time – a brilliant idea which made the process both understandable and memorable. A wonderful lunch of Bento boxes was provided, beverages among which were “Calpis” (pronounced cow-piss which met many giggles from the Australian teams) and ice cold tea. Finally safety was addressed, iGEM partners and special deals were announced, awards were detailed and the Asia workshop was completed.
The RMIT and UQ teams then went shopping for robots in Akihabara then parted ways, filled with notes on their rivals and a few whisps of comradery too. Dr Pattenden boarded a train back to Narita to return home, and Candi and Muriel accidently caught the wrong train to Nikko to begin their Japanese adventure.

My expertise is in plant primary metabolism, particularly seed biology and biochemical genetics. We are using molecular and chemical genetics, biochemistry and bioimaging to dissect the link between metabolism and growth in developing and in germinating seeds and seedlings.
Bradley Brown
I have been previously involved with iGEM in 2015 as a member of the Exeter team, and in 2017 with the Newcastle team. Currently I am a PhD student investigating how the principles of modularisation and multicellularity can be used to optimise the behaviour and development of biological systems.
Josh Isaac
During my third year of Pharmacy, I came across synthetic biology through its diagnostic potential in the Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using Programmable Biomolecular Components. After more reading I left Pharmacy with a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences and pursue a masters in Synthetic Biology, which I completed end of August 2018.
Throughout my masters it became apparent to me that Synthetic biology is moving towards a systems era and whilst module complexity and capability has advanced rapidly, integrating techniques have not. My research looks to overcome this bottleneck through dsRNA strand displacement cascades - by stacking these cascades you can emulate the same gated logic used in electrical engineering. Specifically I aimed to provide a proof of concept and build a model to study how changing sequence energetics affects the behaviour of individual and stacked displacement motifs in response to an RNA input. These transcription based tools could enable algorithms and SCADA systems to be encoded into plasmids whereby the result is reported via Toehold Riboswitch.
I’m currently pursuing PhD opportunities that will allow me to move past modelling and into synthesis, assembly, and implementation, to introduce to Synthetic Biology what the 7400 integrated circuits brought to electrical engineering.

I am a plant biologist and my major interest is to modify crop plants to improve their photosynthesis and yield. My fascination with plant biology started when I was an undergraduate student and my research supervisor, Prof. Vladimir Pyankov, invited me into work with Prof. Gerald Edwards. After my PhD on plant genetics, I was fortunate to work with Gerry again at Washington State University revisiting evolution of C4 photosynthesis in the succulent clade of chenopods.

Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values.

To earn a Gold Medal, in addition to the Silver Medal requirements, a team must:
Requirement
Achievement
1. Have another team utilized the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained?
The SUSTC-Shenzhen-A has used our LGD in designing their own circuits. see their wiki for how they are using our software: Team A .
The Tsinghua-E team has used our software for brainstorming. They trained they freshman students using circuitplus, and they told us that circuitplus is very informatic, and they will continue use it in future. Meanwhile, they propose that they can develop circuitplus 2.0 in collaborating with us.
Team Peking, team HKUST, team CUHK and team Macquarie_Australia also used our software, see their feedback here: feedback .
2a. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
One of the key points of Circuit+ is to promote sharing gene circuits. And using Mindmap, we can popularize synthetic biology from specialists to average people by asking them thinking of crazy ideas and put them on Mindmap. Meanwhile, using Mindmap to present circuits is one kind of innovation. So Sharing is what we hope to push heigher in synthetic biology. You can nearly share every thing while working for synthetic biology via circuit+ !!!
OR
2b. In place of requirement two, a team may instead use SBOL in your software documentation.
Circuit+ supports importing and exporting data in form of SBOL. here is an example
3a. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports one of the following: 1.  design of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 2.  construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 3.  characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 4.  the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 5.  the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
We have two technical standards RFC101 RFC97 to define gene circuits and logical gene gate.

In our human practice, we want to achieve a complete exploration process. In this process we need to enhance our project and to promote our project to the world. We mainly based on the following principles:
1. Extensive investigation
So as to better achieve the value of the project, we need to listen to more suggestions from the community. As the saying goes: no investigation, no right to speak.
2. Positive exchanges
Not only to show the world our works, but also to have a certain exchange of interaction with the world, we want to get good feedback.
3. Targeting the market demand
iGEM is not only a competition, but also a good project. In order to complete projects successfully we need to understand people's interests, which will help us target the market.
4. Pioneer the future
It’s essential for us to establish a system of Human Practice system, and we can obtain a lot of gains from this system. In addition, the system can be used by other teams in the future.
5. Education
Educate responsible engineers.
Our human practice focuses on the safety, rationality and value of the society. From the beginning, we wanted to find the problem in the daily life. We visited a lot of communities, and interviewed some well-known experts and scholars in the area, and also went to a lot of well-known domestic companies to communicate. We got a lot of good feedback. In the process of human practice constantly on our project has been improved.

After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind. Generally, most of them have the main shortages of high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet. We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction pathway in the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety.

- Gonna check if the composite part gibson worked. If it didn't, we'll be making new plasmids with overhangs and try to clone it into those. Primers should arrive today, Eric will fix it. We NEED to start this. If we manage to get it into pJK148 and clone it before the wiki freeze, that'll be a HUGE boon for our project. I can't stress this enough; this is super-important.
- Gibson cloning on the sfGFP. This hasn't happened yet, unfortunately, and we need to do this. Should be started instantly after this meeting is done.
- Hallvard is making some more yeast, if I'm not mistaken?
- More measurement done for the physics part to check for lasing? Someone update
- NTNU collaboration: needs to start today. Four day protocol, but really simple and not really time consuming.
Remaining stuff on the wiki
- Most of the text has been written already, which is good.
-We still have a bunch of lacking content and fine-tuning left, however. Because of this, we'll do tuning and fixing for now until Wednesday, when we'll ask all the supervisors to look through what we've done thus far and provide feedback. We'll do this for every second day remaining until the actual wiki freeze, to ensure we get feedback and get that stuff fixed as soon as possible.
- Also, the text obviously needs to be actually added to the wiki, too. We should have more wiki get-togethers. As many as possible, in fact. Aman, set this up?
- images. We have a bunch of them. Upload them (check upload requirements) and we'll get them in. Look at how past wikis have done this if you want suggestions on how to actually use the images
- references. There's a HUGE bunch of these and they need to be added. Just do this. It goes relatively quick and is really really really fucking important. Don't worry about referencing style; getting this consistent and functional is one of the last things we'll do before the freeze, we just need the actual references. I think Helene has a list of referencing material we can use.
- Work documentation: this is a bit tricky. We have the notebook page, but it never got used, so I think we should scrap it and rethink it. Everyone wrote yellow notes on what they did some time back; add this to what you've done."

GROWTH CURVE EXPERIMENT
Chemical transformation of yeast requires the organism to be in logarithmic growth phase, so, before we clone our casein genes into yeast, we need to make sure that we know how to grow our yeast to log Phase. Also, this data will elucidate the effects of heterologous protein expression on our strains.
Here's a brief protocol for monitoring yeast growth.
GROWTH CURVE
Streak Carolina strain on a YPD + Ura plate for isolated colonies.
Grow overnight at 30C
Pick a single colony from the plate (in triplicate) and grow in 5mL YPD + Ura
The next day, Record the OD (650nm) of the >16hour culture, and dilute the Growth Curve Culture by adding 100uL of 16hour culture to 99.9mL of YPD + Ura.
Grow at 30C, 250rpm.
Record the OD (650nm) at 0, 5, 10, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Use YPD + Ura as the blank for each reading.
Repeat growth curve with pD1214:FAKS-hKappa cloned into yeast strain.''
no, it's not the real human kappa casein, but it'll get us closer to understanding how our strains will perform after real cloning happens. This is a great set of experiments for folks who've not done cloning before. Please learn about Bacterial transformation and plating for single colonies, Plasmid Prep, and Yeast transformation.
Transform positive plasmid into E. coli (see Molecular Biology page)
Instead of plating transformation, add the transformation reaction to 5mL of LB + Carb(50).
Grow this plasmid overnight at 37C, rotating; and plasmid prep the DNA the next day.
Transform yeast using the Yeast Transformation protocol.
Plate transformation and incubate overnight at 30C.
Select single colonies and repeat from (1) - (c) (above).
This experiment can be repeated with different starting concentrations of Yeast culture (1:2, 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, 1:1000).

We changed the ratio of Peasant to Civilian and the concertration of arabinose, which can active PBAD to control the invertase’s secretion. RFP was measured to represent the abundance of Civilian, i.e. the ability how this part (Peasant) can feed bacteria without any invertase genes.
III Methods
    1.Transform invertase and its transport system (Peasant) and constitutively expressed mRFP (Civilian) separately into E. coli MG1655 ΔsidA ΔlacI. Let them grow in M9-sucrose culture medium, a special M9 culture medium in which glucose is replaced by sucrose.
    2. Cultivate a pipe of Peasants and a pipe of Civilians for 12h.
    3. Adjust their OD600 to be the same value.
    4. Take 2ml each, and centrifuged them at 12000rpm for 1min. The supernatant was removed and each sediment was resuspended with 2ml M9-sucrose culture medium.
    5. Add 5ml M9-sucrose medium and 100μl bacterial liquid, in which Peasants and Civilians are mixed, so the total number of them is fixed, nevertheless of their ratio. The concentration of Arabinose was set by adding concentrated Arabinose solution.
The experimental groups and control groups are listed as follows. The number “1” and “3” in the boxes are the numbers of repeats.
    6. All of the groups were cultured for 20h. The growth was measured by flow cytometry. The number of cells is averaged.
IV Results
    The number of cells were counted and illustrated in the figures. Fig. 1 shows the number of living cells in each group (Peasant + Civilian). Fig. 2 shows the number of cells expressing mRFP in each group(Civilian). Fig. 3 shows the ratio of the number of cells expressing mRFP to the number of living cells (Civilian / (Peasant + Civilian)).

Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

Using C-N Model we can model systems with great complexity
The simplest example with only E.coli cell
introduction
As the simplest example, a model of a flask with only E.coli cells inside will be shown. Only one reaction will be considered: the replication of E.coli. However, it is not trivial. MoDeL enables users to add such an auto-catalytic replication reaction easily and conveniently. The minimal database used for this model could be download here.
database construction
We only provide key points regarded with construction of this minimal database. To add the auto-catalytic reaction in the Reaction container, a species with only part E.coli is required. It has the simplest Chain-Node model format: only one chain with one part and no trees. The auto-catalytic reaction has one modifier and one product and they are both referred to E.coli defined in Species container. Since they are compartment-type species (species representing a compartment), attribute itself of compartmentLabel node in modifiers and products definitions should be set the same with label of the compartment they represent in the compartments definition. It ensures that the product and the modifier are the same, avoiding wrong mismatch of the product which is different with the modifier. Since number of E.coli cells will reach a stable level in a long time course, we use <math>k_{g}(1-C_{E.coli}/C_{max})C_{E.coli}V_{Flask}</math> as the reaction rate, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the growth rate of E.coli, <math>V_{Flask}</math> represents the size of E.coli, and <math>C_{E.coli}</math> and <math> C_{max}</math> are concentration of E.coli and its max concentration in the flask, respectively. The negative sign in the rate equation indicates self-repression of E.coli cells.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,"-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG CoA synthase) is an enzyme catalyzing the condensation of Acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). There are two distinct HMG CoA synthases, the cytosolic and the mitochondrial form, encoded by two different genes. The reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic enzyme is a part of the biosynthesis of cholesterol. In mitochondria the same reaction is responsible for keton body formation. Sterol regulatory elements in the promoter region of the gene are responsible for transcriptional regulation [41] .

PUMA
P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is protein belonging to the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic proteins. P53 plays an important role both in p53 dependent and p53 independent apoptosis. The activation of PUMA leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation [1]. PUMA is regulated by many transcription factors (TF), these TFs in turn are regulated by extra and intra cellular stimuli like genotoxic stress, toxins, oncogene expression, redox status and growth factors [42] .

Hsp70
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is an enzyme helping other proteins to fold. Hsp70 proteins are found not only in the cytosol but also in mitochondria and in the endoplasmatic reticulum. The protein binds, together with the cochaperone Hsp40, to newly synthesised (hydrophobic) amino acid residues and prevents the aggregation of those. During cellular stress e.g. oxidative or thermal stress proteins may unfold, Hsp70 binds to the hydrophobic regions of the proteins and prevents further unfolding, aggregation and apoptosis [43] .

Apo A-IV
Apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo A-IV) is a glycoprotein secreted by the small intestine in humans. The production of Apo A-IV is activated through lipid absorption (Chylomicrons). Several studies indicate that Apo A-IV protects against atherosclerosis. It is also thought to be involved in regulation of food intake [44] .

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

As the main component of the fluorescence is GFP-LVA, the samples incubated in bright light have reached the full production capacity when compared to the most fluorescent samples. Moreover, this time has been enough to accumulate GFP long enough to reach seemingly steady state (degradation rate and production rate being equal). Therefore, the response is likely to be a lot shorter than the time between the measurements (one and half hours).
The last timepoint also reveals some very interesting features in our response element. As the light intensities were restored after the perturbation, we incubated the samples in the original light intensities for 75 minutes prior to doing the last measurement. When we examine these fluorescence values (orange, 16:49) we can see that the values were restored back to the same level as the measurements before the perturbation. Also the linear dependency and fourfold fluorescence difference was restored. This means that our system seems to react very fast to increase in the blue light intensity.
.: GFP fluorescence of our light response element compared to the positive control. The 3D plot with respect to time, fluorescence and intensity shows the difference in fluorescence between our sample and the constant GFP expressing strain (Top10 transformed with Measurement Interlabs plasmid with BBa_I20260 ). The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.
One question is still yet to be addressed: does the LEDs interact with heat or is light indeed the mechanism that affects do the fluorescence? Or maybe the blue light interferes straight with GFP inhibiting its fluorescence? To rule out these effects, we compare our samples to a positive and negative control strains. We observe the effect of the blue light on the strain producing GFP at a constant rate and on strain without GFP encoding sequence.
In the , we have plotted average value of negative control strain fluorescence as a function of blue light intensity. The values were averaged over all six timepoints. As we see, the fluorescence levels are clearly lower than any of the measurements with our light response element. Moreover, the value is nearly constant, only decreasing slightly towards higher intensities. This suggests that light intensity may have some minor decreasing effects on fluorescence measured at 511 nm. However, these differences are negligible when compared to the differences in fluorescence observed with the light response element. Moreover, this also suggests that the fluorescence levels are clearly elevated even at the highest blue light intensities.
In we have compared our light response element with a strain producing GFP at a constant rate. First of all, we see that the fluorescence levels are on the different level of magnitude"

IMAC Purification, Take Two
2mL of fresh resin was added to the a pre-chilled 50mL Falcon tube. The contents were centrifuged to discard the ethanol supernatant. The standard IMAC Batch Purification protocol was followed, as in previous purification trials.
Observations
The lysate seems quite viscous, and seems to have some stringy, thick and gluttonous strands suspended in the middle. Even when not observed under blue light, the lysate solution appears an obvious light green color. We hypothesize that this may be due to the super-folded GFP being super concentrated in the lysate. Also, when lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, is added to the resin and the first wash buffer is added (20mM imidazole), the resulting solutions appears white, and a bit foamy or soapy. This contrasts with our previous experience with IMAC Batch purification, when the solution appeared mostly clear. We also attribute this to our lysate being super concentrated, especially when compared to our previous batch of Tamura, which was suspended in excessive amounts of lysis buffer. Despite these unexpected observations, we proceeded with the protocol, and collected Fractions 1-3. When the final elution buffer was added (250mM imidazole), the resin mixed with lysate was transferred into a column. Two layers appeared in the column, a viscous white one on bottom and a clearer one on top. The fraction collects at a slow pace, one drop every 15-20 seconds. Also, it's interesting that even though the strip buffer hasn't been added, the resin already seems to have been stripped. It is no longer blue.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. As safety is of great importance in our human practice  a basic safety guide  along with specific guidelines for working within the  DTU GMO lab  were provided before attendance.
The BioBrick Workshop was also a great opportunity to extract the hard-earned knowledge from previous iGEM alumni. Our own Kristian Davidsen was instrumental in running the experimental work and discussing the theory behind our lab work. SDU was kind enough to provide two alumni presenters for a session on how to create an effective wiki.
The complete agenda for the workshop can be found here  along with the SOPs , both of which can be used to inspire future teams to host their own BioBrick workshop. This is attributed on their wiki pages both  SDU and  UNIK Copenhagen .
 
No Money, No Project!
Getting the money to run such a big project as the one we have undertaken is not cheap. Therefore we have used many hours on getting sponsors and applying for different grants to make sure that we were able to participate in the iGEM competition.
The iGEM 2015 team from Københavns Universitet did not have as much time to apply for grants as we had therefor we sent them our list of grants and our template for grant applications so that they would be able to apply for the money and consumables that whey would need to make there project a reality. This is attributed on their wikipage .
 
What is Fracking?
In mid August we received a request for a helping hand from the CU Boulder from the University of Colorado. As a part of their project concerning hydraulic fracturing, they inquired our team about our conception and personal opinion of the topic. In response we provided the requested answers on a short video recording. Read more about the CU Builder project and the awareness campaign at their iGEM wikipage .
