Microalgae Transformation Platform
To transform pigments genes into Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, we created a well-designed platform for microalgae transformation.
Transformation Procedures
We have a complete set of detailed procedures of microalgae transformation from cloning in E.coli to expression in microalgae.
pPIGBACK
On the basis of previous research, we designed and constructed a useful vector pPIGBACK for microalgae transformation. pPIGBACK is a powerful construct with NSII, AmpR, double terminator, ORI, and PrbcL, and it is able to embark on gene double-crossover homologous recombination in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 genome. (see more detail: Pigments - Backbone Design)
Cultivation of Microalgae
After several failed experiences and many efforts, we found some tricky steps (such as BG11 preparation etc.) and got the hang of microalgae cultivation. All of the key points were recorded in our protocols.
Constructs & Transformants
We sent 13 parts to iGEM and successfully transformed pigments into Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.
Yellow Microalgae with CrtZ
We have successfully used our microalgae transformation platform to transform CrtZ into Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and the transformant are more yellow than wild type! (see more detail: Pigments - Functional Test)
Endolysin-Holin-NrtA
We successfully transformed NrtA gene from cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to E.coli. The engineering E.coli which expresses NrtA protein can catch"

1. The Markerless Gene Replacement Method for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3
Abstract: This is a markerless gene replacement method that combines a temperature-sensitive plasmid pKSV7 with a counter-selectable marker, the upp gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) for the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain LL3. This method allows us to adapt a two-step plasmid integration and excision strategy to perform markerless deletion of genes.
☞☟ 
Introduction
The temperature-sensitive plasmid pKSV7 of Bacillus can replicate at 30oC normally, but the plasmid will be lost at 42oC. Combined the plasmid with a counter-selectable marker, the markerless gene replacement method can be constructed.
The upp gene encodes uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRTase), which makes U transfer to UMP. Thus, cell can use extrinsic uracil via the following pathway 5-FU ➔ 5F(fluorin)-UMP ➔ 5-F-dUMP. Since the products of this pathway are toxic, cellular growth can be restrained.
If upp gene is knocked out, bacteria can resist 5-FU toxicity.
Procedures
Δupp B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 was constructed, which can resist 5-fluorouracil.
Construction of the upp cassette: An 850 bp DNA fragment carrying the upp gene with its 5' regulatory region and its 3' transcription terminator was generated by PCR from B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA using primers Upp-F and Upp-R. After digesting with KpnI and BamHI, the fragment was cloned in the KpnI–BamHI site of pKSV7. The resulting counter-selective plasmid was designated pKSU.
The target gene was selected. The upstream sequence A and downstream sequence B of target gene were combined by over-lapping PCR and ligated into plasmid pKSU.
Plasmid pKSU is a temperature sensitive plasmid, which replicates at 30"
USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#ConceptualFramework#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the behaviour of your system, since most of times biological systems have stochastic behaviours. However, it's harder to work with a complex problem, where you have tons of variables. And it’s also harder to scale-up to the ecological level and make relations with it, since ecological stochastic modeling can be a lot harder than usual.
Basic Differential Equation Models
Having this brief explanation about modeling and a few types of models you can create, based on the focus of the work of this year, paratransgenesis, there are some basic differential equations that are interesting for modeling in paratransgenesis:
Protein production in time:
The first equation that can be worked in our proposal is the anti-pathogen protein expression:
Considering that for paratransgenesis the effect of this protein occurs when it's already out of the bacteria, the expression is directly related to the population, so the first term is the population of the chassis, Na.
The parameters θS and θT are the secretion and translation rates. In our model we treated them as one single term, since they are constants. The variable mR represents the expressed the mRNA, which dynamics is described by the next equation. There’s also degradation of this protein, product of the degradation constant, μP, and the quantity of protein itself.
There’s also some other possibilities to be worked in this equation. Some post-translational alteration can be taken into account depending on the protein that will be expressed. If this protein is a monomer and its action happens with the formation of a complex, it might be interesting to have another equation describing this formation. In this case the term of formation of this complex is a negative term in the protein equation and a positive term representing the release of the complex.
In our model, we considered a negative term that represents the encounter of the protein and the pathogen, N.
RNA expression in time:
The second equation is the protein’s mRNA expression. In this equation we basically have some basal production of the mRNA, called γmR, that is basically the transcription of my DNA not considering any type of external regulation. It also represents how strong the promoter is, since a stronger promoter will lead to a bigger basal transcription. In this term there’s also inducer, [Ι] and repressor, [Χ] variables. The inducer increases the amount of expression, so is represented in a product. In other way, the repressor is the opposite. And is represented with 1+[Χ], because since is a division, when the repressor is 0, this term must go to 1. There"

To detect Plasmodium in general we aligned 2080 sequences from NCBI.                  Our primers and the probe has a consensus of more than 98% and in one case 94,9%.                  The oligos are located in the mitochondria in a regulatory region.
In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, we aligned 1012 sequences of Plasmodium falciparum and our primer set and the probe has a higher                  consensus than 97,5%. The location of the oligos is in a regulatory region of the mitochondria.
Wet Lab
In general, we can detect Plasmodium in all five cultured Plasmodium strains of Plasmodium falciparum (FCR3, Mali2K, HB3, Dd2 and 3D7 from Tuebingen and Heidelberg).                  In addition, we can detect our Biobrick (BBa_K2614000)                  that includes a synthetic template as a positive control for the                  qPCR that detects Plasmodium in general (figure 1).                  We can detect less than 1000 copies of our synthetic template with a probe (FAM)                  and less than 50 copies with SybrGreen.
Figure 1: qPCR with cultured Plasmodium stems and our BioBrick as a control for Plasmodium general
Moreover, we are able to detect P. falciparum in all five cultured Plasmodium strains.                  Our BioBrick is a negative control for our qPCR that detects P. falciparum.                  With the probe (HEX) we detect less than ten copies of our synthetic template. (figure 2)
Figure 2: qPCR with cultured Plasmodium stems and our BioBrick as a control for P. falciparum.
In a multiplex system the two probes (FAM and HEX) also                  detect the five cultured Plasmodium strains.                  They detect them with nearly the same cq-mean which means that                  both qPCRs can detect Plasmodium. With this"

A Synthetic Biology Startup with a Three-Channel Gene Switch
Project Description
We have engineered a three-channel switch that is controlled with the intensity of blue light. By utilizing the mechanisms of the lambda repressor, we are able to switch between the expressions of three different genes with a short delay. This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses.
Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Source business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Source based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Source model’s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community.
We want to share our experiences and insights in biotech entrepreneurship and address the difficulties that students and newcomers may face in the early stages of building a synthetic biology startup.
Our pitch video on August 6th, Summer of Startups Demo Day.
The Story of Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks
We are Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks, the first-ever Finnish iGEM Team and one of the four teams in the new Entrepreneurship Track. Our team consists of nine students from Aalto University and the University of Helsinki and we are combining our interdisciplinary forces to develop something new and fascinating. We want to put Finland on the map of synthetic biology and improve undergraduate research opportunities in our universities.
We have designed a three-channel gene switch that would make it possible to control three user-defined genes with blue light intensity. We are using YF1 as our light receptor protein and the signal is mediated to lambda repressor protein (CI) production via phosphorylation pathway. The concentration of the CI protein defines the gene that should be active at a time. The secret behind this function is our modified version of the lambda repressor mechanism.
We constructed a mathematical model"

Main idea
Enzymatic reaction
We have developed several libraries in Python and a comprehensive guide through our material and code. Our main idea is to spread further several techniques on modeling and simulations for synthetic biology. Everything is hosted on GitHub and publicly available for anyone in the world. We really tried to close the gap between modeling and experimentation as much as possible. For instance, the software we developed was used to analyze our Interlab Study and all results from the wet lab.
This material will be continuously be available and in the following we will go through some of what we have developed.
Crash-course on Python
The first thing we did was to level-up everyone interested with modeling, and created a small material that can be used to quickly understand how to use python and get ready for real-world problems as soon as possible. For instance, here we have a step-by-step tutorial on how to install Python with Anaconda, and here the course itself.
This material was used with UFSCar-Brasil team during our collaboration day of modeling (described here ).
Numerical techniques
Numerical methods are always a problems when someone from a biological area wants to simulate something. For several applications, there are 3rd party software that can very well simulate your system. But sometimes you may want to do it yourself. For this reason, we created another complementary material (available here ) that demonstrates how to use state-of-art numerical methods to simulate differential equations and plot them. These techniques cover most of the simulation issues people have during their first trials.
Data fitting and analysis
The last complementary material (available here ) was focused on analyzing and fitting data. To use as an example, we have used real data available from one of Mozilla's Software"

Week 2 (April 27 – May 3)
Wet Lab Overview
This week we decided to insert ftnA gene into plasmid pET-28a, because pET-28a is a high expression plasmid. We found that the Amp was ineffective, that’s why the transformation of T-vector was failed. The ftnA gene was inserted into T-vector because double digest experiment of PCR products was unsatisfactory.
We started constructing RNA thermometer circuits.
Mag-receiver
Qikai Qin extracted plasmid pET-28a.
Qikai Qin and Jinyang Liang repeated the PCR, digested the pET-28a and PCR products (ftnA) with BamHI and HindIII-HF, assembled the enzyme-digested products, and transformed the plasmids. PCR identification proved that the experiment failed. We thought that we should purified the enzyme-digested products before ligation.
Jinyang Liang extracted plasmid pET-28a.
After finding the Amp was ineffective, Cun Wei and JieLian repeated the ligation of ftnA and T-vector and transformation. Blue colony appeared on the plate. Renjie Shang and Jinyang Liang inoculated white colonies into LB liquid medium for digestion to identify the ligation.
Fig.2. Digestion of T-Vector-ftnA. The Agarose gel electrophoresis shows bands between 500bpand750bp, the target sequence band is expected at 500bp.
Strains containing T-vector-ftnA were preserved. Jinyang Liang extracted plasmid T-vector-ftnA, digested T-vector-ftnA and pET-28a with BamHI and HindIII-HF. The Agarose gel electrophoresis shows the digest result is unsatisfactory.
Agarose gel electrophoresis was done to test the correctness of plasmid T-ftnA.
Jinyang Liang and Qikai Qin did gel extraction of enzyme digest products, the agarose gel shows the double enzyme digest experiment result is terrible.

DN occurs in 20% to 40% of all patients with type 2                         diabetes mellitus, accounting for approximately 50% of cases in the developed countries.[1] The                         costs of care for people with DKD are extraordinarily high. In the Medicare population alone,                         DKD-related expenditures among this mostly older group were nearly $25 billion in 2011.[2] In                         China, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy is also increasing at an alarming rate due to the rapid                         increase of diabetes prevalence and low awareness rate. As the initial symptoms of chronic                         nephropathy are very secretive, hypertension, urinary protein, edema and other obvious symptoms have                         entered the stage of clinical diabetic nephropathy or dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).                         Furthermore, patients often fail to go to the hospital for examination, so patients with diabetic                         nephropathy often miss the optimal intervention period. Failure to intervene early can lead to a                         dramatic deterioration in kidney function and a 90 per cent mortality rate. However, if the renal                         status of patients can be monitored at any time, the reversion rate can be as high as 70% if                         intervention is carried out before stage iii of diabetic nephropathy (incipientDN).
At present, urinary microalbumin (mALB) excretion rate is mainly used to diagnose diabetic                         nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the following                         disadvantages:
The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and factors such as urinary                             tract infection can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, leading to misdiagnosis and                             missed diagnosis.
When mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to stage iii, and at this time, the patient's GBM                             thickening and mesangial matrix increase are more obvious, and there are already glomerular                             nodules and diffuse lesions as well as small artery hyaline changes, and the glomeruli have                             become dilapidated.
Han-Henrik Parving said, ""Microalbuminuria may not be as sensitive and specific a predictor of diabetic                         nephropathy as previously suggested. Other markers of risk for diabetic nephropathy are needed for                         optimal clinical management.""[3] Studies have shown that the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients                         with beta2 microglobulin"

$$ P_{clv}(s|g) = \frac{1}{1+\sum^n_{n=1} e^{-\Delta T(n)}} \tag{2}$$
With $\Delta T(n)$ the parametrization of the energy landscape: the transition state energy between the first bound state and the n-nucleotides bound state. Lastly, we make the simplifying assumption that the transition to the next state is favourable for correct Watson-Crick base pairing (with an energy gain of $\Delta C$) and unfavourable for mismatches (with an energy penalty of $\Delta I$). The energy landscape is then only dependent on the number of correct ($n_c$) and number of incorrect ($n_i=n-n_c$) base pairs.
$$ \Delta T(n) = -(n-n_c) \Delta I + n_c \Delta C, \qquad n_c\leq n \textrm{ and } n \in [1,N] \tag{3}$$
For convenience, we normalize the $P_{clv}$ through division by the cleavage probability for a matching (on-target) sequence and find R, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target.
$$ \mathcal{R} = \frac{P_{clv} (s|g)}{P_{clv}(g|g)} \tag{4}$$
From a numerical implementation of the model (in Python), we can now determine Cas13a’s tolerance for mismatches between the target and guiding sequence for several model parameters (the energy gain $\Delta C$ and energy penalty $\Delta I$).
Off-target simulations
Although scarce, there are some experimental data illustrating the mismatch tolerance of Cas13a ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 , Figure S19 and S21). We observe there is a central seed region between nucleotide 9 and 15. Two consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the two ends of the spacer, while three consecutive mismatches are only allowed to occur between the nucleotides at the 3’ end of the crRNA spacer and thus the 5’ end of the target. We consider these data, adjust the model parameters and compare the data to the computed tolerance for mismatches using our model. We find a decent parameter fit by eye to be:
$$ \Delta C = 0.25 \tag{5}$$ $$ \Delta I = 2.5 \tag{6}$$

1. New Advance
BBa_K562000 . The E. coli tat Promoter – A constitutive promoter  (neither inducible or repressible) that will express genes at functional levels.
2. New Advance
BBa_K562009 . The complete synthetic bacterial microcompartment (sphereactor) – microcompartment genes pduABTUNJK from Salmonella were assembled into a synthetic operon. Gene products of pduB, pduU, pduN and pduK all have  hexa-Histidine tags for easy isolation or identification. Western immunoblots show proteins produced both individually and as a complex when expressed in the E. coli host. As well as biobricking the whole microcompartment ( BBa_K562009 ), we also biobricked parts producing PduAB ( BBa_K562003 ), PduTU ( BBa_K562006 ), PduN ( BBa_K562005 ) and PduJK ( BBa_K562004 ) separately, in case synthetic biologists wish to assemble their own microcompartments. Parts producing PduABTU ( BBa_K562007 ) and PduABTUN ( BBa_K562008 ) are also available.
3. New Advance and Proof of Principle
A) BBa_K562001 . This is a microcompartment targeting tag (PduD20) driven by the tat promoter from BBa_K562000 . The Pdu20 tag is the first 20 amino acid residues of the PduD protein, which is normally inside the microcompartment. Part BBa_K562012 is a further modified version of BBa_K562001 that produces a fusion between the Pdu20 tag and GFP. We hypothesized that the Pdu20 sequence would be sufficient to target GFP to the microcompartment and that this could be shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy. GFP was found to localize in the cytoplasm and within the microcompartment.  The GFP also carries a haemagluttinin (HA) epitope tag in case future synthetic biologists need to follow its production.
B) BBa_K562002 . This is a microcompartment targeting tag (PduD40) driven by the tat"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," second pass during each time step, after the ODEs had been evaluated - thus skirting around the issue of having to solve thousands of simultaneous PDEs, while still producing realistic results. This would require a computational package that was flexible enough to allow us to hook into the ODE solver, performing our own calculations at each increment. An initial assessment showed that this was going to be more difficult than expected, so we decided to roll our own solution in C++.
Because computational speed was not expected to be an issue, we opted to integrate the ODEs using the Euler method at each increment, followed by a convolution of the quorum sensing molecules according to the above kernel. This method should be reasonably accurate given a small enough timestep.
The program then outputs a bitmap at each iteration with the Fluorescent Protein, Lux signal molecule, and Las signal molecule mapped to the Red, Green, and Blue channels, respectively; as well as a plain-text file with these numbers in a format that can be read by a plotting package (such as the free gnuplot, which we used to generate the graphs on this page).
We also wrote a simple GUI, which would allow us visualize the simulation output as it was running.
Finally, the program used an input bitmap to determine the amount of ""light"" shining on the system, which for our purposes was mapped directly to intercellular OmpR concentration. This allowed us to perform multiple experiments with various patterns, to test the behavior of our system under different conditions.
Results
Pictured here is the output of one of our completed simulation runs.  In this particular run, we initialized the system with a vertical stimulus down the center of the plate, resulting in linear oscillation outwards towards the edges.
This result demonstrates the theoretical feasability of our construct under the conditions present in the simulation.
To further test the simulation, we decided to try another type of initial stimulus and observe the results.  The stimulus we chose was seeding the oscillation at the four corners of the ""plate"".  The following is the result of this run, which again reflects the intended behavior of our system.

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify some integration product, eventhough it was difficult to see whether or not it's specifically targetted. Therefore, we included more negative control in this reaction. Moreover, it was shown than performing PCR clean up prior to PCR leads no amplification of the integration product, perhaps due to the loss of products that might have been in very little amount during clean up process. Therefore, the following will be implemented in this reaction
The course of integration over time will be observed by stoping the integration reaction at 4 different time points, namely 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hour, and over night.
PCR clean up procedure will not be implemented prior or post PCR reaction.
Second round PCR will be not implemented.
More negative control will be implemented. This includes reaction without adapter (to see whether there will be integration), without EPO (to see whether there will still be amplification product), without sgRNA (to compare the supposedly targetted integration guided by sgRNA vs non targetted integration), reaction with Tn5 (to compare the supposedly targetted integration by our fusion protien vs random integration by Tn5)
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ary beverages, there’s some relation be found. Their habit of having sugary beverages significantly influences their weight, leading to obesity. The research discovered that the obesity rate of children who took in the most sugary beverage exceeded those took in the fewest by 50%.
   
However, in Taiwan, the prevailing of handmade drinks has made it easy for us to find shops selling them everywhere. It is relatively hard for people to resist the temptation of sugar. If we are to solve the problem of obesity, the most direct approach is to avoid our intestine from absorbing sugar. With such aspiration, 2017 Mingdao IGEM team has designed a kind of bacteria which boost a higher efficiency of sugar absorbing. It can survive in the intestine and absorb excessive sugar before the villus have done it. This is how we take biological means to tackle the detriments sugar may cause. The bacteria is designed with a suicide system, which it will be brought to death if the concentration of sugar is lower than a standard amount we regulate. It will be discharged from our body with excretes. 
   If the product is successfully commercialized, do you agree with the way we solve the problem? Or is there an alternative? And, in your opinion, what impact may be brought to the world?
The bellows are viewpoints from the students in The Mingdao Voice. 
Jenny Yeh :
I don't approve of the way to solve the problem of sugar. I think it cures the symptoms, not the disease. Although it seems that this way can fast deal with the threat which sugar poses to health, the problem of high sugar foods flooding is still unsolved.Perhaps this can receive the result in a short time ,but this can't be a longterm solution. Those who use this product may think it's okay to increase the intake of sugar, so they won't control their own desire or resist the temptation of sugar. Instead, the uncontrolled intake of sugar attributes to the serious sugar flooding. As for the influence on health condition, I think users may reduce the consumption of nutrition and ignore the balanced diet because of the more intake of sugar foods. What's more, the harmful substances in high sugar foods are not only sugar but also much chemical addition or a large amount of oil. As a result, the product can merely solve the problem of sugar content, but it still makes users ingest even more harmful substances by changing their attitude. 
Leona Sun :
I do not agree with it. The above referred preventing sugar as the clearest solution to avoiding obesity, so there are two ways to reach this"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.
User Interface
== Welcome to the world of creation and imagination! ==
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction
Left:
When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is also available in our interface"

When gene doping has been administered, the concentration of gene doping EPO at a given time is given by Equation 19. It is assumed that the degradation of natural EPO and gene doping EPO occurs at the same rate. The overall concentration of EPO in plasma consists of the naturally produced erythropoietin and the administered gene doping EPO:

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Spunky and sweet and like a koi[de] fish swimming gracefully and nimbly amongst code and animation, Sachi is a talented junior Biological Engineer who has found her niche in the world of iGEM. This dedicated, wonderful human being started in Wet lab but worked her way up to take hold of the CS/ECE team by storm. On campus, she can be seen running through Ithaca chasing adventure and if you ever see a swish of color, it’s probably her blue/green/purple/ hair flying past. If you ever need someone to approve of your puns or somebody to help you with app design or somebody to run with you around campus, fish aren’t food but Sachi is the one for you!

In the eons past, men have offered up their prayers. Men wished for reason, for they sought the meaning of existence. Men also wished for sentience, for they wished to make their souls known to others. In the present days, we know these prayers have been answered – the design of ancient languages convey to us the wisdom and memories of old. But evidence suggests that these creations did not arise independently. Whether it’s ancient Sumerian or Egyptian hieroglyphics, whether it’s ancient Chinese or the Mayan script, experts believe that these designs were all inspired by the same unknown power. Attempts to identify and harness this power of creation has been unsuccessful, for it has always so skillfully evaded the records of history, leaving just enough traces for all to marvel at its grace and crave for its strength. However, the latest evidence suggests that this power, which came to be known as “Rishabh”, has recently taken residence in I"

BBa_K2483000 - IAA producing enzymes fused to RNA-binding proteins under control of Pveg2
The idea of the contribution requirement of iGEM is to expand the uses and information available of different parts in the registry.
This part is an upgrade to the part BBa_K515100 of iGEM Imperial College 2012 producing Indoleacetic acid with the enzymes IaaM (Indoleacetic Acid tryptophan monooxygenase) and IaaH (Indoleacetamide Hydrolase). Here we fused the IAA enzymes to the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) MS2 and PP7, respectively. We focused on giving this part a new function by being able to bind specific RNA domains.
We used this part to produce Indoleacetic Acid (IAA) in E.coli and increase the efficiency of the reaction by putting them in close proximity to each other (metabolic channelling). This was done with a dCas9 (BBa_K2483002) scaffold where the RNA-binding proteins bind to aptamer sequences added to the 3'-end of a sgRNA and the sgRNA binds to target cassettes where several of the sgRNA recognition sequences are consecutively arranged (BBa_K2483005 and BBa_K2483006). For the complete part with sgRNA, dCas9 and the IAA-enzymes, see BBa_K2483004.
Also see our registry page about BBa_K2483000.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Laboratory Biosecurity
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
It has now become necessary to expand this traditional approach to biosafety through the introduction of laboratory biosecurity measures. Global events in the recent past have highlighted the need to protect laboratories and the materials they contain from being intentionally compromised in ways that may harm people, livestock, agriculture or the environment. Before the laboratory biosecurity needs of a facility can be defined, however, it is important to understand the distinction between “laboratory biosafety” and “laboratory biosecurity”.
“Laboratory biosafety” is the term used to describe the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. “Laboratory biosecurity” refers to institutional and personal security measures designed to prevent the loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins.
We must understand these concepts and cooperate to gather appropriate information.
Declaration of Helsinki
Medical applications are often seen in iGEMs projects. The effect of the application of GMOs on human beings is still unknown. Moreover, we must also consider patients’ health and privacy. Concerning this sensitive issue, World Medical Association established Declaration of Helsinki.
Declaration of Helsinki says as follows:
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be"

Introduction
“You walk out at the end when you get old, you want to be
able to say, that was worth doing.”
Randy Rettberg, President of the iGEM-Foundation,
he European Experience 2016
The educational platform for 200 high schools in Denmark has now been launched!
Our human practice strategy is largely build upon a desire to reach beyond the iGEM community and spark an interest of synthetic biology in high school students in Denmark.
In Denmark it is not possible for high school students to work with plasmid modification due to controversial rules issued by the Danish Ministry of Education 1 . As a consequence, very limited knowledge is passed unto the students about synthetic biology and many will only encounter this exciting field when attending university.
We want to change this!
The DTU iGEM team 2015 sketched out the first steps and initiated an exciting project that would allow high school students to work with BioBricks overcoming the Danish rules by using 3A assembly of the parts.
The DTU BioBuilders team 2016 picked up where last year's team let go together with a student organisation at DTU, Biotech Academy. With a funding close to 100,000 USD it was possible to send out kits to the Danish high schools allowing them to create their own customized Biosensors.
Project Description
Denmark is a front runner of many innovations. The biotechnology field is no exception and has been offered as a pilot class in Danish high schools since 2008 to get more biological interested students to choose a scientific direction. Even though the pilot scheme has gone well and the trial period has been expanded a couple of times, the"

2010: Gene Doping Detection: Evaluation of Approach for Direct Detection of Gene Transfer using Erythropoietin as a Model System
In two mouse studies, blood was positive for a plasmid in some animals for 1–2 days and up to 1 or 4 weeks after intramuscular or intravenous administration. The sensitivity of PCR methods used in these studies was 100 or 1000 vector copies per mg of gDNA. In another study with mice injected rAAV intramuscularly, 12 whole blood samples from a high-dose group tested positive for viral DNA until day 28, but viral DNA in plasma was cleared within 3–4 days. The sensitivity of the method for vector detection in this study is comparable to that for the assays developed here. ( Baoutina et al. 2010 )
2016: Officials Fear Some Olympic Athletes Might Be Altering Their Genes To Cheat In Rio
Sarah Everts reported for Chemical and Engineering News that officials planned to test 2016 Rio athletes' tissue samples for markers of gene doping. The most likely subject of a genetic hack appears to be the gene that codes for EPO. Therefore, this gene became what the officials planned to test for. ( Letzter et al. 2016 )
Athletes at Rio Olympics Face Advanced Antidoping Technology
According to the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, Richard Budgett, samples collected in Rio will be tested for gene doping at some point after the games, even though the test hasn’t been run during the Olympics itself. ( Everts, 2016 )
2017: Doping Control Analysis at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games
The EPO gene is mostly expressed in renal cells, from where the EPO protein is secreted into the bloodstream. The identification of any concentration of EPO DNA sequences  in blood however, are considered a positive result for gene doping within current detection methods. Considering the growing concern over gene doping, as well as the EPO availability of new molecular biology tools, the Brazilian Doping Control Laboratory (LBCD) implemented, improved, and validated 2 amplification assays for EPO cDNA using the real-time PCR instrument QuantStudio12K (Thermo Fisher, São Paulo, Brazil). All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000"

We inoculated a 250 uL flask with 25 mL of LB broth, 100 uL (20 ug/mL) of adenine, and a loop of E. coli.  We inoculated 25 mL of M9 with the same ingredients. We let these flasks incubate for ~2 hours until moderately turbid.
After the bacteria is moderately turbid, we added another 100 uL of adenine and 200ul (20 ug/mL) uracil to the 25ml flasks of E. coli B in LB and in M9 along with 500 ul (200 ug/mL) mutagen 5-bromo 2-deoxyuridine and 500 ul T4 phage (1x10^9 pfu/mL) and put that in the shaker to determine if the flask will clear in about three hours.
After 150 minutes, we removed 5 mL of bacterial culture and placed it in a 15 mL tube with 1 mL of chloroform.  The LB culture cleared very quickly, while the M9 culture did not clear very well.  At 180 minutes, the LB cleared even better and the M9 cleared slightly better. Due to time constraints, we decided to harvest the pregnant bacteria at 180 minutes.  We pelleted the bacteria in a centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes and resuspended each pellet in 2 mL of broth.  We transferred it to a 15 mL tube and added 10 uL of nuclease mix, 5 uL of 1 M MgCl2, and 2 mL of chloroform. We mixed it gently and let it incubate for 30 minutes.  Then, we centrifuged it at 2700 rpm for 10 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and transferred to a new 15 mL tube.

That’s why, we experimented MOOCs format with high school and University students, in order to have external points of view. We also created a survey for gathering opinions and spread information; translated Wikipedia for iGEM competition; and participated in public events.
Model
In silico experiments can help us improve the basic design of our system. In our case, we have focused in two strategies: Flux Balance Analysis and a system of Dynamic Regulation. For FBA, we have modified a published SBML model of P.putida KT2440 to include our PLA production reactions and we have studied the tuning of cellular metabolism through genetic engineering, enzyme engineering and biochemical optimization of growth conditions. The results have been taken into account in wet-lab experiments of best carbon source selection. For Dynamic Regulation, we have designed a genetic-metabolic circuit regulating the pathway through feedback loops. Using biosensors and repressible promoters, the cell can find its own equilibrium to make PLA. We have studied it from two different approaches: rule-based modeling and ODEs in genetic circuitry. We would integrate the dynamic design in the whole system of optimization and improvement of the initial implementation.
Applied Design
Pseudomonas putida was elected as chassis for PLA bioproduction because its ability to produce polymers, conferring advantage on polymerization bottlenecks. Inducible promoters were used in order to control cell growth and production rates. An extra gene for increasing precursor production was implemented. Optimal growth conditions were investigated through Flux Balance Analysis, by testing optimal carbon source. We conceived and developed in silico a dynamic regulation system based on biosensors and inducible promoters to optimize biosynthesis by means of transcription factors binding precursors from the pathway to assess the optimization in a design-build-and-test iterative fashion. Bioprocess parameters based on experimental cell growth data were described. We designed and built a DIY bioreactor and described its optimal running. A DIY extrusion system and a roller were built for further downstream processing of the biopolymer to provide the whole system with an affordable manner to obtain and prepare the final product.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the prevalence of trichiasis (the inn turned eye lashes) in adults, women generally have about a 1.8 – 2 fold excess prevalence of trichiasis compared to men. The reason for that is that women get infected later in life by what’s going on with their children as their role of caretakers of the kids. So we have kind of two different periods when we have lot of infection between and amongst preschool children and then moms later on, when they are taking care of that preschool kids.
Kai:
[Our] last question would be if you would just focus on these two groups with a diagnostic tool and you just diagnose them eventhough you don’t have an indication would that be useful or would that just be a waste of money and time?
Dr. Courtright:
You mean, diagnosis without any other kind of other clinical signs? [...] I don’t know, that would be the quickest answer, because we often struggle to identify the connection between the clinical disease and the infection. Somebody may be infected but they are not manifesting with the clinical disease, yet. And at that point time there is definitely value in diagnosis of infection so it can be managed. At the same time, you might find plenty of clinical disease but there is no longer an infection, because the infection happened a considerable amount of time before. I think […] there are two different considerations here: one is the situation that we talked about in Ethiopia, what is going on in an area where we still have way too much infection and clinical disease. The other is as trachoma decreases. And when I say trachoma I mean the clinical disease. Do we end with focal conditions and where there is still infection going on and can we pick that up quickly to treat it quickly before it leads a recurrence of the disease? That is always the concern we have: we can see the prevalence of the clinical disease drop but we know it is not geographically even and there will be some areas where there’s still maybe more infection going on. Are there tools which can help identify those focal areas quickly and easily so that interventions can be done much quicker and therefore does not lead to a recurrence of the disease in an entire district for example.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#HeatherNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". We then created more comprehensive “final” drafts to use in future planning. As we prepare for the collaborative brainstorming session tomorrow, we are also compiling our sources of inspiration, and organizing the various sketches, notes, and products of our many previous brainstorming sessions.
Friday: Group workshop/brainstorming session with the BU iGEM team.
Week 4: June 17 - June 21
Monday: After looking over our notes from Friday’s brainstorming session, Joanna and I discussed our project possibilities and made a final decision. The project we decided to implement is an art installation/application that explores the idea of DNA as a universal language, and its potential to encode information. We spent the remainder of the day storyboarding and discussing the details of implementation, including technology, programming strategy, and user interface.
Tuesday: We further discussed implementation details and evaluated the pros and cons of various implementation strategies. After some group consultation, we have decided to create an installation version and also a web demo version for wider distribution. Now we are going to begin developing a mock-up, and working on programming some functionality.
Our first mockup
Wednesday-Thursday: Joanna and I continued developing the mockup and interface functionality. Joanna researched the Twitter API and experimented with mining tweets based on keywords, user names, and hash tags. I continued to work on the html mock-up, looking into flexible layouts and working on the functionality of DNA code translation in javascript.
Friday: In the morning, Joanna and I completed a little more work on our interface mock-up and created a paper prototype. For the remainder of the day we did more Twitter research and began to investigate animation in html5.
Week 5: June 24 - June 28
Monday: Today I spent some time playing with HTML5 canvas and created some simple test animations. The potential of HTML5 is both exciting and daunting. There seems to be support for really great dynamic interaction, but at the same time there are so many different frameworks, each with their own limitations.
Tuesday-Thursday: Throughout the week, I have been doing research and creating test files to experiment more with HTML5 canvas, playing with more animation and implementing some simple drag and drop functionality for the web application.  Now that I have some simple test components working, the next step will be to integrate the test files with the html mock-up.
Friday: Inter-team bonding with BU at the Museum of Fine Arts.
Week 6: July 1 - July 5
Monday: In the afternoon we had our first full team stand-ups to see how each project team has progressed so far and discuss our future"

The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the equation, Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of enzymes’ substrates, Km is the Michaellis constant of enzymes, [I] is the concentration of inhibitors, KI is the inhibition constant towards enzymes DszC brought by HBP, and   shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
Because substrate S has inhibition effect on DszC enzymes, we modify the model into:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Taking astringency into consideration, using MATLAB for models and experimental data fitting will be infeasible, so we choose graphical method to obtain K1 and  .
First we use double-reciprocal plot to analyze the 1/S changes over 1/v:
①The slope of double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
②The intercept of 1/v –axis in the double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
The intercept of I-axis is -αKI.
Based on models above, the value of KI,αparameters are derived.

Cell suspension is cultured in DBT-free liquid medium--30℃, 250rpm, 24h. Sample is detected for biological catalytic activity of BDS over time. The biological catalytic activity of BDS accords with an exponential attenuation, which is shown as below:
Hypothesis:
2.3 Modeling Part
1).Suppose the two intermediates--DBTO2 and HBPS—are only present in cytoplasm.
2).The inhibition to DszA, DszB and DszC of HBP is considered, while the inhibitory effect of HBPS on DszC which is mainly exists in the early stages of BDS is neglected, with the purpose of simplifying our modeling.
3).The DszD’s activity is considered non-inhibited, therefore we took the enzyme out of our modeling.
4).The loss of biological catalytic activity without the effects of HBP is considered.

Easy Note is the software based on Web, which is designed to convenient biosynthetic researchers to do some experimental record and query information. After registration and login, users can do some rudimentary records, related database and background program and so on.
Because the interface is too monotonous, and the function is too simple, we plan to design a succinctly and naturally interface and add query information, timing function, set, import and export document in the resulting month.

Han designed small icon so that the interface will be more beautiful. Small icon included addition, delete, document, tool, and set, text, picture and so on.
Qiu had successfully realized login in and registry database. At the same time, he coded the data board. Chen had written code for the interface including addition, delete, document, tool function. Nonetheless, it is still not enough perfect because of various reasons. What to do next will be discussed at tonight’s meeting.
Huang Xin learned that we can deal with the data from the database using Matlab.
Han Tao refined our algorithm to evaluate promoter strength on Java and try to run some existing software designed to improve protein coding sequencess.
Zhang Yijuan started to learn theories on RBS and its prediction. By looking up to literatures, we find several factors which can influence the RBS strength including the SD sequences, spacer length, initiation codon and secondary structure. And we come up with algorithms similar to the algorithms used in the promoter part which take 3 factors, namely, SD sequences, spacer length, start codon into account. And we’ll study the impact of RBS structure on its strength next week.
Rao has built a database in access containing all the transcription factors’ binding sites and we are now discussing how to use this database in our software.

To improve the login interface and the registry interface, Chen designed a fresh style’s interface which had divided into four sections and had used an irregular design. When clicking one section, this section enlarged so that the interaction effect was better. Kai made the numerous efforts to improve the database. Because the database is problematic, he spent a lot of time for it so he stayed up late sometimes. Next week, we will improve the function and interface.

Moyra Chikomo
I’m an Electronics and Communications Engineering student.
I chose to be a part of the Kent iGEM team this year as I wanted to be a part of a research team that was a little out of my field of study. I felt this would be a great chance to use my biology background from school and see if I could integrate that with my passion for engineering.
After I have graduated I am looking into doing further research and work towards a PhD. In the little “free” time I have I enjoy channeling my creative side, this involves general arts and crafts as well as writing short stories (for my eyes only for now ☺☺). I would say watching back to back series takes up a lot of my time and keeps me sane.
Raneem Jaghoub
I am an Electronics and Communications Engineering student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGEM for the experience and to help me decide whether I would like to continue to do a Masters degree in Genetic Engineering. In my free time I enjoy reading, painting and travelling.
Jonathan Pope
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGem because it gives students experience in working in teams with synthetic biology outside of the usual confinements of a syllabus.
In the future i plan to further my study and complete a PhD and gain more experience in the field of Biology. I play for a local mens football team and listen to hours of music in my free time as well as being an avid Arsenal fan.
Rob Middlewick
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to join the iGEM team due to my fascination with synthetic biology and because I believe that it is an emerging market. It has provided me with valuable experience working in a research environment that will prepare me to undertake a PhD after I’ve completed my degree. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, reading, and cooking.

The Original Part and Our Improvements
The Tokyo Tech iGEM team (2015) standardised a 'flippable promoter' part, which produces GFP ( BBa_E0040 ) constitutively. When FimE (a transposase) is produced, the promoter driving expression of the GFP is 'cut' out of the construct and flipped, such that the promoter is now on the opposite strand. This means that when FimE is absent, GFP is produced. When FimE is present, GFP is not produced. While this part is useful as it provides a reporter which can be switch off, it has two major drawbacks. Firstly, the GFP variant used in this part has very low fluorescent intensity, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. This prevents its use in biosensors, where most applications are outside of a laboratory environment and away from specialist equipment which could be used to measure the expression of the GFP. To remedy this issue, we have replaced the E0040 GFP variant with a red chromoprotein ( eforRed ). This chromoprotein is easily visible to the naked eye, making it much more useful for applications outside of the laboratory.
A second issue with this original part is that it is only able to give a single output (GFP). When the promoter is flipped, nothing else is"

To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node"

    Before the acid stress, the cell structure of the control strain and the recombinant strain remained intact. After 3 h of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

NTHU_Taiwan,2017,Team:NTHU Taiwan#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," helped us realize the whole plant including monitoring station. We learned much about how WTP dispose of the wastewater step by step and also how they control the system:
1. Before entering the plant, nearly most wastewater has undergone treatment by each company. Actually, the inlet water is not that dirty as what we supposed but it still contains lots of metal ions and molecules that need to be rid of. And in these years, the main issue in WTP is ammonia nitrogen degradation. Targets like EDCs are not what WTP concern, engineer Chang said. EDCs’ concentration in wastewater is too low since the water coming in from all sorts of factories dilute it. The main harmful substances left are still a lot of ammonia nitrites and heavy metals added by Chang.
[ Figure. 2.1.1-1 ] Flowchart of WTP of National Science Park. Cited from Hsinchu Science Park Bureau, Ministry of Science and Technology
2. The visit to the monitoring station helped us a lot in dry lab design. This plant is one of the most novel plants which applies testing Ammonia nitrides disposal plant and an alto control system. This testing plant is built because of the rising attention of Ammonia nitrides and the alto control system installed for the purpose of reduction of complicated control steps. Unfortunately, the first renovation, again, implies that EDCs probably is not a priority WTP. However, the alto control system does make us realize the importance of automatic control system and IoT(internet of things). Since the engineers, all use the smartphone APP to receive first information of every disposal plant so it inspired us to develop an APP and we made it !!! On the other hand, Based on the prototype alto-control system we have seen there, we conceived an idea to combine alert, buzzer, e-mail, newsletter and a real-time website displayer etc., that is, the IoT concept, and we have finished the construction of e-mail and smartphone newsletter thanks to the techniques offered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The purposes of building IoT is simple - we can reduce the risk of mistake or omission. Also, we want to unify every controller, monitors, meter and everything that is involved all together so that it would be easier to manage and has a larger space to expand other functions; for example, adding varies sensors for different chemicals or even microbes.

The Problem & Solution
Overview
Improvement of Previoius BioBrick
The Problem & Solution
Effective pest control has long been a pivotal issue in modern agriculture. With the escalating growth of world population and the change in diet, high levels of agricultural production are required to meet the demand for food production. To date, a vast majority of farmers uses chemical pesticide to kill the pest worldwide[1], it is by far the most convenient and effective way of pesticide control. However, the increased production chemical pesticides brought entails multiple negative costs that are usually overlooked, sacrificing human health and the environment. Thus, problems of chemical pesticide involving food safety, farmers’ health, soil & water pollution, and the existence of drug-resistant insects are looming. An alternative solution of pest control is urgently needed, necessitating the nascence of our project.
Overview
We designed a nature-inspired system to offer farmers a safe, environmentally-friendly, accurate, and automatic style of farming. Inspired by the spiders using web and venom to achieve the predation, the system also contains two concept-resembling parts—“Device and PANTIDE.” As engineering, internet of things (IoT), and synthetic biology collide, the transference of knowledge to state-of-the-art system helps farmers no longer need to do laborious farm works and spray hazardous chemical poisons. It is a revolutionary system that not only guarantees the safety of the farmers and customers worldwide but also safeguards the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem. (see Design & Device )
Improvement of Previous BioBrick
This year, we have designed fusion proteins of spider toxin in conjunction with snowdrop lectin by the three-alanine linker. Through the reference searching, we found that the previous research all used the three-alanine linker. In the experiment, we hypothesized that an elongated linker would enhance the function of the fusion protein for the original linker is too short for the proper folding of the two domains. So we went to the linker library in iGEM part registry website to search for a longer linker. At first, we planned to use the Flexible Peptide GS Linker( BBa_K416001 ) from 2010 NY"

This model is built to simulate the diffusion process of chemicals in the PDMS chips, and through that we are able to determine the “delaying time” of the C. elegans’ olfactory response in our inducing experiment.
The experiment is designed to demonstrate that the insertion does not damage the olfactory receptor neuron pair by testing their response to diacetyl and 2-nonanone. We assume that if the neuron pairs is unaffected, the modified worms will respond to the chemicals as the wild types do. We have 2 methods to form a concentration gradient in the microfluidic chip.
• Use layer1 to mix the chemicals from the inlets.
• Input the liquid to the side channel in layer2.
In this model, we only concern the situation in first method, the process that the gas molecules in layer1 will permeate through PDMS layer to layer2 (the chamber holding the worms).
Fig.1 The microfluidic chip We inject the chemicals in chemicals inlet2 and water in inlet1 in layer1 to form the concentration gradient or we can inject the chemicals in side channel1 and water in side channel2 to form the concentration difference in layer2
This plate consists of two layers. We inject the chemicals into the first layer to form a concentration gradient. Gas molecules diffuse downward across the PDMS layer and reach the second layer. Then the worms in the second layer can respond to the chemicals(diacetyl and 2-nonanone).
The chamber in layer2 is just like the Galton Nail Plate. We designed call it the Gaussian Plate in our project (Fig.1 the Gaussian Plate)

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#interviews#expert1_-_-_TEXT.html," our mind. The latter leads to a description in the first form singular where we have the means of language to describe processes of the mind.  For me there exists a gap between the science of neurobiology and the subjective way of describing phenomena of our minds.
Can you please give us a citation or personal definition of complexity?
What comes into my mind are two of four theses in John Searle’s book ‘Mind: a brief introduction’.
Conscious states, with their subjective, first-person ontology, are real phenomena in the real world. We cannot do an eliminative reduction of consciousness, showing that it is just an illusion. Nor can we reduce consciousness to its neurobiological basis, because such a third-person reduction would leave out the first-person ontology of consciousness.
Conscious states are entirely caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain. Conscious states are thus causally reducible to neurobiological processes. They have absolutely no life of their own, independent of the neurobiology. Causally speaking, they are not something “over and above” neurobiological processes.
Source: John R. Searle, Oxford university press; Mind: a brief introduction, 2004
I am here citing Searle because in my opinion a correct description of the world includes a ‘weak’ form of dualism, we simply cannot deal without it. With this weak dualism I do not mean the dualism described by Descartes with res extensa and res cogitans. Moreover I am talking about the comprehension that temporarily we do not have the measurement categories to create a theoretical continuum between first-person descriptions of phenomena of consciousness and third-person descriptions of neuronal processes delivered by neurosciences. At this moment we have the situation of incommensurability and it is not clear to which extent we will be able to overcome this in theory.
Can you provide us with a personal view on the emergence of complexity?
In my opinion complexity arises from us being psychic entities provided with the capability to remember and expect things from our surroundings. On the level of perception do we have primary stimuli that are interconnected on the level of memory.  Complexity is there from the beginning as the stimuli are embedded into a conceptual complexity, a stimulus is a phenomenon with a potential future.  For me perception is a complex phenomenon.
As a passionate musician, where in music do you face complexity?
For me a highly complex situation is the practice of difficult/complex passages within a piece of music. When preparing for a concert you know that every single note played must be perfect. One starts practicing in details with the goal to"

Confirmation PCR of parts 17H, 17J, 17L
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To confirm our parts of interest (17H/J/L) contained the desired insert by running PCR on DNA from the Distribution Kit
Results : We ran a confirmation PCR with primers VF2 and VR, this time with 1 uL of eluted DNA from the distribution kit as template. Even with this low concentration of template, amplification appeared successful for one part. A bright band was seen for 17J and no bands for the other two, which mirrored yesterday's PCR results. As our project depended largely on the manipulation of the inserts in each part, we will be sequencing the plasmids we transformed today once colonies form and are miniprepped.

“So, what are you doing these days?”
“I am involved in an international competition called iGEM”
“Really. Wow. What is it?”
“Well, we will try to make a GMO that solves certain problems.”
“GMO!?. I don’t like the sound of that. I don’t think that’s none of our business playing God”
“Playing God? How do you mean?”´
“You are making organisms that God didn’t intend. God is the only creator.”
“Well. Do we agree that God created man in his picture?”
“Yes”
“So, God created man precisely as man should be?”
“Yes”
“Do you believe that the almighty God gave man two arms, two legs, and two eyes without the intention that man should use these in every way possible?”
“Of course not. God made our bodies the way they are so that we can run, built, and scout for food or danger”
“I agree. Now imagine this; A man suddenly finds himself stuck in a tree. A hungry bear with cubs is circling beneath. From my perspective God has two options here; Letting the man die or in some way save him. Do you agree?”
“Yes”
“And do we agree that whatever happens, it is Gods will?”
“We most certainly do”
“So, if the man in the tree figures a way to produce a spear-like object from a branch and kills the bear, it is Gods will?”
“Very much so”
“So, we agree that every single happening on the face of earth is the will of God?.”
“I am certain of this”
“Then you must also see that when you say that I am doing wrong when I produce a GMO, you are actually saying that Gods will is illegitimate. You are in fact saying that God acts wrongfully. Do we agree on this?”

Fig. 1  Large amount of cultivated cells is time-consuming to harvest by centrifugation
In modern industry, two major methods to harvest cultured cells that produce high-value added macromolecules are centrifugation and filtration. Since sizes of Escherichia coli cells are very small, harvesting them by filtration is difficult. So the most popular method for harvesting E. coli is centrifugation. However centrifugation is time-consuming process particularly when harvest them from large volume of culture medium. (Fig. 1)
The purpose of this project is to make more efficient method for macromolecule production in bacterial cells by eliminating time-consuming centrifugation step, through enlarging sizes of E. coli cell clusters (large enough to be captured), named “Bio-capsule”, for harvesting them by filtration on nylon mesh.
For this purpose, we made E. coli expressing adhesion molecule, Antigen 43 (Ag43), on the surface of outer membrane of it for enhancing cell-cell interaction. We have succeeded in harvesting large amount of E. coli cells as filter cake on nylon mesh after continuous rapid strokes of injector (Fig. 2). The “Bio-capsule” resulted from function of the “Aggregation Module” will contribute to the industrial production in near future.

Ag43 is one of a kind of outer membrane proteins and belongs to auto-transporter family. This protein was derived from E. coli locus: flu, mapping on the E. coli K-12 chromosome. Other E. coli strains also have same gene, but this K-12 strain’s Ag43 cause the most rapid aggregation compared with other"

figure 2 A gives an overview about the cloning constructs. The N-terminal signal peptide ensures protein transport to the cytoplasma membrane. Lipocalin and the scFv-anti-NIP are the extracytoplasmatic parts of the construct to mediate signal transduction into the cell. The GGGS-Linker keeps a distance to the transmembrane region to overcome surface structures of the cell and to avoid a total inflexibility. The split fluorophor linker is only necessary for the C-terminal split parts of Cerulean-CFP and Venus-YFP.  The split enzymes β-Lactamase and Luciferase and the split-fluorophors CFP and YFP are the cytoplasmatic parts of the constructs. If there is a clustering of this synthetic receptor-system caused by the corresponding binding parts of Lipocalin and scFv-anti-NIP, the split parts come together to create a functional protein, which allows detection.

The different constructions described in figure 2.A were cloned into the transfection vector system by using the restriction sites XbaI and PstI to ensure a functional ATG-start codon which is part of the XbaI recognition-sequence in the iGEM-prefix.

NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants for the next year crops, as well as, mixed different plants to create something new and probably better.
NMS St. Leonhard
On May 3 we got the chance to visit a “New Middle School” (NMS) in Graz. We were talking about iGEM and Synthetic Biology in all grades (from 1st to 4th). For this reason, we separated in two groups of 2/3 and visited 2 classes at a time. The lesson started with a small introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, in a child-appropriate manner. We compared DNA and genes to a recipe and tried to keep it as simple as possible. The kids were very attentive and curious. Some of them also had an impressive knowledge about the topic. They asked us questions about Genetic Fingerprinting and inheritance.  After the theoretical part, we did our DNA extraction from strawberries again. The enthusiasm was huge and some kids told us they wish to become biologists, like we are. It was an awesome experience and we will never forget the excitement in the kid’s eyes.
Spritzerstand
After bringing the subject closer to the general public at “Lange Nacht der Forschung” and to kids by teaching at NMS, we tried to figure out the best way to get our university and especially students from all departments involved. It did not take long and we came up with the idea of a “Spritzerstand” on June 16. Spritzer is very popular among young people here in Austria, as it is wine mixed with sparkling water. We also added some flavour like raspberry and elder. Around the “Spritzerstand” we placed posters and further information about our project. The students were very curious and interested in what we are doing. It was a great success and it had exactly the effect we wanted because people were spending hours talking, drinking and discussing science!
Sturmstand
After the great success of our “Spritzerstand” in summer, we thought about doing a similar thing in fall. In Austria it is very popular to drink must, grape juice during fermentation. Especially in fall must in combination with sweet chestnuts is a lovely thing. For this reason, we planned a must event (like the spritzer event) on October 18. It is a great chance for us to present the results of our project to fellow students and to continue spreading the idea of iGEM among young people.

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t"

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

The B. subtilis showed no PCR product. We will need to re-purify our dna template and try the PCR again. Whitney has results for AmyA.
We took a plate reading and got a fairly consistent reading, however we are still having trouble washing the biofilm without disturbing it and losing some in the wash. To correct this, we will try to do the washes and prep work in Eppendorf tubes, spinning them down between washes to allow easy and precise removal of liquid without removing the biofilm as well. The samples will then be transferred to the 96-well plate just for the plate reading. Another possibility is to find a way to centrifuge the entire 9-well plate in between each wash. We will check with Dr. Grose on these on 7/5 and decide on which method we will use.
From our plate reading today, the 0.03% CV stain worked well and gave us a good read. We will use this rather than the 0.3% CV solution cited in our original protocol. Also, the 1% and 4% biofilms showed significantly different readings, however, both groups were fairly consistent within the groups. We decided that we will just run the 4% biofilms from now on to have standardized samples for more consistent data.
7/5/13
Today we discussed the possible methods of preventing biofilm in our washes of the 96-well plate. We will use the plate centrifuge in Dr. Grose’s lab to pellet our biofilm in the plate between each wash. We will also run a few samples with Eppendorfs to see if either method is more consistent.

We reran the PCR cleanup kit on our B. subtilis strain. We also received the DspB part from the France iGem team so we set up phusion PCR for the DspB using the BI107(forward) and BI108(Reverse) primers.

Het is immers geen alledaagse trip en het zou jammer zijn voor maar twee dagen naar de VS te trekken. We gaan bijna langer op het vliegtuig zitten dan in de VS zijn als het ware. Mijn voorstel is om vb te proberen een paar dagen vóór de Jamboree daar te zijn (4 of 5 november), dan zijn we alvast van die vieze jetlag af. Het verblijf die dagen zouden we dan natuurlijk zelf betalen en zo. Wie vindt dit een goed idee? Wie niet? - Benjamien

Wel een kleine opmerking: is het mss niet beter om een paar dagen langer te blijven, dan valt het verblijf samen met 11 november hier en missen we minder lessen (en voor bepaalde mensen mss verplichte labosessies)?

Super Protein Chip
In the future, we plan to try a variety of tumor markers and to study the value of combined serum test in tumors diagnosis. We also plan to conduct specificity experiments to test the detection accuracy. Additionally, we plan to contact the most advanced and experienced laboratory in the field of protein chip in China, expanding its value on clinical application.
Stimulated Plastic Enzymolysis
Our project shows a great potential in plastic disposal field. Because our Janus is typical of environmental and harmless, there are plenty of works need to be done!
1.   Based on the data we achieved, discuss the mechanism why Janus can promote hydrolysis rate.
2.   Expressing more fusion protein (such as LC-sJanus-m) and more cutinase to verify the universality of our conclusions.
3.   Conduct more reduplicate experiments to reduce the deviation of our data.
4.   Find a way to explain the problems we mention above, weather it is accidental or not.
5.   Optimize experimental conditions, try our best to increase hydrolysis rate. In order to apply our Janus into industry someday.
6.   Comparing fusion protein using sJanus with that using inJanus, find out the difference and which one is better for PET disposal.
Protein Extraction Kit
1.     To explore how the concentration of protein influence the extraction efficiency further.
2.     Using more kinds of proteins to conduct the experiments, we want to expand the application of extraction efficiency.
3.     Given to that we only use one kind of detergent, so in the future we are going to test several kinds of detergents to make extraction more convenient and have more meanings.

Model
Cataract prevention occurs over 50 years, so we cannot perform experiments directly on the long-term impact of adding GSR or CH25H. Computational biology allows us to predict cataract development in the long-term. These models allow our team to: (1) understand the impact of adding GSR-loaded nanoparticles into the lens over a 50 year period and (2) design a full treatment plan on how to prevent and treat cataracts with our project. Therefore, the results of our model are essential in developing a functional prototype.
For clarity, we will discuss each model in detail with respect to prevention (using GSR) only. At the end, we extend these results to treatment. In addition, we include collapsibles for interested readers and judges, in order to fully document our modeling work (eg. assumptions, mathematics, and full analysis) while keeping the main page clear with basic points only.

Talk about one of Steven's proposed questions (see below)
Talk about filling up the poster
Ethical question
In 1989 the Dutch philosopher Zweers discusses the attitudes people have towards nature. This coincides with the naturalness issue we discussed within the iGEM project. We are making (more or less) artificial systems based on (more or less) natural ""biological"" components. Zweers states there are generally six attitudes of man towards nature:
The despot, ruling the earth as he sees fit;
The enlightened ruler, where men is somewhat dependent on what nature offers, but nature can still be shaped;
The steward of the earth, where one treats the earth as if it was not his own property, with respect for nature;
The partner, working together with nature, but giving nature its own status next to mankind, where nature and mankind cooperate;
The participant, placing nature ""above"" humans, where people are only part of nature;
The ""unio mystica"", where nature is something spiritual and mankind lives in ""unity"" with nature.
The question of this week:
Where do you recognize yourself in this model? What if you do not consider nature, but biotechnology? Does this make a difference?
In discussing this topic we very soon started to discuss whether what is ""natural"" is also ""good"" per se (see also the naturalistic fallacy of GE Moore ). It was also felt that there can be a different attitude in different situations with different fields of nature. This could be the basis of misunderstandings between different stakeholders in discussions on biological topics.
We also recognized that in biological design, one tries to sell products as if it has the ""unio mystica"" character, while in early biological design, the researchers are ""despots"". Somewhere in between a developer needs to think of the ethical issues that may play, and address them properly. What ""properly"" exactly implies remains unclear for now.
Relations were made between the ""perfect"" character of nature, the creation of life within a Christian reference, whether a ""God"" made mankind and afterwards the world for mankind to use, evolution, etc.

North American Midwestern Meetup
Our team organized a meetup for Midwestern teams on June 30th, held at Michigan State University. In attendance were team members from Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Carroll High School, and University of Iowa, respectively. We spent the morning on a very warm tour of the university’s botanical gardens, learning about a range of plants and the history behind the gardens. In the afternoon, each team gave a short presentation and answered questions about their project, ending in a tour of our team’s lab and facilities. Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and began our collaboration with Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
All of the Meetup attendants pose next to the MSU Horticultural Gardens' statue of the ""father of modern horticulture,"" Liberty Hyde Bailey.
Meetup attendants take a tour of the MSU Botanical Gardens. The temperature may have been close to 100 F, but nothing can keep science nerds away from plant pathway knowledge! (We gave them ice cream afterwards, don't worry.)
Our friends from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology present about their project. This presentation session allowed teams to practice a prototype of their Giant Jamboree presentation in front of other teams as well as faculty mentors.

Notes: The pSB1A2 plasmid are a high-copy-plasmid and therefore 5mL ON culture are used for purification of the plasmid. for the PCR the following PRC program are used: 1: 94°C 3min 2: 94°C 2min 3: 55°C 30 sec 4: 72°C 1min 5: x 29 rep.  6: 72°C 5min 7: hold 4°C
Results:After the purification the concentration of nucleic acid concentration was measured on the Nano Drop. There was made four purification tubes. Only tube 1 and 3 was used for further experiments because the other contained a very low concentration of nucleic acid. The concentration in tube 1 and 3 was 25,72ng/uL and 25,76ng/uL. The purified DNA was loaded in a 1,5% agarose gel together with a 10.000bp long ladder (red).
PCR was run on the DNA using the VR and VF2 primers wich ensures the only the brick part are amplificated. The pfu polymerase was used but unfortunately i did not get any results since i did not add any MgSO4 to the premix.
