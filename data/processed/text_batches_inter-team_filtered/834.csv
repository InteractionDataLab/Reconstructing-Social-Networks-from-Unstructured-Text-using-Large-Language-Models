Week 1: June 1-2
Thursday (06/01/17)
Exciting first day orientation and safety training off-Base for the newly assembled crew. The mentors and students bonded as work started towards a common goal.
Friday (06/02/17)
On the second day, the students began learning and overviewing basic lab techniques. These techniques include conversion factors, serial dilutions, micro pipetting, and creating and pouring plates of LB agar. Under the tender supervision of knowledgable mentors, the students learned to accurately master lab techniques that would prove invaluable once lab work began.
Week 2: June 5-9
Monday (06/05/17) and Tuesday (06/06/17)
The first two days of this week were spent on Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). The team members toured the two labs that they would be working in and received safety training in both. The student researchers were very excited to tour the world-class facilities on base. Multiple brainstorming discussions were also held to finalize the project idea. After the week of training, the group of students split up into 2 groups: one to work in the 711th Human Performance Wing, and one to work in the Materials Directorate. The young researchers at the 711th Human Performance Wing were tasked with sensing and response while the researchers at the Materials Directorate were tasked with packaging.
Wednesday (06/07/17)
Sense/Respond: On the first day in the lab the members made LB broth, (formula in protocol tab). Although a simple procedure, this was the first hands-on experience for the students in the lab. They then did a plasma transformation protocol using E.coli JM109 and the plasmid PRhl_GFPa1. The bacteria created was plated onto LB chloramphenicol and left in incubator (37°C), overnight. If there was growth on the plates in the morning there would a greater probability that the E. coli absorbed the plasmid. The tired but excited young researchers went home with fingers crossed.
Packaging: The lab members attended a review meeting for the Materials Lab. This is where people gave mini presentations on how their projects"
Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#WangYong_-_-_TEXT.html," extended for more education purpose.. Synthetic biology makes sense to biologists. However, the public may have a different impression of these two words. I don’t know what they would think about synthetic biology - Transgene organisms? Evil scientists who create freaks in the lab? That’s what you need to figure out by survey and interviews. First, you need to know what are the misunderstandings about synthetic biology, and then you can design your education to address those misunderstandings. Moreover, you need to be very clear about your opinion and make sure your education material is interesting enough to attract attentions.”
 
The philosophy of our projects is to make synthetic biology available to more people . what’s your opinion or suggestions on this ambition?
“The iGEM itself is a great success of promoting synthetic biology research, it brought undergraduates and even high school students to this area. You might have heard of the concept of “Maker”, those teenagers participate in mechanic and electronic engineering by interest in the west coast of US, and some of them become notable innovators and entrepreneurs later. What I want to emphasize is that for those makers, modularized and simplified tools like Arduino and breadboard played an important role. These tools and modules make the innovation progress much easier since nothing needs to be built de novo. Your ambition seems like setting up a modularized tool for “Bio-Makers”, so I suggest your team to test your product by an open trial to the public. Build your system as simple and easy-understanding as you can, and let those people with few synthetic biology knowledge and experience use it. From the open test, you can expect to receive useful feedbacks to improve your system as well.

CRISPR - dCas13a
What is CRISPR?
Diagram of CRISPR Pathway
CRISPR is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which refers to a crucial structure of the immune system of various microorganisms. When a bacterial cell is infected by a recurrent virus, the CRISPR immune system can detect the virus and destroy it before it harms the cell. It accomplishes this by using CRISPR-associated proteins (or Cas proteins), which insert short viral DNA segments called spacers between the short palindromic repeats. The short palindromic repeats and spacers are then constitutively transcribed and processed into short segments called CRISPR RNAs (or crRNAs). The crRNAs bind to trans-activating CRISPR RNA (or tracrRNA)* and a Cas protein, such as Cas-9. This RNA-protein complex then seeks out and cuts the viral sequences that are complementary to the crRNA; thus, destroys the invading virus.[1]
The CRISPR system’s ability to do targeted cutting of nucleotide sequences has proven to be revolutionary for genetic engineering. By utilizing the CRISPR system to target sequences of interest, scientists have been able to do selective knockdown or mutagenesis in nearly every organism the system has been tested. Labs around the whole have developed numerous tools using CRISPR systems that range from diagnosing and treating genetic diseases to regulating gene expression in-vivo. [1] However, until very recently, all known CRISPR systems targeted DNA sequences. It was reported in 2016, that a new Cas protein called Cas13a is RNA targeting, opening a whole new realm of possibilities. [2]
*In later improvements, the crRNA and tracrRNA sequences were combined into one RNA sequence called the guide RNA (or gRNA).[3]

Overview
Summary
Three components constitute our transcription factor development pipeline. The first is a selection system which lyses cells containing strong matches between a mutated transcription factor and its promoter and allows for the speedy recovery of the relevant DNA. The second component is an in vivo characterization system that uses two different reporter systems as a way to document the binding affinities of the TetR transcription factor and its promoter pTet. The third component is an in vitro characterization system called MITOMI that allows high-throughput quantitative analysis of DNA-protein interaction strengths.
In developing these three pillars, a number of parts were made. We have listed all of them here and have highlighted our favorites.
Systems
Selection System: We cloned the Berkeley Lysis cassette (BBa_K112808) under control of the T7 promoter into a low copy number plasmid (pSB3K1, formerly BBa_I739202).
In Vivo Characterization: We cloned an RFP gene under control of T7 promoter variants (parts BBa_K613001 through BBa_K613012) into a low copy number plasmid (pSB3K1, formerly BBa_I739202). We also cloned TetR mutants (parts BBa_K613013 through BBa_K613019) into a  a low copy number plasmid (pSB3K1, formerly BBa_I739202). Both sets of plasmids were thoroughly characterized using IPTG platereader experiments.
In Vitro Characterization: We characterized TetR mutants (parts BBa_K613013, BBa_K613015, BBa_K613016, BBa_K613017, BBa_K613019) in the low"

Ran PCR on the inserts that had failed previously at a higher melting temperature.
Inserts 1, 3 and 5 showed bands at correct size.
Sent samples to genewiz for sequencing.
Used PCR to extract our vitamin A genes from the genome of our strains. PCR purified these selfsame inserts and digested. Proceeded to ligate overnight.
09/13/11
Received sequencing information from genewiz. Three more sequences were confirmed.
Transformed our vitamin A genes ligated to pcb1c3 into e.coli.
Picked colonies from successful transformation to grow overnight.
09/14/11
Performed csPCR on vitamin A genes.
CrtI and E showed bands of the correct size. However, by mistake I discarded the culture of overnight E.coli for CrtE.
Picked 96 colonies from both CrtE and CrtYB for overnight growth in 96 well plates for csPCR.
09/15/11
csPCR of CrtYB showed that only two colonies had bands of the correct size.
csPCR of CrtE showed many colonies had bands of the correct size.
Sent 4 CrtI, 4 CrtE and 2 CrtYb colonies for sequencing.
09/16/11
Sequencing results returned from genewiz. Both CrtE and CrtI had colonies with the correct sequence, however, CrtYB only had religated vector, as the chloroamphenicol gene was the one sequenced.
09/20/11
Prepared csPCR of second round of vitaminA clones and qcPCR clones.

Why?
You probably have already heard or read that fossil fuel reserves will eventually dry out, right?
Some estimates indicate fossil fuel reserves will run out in the next 30 or 40 years.
It is unlikely the Earth will be able to replenish these energy compounds we inherited from nature.
Ok... you got the idea right? We need renewable sources of energy.
How about biodiesel? Isn't biodiesel already a renewable energy source produced in large scale?
Well... not really, crops used to produce biodiesel do not cope with the world demand.
But... can't we allocate more land to increase biodiesel yield?
Actually... we cannot! Currently, about 95% of the world biodiesel is produced from edible oils such as rapeseed (84%) and sunflower oil (13%).
And these crops already use the suitable spots of agriculture land the world has.
Furthermore, there is no high quality agricultural land to locate plant species for biodiesel production. The fuel crops will compete with food crops.
Source:“A Comprehensive Analysis of Biodiesel Impacts on Exhaust Emissions”. Avaible at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/analysis/biodsl/p02001.pdf
Nevertheless, there are alternatives to this obstacle, including the conversion of non-edible oils into biodiesel.
We MUST look for other alternatives.
That's exactly what  we did.
Graphic showing fractions of raw material mix present in Germany's diesel.
Source: Union zur Förderung von Oel- und Proteinpflanzen e.V. (UFOP); Adapted from Biodiesel Magazine.
What was our research rationale?
First of all, we aimed to identify non-edible oils to produce biodiesel.
The second step we had to work on, was on the identification of a pathway that converts fatty acids (""oils"") into chemicals molecules that are key components of biodiesel.
The third step was to identify a biochemical pathway that converts fatty acids into alkanes.
The fourth step was to identify a pathway that confers membrane resistance to fatty acids.
We were able to identify gene biological pathways that code for proteins involved in each of the steps listed previously.
A funny workflow of our synthetic biology model!
Alkanes Pathway:
The alkane production works trough the Lux Operon usage."

In order to balance all of these constraints, a couple of changes to the coding sequence of the genes were made; however, degenerate codons were used so that the amino acid sequence was not disrupted.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour50_-_-_TEXT.html," This could be due to the fact that people in Ghana and Argentina are presented with undernourishment in their own country as an everyday crude reality.
But as mentioned above, some survey participants pointed out, that they don’t see a problem with malnourishment in Denmark.
It is important to keep an eye on what type of people answered our questionnaire. We saw that many participants had a natural science or social science background and many were in the same age range. Their educational background might have introduced them to GMO before, so that they have a more scientific point of view compared to people with different educations. Furthermore, younger people might be more open-minded towards new technology compared to older people.
In fact, we can´t be sure that only people with connection to a university have filled out our questionnaire. We asked that only those people would answer the questionnaire, but it was freely available to all. All data from the UK were answered by iGEM participants. These people have a similar educational background and are probably all interested in synthetic biology, which often includes knowledge about GMO. It is possible that the data are more uniform because of this.
People who don´t know much about bacteria and GMO might have an unconsciously negative attitude towards the words as most people have negative connotations, i.e. all associations a person has about a word.
Unfortunately, we couldn´t use some of the data, as the answers were unclear. The questions could have been designed differently, with fewer and simpler response options. This might have lead to a clearer result.
Overall, we got too few responses and a too little diversity of participants, but the results obtained gave an insight into the opinion of the people.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,". If not found, then go for the next species.
(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both.
(4) For each template reaction found, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction.
(5) For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
(6) Go to step 2 until the end of the species list.
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
What are special reactions and How to handle with them?
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions (RNA polymerase are ignored). The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
What are differences from single compartment to multi-compartment?
Consider an example first. AHL molecules outside diffuse into E.coli cells with rate k1, while AHL molecules inside E.coli cells diffuse outward and enter into the bio-reactor with rate k2. We assume diffusion reactions are all driven by concentration gradient.

NYC_Software,2011,Team:NYC Software#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," open source tools that would allow everyone to engineer and understand biology more efficiently. We believe that by making good software tools and data sets available to the broader spectrum of people we can promote standardized practices and open communities to foster safer and more positive synthetic biology. And owing to the engineering and data driven nature of the field of synthetic biology itself we believe that it is crucial to push for open standards tools and data to ensure its safe practices in the future.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html," behavior with regards to EPO and red blood cell production. However, IM injection requires more vectors than IV for the same response due to the vectors being destroyed in the muscle and having to pass into the bloodstream. The detection limit of the doping DNA for large dose administration is 261 days after administration. The effects of EPO gene doping on red blood cell count is prevalent until 136 days after injection. The red blood cell count passes 30 trillion cells 19 days after injection.  It reaches its maximum count of 35.9 trillion cells 57 days after injection before dropping below 30 trillion 136 days after injection. Assuming the athlete is trying to maximize his or her performance for a competition, the gene doping test could be conducted during the competition and the doping athlete would be caught. Gene doping athletes are also at risk of being caught through the athletes biological passport system implemented by WADA. The biological passport is an individual electronic record of a professional athlete which profiles biological markers of doping.  Every time an athlete is tested for doping, his blood cell count is recorded. Any large fluctuations in red blood cell count would flag the athlete as a potential blood doper. Another problem with single dose administration is that red blood cell count falls below normal levels after the doping EPO wears off. This causes a decrease in the athlete’s performance following gene doping. For these reasons, athletes are likely to avoid single dose methods in favor of multidosing.
Microdosing Gene Doping
In multidose gene doping, an initial large dose of gene doping EPO DNA is injected to rapidly increase the red blood cell count. Following this, smaller doses are given to maintain the desired red blood cell count. This can be seen in Figure 22. For IV administration, an initial dose of 64 billion vectors is used followed by smaller doses of 18 billion vectors every 20 days.  For IM administration, an initial dose of 96 billion vectors is used followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.
The downside of this method is the requirement for constant microdosing. Repeated injections would cause noticeable damage to the veins. The athlete would then be required to disguise the injection sites or perform the IV microdosing in parts of the body normally covered. For this reason athletes would likely favor IM injection to IV injection as IM is less invasive.
Figure 24. Concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in the blood during IM microdosing with an initial dose is 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.

Subculturing E. Coli
What you need:
- Autoclaved 250 mL flasks
- Liquid Media
- Antibiotic, if necessary (not for DH5a c competent cells)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. Into your autoclaved flask add:
- 50 mL liquid media
- 50 ul antibiotic solution if necessary
- 500 uL overnight liquid culture.
Note: there is a 1:100 ratio of cells to media. Furthermore there is a 1:1000 ratio of antibiotic to media. When subculturing DH5alpha, antibiotic solutions are not required.
2. Incubate in the 37˚C warm room on a stirrer for 4-6 hours
Note: Need to check the cells 2 hours after inoculation to test their optical density (OD). The best competent cells come from cells in exponential phase of their growth. Therefore an OD of 0.4-0.8 is desired and this happens after 2-4 hours of incubation.
Electroporation and Transformation
You will need:
- 100 µl – Electrocompetent Cells
- 2-5 µl – Ligation Reaction (10 – 100 ng DNA)
- 1 ml – SOC broth/ LB liquid media
- Electrocuvette
Procedure:
1. Gather all your supplies and keep them on ice (or in 4o C room). This includes the cuvettes.
2. Thaw frozen electrocompetent cells on ice and place in electrocuvette. Then add ligation reaction and tap the cuvette to mix well. 3. DO NOT pipette up and down.
4. Keep on ice for 1 min.
5. Pulse once (On machine use Ec1 for 1mm cuvettes and Ec2 for 2mm cuvettes).
6. IMMEDIATELY after add 1ml of SOC broth and pipette up and down gently.
7. Incubate recovering cells in 37o C for 1 hr.
Plating:
1. After incubation, plate 200 µl of transformants on to appropriate selective plate and incubate at 37o C for 18+ hrs.
2. If no colonies are formed plate out the rest of the transformants (~800 µl) and incubate at 37o C for 24 hrs

Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html,"=20(years old). Additionally, respondents with a Bachelor or higher degree have taken up a large proportion of the sum.
Method
The survey was based on a questionnaire which has been given out randomly to the public through the Internet. 321 questionnaires have been collected. As the coverage is rather wide, the amount of data is large, the result is reliable to a high degree.
Survey time
From 2017 April 1st to 2017 April 30th
Contents of questionnaires
There are 16 questions included in this questionnaire. Contents of it are mainly consisted of publics’ understanding on transgenic technology, risks and harm of it, as well as the future and application of it.
Results
1. Views toward transgenic technology among different ages
What's your attitude toward transgenic research project？
Do you think whether transgenic technology will be promising in future？
Have you ever used transgenic products?
A glance at these results of surveys illustrates that youngsters learn more about transgenic technology to certain degree, meanwhile they have exhibited an expectation to the promising prospect in the development of transgenic technology. However this is not a case for the senior people especially for the elderly. Large amount of them hold skeptical views to the transgenic products and object to researches with regard to transgenic technology. At the same time, the fact that the penetration of approved transgenic products is rather low is indicated.
2. Views toward transgenic technology among different majors and educational levels
Do you know about transgenic technology?
It can be apparently concluded from the graphs and diagrams above that nearly half of the students with a bachelor or higher degree who major in Biology know very well about transgenic technology while over 90 percent of biology-major students are familiar with this technology. In comparison, as non-Biology major students learn little about transgenic technology, around half of them has just heard of the term of “transgenic technology” and actually knows genuinely a little about the essence. It obviously reflects the truth that publics’ acknowledgement of transgenic technology has still been hindered at the surface currently in China, thus the public can sometimes be easily misled and panics can be easily raised by rumors as well.
What do you think about transgenic products？
As the diagram shown, as for those non-biology major respondents, the lower educational degrees they obtained, the larger the proportion of people who consider transgenic products to do more harm than good is. While transgenic products are more highly-recognized by students with a bachelor degree or a higher one, and they may give out a more reasonable comment.

Michigan State University is working on showing the effect of ACC deaminase engineered endophytes on plant growth in drought and high salinity conditions. We worked with the team to build a kinetics and genetics model that described their system. We were able to make simulations in MATLAB that returned graphical data on how their system acted over time.
Click here to go to their modeling page and see the work we did for their team.
Skype Calls with Other Teams
We met with the University of Michigan iGEM team on video call to talk with them about their project. They are working with a Cas9 system and had questions about how it could be modeled. We were able to give them initial steps on approaching the problem and explained mass-action kinetics to them. After the meeting, we have kept in contact emailing  resources we used for our model, a self-made presentation breaking down simple genetics and enzyme kinetics generic examples, and offering advice on overall model development. In return, they reviewed our wiki and gave us some pointers on the aesthetics and organization of the material.
We skyped with the Yale iGEM team to talk about our projects. Both of our teams are making cells that secrete the enzymes PETase and MHETase to break down PET plastic. They have had more success in the lab than we have, so we were able to ask some questions about how they got their plasmid working. They also suggested we try Gibson Assembly and ligation independent cloning for our plasmid. Additionally, they told us they were finding more success with the yebF secretion tag than some of the others they had tried, like our pelB secretion tag. We were able to answer some questions for them about the modeling we had done, our outreach plans, and other work on our wiki.

Project Overview
One goal of synthetic biology is to understand the exciting biological phenomenon by reconstructing the systems that have the similar behavior to the native. The design of networks are always challenging to the biologists as the desired phenotype is the only hint for the design. And after the design is finished in mind, there is still a gap in realizing it in experiments.The choices of reactors, the stability of the system are still important in the wet experiments. Here we are trying to escape the biologists from the design nightmare, employing the computer instead of the human brain to do the design process.
Goal
Work Flow
The ultimate goal of our program is to assist the experimentalists to design the plasmid that works as the requirement. For example, if an oscillation behavior is the requirement as the input of the software, then the output in our imagination is a DNA sequence which works as an oscillator in E.coli or other specific organisms. It is only an imagination that we have a long way to go. Then the first goal is to make a network work stably. Generally, the desired phenotype is the input of the software, and, optionally, the restrictions extracted from the other experiments or conditions can be the input simultaneously. And the output is a list of networks that have similar phenotypes approximating to the requirement, along with the kinetic parameters and robustness evaluation.

The three-layer optimization is expected during the whole design process: (1) the optimization of parameters in a fixed mathematic model, (2) the selection of interaction forms in a fixed topology, (3) the comparison and screening of different topologies. And during the optimization of the parameters, there are two score functions considered. One is the RMSD(root mean square deviation) between the phenotype of the designed network and the requirement, and the other is the sensitivity of each parameter. As the cell system is noisy, the networks are hard to realize in experiments if some parameters are too sensitive to uncertainties. So the parameters' sensitivities are working as a filter to get rid of the networks that works not stably enough. After the three-layer's optimization and comparison, a list of the best selected networks will output as the final solutions.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,"E protein permanently inverts the promoter from [ON] to [OFF].  This inversion can be used to amplify weak or inconsistent induction signals.
Since the part we are making is designed to amplify a weak signal which can then be detected by a downstream ‘reporter’ cell the quorum sensing system from P. aeruginosa was adapted to allow for signal transfer between cells.  The rhlI gene from P. aeruginosa produces the quorum sensing molecule N-butyryl-AHL (C4-AHL) (Parsek et al.,2000) ( J64718 ),  this molecule is membrane permeable and able to induce expression of a promoter upstream of sfGFP in another cell ( K2205015 ).
Figure 1: SBOL Visual of the switching mechanism of the Fim Switch, in the native [OFF] state the eforRED reporter is expressed (shown in red) allowing direct visualisation of the cells.  Following the inversion of the promoter region ( K1632004 ), eforRED expression is halted and the rhlI gene is expressed ( J64718 ), this is now the [ON] state.
Design Stage
To construct the Fim reporter switch 3 separate gBlocks were designed with overlapping adaptor regions homologous to the iGEM prefix and suffix to allow for Gibson assembly into the pSB1C3 backbone whilst retaining biobrick compatibility.  The individual genes and other components are shown in (Table 1).  The 1st gBlock sequence starts with a RBS ( B0034 ) upstream of the fimE ORF ( K137007 ) with no promoter region, this is to allow for other promoters to be cloned in upstream of the part.  Downstream of the fimE gene is a double terminator ( B0015 ).  All RBS and terminator sequences used are B0034 and B0015 respectively.  The switching mechanism consists of the Fim promoter sequence ( K1632004 ) flanked by two RBS-ORF-Terminator sequences.  While in the native [OFF] state the Fim promoter drives expression of eforRed ( K592012 ) and when flipped to the [ON] state drives expression of rhlI ( J64718) .  The rationale behind using the fimE gene instead offimB is that it permanently inverts the promoter region meaning weak induction signals can be amplified by the Fim switch.

If the cloning of the acsABCD operon had been successful, the cellulose biosynthesis would have been tested using fluorescent brightener 28. This is a colourless organic compound that fluoresces with a bright blue color under ultraviolet radiation, and it is used as a fluorescent brightening agent for polyamide and cellulose fabrics. Fluorescent brightener 28 binds non-specifically to polysaccharides with β-1,3 and β-1,4 linkages, of which the latter is present in cellulose Staining of fungal hyphae and propagules with fluorescent brightener .

Project Overview
Introduction
Cellulose is a natural biopolymer used for a vast variety of biological purposes and it is most commonly found in plants, where it serves as the main structural component. Since plants are primary producers, many organisms of the Earth’s ecosystems have adapted accordingly Lynd LR, Weimer PJ, van Zyl WH, Pretorius IS. Microbial Cellulose Utilization: Fundamentals and Biotechnology. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews. 2002;66(3):506-77. . One of the key evolutionary features for the primary consumers, was the development of the ability to degrade cellulose into glucose, which could then be used as a cellular fuel. A simple organism, able to efficiently do so, is the Cellulomonas fimi, which converts cellulose to glucose in a two-step process, with cellobiose as the intermediate Jung SK, Parisutham V, Jeong SH, Lee SK. Heterologous Expression of Plant Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes for Effective Production of Cellulosic Biofuels. Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology. 2012;2012. .
Breakdown of Cellulose to Cellobiose
Cellulose is a long polysaccharide consisting of β-1,4-linked
D
-glucose units and many organisms, including E. coli, lack the enzymes able to degrade these strong β-linkages. To overcome this, the C. fimi has developed two cellulases, namely the endo-β-1,4-glucanase and exo-β-1,4-glucanase, respectively encoded by the cenA and cex genes Jung SK, Parisutham V, Jeong SH, Lee SK.

We designed composite parts that would utilize these peptides, and display color when they are cleaved for easier and more robust detection. The time necessary for the detection can be significantly reduced when compared to detection methods currently available. Lastly, we developed a prototype of a device that would employ these parts, thus creating a complete and intuitive snake venom detection system.
Future
As mentioned above, our project investigated snake venom detection only as a proof of concept, using three snakes that are a huge health problem and are active in the same geographical region. Future studies would involve optimizing and continuing the tests of the composite parts that allow the identification of these snake venoms, and improving the device used as the detection system. In addition, reducing the time of detection to even less would greatly help the performance and capabilities of the system. Last but not least, continuing the research for more suitable and efficient oligopeptides and expanding the snake species of interest to more regions of the world would be of great importance.

Materials
1 g of wet cell paste or 250 mL bacterial culture with OD600 of ~2.0
CelLytic B
Procedure
Collect bacterial cells that express protein of interest by centrifuging at 5k x g for 10 min.
Carefully remove the spent medium from the cell pellet. The cell pellet may be frozen or used fresh. Frozen cell pellet will give slightly higher yield of protein
Add CelLytic B at ratio of 10-20 mL per gram of cell paste. Mix well to completely resuspend the cells.
Add lysozyme (final concentration = 0.2 mg/mL) to enhance cell lysis
Benzonase (final amount of 50 units/mL) to decrease viscosity of solution.
Protease inhibitors to prevent proteolytic degradation
Incubate extraction suspension with vortexing/shaking at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to fully extract soluble proteins from cells
After cell extraction, centrifuge the extract at 16k x g for 10 mins to pellet insoluble material.
Carefully remove supernatant containing soluble protein fraction. Another round of extraction will yield more soluble protein if required - but will result in more dilute soluble protein sample
Analyze supernatant and insoluble fraction by SDS-PAGE and/or Western  blot to determine which fraction contains protein of interest. For SDS-PAGE use 5-15 uL of each sample for gel.

Cloning of MerT and MerP into BBa_J63010
PCR gene fragments and BBa_J63010 were digested overnight with EcoRI and PstI. Digestions were run on a gel, then in-gel extraction performed. BBa_J63010 was then de-phosphorylated using SAP. Gene was added to vector at 3:1 molar ratio for ligation with T4 DNA ligase. Ligation products were transformed into cells, supplemented with ampicillin, then positive colonies picked for micro-culture. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a miniprep kit, and a digestion using EcoRI and PstI performed.
Figure 12 | Two positive clones of MerT + BBa_J63010 were digested using EcoRI and PstI. Fragment size at 376pb is MerT gene.
Both clones have been submitted for sequencing (21/10/09). We are currently waiting on the results.
MerT was named part BBa_K205004 and submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological parts in plasmid backbone BBa_J63010.
Conclusions
Part BBa_I76101 is incorrect. The sequence supplied on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts site is not a true refelection of the physical DNA. The sequence was unable to be cut by BglII, XhoI or BamHI, which were predicted restriction sites from the sequence. It was cut by PstI, when the given sequence does not contain that site. This part does not fulfill the conventions of Standard 21, as it contains neither the correct suffix or prefix.
Ag43 was isolated from plasmid pKKJ143. However, because the intended vector BBa_I76101 did not conform to Standard 21, this part was taken no further.
Part BBa_J63010 contains the correct Standard 23 Biobrick suffix and prefix.
MerT and MerP were successfully isolated from plasmid pSUTp.
After cloning into vector BBa_J63010, a fragment of the correct size (corressponding to MerT) was observed after digest with appropriate restriction enzymes.
Part BBa_K205004 (MerT) was added to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

Product Design - Background
Our circuit, the tri-stable switch, has many possible functions, ranging from bio-computing, cell differentiation to biosensors. This year, we decided to apply our tri-stable switch on something beneficial for the Hong Kong community, which is a biosensor for fungal diseases in trees. By using the tri-stable switch, the chemical which has the highest"

In the second and third sample preparations the amount of horse feces was kept at a constant 1 g whilst LB-media was used to dilute the liquid culture so that different concentrations could be attained and the total weight of mixed samples was 5 g.
Figure 2. Sample preparation of plate reader samples. The right shows the samples being put onto a shaker in order to speed up the flow-through time.
The first sample preparation (consisting of a mixtures of horse feces and amilGFP liquid culture) was put directly into a 24-well plate with triplicates of each concentration. This method was done for all samples for all preparation methods.  The second preparation of samples was put into a filter (Munktell’s A3-90-700, 70 mm, poorsize 10 µm) and the third preparation into another type of filter (ICA coffee filter “unbleached 102”, cut into circles at 70 mm, est. poorsize 10-15 µm). When 1 mL of liquid could be obtained it was put into a 24-well plate. In order to speed up the process of filtering the sample a shaker was used.

Regarding the second experiment aimed to establish what concentrations would be required in order for fluorescence to be measured with a plate reader. The results can be seen in figure 3 and figure 4 below. Figure 3 shows the fluorescence of samples where feces were mixed with amilGFP and figure 4 shows the fluorescence of the filtrate. The results where feces had been mixed with liquid culture of amilGFP show inconclusive results, with no relationship between the concentration of amilGFP and the fluorescence intensity. However, the results from the samples where liquid cultures of amilGFP, LB-media and feces were mixed and filtered through a coffee filter and a Munktell filter shows some linearity in"

Anti-KRAS siRNA (siRNA for KRAS gene silencing)
Introduction
This part is an artificially designed RNA strand. It serves as an element of the Team NJU-CHINA RNAi module which can be used for down-regulation of KRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We designed specific KRAS siRNA with algorithm based on a software developed by SYSU-Software team. This tool can find the best siRNA sequence on target gene KRAS to ascertain the maximum gene-specificity and silencing efficacy and also designs the pair of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. Then we synthesize the shRNA sequence from a DNA synthesis company (Genscript).
Figure 1. The sequence of KRAS shRNA
Usage and Biology
We packaged KRAS siRNA into exosomes by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS siRNA and then collected siRNA-encapsulated exosomes. When modified exosomes being intravenously injected, they will specifically recognize integrin receptors and fuse with lung adenocarcinoma cells under the direction of the iRGD peptide. Once inside cells, KRAS siRNA will bind to KRAS mRNA through base-pairing and digest the mRNA, resulting in sharp decrease of K-ras in lung cancer cells. As a consequence, K-ras protein’s reduction and disturbed function will both result in the inhabitation of the proliferation of cancer cells, which ultimately have some therapeutic effects on lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer in this case).
Characterization
Interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid
To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, we transfected it into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and then extracted protein"
NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," and high concentration of recombinase.
Characterization in original part
The Peking iGEM 2017 team identified the properties of Bxb1 gp35(BBa_K2243012)in E. coli. We obtained the sequence of this part and requested the plasmid from them. Since our chassis organism is mammalian cell, we optimized the codon and then we identified BBa_K2557001 in detail in HEK 293T cells. Although Bxb1 works well in HEK 293T cells, we did not repeat the activity reported by Peking iGEM 2017 team in E. coli.
Pronuclear verification of recombinase
Two plasmids with different resistances and origins of replication were used for function verification of the recombinase. One of them is a reporter gene plasmid, which uses the constitutive promoter J23119. The recombination site is located on both sides of the promoter: one side is sfGFP, and the other is mRFP. The other plasmid is a recombinase expression plasmid using PBAD, an inducible promoter, which is induced by arabinose. When the two plasmids were co-transfected into E. coli, the reporter plasmid expressed sfGFP, a kind of green fluorescent protein; when the inducer arabinose was added, the recombinant enzyme was expressed, the promoter was inverted, and the mRFP , a kind of red fluorescent protein, was expressed.
Due to the use of two different resistant plasmids, kana and chloramphenicol, we used a plate containing two resistances of kana and chloramphenicol for screening, grew more colonies, and randomly selected 9 singles. After the colonies, we made colony PCR (Fig. 1) and the results showed that both plasmids were transferred.

The verified E. coli was separately placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing antibiotic-containing LB medium, and the culture was grown at 37° C and 200 RPM for 6 hours, and then the culture was aliquoted into two portions, one of which was added with an inducer (10 mM Arabinose). Two cultures were grown for "

""Declaration on the Human Environment"" than was passed in this meeting is the first global international documents in human history to protect the environment, and it marks the birth of the international environmental law.
The International Environmental Education Conference, which published the famous ""Belgrade Charter,"" was held in Belgrade in 1975. This Charter sets out the purpose, goals, objects and guiding principles of environmental education.
Copenhagen World Climate Conference was held in Copenhagen the capita of Danish in2009, and it absorbed many representatives from 192 countries, who are to discuss the follow-up program after the first stage of ""Kyoto Protocol"" expired. The conference is regarded as ""the last chance to save humanity"".  After that, ""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" published.
Nowadays,energy crisis and global warming have become increasingly prominent and threated the healthy development of human society. To solve these issues to some extent, we，members from BIT-CHINA,investigate the basis of Bioproduction process at home and abroad and hope to create one kind of heat self-regulated E.coli with the help of synthetic biology.
We can see that E. coli is still the main industrial model strain used in the process of domestic production of bio-based chemicals from the current industrial production process. Applying our new E.coli to the fermentation industry is important to biological industry restructuring and healthy development. Our research can broaden the optimum fermentation temperature of E.coli to effectively activate reaction process, accelerate the metabolic process flow and control the reaction mass transfer efficiency, and thereby improving the efficiency of cell product synthesis; In addition, the application of this project can effectively save water and power resources, reduce fuel consumption, such as coal and oil, and thus greatly reduce the amount of CO2 generated by thermal power, effectively curb global warming and other environmental issues.Last but not least, our project is conducive to the sustainable development in our society, the harmony in natural ecosystems, and the environmental protection of global village,

Introduction
Spatial factors have a great impact on the results of population competition or cooperation. To understand spatial effects better, we develop our discrete probabilistic solid model.
This model is then used to simulate cell growth in real medium. Also, it is used as the core algorithm in our E-coli war game.

It seems we can use Partial Differential Equation (PDE) directly. However, it will be too complicated to execute PDE fast in program and also difficult for visualization of the changing process, not to say adapting it to our game.
Thus, we choose another method as our solid model fundamental: cellular automaton(CA).
[wikipedia] A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously. [1]
Using the idea of CA, first, we discretize whole space in a medium and total time we take to nourish cells; second, we set placement rules, i.e. events that will happen after a cell is put onto medium; third, we set iteration"

Nematoxicity Test
At last, we did nematoxicity test to find if rMpL protein did have the ability to prevent C.elegans from developing to adulthood from larva. As we showed in the microscopic figures below, nematodes treated with recombinant bacteria show significant difficulty in developing into adulthood according to several measurement index such as the length of the nematodes and the motion activity of nematodes. While the control group showed the opposite phenomena, which is to say the worms can develop to adulthood normally. And as for the motility of the nematodes, the nematodes which ate the bacteria-expressed rMpL moved slower than control group. The following figures shows the differences between the experimental groups and the control groups.

Not only do we display the regulation of our gene of interest to a certain threshold at the end of our timecourse, but  we can observe a tunable threshold as this steady state value changes with varying strengths of the promoter driving expression of Y.  By tweaking certain biologically-relevant parameters is possible to alter the behavior.  The ability to swap in different promoters or to alter binding affinities will make our limiter flexible for regulation in varied biological systems.  Continued part characterization will only further contribute to the ability to predict the results of this tuning.

DNA Hybridization Kit
Taylor Canady, a chemistry graduate student, created a DNA modeling kit in conjunction with Genoa Warner, which was quite successful with students and teachers around Pittsburgh. The iGEM team was approached to physically assemble the kits and provide instructions to accompany them when they are implemented in classrooms. The outreach duo wrote and created 12 different small flip-card sets that have four categories and three levels of difficulties for the teachers to use with the children as they see fit!
Future Impact: Taylor’s DNA Hybridization Kit has already won the 2014 Carnegie Science Award and been at the hands of 132 kids and teens. For Taylor, the moon-shot goal is create a larger-scale operation with a broader distribution of the kits to go across America, possibly accompanying science textbooks as a supplemental kit for teachers, but his mind is open to whatever falls his way. With the instructions from the CMU iGEM team, DNAZone will distribute these kits to any classroom in Pittsburgh, PA that wishes to borrow them for educational purposes.

Among these cytokines, our team has performed ELISA to detect the concentration of IL-6 (Fig.1), cytokine secreted by microglia cells when the brain tissue is infected or damaged to stimulate downstream immune responses and promote inflammation(Fig.2), and to confirm that our construct and design does decrease immune responses in brain.

The complement system, another core component of the innate immune response, is consisted of small proteins found in blood. It has been confirmed that it can be activated and that it induces subsequence inflammation in the CNS. When being stimulated, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines, creating an amplifying cascade of further cleavages that result in the formation of membrane-attack-complex and ultimately pathogens elimination.(Fig.3)
Additionally, phagocytic cells including macrophages and neutrophils, can engulf and kill our bacteria.

Proposals on an""AMB-Itious"" Solution
Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 is an aquatic, motile, Gram-negative bacterium that usually resides in fresh water columns. It has no known pathogenic activity and is well regarded by many scientists for its safety. Still, we’d regarded that there are several core issues associated with what we have mentioned above.
To deal with problems, we have come up with several strategies to decrease and avoid immune responses.The ideas are (i) to express capsular polysaccharides of Klebsiella pneumonia and, (ii) being shielded in liposome.
(i) Klebsiella pneumonia is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and a common cause of nosocomial infections. It possesses a polysaccharide capsule that is considered to be a major pathogenicity factor and the main contributing factor to its evasion ability from macrophages. However, expressing the capsule of K. pneumonia is not something easy. There are 77 different capsular antigens on the capsule, and certain serotypes are associated with certain infection sites. This would be a relatively huge challenge for us.

Overview
Kompala et al model
Kompala et al simulations
Keasling et al model
Kremling
Model Rationale
Several models have focused on inducing the lac operon using IPTG[1 (ref fro protein prod)] but not many have focused on induction by lactose.
The Keasling model in the system describes diauxic growth under the presence of glucose and lactose, and includes the different stages of metabolism of both sources. Here are the main points to remember:
The lac operon is controlled by glucose at 2 levels: Inducer exclusion and catabolite repression.
Inducer exclusion: Relates to the constitutive expression of LacI repressor protein (see protein production pages for more on this), originally repressing the Lac operon.
Catabolite repression: Repression of cAMP by high levels of glucose present in the medium at the start of the culture, also preventing transcription of the lac operon.
When glucose runs out, the lac operon is induced.
When lactose is transported into the cell (by lac permease) and hydrolised into smaller chain length carbon sources by b-galactosidase.
Glucose-6-phosphate amounts control the rate of growth of the cell culture.
Figure 2 from Zhao Lu et al
Model Assumptions
All binding interactions (RNA polymerase-promoter, CRP-cAMP binding site, repressor-allolactose-operator) are 1:1
E.g. 1 molecule of cAMP binds to 1 CRP
The 3 binding interactions mentioned are the only factors contributing to transcription efficiency of the lac promoter, neglecting other possible entities.
Also, since b-galactosidase is a tetramer, the rate constant of b-galactosidase was assumed to be 1/2 the rate for synthesis of the permease to account for differences in productivity.
Degradation and dilution due to cell growth of LacZYA mRNA, b-galactosidase and permease were assumed to be first order.
Efficiency of translation was assumed to affect the mRNA degradation rate, effects which were not included in the model.
Model predictions
In this model two hypotheses for catabolite repression are tested:
Catabolite repression is dependent on extracellular glucose concentrations.

WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
The following teams have used some component of our phage system previously.  No other teams have used our method of polyphage with incorporated coiled coils for polymerization (nor is it present in the literature).
In 2006 the McGill team attempted to use leucine zippers fused to split YFP to display on cells and cause the cells to adhere via the split YFP.  See here .
The 2009 Freiburg Bioware team used Fos/Jun for a 'programmable enzyme' using Fok-fused Fos/Jun as factor in DNA cleavage.  See here .
Paris's team in 2009 attempted to use Jun/Fos as a snare; Jun on signal vesicle, Fos on membrane of receiving cell.  See here .
This year, Duke's team is using Jun- and Fos-based synthetic leucine zippers for genetic regulation.  See here .
CROSS-LINKING IN THE LITERATURE
Willis et al. (2008) used external cross-linking agents and phage display to create phage polymer bundles as well as a 1cm^3 cube of polymerized phage.
Sweeney et al. (2007) used leucine zippers (ACID/BASE and Jun/Fos) on p3 and p9 to create linear arrays of phage up to 30 in length.
The Belcher lab has also been involved in using M13 to create assemblies, such as nanowires and rings.  See Huang, et al. (2005) and Mao, et al. (2004).

Overall Project
Serious health problems arise throughout the world due to the common water contaminants, heavy metals. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ASTDR) released a Priority List of Hazardous Substances of which heavy metals accounted for almost half of the top 10 substances. These substances can ultimately cause cancer along with other symptoms in affected systems like the lungs, blood, digestive system, and nervous system. Therefore, our 2012 team constructed a set of sensors that detect heavy metal contaminants in water. Among our Arsenic, Lead and Cadmium Sensors, we decided to improve the sensitivity of the Cadmium Sensor to provide more accurate and medically relevant levels of detection. This sensor previously paired a promoter responsive to cadmium with GFP as a reporter. To improve this sensor, it was combined with an activator and a stronger promoter to amplify the signal as it reached the GFP reporter. Use of the detector could potentially save lives around the world through earlier detection of the contamination.
One could also create a kit that would include all necessary components for running tests and then decontaminating the resulting growth to prevent release of the engineered bacteria into the environment. It should also include a very simple mechanism for killing or denaturing the bacteria in the detector kit – bleach. Bleach is highly effective at killing bacteria and is readily available to the average person.
Project Details
We originally decided to approach the sensitivity problem two ways. First we used the 2011 UC Davis iGEM team's mutagenic PCR protocol to create mutations in the DNA of the entire Cadmium Sensor and just the cadmium promoter. After multiple runs, we hoped to find at least one colony that had increased sensitivity due to these mutations.
Second we utilized the 2007 Cambridge iGEM team's sensitivity tuners and began building the improved Cadmium Sensor using NEB's BioBrick Construction Kit and creating intermediate parts to form the final construct.
Step 1: We digested the promoter responsive to cadmium (BBa_K174015) with EcoRI and SpeI and digested an activator (either ogr activator, BBa_I746350, or the delta activator, BBa_I746352)"

DNA Digestion
Summary
DNA digestion, or DNA fragmentation, is a basic protocol in synthetic biology. This is typically performed prior to analysis of the DNA sequence, or in order to perform further protocols. Restriction enzymes are mixed and then incubated with DNA in a buffer solution. This yields DNA fragments cleaved at specific sites according to the enzymes used.
This microfluidic chip design performs DNA digestion. The desired DNA segment, restriction enzymes, water and buffer solution are inputted and mixed. The resulting solution is then sealed in an incubation chamber on top of which a heating element is placed. After the designated incubation time has passed, the liquid can then be transferred from the chip using a pipette.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

Another aspect of our policy and practice project entailed outreach within schools to educate the next generation of scientists about synthetic biology. As this is an emerging science, these are the individuals who will be pioneering the technology and so we believed they would be the perfect target audience for our session. We carried out the outreach sessions in Porto, Portugal and Manchester, England.

Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook#Cellulose degradation and related notes_-_-_TEXT.html,"tic bacteria, C. hutchinsonii either has novel cellobiohydrolases or has an unusual method of cellulose utilization."" - Link
C. hutchinsonii has binds to cellulolytic fibres and glides along them. It is hypothesised that it has to be attached to the medium to be able to utilise it. The enzymes involved in the cellulolysis are unknown though. There are candidate genes, but nothing concrete.
Based on this information, I think we should concentrate on trying to introduce Cellulomonas genes into E. coli. It might be worth us questioning Chris on his PhD students' progress with C. hutchinsonii. Cellulose degradation is the most ambitious part of our plan, and we should accept that we might have to give it up in practice and pursue an alternative mentioned below.

== 24 June 2008 == - Notes from meeting with Chris I spoke with Chris today about our plan, and this is the gist of what he had to say: We should hope to achieve in the lab 10% of what we design in theory.
Cellulose degradation:
Cellulose degradation is really complicated. There are various different mechanisms that various different organisms use. (What is traditionally known is derived from work done on Trichoderma reesei, a fungus which is easilly cultured, but there are many other mechanisms.) Over the past ~50 years attempts to introduce cellulases into E. coli have yielded poor results.  That isn't to say that we should give up on cellulose degredation.  Cytophaga hutchinsoniiis a cellulolytic bacterium whose genome has been sequenced. PhD students working under Chris French are investigating cellulases from this bacterium. We could use this (needs some research). A talk by the PhD students has been suggested, and would probably be useful for us even if we have already decided by then not to use C. hutchinsonii.  Chris isn't opposed to the idea of ordering a stock of Cellulomonas if we know the gene we need, and we can get the right strain. A strain would be best ordered from NCIMB in the UK, but there are other companies in Europe and America (from which the strain would take long to arrive and would probably be more expensive). Chris says he would be quite keen to have his PhD"

Before our marine Shewanella baltica TtrS/R ( BBa_K2507013 , BBa_K2507014 , BBa_K2507015 , BBa_K2507016 , BBa_K2507017 ) system, the only known genetically encoded tetrathionate sensor is the Salmonella typhimurium TtrSR two-component system (TCS) (Hensel et al, 1999; Price-Carter et al, 2001). However, they found S.typhimurium’s promoter PttrB is repressed by oxygen and nitrate via the global regulator Nitrate Reductase Regulator (FNR). While the oxygen levels in the intestinal are poorly understood by human beings Kristina et al think the oxygen level maybe relatively high near the epithelial mucosal boundary because of near to the blood. Meanwhile, nitrate levels in intestinal have been shown to be improved during inflammation (Winter et al, 2013). In iGEM 2012, Dundee used Salmonella TtrS/R system BBa_K895007 and the system works well.
The sensor we use S.baltica TtrS/R which is only weakly repressed by oxygen and not repressed by nitrate in E. coli. And our S.baltica TtrS/R system can work well using protoviolaceinic acid as the reporter BBa_K2507017 , which display dark-green color. And our system could also work poorly using sfGFP as the reporter.

Recognition of the modes of existence of technical objects should be the result of philosophical thought, which in this respect has to achieve what it analogous to the role it played in the abolition of slavery and in the affirmation of the value of the human person.”
Gilbert Simondon, On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects, unpublished in English. Translation by Mellamphy.
We have to understand him properly: Simondon does not say that slavery and the current state of the technical objects are equal. The slavery metaphor is only a way to explain that currently objects have no ontological value (it means that, as beings, they have no rights, no moral value, nothing but their materiality), and through an emancipation process they must gain a form of existential and ethical status. In that extent they are in the same situation that the slaves were; but this does not mean that they should be given a status equal to living beings. The technical culture only seeks to give a value to the part of humanity that technical objects bear due to their conception process and their use.
Team discussion
I don’t know which word we should use to speak about E.coli and other microorganisms. But for me, we should keep in mind that microorganisms can be very, very, very dangerous. It means that we must be really careful to modify them. So in a certain way, it’s a kind of respect (the small beast could eat the big one).
I don’t think we have to specially respect E.coli or even S.cerivisae or any other bacteria or yeast that are used in synthbio. If you think about yeast, they were use a long long time ago, for wine,beer and bread as “technical beings” (even if the processes were in fact unknown !) .Well, yes it’s good that yeasts exist for that but respect seem a bit “too far” for me. Is the important point the fact that we use yeast or bacteria or the fact that we modified them ?
I think this is a point where we won’t find any “perfect” answer. In my personal opinion, bacteria are living organisms and as such we should respect them. By respect them I mean that we can’t play with modifying bacteria. They are necessary for us, so it would be silly not to use them. But we have to keep in mind that they are living things, we can’t modify and kill bacteria just to play, just to test things if they are not necessary. Again, the means, the tools, do not justify the end. Even though I truly believe in that, we also"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

To produce a reporter system, we needed to identify promoters from genes that are induced upon glyphosate treatment. Our hypothesis is that the promoter of trpE and trpP are induced by glyphosate, as described in the design section (TO DO, link hier einfügen!!!). Therefore, PtrpE as well as two variants of the EPSP-synthase (encoded by aroE were amplified by PCR using primers iGEM2018_25/26 and iGEM2018_27/28, respectively.

Other genera, including some E. coli strains, secrete cellulose as a component of their biofilm. Even though cellulose biosynthesis is intrinsic to E. coli, the quantity of the production is incomparable to cellulose biosynthesis in G. xylinus.

Approach
To link the two bacterial compartments of the PowerLeaf, an efficient way to store the harvested energy was required.

How it Works:
To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.   We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day. By combining this information we were able to calculate the users’ “antimicrobial footprint,” in grams triclosan/day. The app will also give you this metric in grams triclosan/year.

We know deeply that our experiment and design is interrelated to the community. In fact, our purpose of this project is to provide a cheaper, faster yet a more specific and precise method for diagnosis of H3N2 virus. Therefore, apart from the experimental and designing work, we put much effort on human practices as well. These human practices categorized as local competition, workshops, idea exchange and public engagement. Details are shown in below and Local competition and workshops page.

FUTURE AND APPLICATION
Aiming at controlling and eliminating pests, TERMITE TERMINATOR uses modified bacterium to produce insecticide. In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents. This novel way of insecticide delivery create an eco-friendly model to eliminate pests and can be directly applied to other pest control projects. As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people' houses, we can bring the result of the project into production. The business outlook is considerably broad because our project is environmentally friendly and closely associated with people's daily life. Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.
We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs. We offer not only a whole system for killing pests, but also a referable model that uses nano size chemicals to pack bacteria for biomedicine, food manufacturing and cosmetic industry.

Therefore, to eliminate these the influence of these two intrinsic genes on experiments, we need to knock out sdiA and lacI in MG1655, which is used to do test in experiments. However, we do not know how to knock them out. Therefore, we turned to Team NPU-China for help and they succeed to knock them out. MG1655 they provide performed very well during our experiments.

    Back in Tsinghua, we formed a tight relationship with our brother team, Team Tsinghua, based on members’ friendship and productive team-team interaction, which results in the two teams’ frequently doing things together.
    First, we think together. At the brainstorming stage, we shared our inspiration and sparks and mutually received thought-provoking advice from the other. We discussed a wide range of problems including the project’s applicability, molecular tools in gene editing, plans of human practice and so on.
    Second, we act together. Several teams outside Tsinghua (BNU-China, SZU-China, XMU-China) have expressed their willingness to pay a visit to our university and teams. We thus held several seminars together with Team Tsinghua under the efficient coordination of Han Jianing from Tsinghua and Wang Chenghao from Tsinghua-A. During the open talk other teams’ creative thought struck us from time to time. Some of them even kindly pointed out our team’s flaw which we later payed heavy attention to (the problem of applicability and its limit in human practice). Here we want to deliver our sincere appreciation to Team Tsinghua and all those team involved. It is your wisdom, openness and passion that makes the seminar successfully achieved what was far beyond our expectation.
    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire"

We propose 3 tests to check if the restriction digest (esp. between EcoRI and XbaI, because they lie very close together) works properly:
Test 1: Cut every plasmid (sam8, sam5, ech, Fcs) separately with EcoRI, XbaI and -only sam8 and fcs- with SpeI.
Test 2: Cut subsequently with EcoRI and XbaI, leaving an incubation period of 1h between two digests. Total volume: 30µl, to dilute glycerol (which inhibits restriction)
Test 3: Use pUC18 vector

Protocol
Protocol for chemical inducible expression of GFP Materials:     1、4 groups of induce solution with a concentration gradient of 10^-7, 10^-5, 10^-3, 10^-2;     2、 Overnight bacterial culture or bacterial colonies;     3、Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS). Procedure:     1. Add 20 μ l of the overnight bacterial culture or pick a colony to 5 ml of LB antibiotic medium, Incubate at 37 degree in a shaker till the OD600 value reaches 0.4-0.6.     2. Add 0.5 mL of the fresh bacterial culture and appropriate volume of inducer solution to prepare induction system with the concentration gradient of 10^-9, 10^-8, 10^-7, 10^-6, 10^-5,10^-4, 10^-3, 10^-2.     3. Place the induction system at 37 degree for 2 hours.     4. Pellet bacterial cells by 4 min centrifugation at 4000 rpm, discard the supernatant.     5. Resuspend the pelleted cells in 500 μ l of PBS.     6. Transfer 100 uL of bacterial resuspention into each well of 96-well plate to test the expression of GFP by flow cytometry or Microplate Reader.     1. Late in the day, start a 37 °C, shaking overnight culture from a −80 °C stock in a tube containing 3 mL LB medium and the appropriate antibiotics (50 µg/mL kanamycin, 100 µg/mL spectinomycin and 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol for the CcaS-CcaR system, and the same antibiotics for the Cph8-OmpR system).     2. After the overnight culture has grown for 10–12 h, prepare 200 mL LB medium. Add appropriate antibiotics to medium. Shake/stir the container to ensure the antibiotics are mixed well in the medium.     3. Measure the OD 600 of the overnight culture.     4. Dilute the overnight culture into the LB + antibiotics, bringing the OD 600 to 0.0001. Shake/stir the container to ensure the cells are"

For each group of E.coli, a fraction of the population will go through the process of plasmid replication and dividend at each time step, through which the fraction is determined by the level of E.coli’s growth rate $\mu(i,S)$, who is closely related to the E.coli’s type and culture concentration.
After each time step $dt$, the population change of the $i^{th}$ group $\frac{dN}{dt}$ is constituted with two parts: E.coli with $i$ plasmids produced by parent cell in other groups, and the E.coli with $j(\neq i)$ plasmids produced by parent cell in the $i^{th}$ group.
Given a random distribution mechanism of plasmids into son cells, the distribution rate $\delta_{i,j}$, which stands for the probability of parent E.coli in $i^{th}$ group producing son E.coli in $j^{th}$ group. We then multiply this probability to the fraction of population who replicates, to get the change in population respectively as $$\frac{dN(i)}{dt} = \sum_{j \neq i}^{N_{p,max}}\delta_{i,j} \mu(j,S) N(j) - (1-2(\frac{1}{2})^i) \mu(i,S) N(i)$$
Meanwhile, the consumed substrate can also be describe in an ODE as $$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{1}{Ys} \sum_{i=0}^{N_{p,max}} \frac{dN(i)}{dt}$$
Programs simulating this process is done at each time step, and each group’s population is well-known. We selected ten representative groups (E.coli with 1,20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160,180,200 plasmids) and have their population drawn in the curves below.
Probability of distribution
The loss of plasmids during reproduction, is mainly due to the uneven distribution of plasmids into two son E.coli after plasmid replication. Therefore, it is important to give the probability of each possible situation. To be more specified, the probability of a i-plasmid parent producing a j-plasmid son has to be calculated.
Plasmids’ self-replication has to take place ahead, for a empirical formula of replication number is given $$CopyNum(i) = \frac{V_m ("

We integrated its advantages and improved its shortcomings. Actually, the output components                         helped us save a lot of money rather than buying DCFH-DA probe.
Cell-Based Method (MTT) (2008)
Cell-based method MTT appeared in the same period as CAA. Their ideas and strategy are similar                         and don't need not be detailed here. MTT improved the disadvantage that CAA can only throw a                         single species of radical into cells. And the detection process is simpler. However, it was                         criticized because the text conditions is too extreme for living cells, which may not be                         representative of physiological settings.
This critical voice also reminds us that modest cell survival is necessary"

*Next Generation Sequencing
Strengths
4.1 Versatility
In gene doping detection it is important to be able to detect many genetic differences in a plethora of performance enhancing genes. Proteins such as Zinc fingers and TALEN’s require extensive amino acid sequence design and optimalisation for each genetic difference in gene doping and thus are no feasible method for the detection of gene doping. Therefore, we decided to use a dxCas9 with flexible guide RNA libraries to find the gene doping sites effectively. In this way we do not only guarantee versatility within gene doping detection, but might also soon improve viral detection, fetal DNA screening and food safety maintenance. These are only a few examples of areas where we have identified interested parties as can be read more about on the Entrepreneurship page .
4.2 Efficient, High throughput, Limiting costs
As became apparent from a visit to the doping authority, initial development costs are not the big problem. It is the costs that are inherent to the up-scaling that matter to them. Therefore, we made sure our method is efficient, low cost, and high throughput. Professor Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, cofounder of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pointed us at the value of barcoding and subsequent multiplexing to enhance the sequencing efficiency. Also, we decided to add our gold nanoparticle prescreen based on the visit to the Dutch Doping Authority. In this way we reduce the amount of samples that will need sequencing, reducing the costs. Lastly, our fusion protein makes targeted sequencing possible that not only significantly speeds up the analysis, but also greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored.
4.3 Accuracy and Reliability
Limiting the risk for false positives has been one of our most prominent focuses, because false accusations can ruin athlete’s lives. Therefore, we adhere much value to the build-in double verification.  After a prescreen, we use sequence verification to provide athletes with more direct proof. As the Oxford Nanopore MinION device that we use has a misread percentage, we simulated actual read-outs and made sure the separation between gene doping and misread normal DNA is clearly present. In this way we have an accurate and reliable gene doping detection method.
4.4 Privacy in Genomic Data Analysis
From our surveys it appeared that people generally do not care about genomic privacy. Only 22.6% of the general Dutch population thinks we should be utterly careful about the genomic privacy of athletes based on 181 respondents. We however do believe"
