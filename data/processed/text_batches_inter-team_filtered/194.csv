In Fig. 2, the target proteins are marked with arrows, and the figure shows that synthases are expressed in the cell successfully.
GC-MS analysis of l-/d- limonene
Comparing the differences of TIC between standard samples and test samples, we confirm that standard limonene samples' peak appears at 4.934 minute. And in the figure of our d-limonene sample (n-hexane aq) extracted by E.coli BL21, there is a peak at 4.934 minute, which means that our test samples may contain limonene. Then we analyzed the test samples at this time point by mass spectrometric detection. The MS was operated in SIM mode using ions of 136, 68, and 93 m/z. Compared with Fig.3, there are similar peaks at 136, 68, and 93 m/z in Fig.4. The result shows that the E. coli we designed express d-limonene successfully.

Verification of Attraction of Limonene Towards C. elegans
In order to figure out whether limonene attracts C. elegans, filter paper is dropped of 5μL 5% limonene (DMSO aq) and put on one side. The contrasted paper is put on the other side with only 5μL DMSO as the control group. To eliminate the effect of DMSO, two other control groups are set.

These comprise the aspartic acid dioxygenase (encoded by the gene DelD), the N5-hydroxyornithine formyltransferase (DelP) and finally the lysine/ornithine N-monooxygenase (DelL). The stoichiometry of this lumped reaction is the following:
1 ala-L[c] + 2 ser-L[c] + 1 asp-L[c] + 2 thr-L[c] + 1 gly[c] + 2 orn[c] + 1 arg-L[c] + 10 atp[c] + 1 akg[c] + 2 o2[c] + 1 10fthf[c] + 1 nadph[c] + 1 h[c] + 1 mmcoa-S[c] -> 10 amp[c] + 20 pi[c] + 1 co2[c] + 1 succ[c] + 1 thf[c] + 1 nadp[c] + 1 h2o[c] + 1 coa[c] + 1 co2[c] + 1 delftibactin
Considering constraints of the metabolic model, it was assumed that E.coli grows on minimal glucose medium under aerobic conditions. The maximal glucose uptake rate was set to 10.5 $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $ and the oxygen uptake rate to 15 $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $ and the ATP maintenance flux (which represents the non-growth associated energy required for maintaining the biological processes of the cells) was set to 7.6 $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $. Those fluxes have been previously measured for aerobically growing E.coli [10].
As we were interested in the optimal case, that is the maximal possible delftibactin production based on the stoichiometrically imposed constraints, we initially used FBA with delftibactin production as the objective function. The resulting flux was 1.2105 $ \frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h} $. However, the corresponding specific growth rate was 0. Thus, the maximally possible specific growth rate in dependence of the delftibactin synthesis rate was determined. The polytope was split into 150 intervals. For each of these intervals, the growth rate was fixed and FBA was simulated again. Fig. 4 shows the resulting production envelope, which in turn shows the optimal"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-2_-_-_TEXT.html," we learned about the IRB at UCSC and how we needed to get our questionnaires approved, since we were technically working with “human subjects” if we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about our three parallel experiments, our research, and our outreach. Three team members presented the information to interested audiences at the Symposium.
After successfully linearizing pUC19 and pXRL2, we repeated the same experiment with larger volumes to get more product for future use. Using this product, we performed several DPN1s and clean and concentrate experiments. The first four tests were failures. We used both our advisor’s reagents and Zymo’s reagents. Our solution that eventually worked was to prewarm the 30 uL water we were using as the elution buffer and let it sit for several minutes, in the final step. On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not very well. We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.
We tried many PCR reactions with the new templates but still saw multiple bands for each gene, so we decided to extract the correct bands from the gels and use those as our templates. We tried using larger reaction volumes in the gels to get more DNA from the gel extraction, but we didn’t get clear enough bands to properly extract the correct sized genes. We also tried amplifying the loxP-URA3-lox71 gene cassette with our existing primers, but the reaction didn’t work due to the difference in annealing temperatures between the forward and the reverse primer.
This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them. Upon redoing our PCR experiment with the corrected protocol in a 10uL reaction, our gel showed bands indicating a successful linearization. We also went through the protocol for the creation of chemicompetent yeast cells in anticipation for our transformation into Y. lipolytica. Protocol was successful and yielded 2.5 mL of glycerol stock of our chemicompetent Y. lipolytica.
The glycerol stocks of E. coli were successfully streaked to verify viability. Contacted lab support for pH meter electrode issues.

Human Practice Overview
In order to promote the awareness and education of synthetic biology in China, this summer, SUSTC IGEM team has done a remarkable job in motivating all kinds of people to study synthetic biology.
1.Open Classes.
We have record 5 open classes and uploaded to the web aiming at giving people a whole picture of synthetic biology. These 5 classes cover many fields.
      a.  Introduction to synthetic biology. It focuses on the history and applications of this searching area.
      b.  Interesting stories about synthetic biology. We want to let more people have an interest in scientific research.
      c.  The third part is about central dogma. This is the most important and most beautiful theory in synthetic biology. We hope more people can know it.
      d.  BioBrick is the essence idea of synthetic biology.
      e.  The last part involves the lab work. Because biology is a kind of science that based on experiment. It will also be much fun for people who don’t have a chance to visit laboratory.
2.Article
2. Our team has written an article to help people distinguish synthetic biology from genetic engineering.
3.  Speeches in high schools.
We have hold 3 speeches in high schools to motivate high school students to study synthetic biology and guide them to participate in IGEM High School Division. We think that the development of a new subject really needs creative teenagers and future scientists to push forward.
4.  Posters.
Besides, we have made 8 posters to let people who attend our lectures have a further understanding of our project and synthetic biology.

The purposes of building IoT is simple - we can reduce the risk of mistake or omission. Also, we want to unify every controller, monitors, meter and everything that is involved all together so that it would be easier to manage and has a larger space to expand other functions; for example, adding varies sensors for different chemicals or even microbes.

Field investigation
(1) Visit organic farmers
We had two interviews with organic farmers. The first interviewees were the owner of three organic farms, and the crops include gourds, fruits, mushroom, cereal grain, and vegetables. We investigate the source of water and the used degree of fertilizer of their farms. The result shows that the farms locate on high terrain or higher altitude than the factories. Plus, the irrigating water won’t flow out to another area, and the fertilizer they use is farming residue. As a result, there is no doubt of pollution.
After changing the direction of our project, we had another interview which focuses on the management of organic agriculture. We tried to figure out what predicament the farmers face and whether the statistics reflect the fact or not. And the result seems favorable to our project for the reason that the certification of organic agriculture needs at least three years and cost ＄5000 per year. Such threshold is unfriendly to normal farmers and inefficient. Since there are many bottlenecks in the process of organic agriculture, nearly no profit can be earned from it. First of all, there are many uncontrolled plant diseases and insect pests and natural disasters. Moreover, these agricultural products are not improved Breeds. They not only have low yield but also have bad appearances. Furthermore, labor costs are really high, so they are much more expensive than normal agricultural products. There are too many drawbacks that violate the principle of market competition, and it’s difficult to apply. In consequence, it’s tough to attract farmers to join the ranks of organic agriculture."

We used a classic record player in parallel with our hacked Biota Beats microbiome record player to show how we would play our own microbiome records.
The youth were shown how microbiomes cultured on an agar plate resembled classic vinyl records and                     were given a demonstration as to how a new type of record player could play music from our cultured                     microbiota. Soon after the demonstration, we instructed each participant to swab different parts of                     their body and inoculate their personal agar plate-records with their microbiota. They quickly and                     excitedly began swabbing, inoculating, and essentially composing their own microbiome records.
David Kong explains how Biota Beats works to YSI cohort
YSI participant inoculates her microbiome record.
Upon completely inoculating their personalized microbiome records, the YSI participants were asked to                     take their records home. They were given specific instructions to take pictures of their records as                     the microbiota grew each day. As they continue to share their images with our Street Bio team, we                     are sonifying their records, giving our youth participants the opportunity to produce their own                     electronic music using their individual microbiome records.
Biota Beats and Beyond
By bringing Biota Beats to our community through the Youth Science Initiative, we are providing local                     youth with the unique opportunity to participate in a novel STEAM education program. Our initial YSI                     cohort demonstrated strong enthusiasm in Biota Beats because of how the project brought together                     music, microbiology, and biotechnology. The youth were able to be creative and innovate while                     excitedly engaging with their passions for science. As Street Bio continues to make a strong                     commitment to community youth engagement we hope to use continue using Biota Beats as an exemplary                     model for STEAM education.

TU_Darmstadt,2018,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Upscaling_-_-_TEXT.html,"erevisiae [4] . To adapt this approach, we aimed on overproducing the natively encoded glyoxylate reductase (HprA) and the previously used enzyme homologue from Arabidopsis thaliana (GLYR1) in P. putida.
We started testing if P. putida was an even better production host for glycolic acid. Due to limitation of time, we were only able to validate P. putida KT2440 as a glycolic acid production host. We found the strain can neither utilize glycolic acid nor glyoxylate as carbon source and is therefore, suitable for production of our monomer glycolic acid. As experts, such as DI Dr. Hans Marx from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, experienced with P. putida also recommended us to work with this organism, we see further potential for P. putida as a high yield production host for glycolic acid in the future.
Genetic and Metabolic Engineering
Targeted gene deletions and overexpression of heterologous genes such as AtGLYR1 from A. thaliana were an integral part of our project. For the production of organic acids, the use of acid-tolerant microorganisms, especially fungal species like yeasts, has proven to be beneficial as the pH can decrease significantly during fermentation [5] . For this reason, an alternative for more efficient production of glycolic acid appears to be Kluyveromyces lactis, which achieves a titer of up to 15 g/L when grown on D-xylose and ethanol [4] . Similar considerations regarding the adaption to high concentrations of organic solvents can be applied to ε-caprolactone production.
Fermentation Process and Extraction
Another important step for optimization of the monomer production, especially when using bacteria in fermentation processes, is the precise definition of the pH value, which has a great influence on cell viability. Carboxylic acids are often excreted by the cell and accumulate up to a critical concentration, inhibiting growth and inducing self-destruction [6] . It is for this reason that the type of fermentation process can impact the titer in industrial applications. Since it is known that, for instance, caprolactone production underlies product inhibition  [7] , continuous fermentation possesses an advantage over batch and fed-batch cultures.

Therefore, we also communicated with many other iGEM teams, including BNU-China, FAFU, TJU and BIT. Besides, we took an active part in two iGEMers Meetups held by NCTU and Peking University respectively. Our project becomes more complete during these activities. We made constant improvement day by day and solved many knotty problems with the help of other iGEMers. The united survey offered significant messages concerning other respected application fields more than industrial fermentation of pH Controller. We realized that our system has the potential to solve problems like the soil acidification which is one of the main issues the public concerns. Above all, through the communication with other teams, the companies and the public, we had a better understanding of the potential application of our project in the theoretical context, the business context and the social context. The relatively complete research in Human Practice improved our project a lot. Besides, the united questionnaire spreads the concept of synthetic biology throughout the world and provides a new idea about how we can do such a valid research in China particularly. We are really grateful for all people involved in our Human Practice who have offered us so much useful information. There is no doubt that the united form of Human Practice will benefit us more for next year’s plan."

18th - 20th of August 2018 - Spanish Meet up IGEM in Barcelona
Navarra_BG went to Barcelona Biomedical Research Parc in August in order to participate in the Spanish Meet up IGEM event organized by UPF-CRG Barcelona team. In the first day of the meeting we did a workshop to share different team´s experiences during the previous preparation of the iGEM Proyects until this day. Then, all the participants presented our work in a “elevator pitch” format.
The second day, on Sunday, we presented Biogalaxy Proyect in a extended format and we attended the presentations of the rest of teams: UPF-CRG Barcelona, bioIGEM-IQS Barcelona, iGEM-Grenoble and Madrid-OLM. We helped each other sharing new ideas to improve the works in the next weeks. During this day our team received congratulations of the other participants: we were the only group formed by students of High School and university students were happy when  they saw that young people achieved knowledges that usually are studied in university degrees like Biology, Biotechnology or Biomedic Engineering working for iGEM.
The last day, 20th of August, we did a skype-meeting with Thea Chyrsostomou, iGEM Coordinator in Europe. We attended too interesting conferences of  Marc Güell, Jordi García Ojalvo, Nuria Conde and  David Comas. They presented some innovations ideas related wih synthetic biology and the gave different ideas about possible future challenges to do in iGEM.
We returned to Navarra full of energy and ilusionated to continue working in Biogalaxy Proyect until October.
14th of September - Entrepreneurship and Synthetic Biology Event
Navarra_BG organized an Entrepreneurship and Synthetic Biology Event in the Planetarium of Pamplona in the middle of September. We share our Biogalaxy Proyect with more than 200 High School students that came to conference room of the planetarium.
The event began with María Sanz de Galdeano, Coordinator of CEIN Navarra. She encourage students to have ideas and to create their own enterprise and to chase their dreams. After her, María Sola, Project Manager of Cinfa Biotech presented her enterprise´work and she gave some keys to bring closer the students to the Synthetic Biology.

1.1 Transcriptional modularity
1.2 Genomic integration
1.3 Eukaryotic expression
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Yeast is a well-characterized and relatively simple eukaryotic model organism, and it provides a number of advantages as a chassis for synthetic biology and our project in particular.
Transcriptional modularity
Many transcriptional regulation pathways have been characterized in yeast, and some have been shown to work in a modular fashion.  The Sin3 repression domain and VP64 activation domain used in our transcription factors, for instance, have been shown to function when recombined with a variety of DNA-binding domains.  Thus, we can utilize a library of recombinant factors that each utilize the same control mechanism while binding specifically to different operator sites.  In this way, each element of our system can operate in a similar fashion while having a distinct role
Genomic integration
In yeast, it is a straightforward procedure to integrate assembled constructs directly into the genome via homologous recombination.  In contrast to transformation with plasmid DNA, this approach affords precise control over the copy number of introduced fragments.  Exactly one copy of an integrated construct recombines into a specific locus in the genome.  In this way, we have exact control over the relative presence of different elements of our introduced network, giving its operation greater predictability and reliability.  Additionally, genomic integration is more stable than plasmid transformation.
Eukaryotic expression
Due to the extensive compartmentalization seen in eukaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur within different locations of the cell.  Transcription of precursor mRNA molecules takes places inside the nucleus.  Additional modifications are made to the precursor mRNA before it leaves the nucleus, one of the most noteworthy being the splicing of introns or non-coding regions from the mRNA.  It is the absence of a comparable system of modifications in prokaryotes that provides the first barrier to cloning many mammalian proteins in E. coli.

1.) Labwork:
Protein purification of CTHE has been successful. Other constructs are not working. Not sure whether due to pBAD vector, therefore sequences need to be     checked.
Aachen Enzymes have arrived and the first BioBricks made (still need to be sequenced). BioBricks with colours amilCP, cjBlue and efforRed are being used as     backup.
Purification: Could the enzymes be deactivated by the purification?
Can we check scaffoldin interactions, even though enzymes may not function? So far it hasnt been possible to purify any of the enzymes or RFP and not to     show a 100% positive activity test.
- Restart expression tests
- start cellulase induction
- check RFP again with a control
- could it be possible to use the scaffoldin to purify the enzyme-dockerins?
- check for pBAD promoter error and ask Robert for other expression vectors.
- try and get some sort of interaction even if it is crude
- is there a BioBrick expression vector?
2.) Presentation:

The Hydrogels
Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks made out of synthetic or natural polymers containing large quantities of water, therefore they receive an increasing attention in various fields. We were focused on not using any expensive or toxic linker in combination with chitosan to manufacture a hydrogel, which could be formed in any shape with a perfect alignment to the surrounding tissue.  The aim was to produce such a hydrogel with basic laboratory equipment and modify it to detect pathogenic bacteria visually in wounds. To evaluate an ideal hydrogel various gelation substrates were tested. During this work various promising hydrogels were produced.
Introduction
Patients with burn wounds or other poorly healing wounds, like diabetes wounds, often suffer from various complications such as infections. Until now the common medical bandages have to be removed to monitor the wound healing progress. To examine if there is an infection, which implies the presence of pathogenic bacteria, samples of the wound have to be taken and studied in a specialized laboratory. This is a time-consuming and expensive process and we want to simplify and accelerate this procedure.
The solution for this problem is a hydrogel, with the advantages of the special characteristics of hydrogels such as biocompatibility, elasticity, and modifiable chemical properties. Most hydrogels can swell in aqueous solutions; for our purpose, as a wound bandage, it can be used to absorb some of the wound fluid [3] [4] . Furthermore it can be attached hermetically and the moisture provided by the hydrogel therefore leads to ideal wound healing conditions [5]
An optimal polymer for such a hydrogel is the unique aminopolysaccharide chitosan. Beside beneficial properties like its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and film forming ability, chitosan has reactive amine side groups. This offers possibilities for modifications, like the linkage of a fluorophore to detect pathogenic bacteria (See Chemistry ) [2] .
The hemostatic chitosan is reported to have intrinsic antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties [6] . Furthermore, it promotes scar free wound healing, has healing effects and acts antiallergic [7] . It is an ideal scaffold material to manufacture different types of hydrogels as sal"

Performing Measurements: Nitrate solution Measuring range of the kit:  1-25 mg/L NO3-N
Pipette 4.0 ml of reagent 1 (NO3-1) into a test tube.
Add 0.50 mL of sample when it is among the range of measuring kit (otherwise make proper dilution) Do not mix.
Add 0.50 mL of reagent 2 (NO3-2).
Mix.
Reaction time: 10 mins.
Pour sample into cuvette.
Select method in the spectrometer by entering the AutoSelector (little black tube).
Note result.
If the read is above the linear range then put the sample back to the tube test, dilute it if needed and try again.
If the nitrate test is not in the range make sure that nitrite is not above 5 mg/L and dissolve the sample with amidosulfuric acid. Adjust the pH between 1-3.

Compare Tinker Cell results against MatLab simulations (Amplficiation model).
Compare SimBiology package (in Matlab) results against equations we have derived. (amplification model).
See how we could explore the problem of false negatives in Protein Display model.
Discuss the protein display false positive.
Prepare presentation for the meeting.
Compare the catechol colour response (cells alive vs. immediate cell death).
Discuss with Matthieu on the issue of negative concentrations, volume approximations made in protein display model and the idea of modelling the false positive case.
Update Modelling section of the Wiki.
Update list of experiments (especially for Protein Display Model) and discuss with Chris and Wolf.
Keep modifying wiki.
Keep writing little bits that were left out previously.
Completion
Tinkercell is not very good at dealing with very high or low values.
SimBiology package generates same graphs as our manual simulations. The interface is quite easy to use.
Decreasing absolute and relative tolerances is becoming accpeted as a solution to a negative concentrration problem.
Modelling of false positive in display protein is postponed as more research need to be done on the affinities etc.
Presentation was given - feedback is to be implemented.
It was deduced that we should model the cells as alife, because of the slow cell death induced by addition of catechol.
Matthieu was consulted and the feedback is posted here.
Restructuring modelling wiki is now on!
Experiments discussed with Wolf and all should be doable.
Wiki updating will continue next week.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"actoside transacetylase (LacA) is unknown, but it may act as an detoxifying enzyme. Transcription of the lactose Operon is regulated by both the repressor and the cAMP-CAP complex. The lac operon is negatively regulated by a repressor and positively by an activator. In addition, the activity of the lac permease is controlled by the inducer exclusion mechanism.      The lactose operon works the following way. When lactose is present in the surrounding medium and there is no energy source more favorable for the cell like glucose for cellular metabolism, the three genes of the lactose operon are expressed. In the following lactose is transported through the permease into the cell and there is decomposed by the enzyme ß-galactosidase into glucose, galactose and allolactose. The allolactose performs a backbond to bind to the lactose repressor and allows the transcription to proceed. Negative and positive regulation controls the degradation of the most efficient source of energy (Figure 3).
Figure 4:Functionality of the blue-white screening. 1) If the gene is not inserted into the plasmid, the β-galactokinase can be assembled. She can then split X-Gal and the colonies turn blue. 2) The multiple cloning site of the used plasmid is integrated into the lacZ-alpha part. If the gene is inserted into the the plasmid, the β-galactokinase can´t be assembled. Because of this the colonies stay white.
If a strain has integrated the lactose operon, it is possible to perform a blue-white selection (Figure 4). The basic idea of the genetic engineering principle is to check whether the genetic modification was carried out correctly. The ß-galactosidase, the gene product of the LacZ genes, consists of two components: LacZ-alpha and LacZ-omega only if both components are functionally present, galactosidase can exert its catalytic effect (Langleyet al., 1975) . In the DH5𝛼 strain of E. coli the 𝛼 subunit is deleted. Now, a plasmid containing the alpha subunit is used. (Zamenhofet al., 1972) . By a successful transformation of the plasmid into the mutated strain, a funcional ß-galactosidase can be expressed. If an insertion into this vector occurs, the complementation can not work. After transformation, the cells are plated"

Setting up a humongous library, containing all different kinds of variants, seemed tempting at first, but having a more defined and optimized library was the more rational choice. For doing so we involved only specific amino acids in the randomized regions of our binding proteins, to optimize binding of targets ( Fellouse et al., 2004 ; Koide, 2009 ). Hence, we kept the theoretical variability to a maximum of about one billion (1,073,741, 824), just including estimatingly promising initial binders. See our Design and Construction for further insight.

In order to further validate the safety and clinical recognition of our program, we conducted a thorough interview                 with several physicians and discussed the reliability and effectiveness of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy                 with dialectical thinking.
In June 2017, we interviewed Ai Zhang, a senior physician who specialized in rheumatoid arthritis at the                 department of rheumatology at the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou university, who was currently studying                 at Gulou Hospital in Nanjing (Figure 15). She was well aware of CAR-T and made a lot of suggestions to us.She                 pointed out the problems in actual operation which we needed to pay attention to and all of these are very                 instructive, such as Treg in the separation of the choice of flow sorting or magnetic bead sorting problems,                 Treg training problems, etc. We also had to further develop analysis and optimization of specific experimental                 programs. Plus, she suggested that we would focus on foreign pharmaceutical giants in CAR-T and Treg and                 other clinical trials of clinical therapy, and learned from some of the lessons learned.
Figure 15. We were interviewing Ai Zhang
Fortunately, we also interviewed Minning Shen, who is the associate chief physician of Nanjing first hospital                 in , Department of Rheumatology (Video 2). She was very concerned about this area and she gave a systematic                 evaluation within her point of view of the existing treatment and Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. Her views                 were consistent with the conclusions we had made in the survey, and again verified the security and reliability                 of our program from an authority expert. She also made a general prediction of the clinical application of                 Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. From the pre-basic research to the real application, Novartis's CAR-T pathways                 were significant for our application. Optimistically, Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy in the treatment of                 rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases will have a good effect.
Through the interview with two physicians, we received a lot of suggestions and opinions, and more of which                 was the recognition of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. And they were also considered Syn"

To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one"

ZJU-China,2011,Team:ZJU-China#Brainstorm.html_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental pollution. So we tried to solve this problem in a synthetic biology approach.
We checked the components of the E waste: plastic and metal. We continued to read related papers about bacteria degrading plastic, mobilizing metal elements, or absorbing metal elements. Unfortunately, the plastic substances in the E-waste like epoxy resins, and PCBs, PVC are very hard for bacteria to degrade. Secondly, though there's some paper indicating the power of some bacteria of recycling the metal, the detailed mechanism is still a mystery. In order to first mobilize the metal elements from the solid E-waste, we had proposed some ideas like producing acid such as acetic acid, citric acid even cyanic acid, thus the bacteria we used must be tolerant to the high pH environment. Here the dilemma is: on one hand, if we use some special bacteria, it is difficult to engineer it; on the other hand, if we use E.coli, it is difficult for us to engineer it to adapt to the acid environments. Due to these problems, we stopped further discussion on this topic.4
Signal Modular by Protein Scaffold
This idea comes from the paper by Keasling in which he used protein scaffold to boost the metabolic flow in biosynthesis. We think we can adopt similar methosd in signal transduction. At first, we were all excited about the idea. However, the tragedy is that we found out UCSF had done a similar project in 2007 iGEM. : (
Change the color by shaking
 This is just an interesting idea that there's no specific practical application. The key of this idea is to discover a sensing system based on the physical attachment between cells. So we looked up some paper, and found one paper's novel discovery of sensing the touching. But the fatal drawback is that it lacks detailed mechanism that we can harness.
Streptococcus pneumonia
Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. It has been noted that Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) plays an important role of being sickness. PAIs are a distinct class of genomic islands and are incorporated in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms but are usually absent from those non-pathogenic organisms of the same or closely related species. We would like to concentrate on the special properties of PAIs with measures of synthetic biology. PAIs have correlation of other diseases and may become a fundamental therapy.

Asthma锛?a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs, has been increasingly observed in developed countries. Its remarkable increase attributes to changes in the environment due"
BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," (TEAC) [12] , total oxyradical scavenge capacity (TOSC) [13] , the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC) [14] , the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay (FRAP) [15] , and the DPPH free radical method [16] . Although these chemistry methods are currently widely-use, their main measurement principle                         is to characterize the reducibility of antioxidants by virous artificially synthesized                         exogenous free radical occurring redox reactions with the antioxidants. As a result, chemistry                         methods have the shortcoming of low biological relevance, their detecting conditions are almost                         different from the physiological environment of cell living in, and these assays can’t evaluate                         the effects of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. That means, chemical methods                         are unable tot evaluate indirect antioxidants properly. [17][18] Therefore, the authenticity of the experimental results of chemistry methods is questioned. [19] For example, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for Selected                         Foods from the NDL website in 2012, because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                         chemistry methods. [20]
Cell-based assays
Compared to human studies and animal models, our program has shorter cycles, lower costs and                         lower detection difficulty. Compared to chemistry methods, our project is compatible with                         complex metabolic processes in cells, and biological relevance and data reliability have been                         greatly improved. In addition, our project can also detect the indirect antioxidants that can’t                         be evaluate by chemistry methods, such as antioxidants that functions by stimulating the                         endogenous antioxidant system in cells, which have not antioxidant capacity without cells.
Cell-based methods for evaluating antioxidants are a novel field. Cell-based antioxidants                         detection methods that people have developed can be roughly divided into three types. The first                         type is the CAA assay and MTT assay developed from the traditional chemistry methods. The                         second type is the cell-based electrochemical method evolved from the traditional                         electrochemical methods. The third type is the engineered cells that we use to synthesize                         biology. The third one utilize the engineering cells transformed by synthetic biological                         methods, which can detect and evaluate the antioxidants.

CAA assay [21] is cell-based assay, but it still doesn’t break through the limitations of traditional                         chemistry methods. Firstly, it still produces free radicals using artificial synthetic                         materials used in traditional chemistry methods, such as ABAP (Azo compound) which are                         criticized for cells.

Professor Miha Mraz's visit in Peking
Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical Biology, He gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz’s visit has surely promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University team.
A Online Video talk with Dr. Hu from the University of Edinburgh
online chat with Dr.Hu
Dr. Linda Hu from the University of Edinburgh interviewed Peking_R team on Aug. 10th. During this online video talk, Dr. Hu asked a few questions to each of our team members relating to the construction, operation and division of work of our team. We hope this talk could help promote the communication between Peking_R team and Edinburgh team!
Information & Material Sharing
Tsinghua University IGEM team
Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish iGEM team in China, we would like to share our experience and experiment material with other teams. OUC (Ocean University of China) iGEM team and THU_A iGEM team participate in this competition for the first time this year.
Ocean University of China
All of us 3 teams have some online discussion, via which lot of information about iGEM 2011 competition and team organization affairs has been shared with these 2 new teams.And we also thank OUC for sending us useful strains and plasmids!
Last but not least, we give a huge thank to team Peking R! We helped each other a lot during this busy summer.
Peking R!

“RECOUNTER” a short story
We developed an Android app for the ones who can’t live without their mobile phones, but also we try to approach a whole new different type public by writing a short story.
Since English is not our native language, it was a challenge for us from the very beginning to write the story. Nevertheless, we kept some characteristics of Japanese literature when we were writing it. The story is divided in two parts vol. 1 and vol. 2. In Japanese literature, books are usually divided into two separated books, you can read the first part and if you like it buy the second part, and also it saves a lot of space. The story is light to read (shouldn’t take more tan 3 hours) and events take place in Japan. Our Project “sigma recounter” is a main theme of the story and we tried to explore also topics such living abroad, language and culture differences, and science.
We want to present the first part of the story in our wiki and the second part will be distributed at our poster presentation space. This will also serve us as an experiment for the future human practice methods.
¿Does by giving out a piece of art, can we trigger interest in our Project?.

Lectures to general public
School festivals
The university of Tokyo has two school festivals per year. The May festival is held in May and the Komaba festival is held in November. We explained iGEM and synthetic biology briefly and introduced our project to audience. We invited all iGEM teams in Japan to May festival, and 6 teams participated in poster session. We offered precious opportunities that Japanese iGEM teams meet together through May festivals.

Lack of digital responses in Synthetic Biology have inhibited the diverse potential that accompanies the digitization of biological circuits. This year we developed synthetic modules for signal processing in biological systems, in the form of elements of specialized logic gates based on transcriptional regulation. We moved from computationally demonstrating near digital logic gates with sharp responses, to more specialized collapsible and reconfigurable circuits which can perform various operations like developing square pulses. Further, to realize the aim of making a square wave generator, we engineered a five node repression based ring network to give digital oscillations. Quantitative computational modelling was used to tailor the cellular environment and observe period, steepness, noise and amplitude variations. Our project poses to be an integral element in genetic networks intended to solve scientific challenges for years to come, ranging from making light sensitive frequency modulators and bacterial memory storage systems.

Dundee team
We worked side by side with the Dundee collegiate team on our respective projects over the summer holidays. They were an incredible help, and by working on separate yet similar projects at the same time, we have all achieved much more than we ever could have alone; every step of the way we have been providing each other feedback and advice in order to develop wikis, presentations, surveys, graphic design and our projects as a whole. This was invaluable for both teams as it meant things were constantly being approached from multiple angles and viewpoints, allowing us to very quickly develop and move forward with our projects.
iGEM Northern UK Meet-up
We met up with the Edinburgh UG, Edinburgh OG, Glasgow, Dundee and Newcastle teams in Edinburgh for the day, where we presented our project. This was an excellent opportunity as it provided us with lots of fantastic feedback, as well as the chance to meet and chat with all the teams from Scotland (as well as one from England).
iGEM UK Meet-up
As part of our collaboration with many UK iGEM teams, we attended a meet-up hosted by the University of Westminster team in London. This meet-up allowed us to prepare ourselves and see what the Jamboree would be like as we had a poster session and a presentation slot. We received feedback on both, which allowed us to further improve on them. We were also asked some questions like “How are you going to make the RNA specific to the target bacterium?” which we were able to further elaborate on. Doing the presentation also allowed us to gain confidence because of the large audience, a big help for when Boston comes around.

This year, despite our relatively ambitious project, our team achieved goals in several different areas.
We successfully modelled, designed, characterised and entered our sporulation tuning kinA BioBrick ( BBa_K174011 ) in the parts registry.
We also improved an existing BioBrick part ( BBa_K174004 ) rendering it tightly regulated.
Futhermore, we helped the UQ-Australia iGEM2009 team ( Helping other teams ) by building a template model for their system and sending it to them.
We developed a bacterial population simulation , primarily to assist in examining the affect of our removal of germination in the 'sequestering spores', which combines distributed computing, biochemical models and agent based modelling.
We also modelled all the components of our project's system, and we designed and entered 16 other BioBrick parts and devices, ranking from a degradation controller system to a tightly regulated metal sensing promoter. We believe that several of the BioBrick parts we designed, in addition to our three favourite parts, are novel and can be used not only in the context of our project but in a variety of different systems.
Our degradation controller device is arabinose inducible and should be useful beyond our own project, to tightly regulate the levels of protein in a range of synthetic systems. Our device allows us to exert a third form of control over the expression level of a protein of interest, in addition to the transcriptional and translational regulation already widely used in Synthetic Biology.
Our cadmium sensitive promoter BioBrick is novel since there is no previously available cadmium specific promoter. Our combinatorial approach, using two different transcriptional repressors is a tightly regulated promoter which can be used by any cadmium-sensitive"

Bacterial Art
This year we continued our collaboration with Telus Spark, Calgary’s science centre. We were invited to run an event at their monthly adult night, where adults come to the science centre after hours to participate in science activities. Alongside DIY blood typing and glow in the dark paint, we ran 'Bacterial Art'. Using genetically modified E. coli expressing six different colors of fluorescent protein, participants were able to create their own agar plate masterpieces.
This sparked plenty of conversations about people's perceptions of E. coli. Although many people knew that it could make you sick and that it's often associated with contaminated meat, participants were surprised to know that not all E. coli is pathogenic. They were even more surprised that in our project, we're using non-harmful E. coli in order to build our detector for pathogenic E. coli. Participants were also really interested in the idea of 'glowing bacteria' and the potential applications for it.
It was great to step out of the lab for a bit and see what the general public thinks about E. coli contamination and the potential for our product. After the event, we incubated the 'artwork' overnight and then posted pictures of the plates on the Telus Spark Facebook page so that participants could check out their masterpieces. Below you can see some examples but check out the Facebook page to see them all!

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," combined cloning of all three HUHF-gBlocks by Gibson Assembly into the plasmid backbone of pSB1C3, thus creating the basic part BBa_K2638999 .  For expression of HUHF we cloned an araBAD promoter (BBa_I0500) and a ribosome-binding site (RBS) (BBa_R0030) upstream of the CDS via BioBrick assembly.  HUHF was expressed in E. coli DH5α. Therefore, 50 mL LB cultures in shaking flasks were inoculated from an overnight culture to achieve an OD600 of 0.1. The cultures were cultivated at 37 °C and 140 rounds per minute (rpm). After growing to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, HUHF expression was induced with 1 % L-arabinose. After induction the flasks were incubated at 28 °C and 140 rpm for six hours. Samples were taken hourly for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) . Moreover, the samples were further purified. Therefore, the protocol of Dr. Jon Marles Wright has been applied.  The samples were pelleted (13000 g, 1 min), the media was discarded and cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM tris pH 8, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 20 mM mannitol). Afterwards the cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged (10000 g, 20min), heated to 80 °C for 10 minutes, put on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged (10000 g, 10 min) again. Purified HUHF was located in the supernatant.  HUHF purified by this workflow was analyzed with a SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Clearly visible bands have been recognizable at about 23 kDa, the expected hight for HUF.
Figure 4: SDS-PAGE of purified Human Ferritin Heavy Chain (BBa_K2683999) . HUHF under control of the araBAD promoter (BBa_I0500) was expressed in E. coli DH5 alpha and afterwards purified. Shown are samples were expression was induced with 1 % arabinose (third, sixth ninth and twelfth lane) and controls without induction (second, fifth, eighth and eleventh lane) as well as empty-vector controls (pSB"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," that one measurement should cost less than 25 euros in order for it to be an improvement to existing methods. We used these aspects when choosing the best option of our preliminary detection methods to continue with. We can honestly say that their input affected our choice of using modified yeast as detection chassis organism.
We also talked about the possibility to use genetically modified yeast as a sensor in the natural environment and it was nice to hear that they didn’t turn this idea down even if it is not allowed by the Finnish legislation at the moment. This gave us additional courage to choose our GMO yeast sensor construct to become out topic.
Besides affecting our choice of topic, SYKE gave us information about how we could develop our project after the proof of concept. We talked quite a lot about what kind of models are used now to follow cyanobacterial movement in seas and the development of algal blooms. From this conversation, we got an idea to develop their Levävahti sensor app. This was supposed to be part of our project, but unfortunately time constraints prevented us from doing this. Perhaps after the Giant Jamboree we might have time for this.
Interviewing people on the streets of Helsinki
From interviewing people in the streets, we learned that public knowledge about synthetic biology was rather restricted. Most people associated it with man-made biology or just something that they need to know nothing about. Based on this, we really thought that there was a need to increase knowledge about synthetic biology. We didn’t leave this on the level of thought, as we tried to raise the level of knowledge by talking in university lectures and in a biology olympiad training camp and by telling about synthetic biology in magazine and radio interviews. In the beginning, we didn’t really understand how scary and strange a branch synthetic biology seems to be for people not involved in it, but during the project we started to understand this. It is probably also one reason for why investors are not so easily attracted on projects related to this branch - they don’t know about its existence. Our team participated also in a bioeconomy seminar hosted by VTT, where this subject was brought up. It was discussed that communication really is the key when trying to create business in this field, and that researchers should learn how to communicate about this seemingly outlandish field to the general public. For this reason, too, we see a huge need to spreading knowledge, and we hope that in some years, it will start to show.
Besides gaining information about the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them. All of interviewed"

Last year, SZU-China submitted part C125-TupA( BBa_K2232003 )        , which is the coding sequence (CDS) of a cytoplasmic protein TupA (GenBank: BAB07375.1). This protein catalyzes the conversion of glucuronic acid and L-glutamic acid to polyglucuronic acid and poly-γ-L-glutamic acid.Besides this gene plays a key role in pH homeostasis and increases the alkali resistance of Bacteria.
But it’s a pity that there was no data at the protein level in 2017 SZU-China iGEM’s project.
This year we decided to make an improvement about that.We submit part C125-TupA-6His( BBa_K2788020 ) which add a His-tag at the C-terminus of the protein so that we can gain this cytoplasmic protein by histidine-labeled affinity column chromatography, and analysis at the protein level is easier.
We transfer C125-TupA-6Hisand C125-TupA into Bacillus subtilis sck6 respectively, then screen for         transformants by kanamycin. Transformants were grown in LB broth. Then we collected bacteria into a         new microtube. Then obtained total protein by ultrasonication. performed histidine-tagged affinity         column chromatography to isolate fusion protein, then verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.

Plan: -Need to set up plasmids for sequencing -Grow a Cholera biofilm -Gram-stain of Cholera to check
KP March 20th
Today we started off by picking up our cholera from Dr. Robison’s lab. Most of the day was spent researching previous iGEM teams that have already worked with cholera, quorum sensing, and biofilm degradation. Some of the previous teams projects are very similar to our own, so we are trying to decide whether to proceed with our current plans or to choose something else. Or, if we stick with our current plan, how can we incorporate phage or make our project unique?
Here are a few good papers on using phage to destroy biofilm.

Constructed dCas9 gene cassette and plasmid backbone with replication origin ColE1 via PCR Rescue. Gel purified dCas9 and ColE1 cassettes. 1 out of 4 dCas9 PCR's were successful, and 2 out of 4 colE1's were successful, all of which were Ashlee's. We attributed this to Emily's lack of cloning experience.
Sam prepared electrocompetent cells for use later on, and began process of primer design. Clay designed the synthetic leader sequence and finalized the program in MATLAB that optimizes GFPs at codon level.Met with Dr. Salis and decided to also optimize a GFP for slow insertion time, based on a model created by Iman Farasat.
Tuesday, June 3, 2014
Conducted Colony PCR using P. putida KT2440 strain as DNA template to construct two ~1 kb genome overlaps. Plasmid prepared the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid, DH10B-PKD46, FTV-ptac-LacI-CmR plasmid, and NoHP_15A_Plmra_CmR plasmid containing RFP with a strong, unique promoter.  Stock of NoHP_15A_Pkmra_CmR and FTV_ptac_LacI_CmR for cryogenic storage was also made. Lambda Red Recombinase cassette was amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified.
All constructs (variant GFPs in vector pFTV checked for enzyme restriction sites, enzymes picked to be used in the cloning process. gblocks designed using format: junk DNA- restriction site- CDS- restriction site- junk DNA. Sam designed rescue primers to be used for amplifying the gblocks. They will be expensive and we don't want to leave any chance of running out of stock once we have them. Primers for rescue PCR redesigned when it was realized that Clay accidentally truncated the GFPs by incorrectly copying the coding sequence of original superfolder GFP from its Ape file.

Output
We use the powerful open source simulator for biochemical networks - COPASI, as the output interface of our software.
It has many functions which will satisfy our needs in most situations. The tasks allowed includes steady-state analysis, time course, parameter scan, etc. The most frequently used function is to perform time course analysis. Users could obtain dynamic curves easily. What's more, it provides convenient way  to modify parameters, species and reactions. Users could understand the model's network easily"
Toronto,2015,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," parts, there is a purple or yellow pellet of varying size and intensity at the bottom of each well. This is an indicator dye to show that the sample is present. Gently suspend the pellet by pipetting up and down a few times until the solution appears uniformly pink.
Anchor parts are provided pre-bound to the magnetic beads and appear as a dark brown/black pellet in dried form. Resuspension (as above) will result in an opaque brown solution that will settle over time. Make sure the mixture is well mixed just prior to each use.
Store RDP parts
Transfer each resuspended part to a microfuge tube that has been clearly labelled (screw-capped tubes are preferred since they minimize evaporation).
Refrigerate until needed. Secure the lid tightly on the plate and store refrigerated.
Prepare the ligase solution just prior to use and store on ice.
Each coupling reaction uses 5 μL of T4 DNA ligase at a final concentration of 0.2 Weiss units/μL in 1x ligase buffer. To calculate the volume (in μL) of ligase required, multiply the number of ligation steps in your build by 5 and prepare accordingly. NOTE: ThermoFisher ligase uses Weiss units NEB and Invitrogen use cohesive end units. 1 Weiss unit= ~70 CE units.
RDP Assembly
NOTE: Before beginning, briefly centrifuge all parts and solutions contained in microfuge tubes and mix thoroughly. Tubes that have sat in the fridge for a while will evaporate and condense liquid up at the cap. This step restores the original volume and concentration of the sample.
Consult the circuit design. Post a copy of your RDP circuit design so you know the right order of assembly.
Arrange your RDP parts. Put your DNA tubes in the right order.
Begin the assembly by gently mixing the bead-anchor stock solution by pipetting it slowly up and down (avoiding bubbles) until homogenous. This method minimizes the splashes of other more vigourous methods that strand droplets up the side of the tube.
Immediately transfer 5 μL of the mixture to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.
Add RDP Wash buffer (WB). Add 50 μL of RDP Wash buffer and mix as above. Pulse the liquid down briefly in a low speed microfuge.
Place the tube in a magnet cradle and wait for the solution to clear, by allowing the beads to collect on the tube wall next to the magnet. Wait 20-30 seconds until the solution fully clears.

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," it would otherwise have been. If a sufficient number of sterile insects can be released over a sufficient period, the target population will decline and collapse(Programme, J., 2017).
Based on this method we sustain our product, where we incorporate our ""sterile"" bacteria back to its original habitat, to encourage the decline of the original population of wild Erwinia amylovora. Being of the same species means that it is going compete for the same resources and available space with the phytopathogenic bacteria. The biocontrol can be applied directly to the foliage thanks to the method of sodium alginate microencapsulation, same that maintains the bacteria metabolically dormant which extends the active effect time. The preventive application is essential for optimal use, as the bacteria needs to be there to control an exogenous E. amylovora, as it prevents it to form high enough cellular density to change to a sessile state and infect the plant. This product is foreseen to have an admirable market launch as it has many value levers which greatly increases our chances of success.
Market Competition
Market
Our product is planned to target the market of biological products, specifically in the biological control industry. A market analysis of the Dunham Trimmer International Bio Intelligence showed a global biological control market in 2017 of $2.8 Bn of dollars and forecasted a growth to $11 Bn of dollars by 2025. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated to grow 16% between 2015-2025. Our product can be considered into the biocontrol agents in agriculture, the most important market of the biocontrol agents that is reported to be about 1680 million in 2015. The market of biological control products can be segmented in different ways by type, target pest, crop application a geography. Focusing about type segmentation, our product is part of the biopesticides, specifically in the microbial-bacteria part. This segment is the one with most demand in the world, biocontrol of microbial market is growing faster as both small and large companies, and it is expected to grow nearly 60% of the market through 2025, approximately 6.6 Bn of dollars(Dunhamm M., 2017).
Our product is classified in different ways depending on the segmentation of the biological control market, for example, in geography we are in the Latin American region, according to the Dunham Trimmer analysis, the Latin American region is experiencing the fastest growth in the biological control market, in spite of this, nowadays the strongest region in the biocontrol market in North"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html,", thereby increasing the number of potential trigger sequences. The sequence in the hairpin added after the start codon was also screened for the presence of stop codons, as they would prematurely terminate translation of the gene of interest when the riboregulator was activated. We employed a 12 nt Toehold domain at the 50 end of the hairpin to initiate its interaction with the cognate trigger strand. The trigger RNA contains a 30 nt single-stranded RNA sequence that is complementary to the toehold and stem of the switch RNA.
Figure 6: (C) Flow cytometry GFP fluorescence histograms for toehold switch number 2 compared to E. coli autofluorescence and a positive control. Autofluorescence level measured from induced cells not bearing a GFP-expressing plasmid.(D) GFP mode fluorescence levels measured for switches in their ON and OFF states in comparison to positive control constructs and autofluorescence. Error bars are the SD from at least three biological replicates.
Based on all information given above, we decided to use Toehold-Trigger RNA system fort he AND Gate part of our project.
At last, here is the place of toehold-trigger RNA system in our project as a diagram:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," people should be able to use it without reading the instructions: it’s the main goal of each functional device.                                           For our project, the difficulty comes from the precise protocol that the user must follow. The product must be easy to use by the end-user. Putting color on the surfaces that are going to be manipulated is a way to guide the user. That is why we decided to put  color on the zones that should the user should get in direct contact with and leave the rest in white.
What are the selling features of our device?
It’s a very simple device, contrary to what’s currently available. It’s cheap, small, and easy to use. But mainly it’s not aggressive, not like the vast majority of medical products. The little needle hidden in the device does not refer to a syringe, so the object is less “threatening” than what’s on the market.
What benefits came out of this experience with design?
This was our first experience dealing with an applied design. Our project was complex and with a really applied purpose. It was extremely pleasant to work together. Each universe, design and biology, were bound together and communication easily set in.                               Everyone acquired new knowledge thanks to that. Sadly, it is rare to have a product designer working in parallel to the development of a new product. This experience was extremely beneficial to build our iGEM project more efficiently. Design should be an integrated practice!
Integrated Design as a rupture tool
First, we had to define a list of specifications we wanted for our device. Building something new and really innovative is a difficult task, especially when you start from scratch. As iGEMers but also engineers we started this design work by investigating the self-test market. The results showed us that currently available tests were not intuitive, expensive, and with poor design… we thought that their complexity was reluctant for potential users. We also found out through our human practices actions that potential users tend to be stressed out and uncomfortable when a STD test needs to be done. So we wanted to simplify the manipulations to avoid unnecessary discomfort and potential misuses. The most important remark is that no self-test on the market are suited for the detection of multiple STI.
The current solutions for self-testing are not very developed yet, apart from pregnancy tests, only one self-test is sold in France. We analysed it to explore their limitations.
The existing HIV test is quite complex, with eight elements to be manipulated by the user.
The buffer cap is on one piece and need to be put elsewhere, this is not very easy to understand at a first glance.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," as therapeutics, which we were unaware of. This expanded the potential uses of PHB in our project. This lead us to 3D print a life-size part of a jaw.
We talked to a nurse about their requirements for a patch like ours. This guided us regarding to which aspects we should focus on if hospitals are going to use our Bacto-Aid. Furthermore, we made a survey with one of the high schools we visited and used their feedback to improve the message. Lastly, we send out question forms to Danish plastic companies to investigate their possible interest in the use of plastic made by bacteria. They were very interested in our plastic, but today PHB is too expensive. We have therefore worked hard to optimize the production of PHB.
Best device
We created a BioBrick (K2018050) that will help overcome the problems associated with extraction and production of PHB. The Biobrick allows the PHB producing E. coli to secrete internal PHB into the environment. The BioBrick utilizes the type 1 secretion pathway for hemolysin and tags PHB for secretion by fusing a part of hemolysin to the PHB-binding protein, phasin. The BioBrick has been shown to work in Top10/PanK-sec. The PHB secreting cells could enable optimal utilization of a continuous system for large scale PHB production.
