Ethics in Biotechnology - Concern and issues
There are many concerns that arise with new technology.  It can be new treatments, better solutions, and new knowledge with the intention to benefit human society or our environment.  But as technology advances, so does its complexity.  Issues and concerns have been raised about how technology may be misused in any form, may it be intentional or by accident, or of scientific information being withheld or wrongly presented. These matters are therefore important to discuss.
Questions of technology also apply to biotechnology. The use and alteration of organisms for production and for research have been and still is of debate. With the growing complexity of the field, there are many apprehensions about the publics’ level of knowledge and how capable they are to understanding the ethical problems that lies within this field.  However in recent years there has been a much bigger focus on making research transmittable to a broader audience as we have tried doing so for our human practice.
Through this page we hope to illustrate some concerns and issues that have formed the field of bioethics and how ethical and moral implications of biotechnology are being addressed at different governmental levels.  We will also talk our iGEM project’s bioethical subjects that may surface due to future prospects (see: Prospect for the Future).
Bioethics as a discipline (Willmott, 2011)
There are no real definitions of what bioethics entails nor is there a clear cut to where bioethics starts and where it ends. However when the term as first used by Van Resselaer, an American cell biologist it was described as “a new discipline which combines biological knowledge with a knowledge human value systems”.
Bioethics can loosely be divided into three categories; biomedical ethics, environmental ethics and research ethics. For our project the category referred to as research ethics will be of the bigger relevance as it is significant to be able"

Human Practices
To improve the feasibility of our project and stimulate public interests in our work, we did the following human practices. First, we held meetings with experts in cancer-therapy research to get academic advices on our project. After finishing a sketch of our project plan, we made surveys among faculties in cancer research and attend a cancer summit in Changchun to get suggestions and comment about the feasibility and safety of our plan.  Next, we discussed with some professors in law to understand better the potential biosafety issues of our project. All these work helped us make great improvement of our project. To help people understand more about cancer therapies and our project, we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting, did a TED presentation and were interviewed by some local TV programs, including the Jilin University Television. Furthermore, we made online games, established a public Wechat platform and a twitter account to get feedback from the general public on the internet. To stimulate the interests in science among high school students, we gave a seminar on synthetic biology and our project in a local high school.

Internet Platform
Online media involving Twitter, Wechat, Renren Blog and wiki was well utilized to expand the influence of our activities and synthetic biology. These platforms aided us this year in sharing information and spreading scientific knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology with our website's audience. Besides, we published some articles to draw individual's attention to facilitate our human practice activities. Specifically, Twitter is a platform that is used to communicate with foreign iGEM teams, which has more than 150 fans. Wechat is also a great interface to convey a more humanistic view of iGEM and synthetic biology to Chinese students and scholars, where our article was read by more than 500 individuals. In addition, Renren also provided a great opportunity to lead our university's students to get to know iGEM and synthetic biology and be encouraged to join our team. We can offer diversified methods for you to get familiar with the iGEM. No matter whether you major in bioscience or just are curious about synthetic biology, JOIN US!
University Involvement In iGEM Survey Questionnaire
During the process of building a new iGEM team, we discovered several problems in the development of iGEM in China. As a result, in order to investigate the current situation of iGEM at home and abroad, and find solutions for our team and more iGEM teams, we, Tianjin team, designed and carried out a survey questionnaire on university involvement in iGEM. More than one hundred iGEMers replied to assist us in gathering iGEMers' perspectives and feelings. Undoubtedly, we count it as collaboration and appreciate each team sincerely. (the school name list).
There are some of conclusions according to iGEMers' reply. (Survey Questionnaire Data )
1.The ways of knowing about iGEM are distinguishing. Overseas students mainly were told by students or friends and informed by college teachers, taking up 54% and 39.7% respectively. Yet in China, more than three quarters of iGEMers we interviewed knew about iGEM by iGEM teams' publicities, with 44.26% of iGEMers getting related information from students or friends. As is shown, foreign teachers and students may contact more closely and the information dissemination from iGEM team is of great value.
2. As for the limiting factors for their teams joining in iGEM, there exits divergence.
In China, 77.05% of iGEMers we interviewed think that their knowledge reserve is not enough rich and the research should go further"

We assume that the interconversion between active and inactive forms of a node is reversible. Thus if a node <math>i</math> has only positive incoming links, it is assumed that there is a background (constitutive) deactivating enzyme Fi of a constant concentration (set to be <math>0.5</math>) to catalyze the reverse reaction. Similarly, a background activating enzyme <math>E_{i}=0.5</math> is added for the nodes that have only negative incoming links. The rate equation for a node (e.g., node <math>B</math>) takes the form:
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dB}{dt}=\sum\limits_{i}X_{i}\cdot k_{X_{i}B}\frac{(1-B)}{ (1-B)+K_{X_{i}B}}-\sum\limits_{i}Y_{i}\cdot k_{X_{i}B}\frac{B}{B+K_{Y_{i}B}}, \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>

In the equation for node A, an input term is added to the righthand-side of the equation:

Two topologies that can achieve adaptation: Negative Feedback Loop with a Buffer Node (NFBLB) and Incoherent Feedforward Loop with a Proportioner Node (IFFLP) (Figure reproduced from Defining Network Topologies that Can Achieve Biochemical Adaptation )

Individual constructs range from highest resistance in the following order: merRTPAB > vector control >merΔmerA.  Our results show that both the recombinant E. coli and Pseudomonas putida containing the pBBRBB::mer plasmid were able to grow significantly closer to the HgCl2 disc than the negative control (pBBRBB::GFP). The E.coli strain containing the merA deletion plasmid could not survive as close to the heavy metal spotted disc as the negative control. This is likely due to the fact that it still contains the transport proteins MerP and MerT, and therefore transports the toxic mercury ions into the cell without remediating it due to the lack of MerA, causing cell death. On the other hand, the pBBRBB::GFP control was not able to take up any mercury ions.

LB (abiotic) as well as LB (abiotic) containing 0.5g encapsulation beads were also used as negative controls. Unencapsulated bacteria of each strain were also tested to compare the efficiency of those cells in direct contact with MeHg to those within the encapsulation beads.
Experiments were conducted by adding methylmercury chloride to 7 mL of LB at a final concentration of 1 mg/L. The methylmercury levels were analyzed at the start of the experiment and after 36 hours. At each time point the samples were diluted a million-fold before taking measurements with a Tekran model 2700 Automated Methyl Mercury Analyzer using EPA method 1630 without distillation. This is a highly sensitive and ultra-stable cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) Hg detector. All quality assurance and quality control measures were taken as outlined in EPA method 1630. All MeHg standards (ongoing precision recoveries) were within the acceptable range"

What we did & collaboration with other iGEM 2008 Teams
Paolo Magni and colleagues wanted to introduce Biomedical Engineering students into Synthetic Biology. So, he decided to get some information from Silvio Cavalcanti group (Bologna University), who already worked in this field. At the beginning of 2008 Paolo Magni visited Bologna University labs, located in Cesena, to understand what kind of wet lab resources were necessary to develop a Synthetic Biology project and, discussing with Silvio Cavalcanti and Francesca Ceroni from Bologna group, the iGEM competition seemed to be the right opportunity to start a project. Because Engineering faculty in Pavia had not the required facilities, it was necessary to involve Maria Gabriella Cusella, who leads a Molecular Biology lab in a structure that already worked with Engineering faculty (Center for Tissue Engineering). Then they started selecting students to build up the iGEM team. They chose one Biomedical Engineering master student, Lorenzo Pasotti, one Molecular Biology master student, Mattia Quattrocelli, and a lab advisor, Daniela Galli. In the first weeks of April, Lorenzo trained Mattia about Digital Electronics principles and mathematical modeling. In the meanwhile, Mattia trained Lorenzo about wet lab work. The training included a presentation of all the lab instrumentation, basic Microbiology and Molecular Biology protocols and safety issues. These activities allowed the two students to learn the preliminary skills to start a multidisciplinary collaboration and then they started to get information from literature and from the Registry, to understand what kind of original device they could design. After some weeks they two chose a project and, after some meetings with the other team members, they begun project implementation when Spring 2008 DNA Distribution arrived. The two students worked"

WHU-China,2017,Team:WHU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," know the details of the pollutants, especially halogenated phenols. That tells us that we need to do more things on public education on details of pollution and in the meantime, it’s necessary to carry on our project.
    One of the questions is to collect team names from people. We collected the answers and drew this picture.
    All the names showed in the picture came from the interviewee and the more frequency the name shows in the picture; the higher votes it wins.
4.Water sample analysis
    To figure out water pollution state in Wuhan, which is a city famous for its lakes, we collect many samples in different sites to detect the level of halogenated phenols—— pollutants our engineered bacteria can break down.
    We chose many different sites in river area to figure out the relationship of pollution and human activities.
    Because the amount of halogenated phenols in natural water is too low to be detected exactly, even by HPLC-MS, we didn’t do the experimental work. However, from other indexes we can have a general view on pollution level and obviously, samples from those sites near residential area and factories are polluted unbelievably.
Education
    In June 11th, we got a chance to propagandize iGEM and our project to children in community.
    After delivering a speech about microorganisms, we instructed them to make three types of halogenated phenol models by foam board and stick models, ortho-position, meta position and para position. We taught the children to cut the cystosepiment into regular hexagons. The hexagon represents benzene. The balls and sticks are inserted at hexagonal angles as halogen atoms and hydroxyl groups.
    Then they were divided into two groups, competed and played the role of our engineered dehalogenation bacteria— break the bonds between halogen atoms and phenols. After the volunteers stood away from the head of two queues with equal models, they handed one model to each child, and the child needed to pull the balls representing halogen atoms away from cystosepiment representing phenols, then they had to run back to tail of the queue and hand the separated models to volunteers waiting there. Because our dehalogenase can function and break para-position halogenated phenols firstly, then para-position and ortho-position halogenated phenols, the children can only take para-position halogenated phenols firstly. One team who used the least time to breakdown the models would win. In fact, everyone in both teams was awarded with a delicate toy"

CAMERA
Firstly, we tested a previously characterized CRISPR/Cas9 base editing system obtained from the Addgene repository of Dr. Liu’s lab at Harvard University. The system consisted of a high copy number recording plasmid (R1) and a low copy number writing plasmid with a base editor and one gRNA (W2.1). To assemble this system we transformed the two plasmids into Escherichia coli S1030 obtained from Addgene. This strain of E. coli is a version of the K12 strain with regulatory elements for the 2 inducible promoters PtetO and PLacO encoded into the genome.
The results of the single nucleotide mutations were analyzed through sequencing. The original paper utilized High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to analyze single nucleotide mutations produced by the base editor. However, due to budget restrictions, we utilized Sanger Sequencing combined with analysis from our software tool CrisPy. For analysis of this software please see our software tool page.
Figure 3 below displays the mutation frequency (the percent of total plasmids edited) over time. This matches the expected results, in that we see a linear relationship of editing over time. However, we did not reach the same amount of overall editing that we demonstrated in the paper. Our data shows an overall editing rate of about 12% editing efficiency after 96 hours, which is similar to the paper who got about 55% editing after four days.
In order to optimize our protocol for testing the CAMERA base editing system, we made two modifications to the previous protocol. We used the corresponding antibiotics for each plasmid to mainly ensure that the low copy number plasmid would not be kicked out by the bacterium. Additionally, we used fresh medium and inducers each time we diluted instead of filling all the wells with medium at the beginning and then diluting into them.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"? What would happen if the tool would be used to make disastrous findings? As inventors, are we directly related to someone's bad intentions or are we rather providing the tool? Ethically, would we be held accountable for any individual radical agenda? We have approached the subject by this assessment and believe in the importance of this initial precaution by raising thoughts of the precautionary principle - do we dare to release our product and how can we prevent its misuse? An obvious suggestion would be introduction of limitations in the presented features, limiting the use of the tool for products that are known toxic and the use with a bad intention. This could be implemented by an input blacklisting of NPRS complexes associated with toxin products. Still, these limitations could be insufficient in prevention of uncharacterized toxic products due to lack of prediction. However, engaging this topic by utilitarianism, we should not limit ourselves by these precautions before applying a risk-benefit analysis of individual usage. The outcome of the combined achievement of medical, social and financial gain should by default strongly overweight the risk at hand.
 
But… you work with GMO?!
Yes, as we work with GMO, biosafety is important to address the protection of the environment. Biosafety entails environment, health and safety, and ethical considerations would concern the correct handling of microorganisms. This ensures a safe lab environment and the prevention of microorganisms contamination or being released into nature with a negative influence. As distributers of the synthesizer tool, we cannot ensure certified safety standards when users apply our tool. As a preventive measure, out team has highlighted the importance of basic lab safety measures in the wiki safety page one should always be prepared for any safety-compromised situation. In addition, our team facilitated the BioBrick workshop  with an extensive safety introduction ensuring a basic understanding of safety to follow iGEM team of Denmark.
 
The element of teaching
While teaching high school students about synthetic biology – questions can be raised about the ethics and safety in the passing of mentioned knowledge. As these students are unfamiliar with in-depth knowledge about the particular scientific development in this field, they may not be aware of the unspoken ethic consensus. This adds layers of complexity and considerations to the teaching, as material, teaching methods and especially lab exercises should be under proper supervision.
An obvious concern is the element of biosecurity as our project facilitates the knowhow to manipulate GMO that potentially could be dangerous for human health. Ethical gray-area experiments could become a Trivial Trap as the line between “wrong” and “no harm, no foul” may blur out leaving the susceptible students prone to “the ends"

Kill Switch
We designed a kill switch to control ""Prometheus"" and to prevent potential contamination.
One difficulty we face is how to trigger the suicide progress spontaneously at a certain time. In the medium, the bacteria are easily controlled by adding or removing regulatory factors. However, after pouring E. coli into soil, it is hard for us to control. The suicide progress needs to be activated spontaneously. Moreover, the kill switch is supposed to be “off” for a certain time in the soil, so the bacteria will gain enough time to perform its function.
Considering the problems, toxin protein MazF is the best candidate for ""Prometheus"" to suicide with, as well as for us to restrict the bacterial number under reasonable level.
Background
MazEF is a toxin-antitoxin module comprising mazE and mazF locating on E. coli and other pathogens' chromosome (Hanna et al, 2005). The  protein product of mazF expression is a stable toxin, while mazE a labile MazF antitoxin (Hazan et al, 2004; Schusteret al., 2013). MazF is a sequence-specific mRNA endo-ribonuclease that, when triggered in response to various stresses initiates programmed cell death. The mazEF-mediated death pathway initially acts as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of bacterial phage infection, allowing bacterial populations to behave like multicellular organisms.
With regard to mazEF system, we designed the kill switch forE. coli.

We plan to establish a new E.coli strain without lacI and MazEF system gene to avoid the inference of cell itself. We will test cI background expression level to see if we need to knock out cI.

Hello! I’m a lovely Kidney baby, an essential organ in your body. Can you see those sparkling items                     pointed by my hand? Right! This is a wonderful liquid crystal show caused by the combination of                     β2-MG and nanobodies. What’s more, the different concentrations of β2-MG make                     the different degree of brightness showed by liquid crystal. We can make use of this phenomenon to                     achieve early detection of CKD caused mostly by diabetes and high blood pressure according to the brightness displayed by the detector confidently. Such an amazing idea, right?

LB - Agar Plate Preparation Protocol
return to top
Weigh 35g of LB-Agar powder mix per litre of media desired. One litre makes 40-50 plates
Select an appropriate flask; the lab autoclave will cause flasks half full and above to boil over! Use a 2L flasks for up to .5 L of media, a 4 litre flask for up to 1.5L, etc
Disolve LB-Agar, using water from one of the wall mounted nanopure filters. Add a stir bar and use a magnetic stirrer to speed things up
Cover the flask with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with autoclave tape. The foil should be somewhat loose (to avoid building pressure in the flask while sterilizing and blowing the foil off), but not so loose that lots of liquid can escape
Put the flask in a plastic autoclave tray, load into the autoclave, and sterilize using the 20 minute liquid program
Once the autoclave finishes venting (which can take twice as long as the sterilization proper), check that the foil covering is still in place. If it is not, the media is contaminated! Unload using the insulated oven gloves
Allow the media to cool until it can be handled without the oven mits. The cold room can be used to speed this up. Alternatively, if a large batch of media is prepared flasks may be kept hot in the prep lab water bath, to avoid all of them cooling at once. Agar polymerization cannot be reversed once it starts (and if it begins to set in the flask you're in trouble!), but media can be kept from setting further by keeping it hot.
Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use the magnetic stirrer to mix, but do NOT add a stir bar now, or the media will be contaminated. (If one wasn't added before, you must do without.) Common additions include:
ampicillin (stock 100mg/ml, final 100ug/ml)
kanamycin (stock 50mg/ml, final 50ug/ml)
chloramphenicol (stock 50mg/ml, final 10ug/ml)
To achieve final concentrations, add 1mL of stock per 1L of media, except for chloramphenicol, where "

Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by definition blue? Or does a single mutation make them their own entity? If so, is it incorrect to class these mutants as “improvements” of the wild type? Read more discussion on the Theory of Knowledge page!
Business & Applied Design
We took the biocircuitry of our biosensor that we made in the lab, and turned to engineering to design and assess the viability of a final biosensor product. This involved considering optimisation, immobilisation techniques, potential designs, initial sketches and prototyping. We also pitched our idea to a range of potential consumers, and worked with them to evolve our design. From there, a full plant sizing and costing was done to assess if the investment would provide a worthwhile return.  For more about the business side of things, see the Business Plan page under Keep Fresh, or visit Applied Design for more biosensor design.
Outreach & Public Engagement
We engaged with people from as young as 4 years of age, up to 65+ years of age, and many between! Through numerous social events and workshops, we successfully taught thousands of people about synthetic biology, the importance of not squeezing fruit to see if it’s ripe, and introduced them to our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Outreach page.
Survey
We conducted a survey on fresh produce consumption habits to gain an insight into the context of our project firsthand. We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica)!
It was a great way to directly engage with other iGEM participants too, and generate global interest in our project.
Government
As our project involves the use of biological materials in the context of the food industry, we investigated the government legislation behind microorganisms, especially genetically modified organisms (GMOS).The Australian government regulates GMOs in food through Standard 1.5.2 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. Certain permitted GMOs are described in the subsection 1.5.2-3, which states:
A food for sale may consist of, or have as an ingredient, a food produced using gene technology if the food produced using gene technology:
• (a) is listed in Schedule 26 and complies with any corresponding conditions listed in that Schedule;
• or (b) is a substance that is permitted for use as a food additive by Standard 1.3.1 or as a processing aid by Standard 1.3"

After overnight digestion of the wild type cas9, we performed a 5 hour CIP treatment to prevent self ligation. We will also do a 30 min digestion of the gRNA parts ctxA, ctxB, acfA, and acfB. All five of these will be gel purified and then we will ligate the gRNA into the cas9. These parts will be sent out to Colombia iGEM, hopefully sometime next week!

Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". David, Adam and Tiffany had a meeting with Joe to further discuss modelling. We grew two cultures of Pseudomonas cells in parallel from a frozen stock to establish a growth curve by checking OD every half an hour. We also had a discussion about how we will measure our results and we didn’t come to a clear conclusion, but some ideas that were thrown out were to measure strength by how much protein or mRNA is produced and how quickly protein is produced. We plan to test different RBS’s as well.
7/11 Our team worked together to create a powerpoint to present to our advisors and update them on our progress. We then re-stocked our shelves with autoclaved materials and more media. We made our final edits to our g-block design and added it to our powerpoint. Afterwards, we headed to Chicago to meet with the UChicago iGEM team to discuss our respective projects and potential collaboration. The meeting proved very helpful- once we heard about their project, we found that their promoter could be tested in our lysates. We hope to get this promoter in plasmid form the next time we meet.
Week 5
7/14 Abdullah and Kristi started working on a presentation on synthetic biology for the Center for Talent Development (CTD) high school program. We met with our advisors and found points of our initial testing plan that needed revision. We also got Streptomyces fluorescens from the Kelleher lab and prepared a survey for outreach.
7/15 In the morning, we made LB and then autoclaved it. We also procured some glucose from Will and autoclaved that too. From Professor Yun Wang, we got a BSL1 strain of Pseudomonas in the afternoon. Abdullah, Kristi, and Adam gave a presentation of synthetic biology to a biomedicine class for highschoolers. In addition, we continued to grow strep as it takes two days while searching for different RBS sequences for our non model organisms.
7/16 Abdullah and David went to Roycemore School to meet a CTD teacher to talk about having a synthetic biology presentation for his honors biology class. Adam, Sharon and Kristi went to a BioExcel event where they advised students on their application based projects, for example, how to prevent HIV. We also got N. Europea from Freddy from the Wells lab. After getting ISP ingredients from Jian, we made ISP and plates. We also analyzed the surveys that we handed out to CTD students the day before.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,". If the bacterial culture is mixed constantly in such conditions we should have a uniform response to blue light.
There are several options to optimize and improve our three channel gene switch. First of all, as Dodd et al. (2001) have shown, the operator sites can be mutated to modify the function of the lambda repressor element. We can tune the PRM and PR promoters to enhance or suppress the rate of transcription associated with the promoter. This is very important as the promoters cannot be changed and different users have different needs for the promoter strengths. Another option is to modify the promoters to be as strong as possible and then tune the translation by using weaker RBS sites to get the desired level of protein production.
To address the leakiness of our system, we could attempt to engineer the FixK2 promoter to eliminate the leaky activity. We could also attempt to repress the basal expression level by duplicating the operator site in front of it. The proper function of the promoter is crucial to our system and intended dynamics of the lambda repressor element. However, as we have observed in our experiments, we have not yet reached the saturating intensity of blue light. In each figure of the results section, we see that the fluorescence decreases even from the second highest to the highest intensity. We might be able to drive down the leakiness of the promoter by using even stronger LEDs. Of course, we also need to try to minimize the heat generated by these LEDs.
There are several hypotheses that are yet to be addressed and questions to remain unanswered. Despite our best efforts we have not been able to finish our construct at the moment of the wiki freeze. We have not been able to test our hypotheses regarding the lambda repressor and we have not had enough time to test the light response element in greater detail. We are still working on it and possible future results will be published on the team website .
All our experiments have been carried out in the population level which averages out the possible individual differences. As Zopf et al. (2013) have described, cell cycle affects greatly in the rate of transcription. Especially after division, transcription rates tend to be significantly lower than before the division. In proliferating cultures this may pose a problem. Our mechanism works on the cellular level but instead, we have measured the average level. It is true that we can affect to the expression of the GFP-LVA protein but how does this rate vary from cell to cell? Are we able to keep it stable enough in cell resolution to be able to reliably control protein levels to switch between genes? This issue needs to be taken seriously and it requires further"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Adaptor_-_-_TEXT.html," output nozzle, allowing direct control over when the output is dispensed. The output selector used in the 4-Pressure Regulator chip is identical to those in the finalized branches of a droplet-based TERRA Adapter.
Click here to learn more about our proof-of-concept chip for cell-free expression:
Cell-Free Expression Chip
The TERRA Adapter works for both droplet-based and continuous flow microfluidics. For droplet-based experiments, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulators per output. The pressure regulators serve to minimize the disruption in droplet generation on the experimental chip due to the pressure difference caused by the actuation of the valves in the output selector. In continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output, there are no pressure regulators, but there is an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs.
Below are some TERRA Adapters that our team has created so far:
Single Output, Continuous Flow
Single Output, Droplet-Based
Three Output, Continuous Flow
Three Output, Droplet-Based
We have open-sourced the designs of the TERRA Adapter and added them to the 2017 iGEM BostonU Hardware team, MARS', repository of microfluidic chip designs.
Here are the SVG files for each design and its corresponding description and fabrication and assembly documentation.
Single Output, Continuous Flow
Single Output, Droplet-Based
Three Output, Continuous Flow
Three Output, Droplet-Based
Scalability
The TERRA Adapter is scalable following radial symmetry about the nozzle output, as seen in the diagram below. The continuous flow TERRA Adapters also follow this symmetry but an extra branch has to be added to each design, except that of a single input, to serve as a flush to clean the nozzle between outputs.
While there is no design limit to the number of branches a TERRA Adapter can have, there exist a fabrication limit as to the number you can feasibly mill on a chip, depending on the method of fabrication and size of chip, the fabrication limit of the TERRA Adapter will differ. Using our current fabrication method and chip size, the largest TERRA Adapter we could manufacture would be one with 5 inputs."

As ATc                     degrades, the expression of GSDMD will significantly decreases, thus the process of pyroptosis can                     be inhibited. Based on the features, we think that the cytokine storm caused by pyroptosis                     is controllable.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," screening models derived from the experimental design data are accurate. The screening design should also be performed on many different batches of at least moderately active cell extracts to confirm that important supplements do differ between batches. Following the above, a surface response design could be used for all commonly important supplements of the CFPS system to determine its effectiveness at optimising CFPS activity. The information could also be used to determine commonly unimportant supplements so they can be eliminated from the supplement solution, hence decreasing the cost per reaction.

Another part of our collaborations included mentoring a new team from Notre Dame Collegiate high school in High River, Alberta, Canada. Though they did not participate in the iGEM competition this year, they began to work in the lab, develop project ideas, and plan to compete in future years.  We got the opportunity to travel with them to a workshop in Lethbridge, Alberta, and the aGEM (alberta iGEM) competition.  During this time we agreed to help them refine their lab and research skills. Mentoring a new team not only gives us a chance to help them learn and grow as a team, but also to solidify our own skills and share the experience we learnt through help from our own mentors of the years.
Taiwan
In early March of 2016 we were contacted by an iGEM team in Taiwan who also happened to be working on a project that involved the use of Keratinase. They requested biobricks of our parts KeratinaseA and KeratinaseUS. At the time we were nearing the end of our school year and did not yet have any functional biobricks.
The fact that a team that was so far away had reached out and asked for something we couldn’t provide made us even more determined to buckle down in the lab and in our research to create a functioning biobrick. Something we are still working on. Even though we weren’t able to give them the parts they needed we did in-fact exchange research and provide them with some research of our own to help them along with their project.  However, we did provide them with the sequences of DNA we had synthesized and are using in creating our parts, if case they were interested in also synthesizing them.
Surveys
Additionally, various members of the team were asked to participate in a variety of surveys from other teams.  Determined to boost response rates, we answered all we could find.  These included both a Virginia iGEM team and the Munich United iGEM team survey.
One survey was in regards to bio-containment. Since this season we have decided to try our hand at building a bioreactor for our bacteria, this was helpful in not only expressing our ideas to others, but solidifying our own plans.
The survey done by Munich United focused more on the business side of synthetic biology.
The questions asked were related to areas we hadn’t focused on or even considered before, from funding to founding a company.  Since our aim is to implement our construct industrially these kinds of questions are ones that we need to consider."

Nationally, over 60,000 drinking water tests were conducted, with hexavalent chromium being found in more than 75% of the samples [7]. Per the Environmental Working Group’s data analysis, water supplies serving 218 million Americans contained hexavalent chromium levels above the California-determined .02 ppb maximum. In April of 2017, a local U.S. Steel spill garnered national attention when 346 pounds of chromium - 298 pounds of which were highly toxic hexavalent chromium - were dumped into a Lake Michigan tributary [8]. Total chromium discharges into the lake are restricted to 30 pounds a day, with the amount of hexavalent chromium capped at just 0.51 pounds.
Moreover, in April of 2018, results from a Chicago-wide lead test and analysis were published -- of the nearly 3,000 water-testing sites, over 70% were found to contain levels of lead, with 30% having lead levels above the FDA-set bottled-water limit of 5 ppb. Starting in May of 2016, extensive lead testing has been conducted in Chicago Public Schools. It was found that 37% of CPS schools had at least one sample with an elevated lead level, though 3.05% had samples over the 15 ppb EPA limit. It should be noted that the 15 ppb limit set by the EPA has faced criticism for being too high, as some scientists have reached conclusions that no level of lead in water is safe; the 5 ppb limit set by the FDA, some say, reflect a more accurate level for safety concern -- even 5 ppb is not completely safe, though it significantly decreases health risks [4].
Of course, with these concerning results in mind, this is more than just a local problem. Flint, Michigan has been the toxic lead capital of the United States in recent years, with levels in some areas reaching 13,000 ppb; years of tests and efforts to purify the water have done little to bring the lead levels down to a safe amount [4].
Our Proposed Solution
In response to these staggering statistics and adverse local health effects, the Northwestern iGEM Team seeks to create a biosensor that can detect toxic hexavalent chromium and lead levels in and around Lake Michigan. We will be working with a cell-free protein synthesis system (CFPS) using self-made E. coli extract.

Biobrick Safety
All organisms are biosafety level 1 with the minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. This year, our team is planning to construct a total of 7 novel basic biological parts, and to build complex devices by making use of these parts together with parts available from the Part Registry. Our BioBricks have been considered to be safe for uses and circulation. The parts and their safety evaluations are as follow.
aceA and aceB
Our team is cloning isocitrate lyase (aceA) and malate synthase (aceB) from E. coli strain BW25113. They are enzymes involved in the glyoxylate cycle in plants and bacteria. Dean et al. at UCLA introduced aceA and aceB genes into human hepatocytes to investigate fatty acid metabolism, and no hazardous effect was reported1. Based on current findings, we believe the two genes will not raise any significant safety issues.
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) is a short signaling peptide that directs proteins to the mitochondria in mammalian cells. Its functionality has been tested in human hepatocytes by Bai et al. and no harmful effect of MLS has been reported2. Our team cloned the coding DNA sequence of MLS from a commercial plasmid – pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen) – and fused it with aceA and aceB genes so the MLS can guide the two resulting enzymes into mitochondria. Again, based on the paper written by Dean et al., and with the consideration of the signaling function of this part, we consider this BioBrick to be safe in uses.

Affectionately nicknamed LZ by Barny, is a 100% Chinese postdoctoral research associate in William Barny Whitman’s lab. His family name used to be spelled as Lü in Chinese dictionary and textbooks, but just like mutations are constantly taking place in genes, “point mutation” soon changed the name into Lv or Lu when it’s exposed to the world of computers and internet. Unlike mutations emerging in genes, which is a process believed to be largely random. The arising of Lv or Lu is full of human design based upon convenient communication with computers – early computers just didn’t recognize ü. The newest and also the only internationally authorized design so far - Lyu, made its debut just a year ago, as officials might want to set things straight once-for-all. LZ probably prefers such designs would have never happened to him, since it introduces some kind of identity crisis and also brings up endless hassle when it comes to dealing with personal records. However, he sure wants to make it happen on genes – how cool it would be if one can design genes, right? A coin always has two sides – being deprived of the right to design his family name, LZ gets to design genes and operons to let them express in Methanococcus in Barny’s lab. Hopefully, those ongoing gene designs, including the ones for UGA-iGEM team, would tap the great biosynthetic potential of Methanococcus as well as Archaea; hence help to address some of the most challenging problems such as energy crisis and environmental pollution in the 21st century.

Cultivation conditions
In general, microorganisms utilize three different methods to release electrons produced during the metabolic oxidation of high-energy organic or inorganic substrates. Because the reduction of oxygen, also called aerobic respiration, is the most efficient method for many bacteria, including Escherichia coli, these metabolic pathways are preferred when oxygen is available. In a microbial fuel cell, however, an aerobic metabolism is not desirable, since the electrons are directly transferred to oxygen and thereby cannot be used to produce current. Thus, anaerobic cultivation conditions are necessary.
Without oxygen, bacteria can generate energy through different forms of fermentation and anaerobic respiration. During fermentation and anaerobic respiration, electrons are directly transferred to soluble electron acceptors. In case of Escherichia coli, mixed acid fermentation under formation of metabolic end products like lactate, acetate and ethanol has to be avoided by the choice of suitable cultivation parameters. Their formation and accumulation would effect a comparatively limited electron production and hamper bacterial survival.
Based on these considerations, anaerobic respiration is left as the only suitable option for current generation in a fuel cell, when using the electrode as the terminal electron acceptor. For this reason, construction of the fuel cell, cultivation parameters as well as genetic modifications of Escherichia coli are aimed at enabling anaerobic respiration.
Requirements:
avoid aerobic respiration
avoid fermentation
accelerate anaerobic respiration
Measurement system and protocol
The setup described here is intended for acquiring comparable data regarding the power output gained with different bacteria strains while using mediators for the electron transfer.
When operating a microbial fuel cell, numerous different factors influence the power output that can be measured. Number and growth phase of the bacteria in the anode chamber are among the most important. The reaction taking place in the cathode is just as critical, since a bad setup can lead to the speed of the anode reaction significantly declining over time or not taking place at all. The properties of the proton exchange membrane and the electrodes are also quite important for the speed of the reaction.
Choosing an appropriate resistance is also vital. If the resistance is too high, reduced mediator species accumulate at the anode and the voltage measured does not provide information about how fast the bacteria are able to reduce the mediator. Other factors come into play as well: The diffusion speed of the mediator, diffusion of cations through the membrane, agitation of the solution and the buildup of a biofilm at the anode have an influence at the power output of the fuel cell.

Our System
Getting back at the Sleeping sickness by detecting it early.
We have designed an E. coli-based detection system that can be used for the diagnosis of Trypanosomiasis using patient serum polyclonal antibodies.
We created Antigen-43 and Ice Nucleation Protein constructs, to be expressed on the surface of E. coli, that carry an additional sequence of amino acids referred to as a ‘mimotope’. A mimotope (mimic epitope), functions as a target for disease-specific antibodies in the blood, which may be present due to an active immune response to a pathogen. Our system carries two different antigens that will allow the detection of an immune response to trypanosomes with minimal false positive results. The antibodies from the serum will are attached to a poly-lysine coated cuvete, or other appropriate surface before the introduction of the E.coli. This allows communication between a Quorum Sensing (QS) sender and receiver gene that causes the production of GFP when there are enough cells of each within close proximity to each other. A green fluorescence response indicates a positive disease diagnosis.
Antigen-43 (Ag43) and Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) are autotransporter proteins that are capable of localisation to the cell surface and forming their own protein complex to allow surface expression without the use of other proteins. One interesting feature of some autotransporters is that they have the capability to contain other large peptide sequences for cell-surface display without altering the final structure of either the autotranspotrer or the passenger. We have concentrated on creating ‘BioBrick’ versions of these for submission to the iGEM 2014 repository.
The Ag43 has had its PstI restriction sites removed to make it BioBrick compatible, with two Beta-hairpins removed to prevent cellular auto-aggregation. A BglII and HindIII restriction site has also been added for easy future insertions of desired sequences. We have also introduced a FLAG-tag to create a demonstrable ‘proof of concept’ for antibody aggregation-based detection. We intend to also create a His-tag version"

What’s more, we also interviewed Dr. Yunzi Luo, first PI of SCU-WestChina in 2017 iGEM, as well as an expert in synthetic biology field. She advised us to try other kinds of promoters for sgRNA expression, and we took her suggestion willingly.
Application
Our team has always focused on transforming scientific theories into practical technologies and solving the existing issue seen in the society. Thus, we tried to use CRISProgrammer in biosynthesis of indigo, which can solve the pollution problem of chemical synthesis and provide a better way to store and transport the engineered bacteria.
We are concerned about indigo because of a visit of a Xiangxi batik workshop. After that trip we knew that indigo is an important ancient dye and it is also the material of batik--an ancient folk traditional textile printing and dying craft in China. However, there are many shortcomings of the modern process of producing indigo. So we decided to find a better way to produce indigo, which means biosynthesis combining CRISProgrammer.
In all of the above mentioned interview, study and communication, we obtained information and assistance that pushed us forward and enabled us to complete our project step by step. Finally, through our own hard work and the generous help of others, we finished a thorough, complete project with practical value.

This technique uses a recombination enzyme native to bacteriophage P1, Cre recombinase, and lox sites that the recombinase targets (Watson et al., 2008). Typical Cre-lox recombination uses two identical loxP sites which may invert or delete the genomic information between them depending on lox site directionality (Juchheim, 2015). We found a publication by Watson et al. (2008) where they used two incompatible lox sites for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (Watson et al., 2008). In their genome, two incompatible lox sites flanked a selectable marker. The same two lox sites flanked the gene of interest in the plasmid.
Figure 4: Progesterone biosynthesis pathway optimized for use in yeast. Design idea came directly from Duport et al., and genes for enzymes and electron carriers were codon optimized for use in Y. lipolytica.
Using two incompatible lox sites allows the Cre recombinase to recombine only the sequence between the lox sites; we determined that this system may work to incorporate our genes of interest. Figure 4 shows how RMCE works with two incompatible lox sites in the context of our experiment. We will use BioBrick loxP (BBa_J61046) and lox71. To confirm that Cre-lox has worked, we will engineer the selectable marker ura3 between the lox sites in the genome, and grow the transformed strain on uracil-enriched 5-FOA media to ensure only transformed colonies are viable.
Since we were uncertain of the size of the gene insert we could reasonably incorporate using RMCE, we contacted the authors of the article, Dr. Adam Watson and Dr. Tony Carr of the University of Sussex. They informed us that we could insert our genes of interest with little difficulty, as they previously used RMCE to insert up to 16 kb fragments with no decrease in efficiency.
After much consideration, we decided to use both Cre-lox recombination and HR in parallel experiments to determine which method yields the most recombinants. We will use"

The AzoF-variants do not seem to influence the lycopene production when no amber-codon is present in crtI. Concluding, we provided strong evidence that that the observed difference in lycopene production in the three variants is caused by the incorporation and photoswitching of AzoF.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

5 Meritorious Projects: Wiki
Completely lost when you are looking for some specific information in a wiki? Paris 2011 says a good navigation system would help. Though text and photos are garbled at the front-page , this wiki enjoys an elegant design in its navigation bar, which is not only informative, but also convenient for users from all kinds of backgrounds.
Paris Bettencourt 2011
As for the elegant wiki of Washington 2011, people would be touched by first sight. Explicit illustration at frontpage not only avoids prolonged texture and makes the whole page more compact, but also eased the tension of serious scientific research. If you want an eye-catching and informative wiki, this is it!
Washington 2011
Other styles also convey their stories effectively, such as the wiki of Imperial College London 2011. The introduction of a rotating gallery containing each individual module of the whole wiki also saves space, but this format requires inclusive consideration on timing, picture choosing and more efficient wording.
Imperial College London 2011
Aesthetics is another core element come to a wiki constructor’s mind. And the wiki of Heidelberg in 2009 serves as a good example. The usage of pure-color squares and the combination of carefully aligned, differently sized squares gives out an impression of well organization and explicitness.
Heidelberg 2009
Well, a wiki does not come out of nowhere. Good coding not only guarantees a good wiki website but also facilitates those who want to learn from the wiki’s construction. For those teams who wrote their own codes and constructed their own system of wiki, their wiki should be highly appreciated and honored. By the way, this year, Peking's Wiki System is also written by ourselves, character by character!

Sharing our experimental materials on the iShare platform of Nankai_China！
This is the first time Nankai University iGEM team asked our team for help. They asked us to join their iShare platform, in which all iGEM teams could find the resource and material. We shared the resources and materials through an excel, which includes all the Biobricks and cells information about our project. We strongly support the iShare platform created by Nankai iGEM. Fortunately, SZU-iGEM is the first team to share information in the iGEM teams. We have only one purpose to join Nankai iGEM iShare, which is to make our best efforts to help each team, so that we can share resources with iShare as soon as possible. We helped NanKai University iGEM with the resource sharing of iShare. In return, they gave us these badges as a reward.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter; the fluorescent proteins were digested using Xba1 and Pst1 in order to remove the insert. A ligation was then carried out using standard assembly protocol and the ligation products were transformed into E. coli competent cells, which in turn were grown on agar plates 2.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol (due to pSB1C3 containing chloramphenicol resistance).
In order to quickly identify colonies of bacteria containing the promoter, RBS and reporter in a likely correct sequence a range of colonies were inoculated into media also containing potassium nitrate (KNO3) solution; this was done in order to inhibit the Nar repressor in PyeaR and result in activation of the promoter/induction of transcription/expression of the fluorescent protein reporter. Samples of the inoculated media containing KNO3 were then added to an eppendorf and spun down to form a pellet, which was viewed under a UV box and observed for fluorescence. After a week of various ligation and transformation experiments both promoters were successfully ligated to both fluorescent proteins and fluorescence of eCFP and RFP was observed under a UV box.
From these experiments four more BioBricks were produced and submitted to the registry: B-M + eCFP , B-M + RFP , M-B + eCFP , and M-B + RFP .
In order to characterise the hybrid promoters ligated to fluorescent proteins a number of experiments were carried out to measure the level of fluorescent output at different concentrations of KNO3 (used to induce the promoter's activity). All of these experiments were carried out in week eleven
Qualitative Results
Figure 8.A photograph of spun-down media containing potassium nitrate (to induce the hybrid promoters) and E. coli transformed by M-B + eCFP. The concentrations of potassium nitrate added to the media were, from left to right: 100 mM, 50 mM, 10 mM, 0 mM.
This figure appears to show fluorescence from the spun-down pellets of each hybrid promoter + fluorescent protein that had been grown in media contain potassium nitrate; it can be inferred from this that the potassium nitrate has induced the hybrid promoter, resulting in expression of the fluorescent protein reporter. The negative control of 0 mM potassium nitrate appears to show no fluorescence, suggesting it is indeed the potassium nitrate that is inducing the promoter.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Project Overview
HIV is a global problem. By the end of 2015, approximately 36.7 million people were living with HIV. Of those, 2.1 million people became newly infected. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region in the world. In this region, 25.6 million people (~71% of all HIV infected patients) are living with HIV (WHO).
Worldwide, over 50% of people who have HIV do not know their status (UNAIDS). This is a significant problem because late diagnosis is a major cause of late antiretroviral therapy uptake; such treatment patterns contribute to the overall mortality and morbidity rates of this deadly disease. In sub-Saharan Africa specifically, only 45% of people who have HIV know their status while 86% of people who know their status seek out treatment (UNAIDS). There is a significant  portion of people in this region who do not know their status and would seek treatment if they did. So why do more people not get tested?
Current diagnostic tests include ELISAs, flow cytometry, and PCR assays. The average cost per client varies between $5 USD and $1367 USD depending on if the patient is HIV positive or negative (Bautista-Arredondo et al). This is a significant problem when on average contract workers in the region make $0.67/hr USD and the median average hourly wage is $0.53/hr USD ("

It can be seen that the histidine-tagged fusion protein was successfully expressed. Lane 2 showed the band corresponded with the molecular weight of TupA(57.3kDa), while lane 4 had no band.
We added a histine-tag at the C terminal of the TupA protein so that histidine-tagged affinity column chromatography can be performed. Besides the histine-tag could be an antibody recognition site, and there are many prepared antibody on sale. Some protein like TupA has slim studies on it. and there is no prepared antibody on sale. Once with his-tag, we can do Western Blot and other technique based on antigen-antibody reaction. The research on TupA’s expression is more smooth."

CPAC method doesn’t leave any scars in the cloning and no gel purification is required, only PCR and gel running is required. Perhaps the method will be taught sometime later in the week to the whole group. One modification is that instead of using E0030, Venus will be used. PSB1C3 will be arriving on Friday. Transformation after ligation was done today, colonies will be seen tomorrow. Starting another set of regular cloning in case CPAC doesn’t work, from digestion/ligation/transformation. -Adi: Alex will be arriving this weekend. The entrepreneurship wiki should be done in approximately 2 weeks. Adi will e-mail Mark from Octochem about a chemical needed for the PHAT project. -Anthony: Digested, extracted, and ligated PCR of pBAD and wild type PUF PCR. Transformed today and will plate, hopefully there will be colonies tomorrow. -Uros: Continued to investigate how to tether PUF to a correct split-GFP sequence. Asked Angela for further information on the UNC paper in order to receive more information where on PUF was the tether placed. Proceeded to e-mail the graduate student who helped collaborate and give advice for the RNA Scaffold synthesis about the split-GFP sequence used in the paper (Pam Silver paper). E-mailed Dr. Bourde, the principal investigator of the lab which was referenced in the Pam Silver paper, concerning split-GFP work for either the sequence or possible part shipment. E-mailed Todd in order to get more information or suggestions on where to head with the tethering project. Also, Todd might offer insight whether it is still feasible to produce the construct ourselves before August and so we could save money before synthesis. Been trying to find a trustworthy source for the split-GFP sequence and have found two sources. One of them being from a past iGEM team and the other from a research article. For Friday an update will be presented to the advisors along with a list of options which can be pursued, one of which will be decided upon collectively. An e-mail was forwarded from Courtney, sent by IDT, that the RNA scaffold gene is still in production and everything is being done so it could be properly made. Any other product ordered along with the scaffold should be asked to be sent immediately due to the unpredictable completion time of it.  -Cara/Bob: Cara and Bob made smaller aliquots of freshly made LB media and put them into the 50mL con"

5. Load microplate. Distribute the cellulase dilution series  (from step 4) in separate wells of a microplate (50 µL per well),  Add 50 µL of digestion buffer to a separate well to serve as a  buffer-only control. To each test and control well add 50 µL of  EnzChek® cellulase substrate working solution (from step 3) and  mix well. Duplicates or triplicates are recommended. Incubate for  30 minutes at room temperature, protected from light. Incubation  times may vary; see Protocol Details.
6. Measure the fluorescence using a microplate reader. Excitation and emission maxima are 339 (shoulder at 360 nm) and 452 nm, respectively. Excitation/emission settings of 360/460 nm  are optimal for this substrate.
7. Use a standard curve to determine cellulase activity. For the  cellulase standards, plot amount vs. fluorescence, and fit a line to  the data points. Sample standard curves are given in Figure 1.
File:M1 Assay2005 Fig1.jpg
Protocol considerations
Reagent dilutions
The digestion buffer described herein is recommended for  detecting the activity of most cellulases complexes with activity  optima from pH 4.5 to 6.0 using the EnzChek® cellulase substrate.  Buffers other than this may be acceptable, although assay perfor-  mance will be adversely affected at pH values below 4.5.
Sample volumes
The assay has been optimized for 100 µL total well volumes.  We recommend preparing enzyme standard and sample dilutions  in volumes of at least 0.5 mL, which are then distributed to indi-  vidual wells of the microplate.
Assay times and temperatures
The assay temperature is “room temperature,” defined here as  20–25°C. Assay temperatures outside of this range have not been  tested, but may be acceptable. The assay described here has been  optimized for a 30 minute incubation period. Sensitivities may be  increased by incubating longer. Conversely, if high sensitivity is not  required, incubation times may be reduced. We recommend incu-  bations of at least 5 minutes. The exact incubation period is not  critical. However, it is important that all reactions being compared  in the experiment are incubated for the same time.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the team on this page.  They must distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
Thus we declare that the planning and organization of an iGEM Team in Freiburg 2011 was done solely by us students. Furthermore,  the complete setup and installation of the lab, the wiki,  all the ideas for all areas of our project and all labwork  was exclusively done by the members of the iGEM Team Freiburg.
Sven Fischer
a short time team member who left us at an early state of the iGEM Project. Thanks to him, we could use the 3D protein prediction from DNA sequence web-tool I-TASSER http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ with which we did the rational modelling for the Precipitator protein.
ATG:biosynthetics
The company sponsored us the synthesis of the Precipitator protein and additionally a sequence optimization, to adjust the codon usage in a way that there is just the right polymerase concentration on the RNA.

TU_Delft,2010,Team:TU Delft#Lablog_-_-_TEXT.html,"For E2 medium this is the recipe that we use:
(NH4)2HPO4  10   g
K2HPO4            5   g
Na2SO4            0.5g
1 ml of MT stock solution
1 ml of 1M MgSO4
Water, as much as you need for 1 L of culture medium
If you want to prepare the solid medium, add 15 g of agar per liter of medium.
This medium is really minimal, you can choose your own carbon source. Some literature recommend to use citrate, glucose, glycerol and, for our case, hydrocarbons. E2 medium is not complete without the following solution:
MT stock solution
FeSO4 7H2O        2.8 g
MnCl2                  0.19g
CoCl2 6H2O        2.8 g
CaCl2 4H2O         1.84g
ZnSO4 7H2O      0.28 g
CuSO4                 0.16g
WARNING: Dear iGEM people be aware that the original E2 composition is the following (Lageveen et al., 1988):
KH2PO4 3.7 g
K2HPO4 7.5 g
NaNH4HPO4.4H2O 3.5 g
Citrate 5 g / 12 g
1 M MgSO4 . 7H2O 1 ml
MT stock solution 1 ml
and the original MT stock solution composition is:
FeSO4.7H2O 2.8 g
MnSO4.H2O 2 g
CoCl2.6H2O 2.8 g
CaCl2.2H2O  1.48 g
ZnSO4.7H2O 0.28 g
CuCl2.2H2O 0.16 g
Why did we change the medium?
First, we lack of the weird salt NaNH4HPO4.4H2O, we want to save some money by making some engineering in the culture medium. Instead of the main salts for E2 we are using the salts recommended by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in the optimal medium for Ps. putida, this mineral medium is also known as P1. Find the original medium composition here .
Second, we decided to keep the MT stock solution because,"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

"
Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview_-_-_TEXT.html," requires RNA samples which are degraded by RNases in the body and even if it is not, it requires a well equipped laboratory to prevent further degradation.Therefore, this method cannot be used reliably in  many parts of the world (especially in underdeveloped countries).
Another technique to detect pathogens through their DNA is DNA-hybridization, but the downside with this method is that it is labor intensive and involves the use of radio-labelled probes.
Detection by Microscopy
As mentioned before, microscopy has been the mainstay for detection of pathogenic fungi. This is primarily due to the fact that it is one of the oldest and most widely available means of detection. It only requires a microscope, a stain for contrast, the sample from a patient and a user with some experience. Furthermore, this technique requires neither the consideration of multiple parameters (such as in a PCR) nor much time (agar plate cultures need at least a day) to yield results.
Thus, we believe that improving detectability through microscopy by giving it the advantage of molecular biology (specificity and a better scope for visualization) while maintaining the advantages of conventional microscopy.

Induction of expression of CaDXMT1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the start of the expression of CaDXMT1. This is the third and last gene, neccessary for caffeine- synthesis (previous transformation experiments did not work).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the OD600 of the over night culture was determined: 4,42 (0,442 at 1/10 dilution). Next, 200ml of SC-U 2% galactose medium were inoculated with an adequate amount of the over night culture (has grown in SC-U 2% glucose). Note: Not the whole amount of the calculated over night culture was centrifuged down. Thus, about 12 ml of glucose medium were given to the galactose medium. In theory, the expression will start a"

Creating Inexpensive and Reusable Plates
Project Timeline: Click on an image to see more information
The equipment and supplies required to sterilize and make plates are expensive and not usually available to a high school lab.  We attempted to create plates which could easily be sterilized by a microwave or bleach.
Scintered Plastic Plates
Scintered Plastic Supplier: SPC technologies Ltd.
We used 3 types of scintered plastic:
3.0mm Ultra-Fine PE sheet(14um pore-size)
ultra-fine grade should be a bacterial barrier
6.0mm Fine-Grade PE Sheet(30um pore-size)
fine grade should also be a bacterial barrier but it was too hard to cut
4.5mm Medium Grade PE Sheet(88um pore-size)
Procedure:
tested plastic's ability to absorb LB
June 22, 2010 - added 10ml of LB and 40ul chloramphenicol to plates made from the 3.0mm and 4.5mm scintered plastics.  Incubated in a 37C warm room overnight.
June 23, 2010 - 7ml LB left in 3.0mm ultra-fine and 8ml left in 4.5mm medium-grade
Streaking on Plastic
June 23, 2010 - streaked both types of scintered plastic with RFP-containing colonies(after transferring plastic into new petri dishes).  Left in 37C warm room overnight.
June 24, 2010 - no growth after incubation, plastic was very dry

The main concern with this method is that it has not yet been tested extensively to prove its value as a standard method of Biobrick assembly.
Parts for protein expression
Protein Expression
As with any other gene sequences and parts, it was important to consider how to control the rate of expression for the protein, i.e. induce transcription of the insert and subsequent translation. Different promoter sequences are often incorporated upstream of the gene of interest to allow RNA polymerase a site to bind to in which to start transcription. Likewise ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are added downstream of the promoter to allow ribosomes to attach to the transcribe mRNA sequence. Depending on the promoter and RBS used, the level of expression for the protein can change anywhere from being produced in abundance or having little produced at all.
In our project we decided to use the IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) inducible promoter with RBS (Part:BBa J04500). The complex is made up of the LacI regulated promoter found naturally in E.coli and an rbs based off of a repressilator.
Promoter
The promoter used is the natural promoter from the LacZYA operon. It contains two protein binding sites; the first is for the CAP protein which is found in E.coli and associated with cell health and glucose supply. The second site binds LacI protein which is expressed to inhibit expression of the Lac operon when no lactose is present. In the absence of the CAP protein and LacI, the promoter will increase transcription. However, the promoter is naturally constitutive (meaning that by default it is in an ON state) in E.coli strains that have low expression of LacI proteins (such as Top 10). Because of this fact and prior experience with the part, we decided to keep using this promoter. In theory (and most likely practice) any other constitutive promoter part would have sufficed for our project.
A crucial fact to note is that this part is incompatible in species containing active LacI coding regions and environments containing lactose and lactose analogs. The former reason is because active LacI expression will limit the efficiency of the promoter, the later because the presence of lactose would continuously activate the promoter. Therefore these factors were considered before adoption of this promoter.

SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!

Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antis"

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," engender a multitude of possible statements coming from different pockets of knowledge. For instance, synthetic biology for the prevention of azo dye pollution, consists of not only of the dual discourses of innovation versus security, but also of questions regarding its economic and ecological implications, its (bio)ethics, and the sophistication of the technical features (Hajer 2000). For this study, I will consider the UCL iGEM team as an actor that produces a particular discourse within environmental politics. Notwithstanding this specific 'mode of talking', they somehow need to learn to communicate with a wide variety of actors who force them to diversify their discursive practices in order to gain prominence within the iGEM competition. And so this implies that they have to fully engage themselves with their project on a highly 'inter-discursive' level. (Hajer 2000: 46).
Glossary
Anticipatory socialisation: Adopting norms, values, standards and behaviour of a group, which non-members of the group aspire to join. Through social interactions and experience, these individuals learn to take on the role they have yet to assume in order to facilitate their assimilation and eventual participation in the group (Marshall 1998).
Black-boxing: Ignoring or not paying attention to the internal workings of a scientific or technological achievement, or as Bruno Latour describes it, ""the way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become"" (Latour 1999).
Commodification: Making a commodity out of goods, services, ideas or other entities that are usually not considered as salable things. This concept from Marxist political theory describes a process where market values are attributed to something that did not have such economic or commercial value before, and therefore sometimes replace certain social values.
Cross-borderness of synthetic biology:The simultaneous crossing of borders of scientific disciplines, industrial sectors and geopolitical areas. Various difficulties may arise from this as different notions of what knowledge is, come together and encounter various challenges in governance measures.
Deskilling synthetic biology: Making synthetic biology more accessible as practitioners do not need some of the skills in molecular biology to work on it. This has given rise to 'Do It Yourself' biology as an expression of citizen or amateur science (Calvert 2013).

Molecular Biology and Chemistry
About me
I am Ukrainian and I have been living in Denmark for about 8 years. I have finished international high school IB (International Baccalaureate) at Nørre Gymnasium. Then I went to study at Roskilde University, where I received a Bachelor degree in Molecular Biology and Chemistry. Currently I am taking Masters in Biotechnology at DTU. I am mostly interested in Biomedical Microbiology and that is why I follow this study line. In my spare time I enjoy travelling, reading good books and spending time with my friends and family, especially by making “movies and dinner” times, etc. I am also going to a gym and doing other sports on regular basis.

About me
I am original from Germany, but now I lived in Denmark for about 14 years and I like it ;-) I started to study Medicine at Aarhus University, just to find out that I, instead of treating patients, like more to do research on the causes of a given disease. That is why I have taken a bachelors degree in Molecular Biomedicine at Copenhagen University and now continue with my master studies at DTU. Bacteria are my love and therefore I want to specialize in Biomedical Microbiology. Besides bacteria, my academic focus is on immunology, medicine, antibiotic resistance and infection mechanisms, but also what it means to conduct good science and experimental set-ups incl. scientific writing. I am going to write my master thesis at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the USA and I am really looking forward to this! In my"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"
Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#miRNA Kit_-_-_TEXT.html," that is specifically expressed in the target cells/tissue. In consequence, the TetR is knocked down, releasing the promoter and enabling specific GOI expression.
Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short endogenous, non-coding RNAs that mediate gene expression in a diversity of organisms (Bartel, 2004) . Although the understanding of their biological functions is progressing remarkably, the exact mechanisms of regulation are still not unambiguously defined. However, it is commonly believed that miRNAs trigger target mRNA regulation by binding to 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of its target (Chekulaeva and Filipowicz, 2009) .  Exact principles of expression knockdown mediated by miRNA are still in debate (Eulalio et al., 2008) .
However, sequence depending binding site properties have an essential impact on miRNA-mRNA interaction.  Depending on pairing specificity translational repression is mediated through the imperfect miRNA-mRNA hybrids. The potential for stringent regulation of transgene expression makes the miRNA world a promising area of gene therapy (Brown et al.,2009) . There is a need for tight control of gene expression, since cellular processes are sensitive to expression profiles. Non-mediated gene expression can lead to fatal dysfunction of molecular networks. It is widely known, that miRNAs can adjust such fluctuations (Brenecke et al., 2005) . A combination of random and rational design of binding sites could become a powerful tool to achieve a narrow range of resulting gene expression knockdown. To ease in silico construction of miRNA binding sites with appropriate characteristics for its target, we wrote a program - the miBS designer . Using all of our theoretical models gives the user the opportunity to calculate knockdown percentages caused by the designed miRNA in the target cell.  Our synthetic miRNA Kit guarantees at least for individually modifiable but still ready-to-use constructs to interfere genetic circuits with synthetic or endogenous miRNAs. We preciously show, that gene expression can thereby by adjusted - tuned - to an arbitrary level. The miTuner (see sidebar) allows on the simultaneous expression of a synthetic miRNA and a gene of interest that is fused with a designed binding site for this specific miRNA. Our modular kit comes with different parts that can be combined by choice, e. g. different mammalian promoters and characterized binding sites of specific properties. By choosing a certain binding site to tag the GOI, one can tune the expression of this gene. Depending on the GOI, different means for read out of gene expression come into"

Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require a high initial startup cost, technical agility, time investment and more educational investment to learn how to correctly manufacture the chips.
After manufacturing their device, the synthetic biologist can then move onto implementation and testing. However, there are many difficulties that may arise when testing a device. For example, certain chips may require some external apparatus, such as off-chip metering or electronic components. These can vary from design to design, adding additional costs and time investment in learn how to use them.
Even after investing time and money into this microfluidics workflow, success is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and testing microfluidic devices was experienced first-hand by the BostonU HW Team. While replicating chips from journal articles, similarly to our synthetic biologist, we noted three repeated issues:
Lack of thorough documentation of experimental procedures
High level of design specificity and a lack accessibility of design files
Lack of standard evaluation system to grade devices against
As a result, the final chip manufactured cannot be run correctly due to lack of protocol documentation. Additionally, it is not possible to use a quantitative system of evaluation to ensure the device is working as intended. We have classified these limitations as barriers in the “implementation” stage of the microfluidics workflow.
Our Project
The CIDAR Lab at Boston University has tackled many of these design and manufacture shortcomings with an easy to use software workflow, including last year's iGEM Hardware project Neptune , and a low-cost rapid prototyping manufacturing system Makerfluidics . However, this system does not address the barriers we had identified under “Implementation” which limits the accessibility of microfluidics to everyday synthetic biology labs.
This year’s iGEM Team, decided to focus on removing these barriers in the implementation stage of the workflow which led to the creation of our project MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio).
MARS aims to increase the accessibility and relevance of microfluidics to synthetic biology through three defined goals:
Increase the ease of access of microfluidics to synbiologists
Design chips relevant for day to day use in synthetic biology
Create a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These goals have been built on and expanded to create the three branches of MARS which are:
Microfluidics 101
The MARS Repository

The current problem
  
  Information is not complete in partsregistry.org
    When the partsregistry.org was established at first, it is worth to be called the authority of the BioBricks. But as time goes by, more and more BioBricks are added in, now partsregistry.org becomes less satisfy. Information of many BioBricks are incomplete, some even wrong. Because every one can submit one's BioBrick as long as one logs in, many information is informal since the website doesn't examine the information users submit. This would waste resource as well as mess up the database.
    Moreover, the layout of the website becomes more unclear as the database becomes larger and larger. For example, the Catalog. In this page, BioBricks are classified according to many different criteria. But the interface style in one section is far different from it in another section. Sometimes it is the description of a project, sometimes it becomes BioBrick list. A large list will be prsented in front of users with hundreds of BioBricks, but no search tool is available for users to search for the BioBrick that they really want. All of these would increase the difficulty for users to find the information that they want. For example, in the following figure, no list for Translational units can be found while others have long lists.
  
    
  
This BioBrick is totally useless but it is still on the BioBrick list. This shows that the uploading of BioBricks should be standardized.
  
    
  
  Information is not useful in database
    We got a database that contains all the information about all the BioBricks. In this database, every BioBrick has 40 properties, they are:
  
    With these long list, nobody has the patience to look through them all. Indeed many properties are rubbish. Look at the property No.34-No.37, they are completely useless because they are apparently not a part of information of a BioBrick. Another example is property No.14, specified_scar_u_list. This property is NULL, which means it contains no information, for nearly all the BioBricks. We draw a histogram to demonstrate the percentage of unqualified and qualified BioBricks.
  
  
  
    Explanation of the above histogram:
                               x-axis:    1 - number o properties whose information is NULL for more 3000 BioBricks (our database contains 13442 BioBricks).

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Features_-_-_TEXT.html,"-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our Core Program designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli genes. However, according to Peking 2012, mutated version of LexA could solve this problem.
Cph8 ( BBa_I15010 ) is a fusion of Cph1 red photoreceptor domain (660nm) and EnvZ histidine kinase domain. In absence of red light, EnvZ is active and it phosphorylates endogenous OmpR which in turn activates OmpC promoter ( BBa_R0082 ). Red light activates Cph1 which inhibits EnvZ kinase domain function. However, as both EnvZ, OmpR and OmpC are endogenous in E. coli, reliable use would require EnvZ deficient strain. The activation Cph1 requires Phycocyanobilin which can be produced with heme oxygenase ( BBa_I15008 ) and ferrodoxin oxidoreductase ( BBa_I15009 ). The Cph8 was described by Levskaya et al. (2005) and they achieved nearly 10-fold induction. However, as EnvZ and OmpR are involved in indigenous osmolarity response, phosphorylated OmpR might also interfere with promoters encoding membrane porins.
CcaS ( BBa_K592001 ) is a cyanobacteriochrome that gets activated by autophosphorylation. This is upregulated by green light (535nm). The activated CcaS phosphorylates its response regulator CCaR ( BBa_K592002 ) which then induces the promoter PcpcG2 (Hirose et al., 2008; Tabor et al., 2011). As Cph8 system, this light receptor also requires Phycocyanobilin to function. In addition, CcaS is inactivated in red light (672nm) allowing higher degree of control and fast response times. According to the experiments by Tabor et al. (2011), the promoter PcpcG2 showed only 2-fold induction in green light. The transcription response is somewhat linear to the light intensity of 0.01 W/m2 after which it rapidly saturates. Although CcaR and CcaS BioBricks are indeed available although the experiences of other iGEM teams were very few and poorly described.
YF1 Light Sensor
YF1 ( BBa_K592004 ) is an engineered blue light (previous experiments in 430nm) sensor protein that consists of two initially separate domains, LOV domain (sensory domain) from YtvA and histidine kinase domain (effector domain) from FixL. This fusionprotein was"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Peru is a predominantly Catholic society, many Peruvians don’t support the use of birth control in general. In most cases, those in need of birth control are the ones who can’t afford it. In addition to cost, access to birth control is an issue. According to Guillermo, Peruvians “have social services available to help, but no outreach programs since many women live in the mountains of Peru away from the capital”. Peru is also a male-dominated society, and many husbands/boyfriends “don’t believe in birth control and are against it out of ignorance”. Possibly because of this, Peru has an extremely high rate of illegal abortions. Guillermo explained that “women die all the time” from illegal abortions; in the year 2000, 35% of pregnancies ended in abortion [4] . Interestingly enough, he wonders if the design of our product would entice women to try it. The most common form of birth control in Peru is birth control pills, which are easy to identify given their recognizable packaging. Our product would grow as a yeast, and the user could press the dried yeast herself to form a pill. This process is less recognizable than normal birth control pills and may be appealing for women who face a male-dominated society that doesn’t approve of birth control use. This viewpoint hadn’t been considered by our team before, and we now hope to incorporate this angle into our development and advertisement of our new birth control method.
Russia
Misha, Former Russian Citizen
Misha is a woman who spent the first part of her life in Soviet Russia. She tried for many years to obtain any form of birth control but only received her first IUD after having her first child at age 19. She couldn’t afford to purchase condoms, and most couples opted not to use any forms of contraception. Russia’s government did not encourage or supply cheap contraceptives. For a time, inexpensive abortions were available at state hospitals. Most women were aware of this and expected to have one to three abortions in their lifetimes. Abortion clinics shut down after a few years, which led to many Russian women to obtain illegal abortions, most of which were ineffective or dangerous. We didn’t realize the prevalence of illegal abortions in Russia and we hope to legalize our birth control method in Russia to prevent the need for these abortions.

In the spirit of iGEM we wished to continue applications of the work done by the Oxford 2016 iGEM team making agarose beads. This would apply well to delivering bacteria to cattle because the bacteria will remain encapsulated inside the beads during shipment yet when it is inside the cow the protein will still be able to diffuse out. The bacteria and its required substrates would be put inside the agarose beads and added as a top dress onto the basal diet of the cattle.
After this we would have used our connections at UNL to visit the Mead Research Center and test our E. coli on cows there to see the results in vivo.

I also found a basic tutorial on getting images to display on the cubes  By following the tutorial, I was able to get a series of letters to display on the Sifteo cubes.
Week of June 4
June 4: Today, our lab visited the Microsoft New England Research and Development Center. There, Edwin and Chris demonstrated Windows 8 running on the Samsung Slate tablet computer.
June 6: The first part of the day was a lecture by Natalie Kuldell explaining some of the basics of synthetic biology. Professor Kuldell showed us a video of the 2006 MIT team presenting their iGEM project called Eau d'E coli. During Professor Kuldell's presentation, the issue of ethics and problems of regulation were also brought up. For instance, people making decisions about synthetic biology are generally uninformed. Also, because the field is so new, there is no government regulation for synthetic biology research. After Professor Kuldell's talk, we had a safety briefing about general lab safety. The later part of the day was spent completing 2 experiments in the lab. We split into pairs, with one inexperienced person paired up with someone with lab experience. I worked with Kara and learned how to use an automatic pipette and other lab equipment.

Decarboxylation
Why Decarboxylation?
Among the toxins found in the tailing ponds, naphthenic acids (NAs) are among the most harmful and the most common. Though there is great diversity within the NAs class of compounds, all share the common chemical feature of a carboxylic acid group. The carboxyl group is the primary cause for their toxicity, allowing these chemicals to traverse cell membranes and react with cellular materials (Frank et al. 2009). NAs are recalcitrant (not easily degraded), potentially harmful to the surrounding ecosystem (Clemente & Fedorak, 2005) and corrosive to extraction and transport equipment of petroleum materials (Slavcheva et al. 1999).  Corrosion of pipelines leads to higher maintenance costs as well as the grim possibility of these and other toxins leaking into the environment.   There is"

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#RichardNotebook#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"FX. And that's where the rest of my week went- JavaFX looks great and runs fast, BUT YOU CAN'T CALL IT FROM JAVA. At least not directly, but the hacks I've found so far don't work with the latest version of the SDK, which came out just a couple weeks ago. I do have a working standalone demo that apparently calls JavaFX code as a script, but so far I can't make it work with Clotho. -- Legor17 06:07, 16 June 2009 (UTC)
Week Three - 6/15
Monday Half of the comp team did presentations on their projects; Joanna and I were up today for Clotho's visualization tool. We'll have something like a drag-and-drop toolbox/sandbox setup, with the workspace in the middle and a palette of parts as a side panel.
Integrating the JavaFX demo into Clotho has been a major headache. It completely breaks Clotho when we use Substance 4.1 (a pretty GUI skinning library), and while the latest Substance release doesn't crash, the JavaFX demo plugin crashes.
Thursday The past few days of working on a JavaFX solution are now moot. We did get a decent mockup of the GUI on Wednesday, so it wasn't all for naught. Today I did some more digging for a Swing solution, and I stumbled across an article that shows how to use the NetBeans Visual Library API outside of a NetBeans Module. It irks me that I didn't find it until now, as that would've saved me a lot of time banging my head against a wall over JavaFX. On the bright side, we now have a working drag and drop JScrollPane as a Clotho plugin, and we may soon be able to borrow some components (namely the thumbnail panel and the drag 'n' drop to the workspace feature of blueMarine .
-- Legor17 00:40, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
Week Four - 6/22
Quick recap of the weekend: we're still working on getting the new ClothoPlugin class to play nice. I'm fiddling with the Visual Library's MoveStrategy interface to make a snap-able grid for widgets. I still need to figure out what I need to do to handle what happens after a widget is re-arranged or dropped on the grid. I did manage to solve the resizing issue with the JScrollPane; the trick was to set the GraphScene's LayerWidget's size to the JScrollPane and to account for the JScrollPane's insets.

However, the results of culture in 96 well plat were unstable due to the low culture system. Hence, the red colour of the 30 鈩?and 37 鈩?culture were compared and the best cultures were streaked on the LB agar plate, and incubated at 37 鈩?and 30 鈩?for 18 h separately. (Figure 3.) The degree of red was compared, and again the best performed samples were shake in 150 ml flasks at 20 ml system. The fluorescence of the shaking flasks were tested and compared.
Figure 3. Streaked plate of different RNATs at 30 鈩?and 37鈩? (F3: JB1F3, F4: JB1F4, G1: JB1G1, G2: JB1G2, G3: JB1G4, G3: JB1G4, H1: JB1_H1, J23119 mut, J23119 PC: positive control)
Results
The Result of the fluorescence of different RNAT at 26 鈩?and 37 鈩? (Figure 4.) As is shown on the graph, the natural RNAT A is too strong to even express the MRFP. Normally, the positive control (no anti-SD and poly A) showed no significant difference between 26 鈩?and 37 鈩? The mutation of RNAT truly improve the performance of RNAT up to 4.5 times difference and increase the expression level of Mrfp. These RNAT were sequenced, and the sequence are shown in Table 2.

The test of RNAT library is still on going. The future plan is to find out the RNAT with lower leakage and higher expression. Also we want to further test the performance of the RNAT using different reporter genes such as GFP and luciferase to find out the most rebut RNAT.
