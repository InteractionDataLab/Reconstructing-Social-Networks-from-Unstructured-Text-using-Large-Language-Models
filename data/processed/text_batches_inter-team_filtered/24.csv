Stochastic reactions
In a stochastic reaction, each reaction is defined by the rate and chemical components. To simulate a reaction, you have to know how much of each reactant there is plus how probable it is for the reaction to happen. The chemical components can be divided into two classes:
Non-diffusive
Diffusive
Non-diffusive components are proteins, markers, and genes, which do not leave the cell. They may be treated as being present only inside of the cell’s center, i.e., programmatically speaking, each biological cell remembers how many molecules of each component there are.
Diffusive components are a bit trickier, because they are not linked to the cell interior but rather to the environment itself. During each step, a routine is run to determine how many molecules of a diffusive component are currently present in the cell's close surroundings.
In some simulations, you may need reactions inside the cell, but not diffusive components. To save your resources, diffusive reactions are an optional extension, which may or may not be included in your simulation.
Propensity
Each reaction is described by the reactants, the rate, and when talking stochastically, the probability that the reaction happens in the following moments. Usually, a reaction is described by a probability measure called propensity, which is the probability that the reaction fires in the infinitesimal time dt. To simulate a system of chemical reactions, we  need to know how to compute the propensity for simple reactions
Birth
\(\varnothing \Rightarrow k_A \Rightarrow A\), propensity \(k_A\)
Death
\(A \Rightarrow d_A \Rightarrow \varnothing\), propensity \(d_A A\)
Two component
\(A + B \Rightarrow k_{AB} \Rightarrow C\), propensity \(k_{AB} A B\)
Probability of the birth reaction is constant, it depends only on its rate, but the probability that something dies increases with the amount of things that can die (the more A's, the higher the probability of any of them dying). Similarly, the probability that something collides increases with amounts of both of things that can collide.
It is often useful to write down reactions in terms of a stoichiometric matrix. This matrix’s rows correspond to reactions and columns to species. Each row says how much of a change in species numbers there is if the linked reaction happens. For example consider the following reaction system:
\(\varnothing \Rightarrow k_A"

Fig.8 Sequenc comparison of the mutants
It can be observed that mutations at the semiconserved region of PmerT promoter significantly influenced the response behavior of MerR/PmerT pair(Fig.7). It is probably because that the mutations alter the binding affinity between MerR and PmerT promoter. As a result of this, different sensitivity (higher or lower than the wild-type) PmerT promoters were gained by us. More details about these mutants suffixed with GFP(BBa_E0840) were described in the parts BBa_K346020 - BBa_K346025.

RBS(B0032)+MBP(mercury metal binding peptide engineered from MerR)
This part is a combination of a rbs, a mbp, the coding sequence of a mercury metal binding peptide egineered from MerR.It was designed to function as mercury(II) binding peptide in our project.It is expressed in the cytosol and when fused with the periplasm protein Dsba or the membrane protein lpp-ompa, it will be expressed and translocated to the periplasm and membrane.In short, this part function as the fundamental metal binding peptide of mercury in our project.
Part:BBa_K346003: main introduction
MerR, the mercury-responsible transcription factor(figure on the left), acts as an effective mercury accumulator in aquatic environment.However, as a transcription regulator, over-expression of MerR in bacteria may lead to some unpredictable side effect. Earlier work suggested that the truncated peptide only consisting of the metal binding domain can form a stable dimer with its mercury binding affinity remained and DNA binding domain and metal binding domain can function individually.Based on all these above and carefully structure analysis of MerR via 3D structure modeling, we directly tandemed two copies of metal binding domain of MerR together, to implement a mercury metal binding peptide (MBP) as is shown in the figure on the right.
The figure shows the structure of MerR and MBP. The left figure is MerR, the mercury-responsive transcription factor. The right figure shows the predicted structure of resulted metal binding peptide. Mercury"
BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Brick DNA is the most important factor to improve. Thus, two punched paper discs of the same BioBrick were incubated overnight at two different temperatures: 37oC and room temperature. The room temparature DNA resulted in 63 colonies (compared to 14 colonies with the 37oC-DNA), but it was not comparable since the 63 colonies were a result from a double electro shock. This may enhance the transformation efficiency. Thus, further tests should be conducted considering different incubation times and temperatures of the paper disc in water and as well single and double electroporation.
Electro competent cell of E. coli MG1655 were made and tested with pUC19. This resulted in zero colonies and may due to the high OD600 of the cells when they were prepared. New cells should be made.
DH5α cells were transformed with pRZ1 (pRS415 containing cpxR responsive promotor). The efficiency was very high and 15 colonies were isolated.

Change to a proof-of-concept
Unfortunately it was discovered that the Cpx response (activated by adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces) actually downregulates, via CpxR, chemotaxis through a number of genes. This means that our initial plan of using the Cpx system to detect adhesion to the beads will not work in its current form as the bacteria adhered to the bead will stop chemotaxing. Indeed, bacteria that adhere to the bead because of short or long-range co-ordination will also stop chemotaxing soon after they reach and adhere to the bead. There would be two ways around this problem: either we stop CpxR switching off chemotaxis by knocking-out the two binding regions that allow CpxR to downregulate the two operons downregulating the chemotactic genes, or we place these genes (eight of them) under the control of an activating CpxR region. In the time remaining, neither of these are achievable. Furthermore, it is likely that there are additional unknown genes required for chemotaxis, that are also downreguated by CpxR upon adhesion, therefore there is a good chance that neither strategy would work initially. As our experimental work has not yet confirmed whether bacteria adhered to beads, and able to chemotax, can actually direct bead movement towards a goal chemoattractant, at the least we would require the modelling work to suggest that this was indeed possible before any effort was made to maintain chemotaxis upon adhesion by either of the"

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Improving Flip Flop#Bioinformatics#Docking SspB-ClpX_-_-_TEXT.html," (blue). More information of these domains is available in the ClpX protein Pfam entry.
Strategy
A protein-protein docking has been carried out to obtain an interaction model for the SspB adaptor protein and the protease subunit ClpX. This interaction model would be the first step in the development of a complete real structural model for the degradation process of a target protein by this protease system.
Procedure
Obtain a pdb model for the SspB and ClpX proteins. In the case of SspB, no pdb model was available for this protein in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) , so the protein homology modeling server Swiss Model and CPHmodels 3.0 server were used to obtain a structural model of this protein. However, for ClpX protein several pdb 3D files were available and the largest one was chosen ( PDB entry 3hte ).
Run the Hex protein-protein Docking server. A shape complementarity approach was chosen.
Analyse the docking results. RasMol 2.7.5. and Jmol 12.0 molecule viewers were used.
Results and Discussion
The Hex server output is shown in figure 2. This model is comparable with the model previously reported by McGinness et al (McGinnes et al, 2006) . Thus, it seems that SspB interacts with the ClpX homohexameric ring in two different main points. These interactions are displayed in figures 3 and 4. The interacting amino acids are displayed in a ball and stick way in which the amino acids side chains interactions can be perfectly appreciated.

RFC Technical Standard
Brief Introduction:
Technical standards framework is formed to reduce the complexity and cost of producing synthetic living organisms by leveraging time-honored engineering principles of abstraction and standardization. This blend of technology and biology makes it easier for scientists and engineers to work together to develop practical solutions for serious problems facing mankind.
In order to help other people to do research on this field, our efficiency measurement protocol has been submitted to BioBrick foundation as a technical standard(BBF RFC 90).
For more information about this paper, please go to BBF RFC 90
BBF RFC 90：The Measurement of rho-independent Transcription Terminator Efficiency.
Jiankui He, Shui Jing, Mengshi Zhang, Xianggeng Liu, Yao Chen, Boyu Qie, Liuxing Shen Zishan Wu
26 September 2012
1. Purpose
The purpose of this RFC is to provide standard methodology for the measurement of the absolute strength of terminators in bacteria. Because we have characterized the performance of terminator in E.coli and used a simple equation model, it can be expressed in PoPS.
2. Relation to other BBF RFCs
This paper doesn’t relate to any other BBF RFC.
3. Copyright Notice
Copyright (C) The BioBrick foundation(2012).All Right Reserved.
4. Standard terminator efficiency measurement kit for use in E.coli.
The terminator efficiency measurement kit MUST include promoter, ribosome binding sites, reporter gene and vector backbone. Standard transcription terminator efficiency measurement kit MUST comprise of promoter BBa_R0040, ribosome binding site BBa_B0030, reporter gene, RFP BBa_E1010, GFP BBa_E0040. It SHOULD comprise vector backbone pSB1A3, a high copy number plasmid carrying ampicillin resistance. This high copy number vector is chosen to facilitate growth of bacteria step in the experiment

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#experiment#exp1_-_-_TEXT.html," incubation with palmitic acid, around45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours incubation, cell viability varied for different concentrations. To maintain 50% cell viability after 48 hours incubation with palmitic acid, we concluded to experiment within range from 0mM to 0.32 mM of palmitic acid.
Fatty Acid Quantification
Quantification Method
Two fatty acid quantification methods were investigated to measure fatty acid uptake rate ofconstitutive and inducible glyoxylate system: 1) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS), and 2) Fatty acid quantification kit (Sigma Aldrich). While we managed to measure fatty acid amount in cell culture medium using GC-MS, fatty acid quantification kit could not be tested due to limitation of time.
Fatty Acid Treatment
In measuring fatty acid, fatty acid solution was mixed with ethanol and chloroform. After acidifying by HCl and refluxing in water bath for 30 min, the organic layer containing fatty acid was collected and extracted by diethyl ether and petroleum ether solution. Again the organic layer was sucked out to be dried before NaOH was added. Then after derivatisation by BF3 and bromotetradecane, the organic layer was collected into GC-MS vial for analysis.
GC-MS
GC-MS is a very useful tool to quantify volatile compounds effectively. For our experiment, we conducted calibration test using known concentrations of fatty acids. However, it was difficult to reach a conclusion due to lack of internal standards and uncertain amount of sample loss.

The reason for choosing the first three parts is because they serve as a good point of comparison between parts with the same binding site.  We decided to transform the Zif activator + reporter simply because we had it available, because we had extra cells after the final centrifugation step, and because this activator had been characterized beforehand in the paper by Caroline Ajo-Franklin.
Resuspended in 0.75 mL before plating.  Then plated 200 uL on one half of each plate and 50 uL on the other half.  Placed in incubator at 6:00 pm.
Also note that because we needed a shaking incubator set to 30 degrees C, we were ultimately forced to turn down the temperature on the incubator that already contained the E. coli cultures from last night (promoters and shuttle vector).  This was done around 10 hr and 30 min into their incubation time.  The result will be a slowing of cell growth for these cultures, possibly also bringing them out of log phase.  As a result, it will be necessary to make glycerol stocks and to do minipreps a lot later tonight.  Note that the incubator was switched back to 37 degrees around the 14th hour.  The cells were then taken out of the incubator around 16 hr and 35 min after they had been put in.  Note that pRS303 showed no signs of growth.  Hopefully this is just due to the fact that the colony on the plate was not properly collected, instead of a sign of contamination on the plates.  In any case, successfully glycerol stocked p413_PCYC, p414_PADH, and p413_PTEF, making two stocks for each part from the same culture.

ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html,". Considering some of the ideas we have come up with this week, many have been about giving context to bacteria - E.cloudy, Crime as emotion, Glandotransius. Can physical context affect bacteria? How will the lab equipment the team made change the bacteria? Can we think of this as a kind of memory construction?
Thinking about story telling, the Swedish village in the documentary helped construct the narrative - the context framed the arguments. In effect, the inhabitants wrote the story through documentation of harvests, population etc, and the scientists extracted and interpreted the data. Scientists borrow from narrative to construct a scientific story, though they don't always admit this in such terms! But data is always subject to interpretation in some way.
We touched on Adam Zaretsky's approach, and Dunne & Raby's Manifesto , which differentiates science fiction from social fiction, futures from parallel worlds, and fictional functions from functional fictions. Earlier this morning, we had been discussing fake iPhones made in small workshops in India, physically indistinguishable from the real thing except for the software, and context-dependent hacks like two-sim card mobiles that allow two phone numbers on one phone, responding to local demand.
Can we think about an 'Indian biology' (a local biology, like 'Indian physics or Indian maths' which are recognised paths of thought)? Can we think about 'Indian critical design'? Context-dependent, local memes, much like the two-sim card mobile phone?
Monday 21st June (Daisy's Birthday): Synthetic Mythologies
Mohor has already spotted a great example: The Transformation of Daksha from Man to Man-Goat (image above).
Local stories
Today we are continuing our exploration of Indian mythologies and looking for parallels and shared metaphors with synthetic biology. The team are delving through the Stories of Shiva and the Devotees of Vishnu and collecting examples that echo the themes that arose through our discussions last week, we grouped last week's ideas into these themes:
Bio-prospecting
Ecosystems
Immunisation  against a disaster
Karma
Epigenetics
Soma
and, of course, Jugaad
Over the weekend, Daisy and I picked up a copy of TimeOut Bangalore which proved a treasure trove of useful information for this project. We came across a reference to a collection of documentary films made by a local collective and farming community about the use of Biotech crops in India: GE in 24 Frames .

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP sites at both side of strong constitutive promoter J23119 and J23119 would be inverted. Therefore the bacteria stop producing GABA and start the product of lactate. Similarly, when the pH of environment reaches the P-asr’s responsive range, J23119 would be inverted again. The bacteria will produce GABA again. Through the combine of multiple LoxP sites and FTR sites, we can realize multi-regulation and fine-regulation. To prevent gene from wrong inverting, we designed two kinds of sRNA to inhibit Cre and Flp’s function. When one of recombinases expresses, the sRNA for the other recombinase will be produced at the same time. The sRNA would inhibit the translation of the other recombinase and avoid the wrong inversion. sRNA consists of two parts, the scaffold structure MicC and a target-binding sequence. Target-binding sequence, an anti-sequence about 15~20 bp, can inhibit the translation through binding with mRNA. These circuits are used when the functional acid and the alkali are both medium.
○ Bxb1 circuit
Bxb1 integrase is a DNA recombinase ( details in project page ). In the primary state, the bacteria also produce alkali. Since the alkali is strong, the pH of environment could reach the responsible range of P-atp2 easily. It can lead Bxb1 to work. The promoter J23119 could be inverted persistently until the inverted efficacy reaches half and half. In this process, the bacteria produce the acid and the alkali at the same time, it can create a wave-motion of pH. And the pH of environment will stable finally. The final pH is influenced by the promoter sensing pH and the strength of acid and alkali. This circuit is applied when the functional acid and alkali are both strong.
○ FimE circuit
FimE is different from other kind’s recombinase. Its recognized sites on the upstream (IRL) and downstream (IRR) are not same. It means that after the recombination mediated by FimE happens, the sign sites would be exchanged, so that the new sign sites couldn’t be recognized by FimE again. So the recombination mediated by FimE is irreversible. Granted that the bacteria produce the strong alkali in the primary, the environment would turn alkaline quickly. So P-atp2 can correspond the change of environment and start the expression of"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," point mutations in the HNS protein. . As a result of their Swarm plate assay and experiments for the determination of flagellar rotational speed, it was found that some random mutations (HSN-T108I and HNS-A18E) resulted in bacteria with a stronger and faster flagella as compared with wild type bacteria. This single amino acid change caused a 50% increase in the binding of HNS to FliG.. It was also shown that this single amino acid change in HNS resulted in an approximately 50% increase in flagellar rotation speed and about a 2-fold increase in the bacteria’s swarm size.
Figure 4: Swarm plate assay. Fresh colonies from strains carrying the indicated alleles were inoculated onto semi-solid agar plates and grown at 30 °C. Growth was measured as the diameter of the bacterial swarm over several time points. Bacteria with swarm diameters under 10 mm at the end of 17 h incubation were considered non-motile. Data representative of three individual experiments. *, vector; f, hns2-tetR; ,,wild-type HNS; l, hnsT108I; l, hnsA18E..
Figure 5: Flagella propel bacteria by rotating motor-driven helical filaments (35, 36) whereby swimming speed is directly related to flagellar rotational speed (39). Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula1 , in another experiment which they tried to compare rotational speeds of mutant and wild-type bacteria, they concluded that hnsA18E and hnsT108I accelerated flagellar speeds 44–62% over wild-type levels.
In the results from fluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking, Donato and Kawula showed that there is an interaction between HNS and FliG, the protein responsible for flagellar torque; and they show that the mutant form of HNS binds FliG 50% more often than does wild-type HNS: They explain the increase in the bacteria’s swarm rate and swim speed caused by mutant HNS thusly “We position H-NS at the interface between the rotor and stator, directly linked to the C terminus of FliG(Fig. 5 A). Tighter binding of mutant H-NST108I toFliG (Fig.5 B) may cause increases in flagellar speed by altering the conformation of FliG relative to the other rotor proteins and/or the MotA·B complex, thus, compacting the motor complex and allowing fast errotation by creating less"
NJAU_China,2015,Team:NJAU China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biological memory?
The simplest mechanism is the construction of a number of bistable systems. Latest statistics show the biological mechanisms include nucleic acid hybridization, DNA recombination, chromatin modification, transcription, and post-transcriptional phenomena. The latest research uses the reverse transcription enzyme to be used as a means to achieve a biological memory.
4th. What are the future applications of biological memory?
Biological memory can be used to monitor the changes of environmental ecological factors and the monitoring of the disease. It can also be used to induce the expression of environmental change. In basic research, it can be used to monitor the dynamic changes of cell populations, and to advance simple synthetic devices into expertly constructed circuits with important applications.

We will have to pay the great efforts in the biological interface circuit components, biological self-organization and bio logical operations, even if"

1 Social Enterprise

3 Intellectual property
4 Intellectual property crash course: USA vs Europe
Social Enterprise
As described in our company vision, we wish Darwin Toolbox to increase access to this technology and awareness of synthetic biology. Therefore, requiring all parties to sign non-disclosure agreements and heavily protecting our intellectual property is somewhat contradictory to this goal. Therefore, the Darwin Toolbox will be launched as an open-source, social enterprise. In addition to enabling the free-trade of information associated with this technology, it will markedly simplify all of the legal issues associated with setting up this company and substantially reduce costs. Establishing world-wide patents for equipment as complex as Darwin Toolbox would cost in excess of $40,000 – if the technology is made open-source, these funds could instead be diverted into product development.
Trademarks
In order to successfully grow the company, the name “Darwin Toolbox” would need to be trademarked in order to stop others imitating it or otherwise damaging the brand. There are currently a wide range of companies that are already registered using the “Darwin” name. However, none of these use “Darwin Toolbox”, and so no claims to this name can be made. In order to register a trademark, the product class, or classes, must first be established. Initially, Darwin Toolbox may be best described by class 9:
“Scientific, nautical, surveying, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling, checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments; apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity; apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of sound or images; magnetic data carriers, recording discs; compact discs, DVDs and other digital recording media; mechanisms for coin-operated apparatus; cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment, computers; computer software; fire-extinguishing apparatus.” Nice Classification, 10th edition, version 2014 (NCL(10-2014))
However, other classes must also be considered as the product develops, especially if reagents are also to be supplied with Darwin Toolbox branding. Classes that may be spanned include classes 1 (enzyme preparations for industrial usage), 5 (enzyme preparations for"

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmids were isolated by miniprep and sent in for sequencing using the designed primers. The pET29b(+)-FadD sequencing results were incorrect. However, to double-check, we prepared a master plate and overnight cultures of a few colonies from the plate of transformants. Miniprep was performed and the plasmids were digested and were run on 1% agarose gel. The results did not indicate the successful ligation of the insert.   To keep the pET29b(+) E. coli DH5α fresh, a new streak plate was made. An overnight culture was made and plasmids were isolated by miniprep and stored in the -20°C freezer for future use.
Week 14 (July 31 - Aug 4)
This week, we digested, ligated, transformed pET29b(+)-phaC and pET29b(+)-phaCJ into competent DH5α using pET29b-RFP. However, the transformations did not work. Therefore, the phaCJ and PhaC inserts were digested, ligated, and transformed again. However, transformants did not grow. We ran control experiments with the enzymes to check their functionality. The results showed that the enzymes were functional. Ligation was performed again using quick ligase for the A beta-oxidation insert and the PhaC insert and then transformed again. However, the transformation did not work. Because the LB tube was clear we rationalized that there was no cell growth from the 1-hour incubation in the shaker after transforming. The cells in plain LB from the transformation the previous day were spun down and resuspended and plated and incubated again overnight.
Made overnight cultures of pet29B(+)-fadE and pUCIDT-fadE. Miniprepped pET29b(+)-fadE and the other in pUCIDT-fadE.

In the MFC design that uses ferricyanide as cathode, the maximum cell voltage would be 0.182V. If oxygen is used as cathode, the maximum cell voltage would be 0.256V. The maximum power output could be 0.398W/gDW in ferricyanide while 0.56W/gDW could be reached using oxygen as cathode.
Effect of fumarate
Figure 7. The effect of fumarate on maximum direct electron transfer(DET) flux of Shewanella utilizing hexane at viable growth flux boundary
 
In pursuit of an overall higher electron output, we tried to identify how the nutritional factors in culturing media affect DET flux and growth flux. Hexane concentration was found to play a minor role since the actual uptake flux was restricted to be low(around -6.04*10-7 mmol/gDW/h) by internal factors of the bacteria.
However, fumarate was found to be an essential factor since it affects for growth, DET, and hexane uptake. In figure 7, the blue curve shows a positive correlation between fumarate uptake and DET flux (with growth flux set to 5%), and DET achieves its maximum value 81.68mmol/gDW/h at a fumarate uptake flux of  8 mmol/gDW/h. The green curve is the corresponding growth flux when DET was optimized. Since DET and growth cannot be optimized simultaneously, we separately constructed the red curve to describe the relationship between growth flux and fumarate uptake when optimizing growth. The curve shows a positive correlation and growth flux achieves its maximum value 0.9408h-1 when fumarate uptake flux reaches 94 mmol/gDW/h.
Aeration effect on DET flux
We also explored the difference of DET flux under aerobic and anaerobic condition. In anaerobic condition, we assumed fumarate as the electron acceptor. It is surprising that the DET flux is driven to extremely small negative value under anaerobic condition, while DET flux can reach 81.68mmol/gDW/h when oxygen flux is set as 20.42mmol/gDW/h according to literature[4].

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#projectbackground_-_-_TEXT.html," removing the need for direct application of bacteria to the carbonate deposits.
Carbon fixation to fuel cell growth: To address environmental concerns regarding unconventional oil extraction, carbon capture can be used to help limit greenhouse gas emission. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms with the capability of fixing both nitrogen and carbon. The cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 has been engineered to convert CO2 into glucose and fructose for export out of the cell to exclusively sustain the growth of Escherichia coli7. This system can be used to efficiently fix carbon and support the growth of E. coli engineered to produce useful MEOR products. An alternative method for carbon fixation is the use of a carboxysome bacterial microcompartment that enhances CO2 fixation in microbes by co-localizing carbon fixation enzymes within a proteinaceous shell8. The sulphur-oxidizing bacterium Halothiobacillus neapolitanus uses reduced sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide, a toxic compound commonly produced by sulphur-reducing bacteria in petrochemical operations, as an energy source for fixing CO2. H. neapolitanus, like S. elongatus, fixes carbon within an α-carboxysome using the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) to convert CO2 into 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG)8. 3PG diffuses out of the carboxysome and enters the cell’s central metabolism9. Although RuBisCO is a relatively inefficient enzyme, localization within the carboxysome increases the local CO2 concentration to help RuBisCO perform near its maximum rate with increased substrate specificity9,10. To further enhance carbon fixation, models of synthetic carbon fixation pathways suggest that alternative carbon fixation pathways could have quantitative advantages over natural pathways11. Ultimately, natural or synthetic carbon fixation pathways can be optimized as a module to fuel bacterial cultures and the production of useful bioproducts.
Acetic acid for breakdown of carbonate rock:  Stimulation of oil wells using organic acids, as opposed to stronger, inorganic acids, is frequently used to increase pore size while retaining the acid at the injection site and preventing oil/acid emulsions12. Acetic acid has been used successfully with other organic acids to treat carbonate oil deposits to increase porosity of the rock and enhance flow rates5. The natural E. coli enzymes phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK) produce acetic acid as a part of normal metabolic processes13"
WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," hearing of an outside branch having success with replacing glucose as a sole energy source with succinate. From this, I started transitioning on to a new topic, specifically other carbon-containing substrates that can replace glucose in our model. Tom also sat down with Dr. Maranas, who would orchestrate funding for our trip to the Jamboree. Even though Dr. Maranas oversees student research in our branch of the department, he does not play a direct role in the work Laura and I do. To verify that her and I are making productive use of our time here, he requested that each of us write a report detailing our project with iGem, along with our findings and future objectives.

Reporting Results
J_exp25
I began writing my report for Dr. Maranas, detailing the motive behind our work here and our ultimate goal of giving plants the ability to produce their own nitrogen. I also mentioned that our branch specifically oversees genome-scale modeling to help guide potential genetic interventions and facilitate nitrogen fixation in E. coli. From our model, we can use FBA to determine the flow of metabolites, or flux, through the network. And from gene knockouts/overexpressions, we can identify available pathways for producing/consuming a metabolite of interest, such as ATP.. As for our results, I focused primarily on how ATP and reduced flavodoxin are the limiting factors in our nitrogenase reactions. Specifically, I mentioned how we attempted to maximize reduced flavodoxin by manipulating pyruvate metabolism. I also focused heavily on my recent work with the metabolite exchange reactions, and how we are looking for ways to help aid cell growth/activity. From this, I have begun looking into other carbon-containing substrates that can replace glucose as the model’s source carbon source.

Checking out Succinate
J_exp27
I started editing my codes to begin running an FBA analysis on replacing glucose with succinate as our model’s sole carbon source. However, after normalizing our substrate to the number of carbon atoms in succinate, 30 mmol/g DW hr succinate vs. 20 mmol/g DW hr glucose, the model proved infeasible. After consulting with Tom, he suggested looking into studies on E. coli growth on succinate to determine if any there are any additional parameters we need to account for, like the presence of another carbon source.

Variations
A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µL restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Restriction analysis
Digest BioBrick of interest: about 400 ng DNA / 10 µL volume, 1 µL 10x orange buffer, 0.5 µL NotI or PstI. Digest for 2 h at 37 °C. NotI is used to determine the length of the BioBrick and the plasmid backbone, PstI is used to determine the length of the BioBrick in the plasmid backbone.
Gel electrophoresis: add 2 µL loading buffer to every digestion mix, apply about 100 - 200 ng DNA / pocket in gel. Don't forget to apply the uncut BioBrick as well. A good agarose concentration for BioBricks between 0.2 and 3 kb is 1.5 %. The smaller your BioBrick of interest is the higher the agarose concentration should be and vice versa. The gel electrophoresis is made with TAE-buffer. Be sure that you melt your agarose gel in the same buffer you use for the electrophoresis later.
Colony PCR
Colony PCR was done with GoTaq DNA-polymerase (Promega) and BIOTAQ DNA-polymerase (Bioline) .
Pick one colony with a sterile tip and put it in one PCR tube with mastermix.

Figure 1: Principle of adding aptamers to Spinach2
By fusing an ATP-aptamer to Spinach2, we created an ATP-sensor with fluorescent readout.
One of the main strengths of synthetic biology, compared to other scientific disciplines is the strong community it is build upon. Yet this community is nothing without active participation and interaction. We therefore see it as a very important responsibility of all iGEM-teams to constantly improve and newly apply parts submitted to the registry. As we were working with functional nucleotides, we soon took notice of BBa_K1330000, better known as Spinach2.1 from DTU Denmark iGEM team 2014. This modified version of Spinach2 was made compatible with the RFC 10 standard without change of functionality.
Envisionning the introduction of the power of aptamers and aptazymes to the iGEM community, we improved part BBa_K1330000 by making it depending on and thereby capable of sensing ATP - we call it BBa_K1614019. We show a possible application of this improved part in the optimization of in vitro transcription conditions and furthermore enhance the readout and the activity by software engineering. Besides, one could imagine sensing other small molecules in a standardized way.
Figure 1 displays both, the principle behind creating a fusion of Spinach2 (BBa_K1330000) and a small molecule aptamer, as well as the way the software designed by our team was used for creation and improvement of the novel ATP-dependent Spinach2."

Formation of fluorescing droplets in HeLa cells, courtesy of Tim Nott
First, we had to confirm the formation of droplets also works in S. cerevisiae, as we neither had the courage nor the equipment to work with human cells. We created a part (BBa_K2483007) with yeast optimized Ddx4-YFP where we took the amino acid sequence from the publication above and with a galactose induced promoter (GAL1) to have more control over protein expression. Droplet formation can be induced by changing temperatures and change in osmolarity. Yeast cells were viewed under the fluorescence microscope.
After confirmation of droplet formation, we fused Ddx4 with IAAM and IAAH respectively and put them both under the same GAL1 promoter (BBa_K2483010). The idea is, to induce metabolic channeling by concentrating the IAA enzymes in the Ddx4 droplets and thereby reducing diffusion time.
Measurements were again done with GC-MS, as a control we used freely diffusing, yeast optimized IAAM and IAAH.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time,"

→ What is your scientific background?
I obtained my diploma of the National Superior School of Agronomy (AgroPrisTech) in 2007. During my Master at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), I began working on synthetic biology. With a few classmates, we have also created the Synthetic Biology Club (SynBC). We then created the first iGEM Paris Bettencourt Team, in 2007.
→ What can synthetic biology provide to society?
Synthetic biology was created by biologists, electronic engineers and physicists content. They wanted to apply engineering concepts to biology, in order to rationalize and predict the behavior of biological systems. Today, synthetic biology has a broader definition and means for the most part genetic engineering. However, there are still limits to our knowledge in engineered biological systems: only a few articles have been published about the functioning these synthetic systems. Moreover, synthetic biology is more and more present in our life, through biofuels and drugs for instance, and many startups are being created nowadays.
→ What is the reaction of general public towards synthetic biology?
In France, many people are afraid of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), even though they are used everywhere by everyone. It is a more sensitive issue once GMOs affect our environment and our health. However, genetic engineering is a promising field of synthetic biology, especially on the development of diseases’ treatments. Like every new technology, synthetic biology is questioning the already established ethic rules while changing our collective awareness as it becomes more present in our every day life.
Interview with other iGEM teams
To have external and diverse advice on our project and to answer ethicals questions, we used the meet-up hosted by iGEM Bordeaux to debate our project. Indeed we prepared a short survey to collect opinions of other iGEM members.
We would like to thanks the teams that have participated to this survey: Bordeaux (France), Paris_Saclay (France), Toulouse (France), Aix_Marseille (France) and iGEM KU_Leuven (Belgium).

Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis
After describing the biological processes, we wanted to characterize our designed processing modules by simulation. Before the simulation, we integrated some information about non-induced promoter strength we got from the wet lab. We found that some promoter properties did influence the cell's state directly. To take the intrinsic noise into consideration, we simulated the stochastic time course trajectories of the state of a chemical reaction network using Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1977). We analyzed our two designs respectively. Before the wiki freeze deadline, we got some qualitative and quantitative results of design 2, which verified the validity of our models
4.1 Parameters
The parameters we used in our model of the two designs were mainly from two resources. Parameters in the processing module of design 1 were from the repressilator model in BioModels Database . And parameters used in design 2 came from parameter page collected by ETH Zurich iGEM 2013 . And we adjusted some parameters by more reasonable consideration and some promoter tests. We adjusted the protein half life from 10min to 40min and adjusted the relative strength among the promoters we used according to our experimental results (Fig. 1).

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cells in the biofilm (matrix) producing phenotype. The phenotype of Bacillus subtilis is determined by the activity of different genetic pathways. A network of regulators, activators and repressors regulate the expression of genes resulting in a certain phenotype. The expression of biofilm genes is also under control of this complex network. We decided to adopt both a top-down approach (where we modify the genetic pathways controlling expression of biofilm genes and repression of motility genes), and a bottom-up approach (where we overexpress biofilm genes directly). Our biofilm must not only be stable, it must also be ion-selective. Specifically, we wanted to engineer the biofilm to function as a cation exchange membrane. However, selectivity can only be achieved in a reasonably robust biofilm.
Bottom up approach for robustness
The most obvious way to increase the robustness of the biofilm is the direct overexpression of biofilm genes. This bottom-up approach aims to have continuous expression of biofilm genes as a result, maintaining the bacteria in a biofilm state even if they would otherwise revert to a motile state. Gene candidates are the tasA gene, which results in the formation of TasA amyloid fibres and provides structural integrity to the biofilm (Romero et al, 2010), and the bslA gene, which encodes hydrophobic proteins which form a layer on the surface of a biofilm. This hydrophobic layer of BslA is a major contributor to surface repellency of the biofilm (Kobayashi et al, 2012).
Structural fibres (TasA)
TasA is the main protein component of the Bacillus subtilis biofilm. It forms amyloid fibres which provide structural integrity to the biofilm by binding together the cells in the biofilm (Romero et al, 2009). It is also known that biofilms lacking the TasA amyloid fibres are very fragile (Romero et al, 2010). TasA is part of the tapA-sipW-tasA operon (Kearns et al, 2005).

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," very important variable in this industry. The product raises new questions with regards to measuring safety and effectiveness by regulatory authorities and about how the reimbursement codes should be assigned by different countries, having different reimbursement systems. Even if the product is able to successfully break down mucus, it may need from the use in combination with bronchodilators and from training in effective elimination from the lungs.
The product does not provide a cure for any of the diseases, or potentially increases the number of years a patient will live with the diseases, but makes the disease more bearable and increases the quality of the disease.
The successful introduction of the product in a market and its reimbursement by public authorities would be therefore determined by a study of the risk-benefit ratio and of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure.
We have extensively spoken about the different benefits this technology can bring to healthcare and about some of the risks it may create. In order to overcome the weight of these risks and have a well-structured plan in case of failure, well built Risk Management Systems should be implemented.
For example, one of the risks the product may create is if the genetically modified bacteria got stuck before reaching the targeted area in the lungs. In this case, an opportunistic infection could be a possible adverse effect, which exists even in the current probiotics. The bacteria would need to be cleared by the cilia in the respiratory tract caused by an immune reaction. In order to prevent this, the developed product must have a kill switch (in our case chemical induced mechanism) which will ensure the death whereas does not have a negative impact on the lung.
The QALY is able to provide a currency that allows comparisons between different disease areas and the cost-effectiveness of any treatment by combining the effects of health interventions on mortality and morbidity into a single index. The calculation is simple, the number of QALYs gained is obtained by multiplying the change in utility value induced by the treatment is multiplied and the duration of the treatment effect   .
If the benefits of using this technology are heavier than the potential risks it may raise, and the QALY measure is big enough, the product may be adopted for public healthcare reimbursement.
For the reimbursement and health economics part of our product development we had the guidance and support of Patrik Hidefjäll. Patrik holds a PhD in innovation management and is currently working for the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. With his help, we were able to understand the structure of the decision making in the Swedish healthcare systems and the requirements for adoption and reimbursement by public healthcare.

Bio-sensor
This device has two parts, including a new promoter PcadA, which can be induced by cadmium ion; and the Tetracycline induced promoter Ptet, which we are familiar with. We devoted ourselves to establishing an accurate mathematical model to predict the result that Bio-sensor Device could achieve.
To the whole Bio-sensor Device, whether it shows red or blue is controlled by the concentration of cadmium ion and the length of time. In other words, this two influencing factors are the two independent variables in the model which simulates how this device works and the dependent variables are the expression level of RFP or cjBlue. In order to establish an accurate model, we need to analyze two parts respectively.
Part 1: PcadA Strength
I.Goal
We design a quantitative experiment to measure the concentration of extracellular cadmium ion, biomass of E.coli (OD600) and fluorescence quantity of RFP protein in different time point. Then we establish a suitable mathematical model and work out the relationship between the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion and the PcadA strength. After this model is built, we can easily figure out the expression level of csgA-EC and tetR as long as we know the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion.
II.Principle
1)Master Model
PcadA strength is repressed by merR mutant, but cadmium ion can combine with merR and disable it, eventually leads to derepression of PcadA. Therefore, PcadA can be regarded as a cadmium ion induced promoter. [1]
Hill equation can be used to simulate the effect of inducible promoter. In PcadA Strength model, the independent variable is the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion, and the dependent variable is the strength of PcadA.
2)Sub Model for the relationship between concentration of extracellular and intracellular cadmium ion
Before measuring the data of mater model, we have measured a series of quantitative data about the concentration of extracellular and intr"

Part II: Rates Based on Concentration
The figure/literature used is still the same as the association/dissociation rates above; therefore, by remodelling and regressing the data based on the literature, one can predict the association and dissociation rates on certain times, with the concentration of the toxin as the independent variable, which is shown at the interactive Excel with this interface:

In the end, the OD600 at 5ml/50ml system experiment shows the result as our expected. However, FI result shows the opposite. We can’t explain it (Figure 11). But we think maybe if we consider growth and protein expression together, there are more evidence to explain. But we didn’t have more acute data to analyze.

Modelling
Stochastic model done.
Models :
Stochastic program is implemented for the toggle switch and works fine. We adapted the program for the whole system so we can implement the quorum sensing stochastic model very quickly when we have the parameters (about 1/2 day of work). The current model and parameters prove that we do have a bi-modal distribution when IPTG and pollutant concentrations are equal :
On the X-axis we can see the concentration of lacI (neg) or merR (positive) in cells. On the Y-axis we can see the amount of cells in one way or another.
Parameters :
We have coherent sets of parameters, but we still can't compare our models to the real system and are waiting for the results of characterization experiments.

Description :
Cellulose can be synthesized by many organisms, ranging from prokaryote to animal. In prokaryotic organisms, bacterial cellulose is synthesized mainly by Gluconacetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Escherichia, Enterobacter and salmonella. In nature, only bacteria can synthesize cellulose pellicle with water-holding texture, among which the most studied bacteria are the genus Gluconacetobacter. Several common strains in the genus Gluconacetobacter can be distinguished by different representations. Bacteria that can synthesize bacterial cellulose are mainly G. Europaeus, G. intermedius, G. Oboediens, G. Nataicola, G. Sacchari and G.xylinus. Researchers have been studying the biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose in recent decades. This G.xylinus has long been recognized as a model strain. Many classical cellulose synthesis pathways and regulatory models were obtained in G.xylinus. Therefore,we choose G.xylinus as the research object in this experiment.
The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in G.xylinus is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.
The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose begins with the conversion of substrates to cellulose precursors, which are usually carbon sources, such as the conversion of glucose to uridine diphosphate glucose (udp-glucose). Uridine diphosphate glucose is the substrate of cellulose synthase, and it is catalyzed by cellulose synthase to form β-1 and 4 glucoside bonds between glucose monomers. There are specific sites on the outer membranes of the bacterial cells, which are coupled with the cellulose synthase complexes and is the spot where the polymerization is conducted [9]. When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular"

Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer
Monitoring Plasmid Numbers
Kill the Slacker
In the procedure of large-scale industrial
production, due to the random distribution of
plasmids in the process of bacteria proliferation
and division, the bacteria containing less
plasmids will gradually become the
“slackers”.
Generally, we aim to avoid these undesired
bacteria become the dominant population.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of
plasmid-free bacteria and the applied ways are
only limited to the laboratory-use.
What about equipping the bacteria with a
plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer
(P-SLACKiller)?
Here is killer’s basic rule:
Kill the slackers (Plasmid numbers are above a
threshold);
Save the workers (Plasmid numbers are below
the threshold).
Surprise! We can guarantee the microbial
population structure stay optimal now!
Our team divide the experiment into 4 parts as below.
Why not click and have a look?
Basic Circuit
We know low-plasmid level cells cost too much but produce less,like a slacker.So let's kill them to improve production.
Inhibitor
Yes,we set a BOMB in every cell,inside the plasmid.They are controlled to Terminate the cell's life.
Killer
Our project depends on good models.Every step we go all with the direction of our model part.
Recombination
Considering the safety requirements,our project is environment-friendly .

Background
One of the more challenging aspects of the CUTSCENE project was finding ways to measure the point mutation frequencies of our DNA. Our envisioned final readout is gel electrophoresis, however we needed a reliable alternate method as a baseline for comparison.
While high throughput sequencing methods are accurate, the cost was prohibitive for the large quantity of sequences we wanted to test. Instead, we turned to Sanger sequencing, an older but less costly method. This decision was supported by recent work by the Timothy Lu lab, that  demonstrated relative mutation frequencies can be quantified from these chromatograms.
Figure 1: Sanger sequencing consists of three main steps: First a primer is added to the DNA and DNA fragments of different lengths are generated, each terminating with a labeled nucleotide; next the DNA segments are separated by length through capillary gel electrophoresis; finally a laser detects each of the labeled nucleotides as they pass by, generating a chromatogram like the one shown above [Sanger Sequencing Steps & Method, Sigma Aldrich].
Another question that we needed to solve was whether the cas9 protein could maintain its specificity when faced with many similar (but non-identical) DNA frames. Theoretically, we knew that having multiple mismatches close to the PAM sequence would make it less likely to bind, but we were not sure of the exact rates or whether using the modified cas9 base editor would make a significant difference. We discovered that the University of British Columbia’s 2017 iGem team had completed work on this in the past, building off of research done by Dr. Howard M Salis’s lab. The team took into account position, mismatch type, and supercoiling of the DNA to find how energetically favorable a match between the gRNA and DNA would be. Since our goal was to simply identify a range of likely off-target sequences, we used a scoring system that only took into account the position of each mismatch, then chose a threshold to screen for the highest scores (cutoff of 0.6). Scores were normalized to from 0-1, with 1 being a perfect match.
Figure 2: As illustrated by the 2017 University of British Columbia iGEM Team, sites farther from the PAM sequence are less important to target"

Each response is the hopes, and they make us to know that there is always a group behind us. We are just a small group, but with our efforts, we are confident to take a try and solve social problems. A refueling let us have motivation to continue efforts. The Internet will help the knowledge and our enthusiasm cross all the boundaries.
8.Newslatter
On Aug 16th 2016, we were invited by XMU-China to delivered them an article to introduce our project and our experiment results. We are very glad to share our project to iGEMers all around the world, and we wrote our article. On Sep 5th 2016, XMU-China published our article on Newsletter magazine.
9.The iGEM Booklet
To spread public awareness of our project, we completed a iGEM booklet to introduce ""What is Synthetic Biology?"" and ""What is solid tumor and how to treat it"". As an educational booklet, knowledge is carefully summarized. Background information, social situation, and critical learning questions are all included so that people with limited Biology background could easily learn something from the booklet.
We have already shared our booklet with teachers all over the city, the country, and even the world! Here in Jilin University, we joined a TED JLU talk and our booklets were present as a gift to the teachers and students. In addition, we have given our booklet to students, teachers, and people from other walks of life all over the state. In the HUST-Cheering Meeting,we provided our booklet to other iGEM teams and exchanged ideas with them. Two students helped bring some booklets to Los Angeles, America, as well as Stockholm, Sweden. And in Boston, during the Gaint Jamboree, we will hand out our booklet to others as well.
Three Different edited version of the booklet have been printed, better and better. And we are still working on fulfilling the information for our booklet. Currently, we are working on providing the some updated statistics so that people can have a bigger view of tumor.
The information we provided and taught to students and adults will inspire them to look into Synthetic Biology. We have already received many positive responses and we feel certain that this enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology will carry them into the future. Additionally, people learn about tumor and a healthy style of life will be pursued. Our educational synthetic biology activities booklet will be available online for anyone to use for free as soon as we get our final edition.

restreak pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11
run digestions of pAT08 and pSB2K3 on the gel
do PCR clean up
3 & 4-10-2010 Repressor group Lisa
we did PCR on minipreps - and there are nothing going on in the PCR. What are we doing wrong?
we will try to make a dilution of template DNA.
We could try a digestion check, and maybe we could just use E+P as check enzymes.
we made O/N cultures of restreaks from 2-10-2010. And the interesting one of these were miniprepped - didnt have a look at gelpicture yet.
Digestions were made of products needed for making the plasmids that were submitting as biobricks, these need to be PCR-cleaned and then they should be ready for ligation.
Plating of O/N culture which should contain plasmids with pBADZ2 +RFP together with L-arabinose. If we get red colonies we know that the construct (pBADZ2 +RFP) is actually present
I had a look at colonies from transformations that should contain pIGR01, pIGR02, pIGR03 and pIGR04 in FLemmings microscope. In a few of the transformations with pIGR01 and 02, there are good fluorescence, but in the rest it is poor ( Sebastien says that this could be background fluorescence from E. Coli??). In colonies containing pIGR03 and 04 (containing promoter and repressor) there is also fluorescence, but this is reasonable since the system is not tight..
Tomorrow Maya will transform Salmonella with pIGR03 and 04 and pSLD20 and 22 (containing antirepressors), and hopefully we can get some highly glowing colonies.

The bands in the other lanes were approximately around the same location, suggesting that the treated proteins did not change in size. We found it peculiar that the lanes 3 and 4 had additional bands of smaller molecular weight and are unsure what it is.
Conclusion
Ultimately, this work still needs a much greater degree of characterization. A successful fiber is always going to be a copolymer with non-collagen regions, and it may have properties quite different from collagen in its current formulation. However, this method of assembly might also be used to form human collagen-based heterotrimers in a eukaryotic production organism, not simply bacterial collagen homotrimers. This kind of modular design seems both more tenable and more generally applicable than any de novo work. After all, conjugating GFP or a cellulose-binding domain to a protein is an example of an attempt at rational modular design of a bifunctional protein construct; while such attempts are far from universally successful, a great many of them have been, including our own modified chromoproteins . It is only natural for this approach to expand in scope and refine associated techniques, and we certainly hope to continue to build on this work specifically.
Methods
DNA for the  four single bacterial collagen domain constructs with attached cross-linking domains was ordered from IDT with overlaps for Gibson assembly into pSB1C3. The resulting plasmid was transformed into T7 Express E. coli cells and sequence verified; 250 mL cultures of the three heterotrimer component-producing strains and a 500 mL culture of the original construct with cross-linking domain were grown up and induced at room temperature with 40 μm IPTG. Protein production was verified with LumioTM Green and protein extraction based on hexahistidine tags was performed using 3 mL HisPur Ni-NTA nickel columns . Protein gels used were 4-12 Bis-Tris Protein gels. Protein ladder used was BenchMarkTM Fluorescent Protein Standard Constructs without cross-linking domains were produced by SapI digest in the presence of T4 DNA Ligase, taking advantage of sites designed into the original order. Full constructs were produced by Golden Gate assembly of linear DNA fragments produced by PCR of the relevant minipreps using BsaI-HF. All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.

Figure 7. The overall objective of the MM-PBSA method is to calculate the free energy difference between two states which most often represent the bounded and unbounded state of two solvated molecules or alternatively to compare the free energy of two different solvated conformations of the same molecule.
The simulation of sRNA complex
We simulate the sRNA-target complex in implicit solvent model based on AMBER molecular dynamic package. The all-atom molecular simulations are run by using force field ff14SB, the standard pairwise Generalized-Born solvation model (igb =1) and calculated with GPU-accelerated PMEMD.cuda. The RNA simulation in implicit solvent model is run by using the 500 steps of minimization and 820 ns at 300K. The unbounded cutoff is set to 999 Å in the minimization. For RMSD of steady states of RNA structure, we use the cpptraj program in AmberTools packages to analyze. The final structures of RNA duplex are converted into pdb files for the next step of MM/PBSA.
The MM/PB(GB)SA in explicit model
Following the previous step, the structures of RNA duplexes are divided into two parts in single strand RNA. The force field is ff14SB and the TIP3P water extends to 12 Å in a rectangular box with neutralized charges of RNA"

Got in touch with the inventors  of Monobodies, Shohei and Akiko Koide  from the Koide Laboratory which inter alia led to receiving information on sequences for Monobodies.
Week 6: (09.05.16-15.05.16):
Library was started with two leading threads , one following antibody mimetics (Monobodies) and another single domain antibodies (Nanobodies).
Again: searching for DNA sequences, this time for the constant parts of both scaffolds.
Week 7: (16.05.16-22.05.16):
Several hints in literature lead to the choice of minimalistic schemes for variable regions. Sorting thoughts and further research on well-suited schemes.
Yet focusing on finding DNA sequences for constant regions.
Introducing the thought to order constant regions as IDT gBlocks  and the variable regions as oligo-nucleotides.
Week 8: (23.05.16-29.05.16):
Design of sequences with gained knowledge of constant regions.
Worked out a control method for supervising the correct folding of protein scaffolds containing disulifde bonds. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) for the control seemed suited. Search of  suitable sequences for a BiFC is initialised.
Week 9: (30.05.16-05.06.16):
Design of sequences for constant regions of the protein scaffolds.
Focused work on sequences, which are possible for the BiFC control.

Finishing of the design of the constant regions and ordering of gene fragments at IDT.
Desig of oligo nucleotides  for variable regions with several minimalistic schemes.
Week 11: (13.06.16-19.06.16):
Ongoing design of oligo sequences variable regions and also construction of several primers.
Achieving a theoretical variety of about one billion per protein scaffold by choosing three different variants for nucleic acid schemes for variable regions.
Finally, ordering the oligo synthesis for variable regions and also fitting primers.
Week 12 (20.06.16-26.06.16):
Further experiments were planned.
Week 13 (27.06.16-03.07.16):
Start of practical work on library.

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction.

Open License (and Responsible Research and Innovation)
Not unlike scientific research, RRI is about common sense, about combining self-profit with others’ profit, about taking care of our planet. We believe that being responsible is not the opposite of being selfish; responsibility is just a broad-minded way of selfishness that points at the long-term benefit.       And there is no long-term benefit without a sustainable society in a sustainable environment. What is good for our neighbors and for our home must be good for us as well.
Our Proposal: Responsible Research and Innovation as a tool to choose within the IP ecosystem.
Since we, our Human Practices sub-team, are a biotechnology and a law student, we are also glad to see that another key concept in IP is a beautiful science-law metaphor: Jane Calvert & Drew Endy's “diverse ecology” scenario. This image fits well with our interdisciplinary spirit and we found it very useful because it evokes very elegantly the range of different solutions out there to choose from in order to use a scientific invention in a given way.
Having reached this point, it is obvious which the next step is: there is a whole ecosystem of IP figures (see the poetic cover illustration by Paula, another team member), and one has to be chosen. How? Our bet is simple: by using RRI principles (mutual learning, human resources management, fundamental rights respect, research formation and transparency) as the main guide in the decision process.
The following figure illustrates what we propose:
Figure 1. RRI-based decision process on a diverse ecology scenario. From a diverse array of IP protection possibilities (diverse ecology scenario), we propose RRI as a framework to choose the most suitable one. In order to assist in the decision process, experts’ opinion is the major force, and we propose here two tools to contribute to this process: a common language exemplified by our dictionaries (Annex I), and a formula-based assistance procedure (Annex II).
In our view, the decision process has to fall upon the responsibility of the experts or examiners, as it is the case today. But we propose that a formation       on RRI for patent examiners and other IP actors is introduced. In the same way that scientists need a basic law background for transferring their knowledge       into applied solutions, we envisage a future in which everybody involved in the production of a given IP figure (a patent, for example, from scientists and       engineers to ethics specialists, lawyers and other experts) should share a common interdisciplinary formation on RRI.

So, from these expreiments we can conclude that we have successfully genetically modified E. coli in such a way that it covers itself in a homogeneous layer of polysilicate. We can use these cells for further experiments on their ability to function as a laser or lens.
Engineering a biological laser
Introduction
Our cellular laser consists out of two features: fluorophores will be the light of the laser and a polysilicate layer synthesized by silicatein will be the ‘mirrors’ that reflect a part of the photons emitted by these fluorophores. The fluorophores first need to be excited by an external light source. This could be either an LED source or a conventional solid laser. For fluorescence an LED excitation source suffices. However, we want lasing to happen in our cells. For this to happen, we need ‘population inversion’, which means the majority of the fluorophores is in an excited state (Gather & Yun, 2011; Svelto & Hanna, 1976) . More information on this can be found in the hardware page . In order to excite the majority of the fluorescent proteins at the same time, we need a strong excitation source. Therefore we need to use a laser to excite the fluorphores in our biolaser. However, a major downside to using lasers for fluorophore excitation is the occurrence of photobleaching (Eggeling, Widengren, Rigler, & Seidel, 1998) . The laser power required for the excitation of fluorophores to induce population inversion in the cell is so high it will photobleach the fluorophores within microseconds (Jonáš et al., 2014) . Therefore, we need a custom laser setup to prevent photobleaching but establish the population inversion required for our biolaser. This laser setup should contain a pulsing laser which pulses at a frequency that will maintain the excited state but does not photobleach the proteins.
Figure 1: Our custom-built hardware setup to image our Biolaser cells.
The appropriate set-up was not available, so we decided to build our own microscope out of separate optical parts. By discussing our problem with optics- and photonics companies and showing our motivation to solve this challenge, we were able to get all our required components sponsored or borrowed, making the entire set-up nearly cost-free. With our minimal set of available tools, we calculated and designed the optics in such a"

Procedure
The competent cells are removed from -80 deg C and thawed on ice
1-2 ul of plasmid is added to 100 ul of competent cells (i.e. into one microcentrifuge tube containing competent cells – the competent cells are made and stored in a way that each microcentrifuge tube has 100 ul)
The cells are kept on ice for 30 min
The cells are then heat shocked by placing them in a water bath at 42 deg C for 90 seconds
The cells are further allowed to rest on ice for 5 min
700 ul of autoclaved LB media (2.5%) is added to each microcentrifuge tube
Microcentrifuge tubes are now incubated at 37 deg C for a period of time depending upon the antibiotic resistance provided by the plasmid:
Chloramphenicol resistance – 2 hours
Ampicillin resistance – 1 hour
Kanamycin resistance – 1 and a half hour
The cells are now plated onto LB + agar plates (1% agar) having the following concentration of the required antibiotic:
For Chloramphenicol – 25 ug/ml
For Ampicillin – 100 ug/ml
For Kanamycin – 100 ug/ml
