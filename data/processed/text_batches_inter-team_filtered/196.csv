Check LB and LB + kan plates for any DH5-alpha cells transformed with BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076
If unsuccessful, abandon,
If successful, prepare 5ml LB inoculations
Procedures
1) Midi-preps of BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002, and BBa_R0077
Protocol
Jess tipping off the supernatant after spinning the overnight cultures in the centrifuge
We did a midi prep for the overnight cultures. We followed the protocol from GenElute ( NA0200S_NA0200 ). The list of plasmid kits can be accessed from Gen Elute's plasmid kits page .
Procedure
To transfer the binding column, we used two eppendorf tubes for each culture. The volume of the eppendorfs were 450ul and we used 45ul of sodium acetate buffer and 315ul of isopropanol for ""DNA concentration"" step. We centrifuged the tubes at 18000rpm for 30 minutes before adding ethanol to rinse the DNAs. We then centriguged the tubes again for 20 minutes at 13000rpm. If we had used the faster machine we would centrifuge the tubes at 18000rpm for 10 minutes. Since it was a slower machine, we used 20 minutes instead.
At the end we air-dried the pellets until the ethanol evaporated. We then added 50ul of PCR water to each eppendorf tube and mixed the solution well. Two eppendorf tubes from the same colony were combined.
Results
Goksel adding one of the agents needed for the plasmid midiprep
Finally we measured the concentration of the DNA in the tubes using spectrometer. We used a sensitive pipet to wash the machine wth 2ul of water twice.  We then loaded and measured the concentration for each tube. Between the steps we cleaned the machine with tissues. At the end we loaded with water again for a final cleaning procedure.
Tubes with plasmid DNAs were then placed to the -20C freezer.
Results for each tube are as below.
Results for BBa_C0056
We had high DNA concentration for the first tube.
The concentration of DNA: 124.6 ng/uL The ratio of DNA concentration to protein concentration(260/280): 1.84 The ratio of protein concentration to RNA concentration(260/230): 1.73
Results for BBa_B1002
We had low DNA concentration"

7. If the answer is “YES” for question number 6, is android smartphone application easy to use?
All of our producer respondents agree if android smartphone applications are easy to use. Whereas 40% from our distributor respondents and 5% from consumer respondents said that the applications are difficult to use.
8. If the application can meassure glucose level in honey, what is your response?
Our respondents were very interest with our project especially for producer and distributor category as show from the survey result.
9. As sumbawa people, are you proud of Sumbawa honey?
We can conclude that Sumbawa people are absolutely proud of Sumbawa honey. Sumbawa honey is the icon of Sumbawa.
Conclusion
Sumbawa honey as the icon of Sumbawa contains high glucose level. However, there is no tools for measuring glucose concentration exist in Sumbawa. That's why people of Sumbawa they really appreciate our ECONEY project. We hope our ECONEY project could be applied to help people in Sumbawa measure glucose level in honey.

From the heat chart, it is clear that the raative error in a system has much less effect on the accuracy of testing than that of input, which implies us that it is vital to control the deviation of input. Thus, we have to find a stable and precise way to deal with our histamine samples. The better the input error is controlled, the more accurate the testing is.

Modeling
1. Overview
Our project aims to engineer cells that can process information to adapt to the environment as we expected, so we need to yield quantitative predictions of gene behaviors. Mathematic model becomes a powerful tool here. It not only helps us predict and analyze the phenomena, but also contributes to the design of genetic circuits. Our models can be divided into several parts. Firstly, we will introduce the biological processes in our design and translate them into mathematical language. Then we will perform some comparisons to explain why we designed circuits this way. Next, we will present the simulation results and experiment evidences from wet lab. Parameter analysis will also be made here. Finally, we will talk about the design principle of the rewirable circuit using ODE sets with matrices. We hope that other researchers can get insight from the mathematic model and make the rewirable circuit widely used.
2. Biological Processes
In this part, we will list the important biological processes and explain how the related molecules work, and then we can describe them using equations. Because the timescales of many processes are separated, we use a quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to reduce the number of dimensions in the systems in most cases. However, if we focus on some processes more than the  final steady state, we may use other approximations such as prefactor method (Bennett et al., 2007).
2.1 Transcription and translation
According to the Central Dogma, DNAs can be transcribed into RNAs and RNAs can be translated into proteins. These processes sometimes can be regulated by some molecules like transcription factors or non-coding RNAs. The interactions among"

ABSTRACT
Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease in some of the most important crops such as apple, pear and most of the members of the Rosaceae. Here the team Tec-Chihuahua presents its proposal to address this environmental issue by using synthetic biology techniques to synthesize three different enzymes that might inhibit most, if not all, the virulence factors of E. amylovora. The use of N-Acyl homoserine lactonase, encoded by the aiiA gene, would directly affect the AHLs by hydrolyzing and inhibiting the main quorum sensing molecule. Then, the Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase from the yhjH gene would linearize the c-di-GMP avoiding the formation of biofilm and encouraging the motility. For this last virulence factor, the team proposes to arrest flagellar rotation with a Putative Glycosyltransferase encoded by epsE. Also, we had already designed a biocontrol product that goes by the name of ""Erwnions"" which main value proposition it's our modified Erwinia. We had considered all the entrepreneurship, social and legal aspects of how this project will affect locally, nationally and worldwide.
INTRODUCTION
The Rosaceae, commonly called the rose family, is a family of flowering plants; it consists of about one hundred genera and three thousand species. It's distributed throughout the world, being especially common in North America, Europe, and Asia.
One of the most conspicuous characteristics of Rosaceae is the variety of fruits produced by its species, which much of them are eaten by people in temperate regions; for example apples, pears, strawberries, and cherries. Also, many members of the family are important as ornamentals because of their foliage and flowers plus with the vast variety of species they are large enough to be sources of wood (Folta, 2009). Also, it is essential to highlight the economic impact of the Rosaceae"

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Notebook#Lab Work#Justin_-_-_TEXT.html,"I spent the remainder of the day working on fundraising applications.
Thursday
Today I continued organizing the lab and autoclaved media in preparation for the 2011 iGEM volunteers to come. Before I left the lab I inoculated 5 mL LB media test tubes containing E. coli cells containg various biobricks that will be used to assemble our lumazine synthase / fluorescent protein construct.
Friday
I minipreped the E. coli cultures that were grown overnight. The parts were then assembled using the red/white screening protocol. Ligations were left overnight at room temperature.
Saturday
The ligations that were left overnight were transformed into E. coliDH5α cells. The transformed cells were plated on LB media pales with agar and incubated for 2 days
Week 2 (May 9 - 15)
Monday
Each plate from the transformations platted on Saturday showed a lawn of colonies. All colonies were white, none red. This is a highly unlikely result. A possible explanation could be that, the plates were improperly made and did not contain any antibiotic.
I divided a LB agar plate from the same batch as I used Saturday into 4 quadrants and streak plated E. coliDH5α cells containing different antibiotic resistant plasmids; pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1T3, and pSC1K3. This should reveal which antibiotic is in the plates, if any
Tuesday
Everything grew on the plates, meaning no antibiotic was added to the plates. I threw out the faulty plates<p/><p> The ligations from May 7th were re-transformed and plated on LB agar plates containing Tetracycline.
Wednesday
The assembly of the following constructs was attempted:
1) pLacI-sRBS
2) pBAD-sRBS
3) K331033-K331035
4) K331025-B0015
5) R0040-K331029 into pSB1T3
Restrictions were done (standard iGEM restriction enzymes) and then the parts were ligated together.
Thursday
No cell growth was observed in the 5 mL cultures. Is there something wrong with our Tetracycline?

For this                              reason, we wanted to approach the topic of science communication without using words                              at all, so we collaborated with student artists form University of Arts London (UAL)                              Camberwell to create art pieces that would be able to convey synthetic biology                              without words. The resulting art pieces can be viewed in our digital gallery . We would like to thank all of the talented artists who took time                              off of their summer to help us convey our passion, enthusiasm and vision of                              synthetic biology to the world through their art pieces.
Graphic design workshop
As part of the troubleshoot meet-up with the other London iGEM teams,                              we also invited graphic design students from the University of Arts London Central                              St Martins to run a graphic design workshop in which they explained some of the foundational                              concepts of graphic design. Using previous iGEM wikis as examples, they showed us                              what makes a good wiki functional and easy to use. Furthermore, they advised all the teams                              individually on how to improve our wiki and poster designs. We would like to thank the                              students, Audrey, Michelle and Andrea for joining us at our troubleshooting event and running                              the graphic design workshop to help us improve our design skills.
Web design consultation
For our wiki we worked closely with Virginia Ma, a graphic design student                              from University of Arts London Central St Martins, who helped us in many aspects of the design of our wiki,                             from picking the colour scheme to laying out the pages and                              providing illustrations for us.

Nanjing-China,2013,Team:Nanjing-China#practice_-_-_TEXT.html," had learned so much and both Tsinghua and our team members thought that we should keep contact with each other in the future and step forward together.
iGEM Communication with Shanghai Jiao Tong University And Tsinghua University
This is the 2nd year since for Nanjing University to participate in the IGEM, so it is necessary to spread the basic principles of synthetic biology and introduce the iGEM to more students in NJU.
To achieve this goal, in April, we invited 2 leaders of other iGEM teams in China to give lectures on synthetic biology for students from different majors. XiRui, the leader of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, 2012, introduced the iGEM from a new perspective. She shared their experience on the IGEM project, which have had profound impact on our project. Meanwhile, Wei Lei, the leader of Tsinghua-A, 2012, showed us how they combine synthetic biology with automation technology, promoting our understanding of the concept and methods of interdisciplinary. Audiences attending the lecture were all deeply impressed and attracted by the iGEM and synthetic biology.
Leaflets on China Adolescents Science and Technology Innovation Contest
The 28th China Adolescents Science and Technology Innovation Contest (CASTIC) was held on August 4th in Nanjing. This annual contest covering science, engineering and social science, is held by the China Association for Science and Technology and the ministries of education, science and technology. Every year, more than 15 million young people take part in the contest.China's future stars of science and technology from primary and secondary schools nationwide gathered in Nanjing to show the fruit of their scientific research.
Obviously this was a great chance to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM to youth in China, so we propagated the basic theory of synthetic biology and the idea of our team to them by handing out leaflets and communicating face to face.Many of them showed great interest in IGEM. We also hope to grab this opportunity to allow them a greater interest in synthetic biology.
Help Another iGEM Team, ZJU-China
Throughout our project, we took notice of the fact that ZJU-China team and our team both focus on the degradation of atrazine.
Under this circumstance, we collaborated a lot with them, such as sharing experience, exchanging ideas about environmental protection, and encouraging each other when got stricken. Especially,we offered TrzN, a gene can degrade atrazine to them, which may be of great help for their projects.
Both of the two outstanding teams learnt a lot from each other's experience, and"

The Story of Our Team Leader
一、 fight for IGEM
‘SCUT students won two gold medals and one silver in the Asia division’, seven students from  ’SCUT-BGI genome innovative science institute’participate in ‘BGIC_ATCG’ and ‘ BGIC_0101’。And both of them perform outstandingly and won the gold medal in Asia division while these two teams both make the iGEM  finals which was hold in MIT in 1st November 2013. What’s more, SCUT won silver medal via their first participation which is a breakthrough in the college. In the team, a handsome young boy worked day after day and persisted in the scientific road. Who is he?——2014 iGEM-SCUT leader Zhang Junjie.
二、 Bring iGEM to SCUT
Junjie studied in Heyuan Zijin High School before he took the national university entrance examination in 2009 and chose bioengineering as his major in South China University of Technology with an excellent performance. When he first entered the college, like many other students specializing in biology, he had a negative impression of the future of biology and started to the preparation for transferring to another major. But a conference changed his mind and he made up his mind to do something great in biology. That was the orientation week, the dean of the biology school，Wang Xiaoning introduced an innovative pattern to the bachelor students——‘SCUT-BGI’which studied bioinformatics. Effected by Professor Wang, he decided to work harder expecting to join in the class. Owing to his study in BGI, he had an intimate contact with iGEM, and finally he introduced this chagelling competition into SCUT..
In his sophomore year, he studied in the innovative class as his wish, and started his one year research in the BGI institute. Through this year’s study, he participate in many projects, including Method and Device for  Detecting Microdeletion in Chromosome STS Area etc, applied four patents, one international patent and two paper still writing included. What’s more, he represented ShenZhen BGI and participate in 2012 iGEM .
Early in 2013, he returned to his Alma Mater and start to introduced iGEM to every students as well as recruit 2013 iGEM team member. After several week’s"

Throw out other samples and their corresponding minipreps.
8 streaks of picked colonies after 4 days of incubation
The idea is that we would take our knockout tolC (ΔtolC) E. coli strain and transform them with a plasmid containing the E. coli tolC gene (behind  a pBAD promoter and a strong E. coli RBS) and an ampicillin-resistance gene. We would then grow them as if we were making a lawn, but mix in an abundance of TLS phage and a working concentration of ampicillin. It was hoped that the ampicillin would prevent any bacteria without the plasmid from growing. The TLS phage would provide the selective pressure to select for phage resistant mutants. One of these plates is pictured.
It was immediately noted that there was considerable variability in the size of colonies (initially presumed to be caused by different mutations. Twelve colonies were picked making sure to get a variety of colony sizes; none of these grew on LB-Amp. Fifteen colonies were picked from a similar plate with identical results. It is highly likely that the colonies picked were satellite colonies that had abandoned their plasmids under selective pressure from the TLS phage.
Attempting the experiment with 2, 4, and 6 times the working concentration of ampicillin resulted in approximately 10% of picked colonies growing. Due to time constraints  further experimentation was halted.

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," appropriate solution to these troubling insects. Every year, harmful insects bring significant economic loss to agriculture, which seriously disturb people's livelihood and economy.
Take Brazil as an example, where the agricultural loss can reach up to 11 billion US dollars because most economic crops here such as coconut, coffee, and sugarcane are under serious insects attack. To control these obnoxious insects, 1.4 billion has to be invested to purchase insecticides annually. Terrible as it may seem, Brazil is just one of the many cases in the world! The truth is that farmers worldwide are doing the same thing! To ensure good harvest, they use pesticides without much consideration about its side effects. In other words, a great amount of insecticides containing toxic substances is discharged to the environment every day. Obviously, it’s never a good solution.
Fig.1-1-1 Losses caused by pests in Brazil. This chart demonstrates the losses of various crops caused by pests.
Also, there is a data about the IPM (Integrated pest management) in USA.  Integrated pest management, which is defined as integration of pest control based on predicted economic, ecological and sociological consequences, makes maximum use of naturally occurring control agents, including weather, disease organisms, predators and parasites.In brief,IPM means the ability to control harmful insects.The lower the number is, the more efficient we are able to control the pests in the evaluated area. In the data, we can see that crops are planted in lots of areas in USA.There are several kinds of plants such as corn and soybean which suffer from insect damage. Since we can only control the insect damage efficiently within a small, limited area. Therefore, as the production areas expand to an extent, the effect of control declines exponentially. Even though the production areas become larger, the total production might be lower.
Therefore, what we need is a brand new method to solve this problem.
Fig.1-1-2  This chart demonstrates IPMs of the various areas of different crops planted in the USA.
Common Solutions
Chemical Control Method
Because of insects damage, human tried lots of ways to kill these harmful insects. In the 15th century, people used pesticide containing heavy metal such as Arsenic, Mercury and Plumbum to kill harmful insects, which was a catastrophe to the environment. Pesticides became more powerful along with the development of modern technology. In the 20th century, the agriculture prospered rapidly owing to the evolution of pesticides. But the pesticides are not only fatal to the insects but also harmful to the human body. People found this problem after several decades"

Furthermore we transformed J23100-B0032-aeBlue into strain JM109. The functionality of the final Plas construct in strain E. coli JM109 was evaluated by growing it on media supplemented with ampicillin and the inducer N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone. The strain grew and developed a blue color. This observation led to the conclusion that the construct worked inE. coli JM109.
Furthermore we miniprepped the final Plas contruct in E. coli JM109 and revised the sequencing results of the final eforRed-construct in E. coli Top10 F’. The final Prhl construct was sequence verified.
We also conducted regulated and unregulated continuous bioreactor cultivations of mixed cultures of E. coli TOP10F'bearing final Prhl construct and E. coli JM109 containing the final Plas construct. The cultures were inoculated with a 70 % : 30 % ratio of E. coli Top10F' (Prhl construct)/E. coli(Plas construct) and samples were taken every hour. In order to determine the ratios of the strains during the cultivation, the samples were spread out on agar plates and incubated at 37°C. The cultivation was stopped after 25 h.

Figure 13. Cells of A.hydrophila processed by cPcAMP1
Figure 10 to figure 13 show a group of broken A. hydrophila that has been processed by AMPs. The edges of the cells are clearly rougher than those of cells in the control group, with some obvious light leaves as circled in blue. We suppose the darkened parts among and besides the cells (circled in red) are the cell structures flowed out of the cell via the gaps on cell walls.
Through the electron microscope photos, we could demonstrate that our AMP solution caused damage on cell walls of A. hydrophila.
IX.Future Improvement
1. Increase the RBS strength for rhlR (LVA-tagged) to improve cooperativity between C4-HSL and RhlR, enabling our sensor device to detect even lower concentration of A. hydrophila and avoid infection more effectively.
2.Change the strength of two RBSs in quorum quenching devices and make the expression of lactonase more sensitive at low C4-HSL concentration.
3. Construct the antimicrobial releasing devices as described in design , so the expressed AMPs can be released in fish intestine and kill A. hydrophila directly.
4. Use OmpA signal peptide to secrete AMPs out of cell (Pechsrichuang).
5. Remove the antibiotic resistance marker on RPG plasmid to ensure biosafety.
6. Put the three devices into fish probiotics like E. coli K12 MG1655, so the killer can colonize in the fish intestine and protect the health of fish for a longer time.

We have registered an iGEM team, had an awesome summer in the lab, and we will attend the Jamboree.
We have completed the judging form.
We have uploaded a description of our project on this wiki-page and registered our BioBricks SSB , pTPI , RecA , STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 by using Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
You can come and visit us by our nice poster at the Jamboree and come and hear our presentation on the 25th.
We have a page on the wiki where all the attributions are listed.
We have documented the following new parts that have been used in our project: SSB , pTPI1 , RecA , STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 .
Silver
We have characterized two of our registered BioBricks: STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 .
STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 have both been registered in the iGEM Part Registry.
We believe that the Human Practices are really important. We have therefore done work concerning both safety and ethics as well as various outreach efforts in different areas. You can read all about it on the pages Safety and Human Practices.
Gold
We have done something extra special and new for our Human Practices. We recognize the importance of everyone being able to find information about scientific topics which are explained in a simplified way. We have therefore translated and extended articles on Wikipedia which is a very important source of information.
We have during the entire summer collaborated with the team Czech Republic . It’s their first year participating in iGEM so we have been helping them with some startups as well as where to find important information and the free DNA starting kit. We have also shared some of our Human Practices and modeling work with them.
We have improved the function of RecA by codon optimization for Saccharomy"

The Issue
When researching a concept for the project, we attended the N8 Crop and Agriculture Innovation Conference, where we heard a talk by Dr David George, who was speaking about the uptake of new technologies among agriculture industries. He said that only a small percentage of the top of an industry will pick up a new technology, then it is relied to filter down the industry. Professor Rick Mumford also spoke on the long process from lab to field and that improvements of the innovation pipeline can be made at every level, including deployment.
Our Solution
We have looked at this issue from a communication angle and extensively analysed the current profile of SynBio in the media by producing A Corpus Based Investigation Into Science Communication , as well as producing guidelines for future science communication . We did this to help future teams and scientists on how to best communicate their work and help deployment of technologies to the public.
Further Stakeholder Influences and Feedback
During our extensive talks with stakeholders, we took other ideas and advice on board and directed our project's direction accordingly. At the N8 Crop and Agriculture Innovation Conference, we spoke to many experts in the agriculture industry, including organic farmers. They were interested in the detection of herbicides such as Glyphosate. This lead to use looking for a detection module we could incorporate into our system that could detect it. There was no known binding sequence for Glyphosate and this lead to us developing Sarcosine Oxidase , an adapter module that broke down Glyphosate into formaldehyde as this has a known biosensor. During talks with Dr Karen Polizzi from Imperial College, she told us about her work with biosensors in bioprocessing and bioreactors. From this, she told us a particular problem industry is questions over reliability; is it as reliable as a non biological mechanism for detecting things? they have access to any analytical equipment they want- how does the performance and reliability of your biosensor compare to that? We kept this in the forefront of our minds when carrying out extensive characterisation and optimisation process. It was important to use to complete the design circle and revisit our stakeholders after our initial conversations. At the end of our laboratory work, we recontacted all the experts that helped us on the way, to get their feedback on our work. Dr Martin Peacock was impressed with the problems we had addressed and commended us on our novel approach to solving them and Dr Oliver Purcell posed interesting questions about the uses of our platform as well as congratulating us on a novel solution. We’d like to thank Dr Chris French, Dr Martin Peacock"

Mr Holmes
School Project at the NEAnderLab
The NEAnderLab is a laboratory in Hilden where classes from schools in the region can do a range of experiments and workshops, from soldering to PCR. As a part of our initiative to spark interest for (synthetic) biology and DIY hardware in the young generation, we cooperated with the high school Gymnasium am Neandertal to bring a grade 11 biology standard level class into the lab.
Overall, this event was a great success! We got really good positive feedback from both students and instructors, and the project even made it into a local newspaper. Rheinische Post reported about the collaboration between our iGEM team and the NEAnderLab in the article ""Schüler forschen mit Studenten im Neanderlab"" (""High school students do research with university students in the Neanderlab"") on September 24th, 2014.

Summary of the Day
The students carried out multiple experiments in context of our iGEM project. During the day, the students collected samples from an E. coli TB culture every 30 minutes to observe the exponential growth phase. The optical density was measured with our own DIY photometer. Overall, the students did a good job of treating their bacterial culture well, as shown in the graph below.
Growth profiles of E. coli
Optical density of the cultures measured by the students
In between the growth curve measurements, we introduced the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. Of course, our team members also explained the bacterial growth properties and how we can observe the propagation of cells using the photometer.

ZJU-China,2018,Team:ZJU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," with mainstream opinions in China which is very conservative. We realized it would be a wise choice for us to develop a cell-free diagnostic device.
2. There still exists concerns in our diagnostic device from the public perspective even though it is already cell-free. Then, the problem turns to a safety-related concern which requires us to ensure there exists no cell left on our device.
MDST
Biosafety is essential for our products since we chose to develop an in-vitro medical device. MDST (Zhejiang Institute of Medical Device Testing) is a Hangzhou center for medical device quality supervision and testing of China food and drug administration. We thought the suggestions from In-vitro Diagnostic Device Department (IVDs) of MDST would make a great difference to our final products. Hence, we went on a field visit to their lab and seized an opportunity to interview the director of the department, Lianjun Lin. We consulted her about A Detector.
We summarized her points of view which did make profound impact on our project design and listed them below:
Q: How can we promise the safety of a medical diagnostic device from the very beginning?
A: It’s hard to define the word “safety”, for it relates to many concepts. The first thing you should concern about is the national standard of in-vitro medical device, which represents the minimum safety requirement. I highly recommend that you focus on the basic safety requirements on cell-free biosensors.
Q: How long can a medical device be released, and mass produced? How can we speed up the process?
A: It depends. Usually, it takes 2-3 years for the products to be licensed for production, including the research period. However, it is for biotech companies, not a scientific research and innovation team like you. To practice your ideas, you are supposed to consider cooperating with related biotech companies, which is more realistic. Additionally, you should take intellectual property seriously while sharing ideas.
Q: How about ethics?
A: For medical devices, ethics is as important as safety. Nowadays, the mode of Internet plus Hospital is increasing with the concern about the privacy leaks. So data security is alwaya a matter of great concern no matter how big the market you have.
Q: What do you think of our product if it can work out? Can you describe the blueprint you imagine?
A: I think what you’re doing is great since it reminds me of a different way to develop in-vitro diagnostic device. If you ask me the ideal IVD from my perspective, I would like to let everyone have their family physical examinations."
HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," intentional is not enough; as long as it happen, it's our irrevocable responsibility.
Many previous iGEM teams have done impressive work when addressing ethical issues in synthetic biology. Their discussions about many topics gave us much room for contemplation. However, after contemplating upon the ethical concerns about our project, we discovered a relatively simple approach to tackle the ethics problems in synthetic biology, and we would like to share it with everybody. Paradigm might sound a bit pretentious actually, and since we built this model from scratch, it certainly has many imperfections, so, just regard it as a bit of experience sharing! We hope future iGEMers could find it somewhat useful, and innovate more ideas on how to think about an ethic problem in synthetic biology.
And here is our ethics report, enjoy!
Balance is more than a lifestyle. It's a thinking style. We need to think about the complexities when looking at the seemingly simple things, and think in a direct and simple way when tackling the seeming complexity. [1] It's an old philosophy handed down by our Chinese ancestors from very ancient times.
Influenced deeply by this philosophy, this paradigm is very simple and easy to understand.
2. Construction from Scratch: A 3-D Model
Imagine the scope of ethical issues as we perceive in synthetic biology as a patch. A keyword is a dot, the development of this dot is a thread, any kind of relationship between two keywords is a thread, too.
     The intertwining of many threads of topics become such a patch. The X axis means ""negative"". The Y axis means ""positive"".
     Wait a moment. Talking about positive and negative in such a rush might seem childish, but sometimes children's simple dichotomy might enlighten us on an easy cut-through to an otherwise complex issue. Topics such as good, evil, right, wrong, is, or ought in relation to synthetic biology can contain a book-worth of contents if you choose to look at them the complex way, which certainly will prove very productive; for in an ethic jigsaw, we ultimately will need all the tiny pieces. Teams such as iGEM Paris 2009 have done impressive works in this, and their previous works have given us great inspiration.
     Then imagine this patch growing to be a 3-D one, with some dots and thread at the surface, some dots and threads down the surface, some threads start from the bottom and extends to the surface. This means, some issues are latent, not perceived, but have influence on the issues on the surface.

The basal activity of the envisioned LacH promotor might result in background noise because of leaky expression of the methyltransferase. We tried to solve this problem by doing experiments with the LacIQ strain of E.coli and by using the pBAD promotor.
Innovation manager & Business developer
Early in the stage of our project we realized that the Cellular Logbook had the potential to become a platform technology for synthetic biology. Although we could think of numerous different applications for our system in the future, none of these applications were really evident at the moment; our main focus was to get the proof of concept that our multi-signal sensing system would work. We did realize though, that we needed to have a clear story on how to present our project to all kinds of audiences.
In order to get some advice on this, we went to talk to Willem Fokkema, innovation manager and business developer at the UvA Technology Transfer Office. Willem Fokkema is specialized in the applicability of knowledge and aiding life scientists to find commercial partners. We started of with an explanation of our project, after which he gave us some tips:
Work on your elevator pitch. You should be able to explain your project in one minute.
Don’t use ‘cheap or low costs’ as an argument in favor of your technology. Focus on what your technology can do and help companies see how this can help them.
Concerning legal issues: he stated that we shouldn’t think about patenting until we would have a clear ‘product and application’ in mind. He proposed he would give us advice regarding patenting at a later stage of our project.
In thinking of applications for your project, consider going through the list of Global Grand Challenges .

They were quite welcoming regarding the participation in iGEM. After the workshop,   we had a discussion with one of the professors regarding the problem of food spoilage and it’s   solutions. We also visited his lab to see his work. He was quite overwhelmed to see our participation   in iGEM. He insisted us to keep in contact with their students, so that they can also participate in   iGEM within the next few years.
Balarampur High School
Some of our team members went to Balarampur High school to spread awareness regarding food   spoilage and synthetic biology among high school students. The students were already aware with   the concept of Genetics and were fast in catching up. Our team members explained them about   food spoilage and it’s causes. They were taught about synthetic biology and it’s uses in addressing   food spoilage. The guide book designed by our team came in very handy to teach them and it also   served the purpose to clear their doubts on various related topics. The students were quite   enthusiastic regarding the whole concept of gene manipulation. Our members were following quite   an interesting and fun-loving way to teach the students. The students were also taught about some   ways to prevent food spoilage at their homes. The class lasted for about 1 hour and our members   were very successful in converting a boring lecture class into an interactive session for the students.
Media Articles
Guidebook
Our guidebook is an essential tool we created to provide our reader an informative and easy-to-understand content to help them surf through mind-boggling oddities and platitude existing regarding food spoilage. This guidebook is uniquely crafted and designed after huge brainstorming sessions to provide our readers well-curated content from internet, magazines, and journals regarding causes, effects, precautions and symptoms of food spoilage. All the important highlights are covered under different sections, charts and infographics prepared from raw data. This organization has been chosen to make it a modular reading material making each section unique, competent and most importantly useful for the readers. We believe that our efforts would help all our readers by giving them an easy and quick access to Food Safety Practices as a gentle reminder that help exists just a tap on screen away.

If the intervening sequence were something of environmental or public relevance (such as antibiotic resistance), the experimental design indicates that the sequence will be removed and, thus, not expressed. This is a relevant contribution of the design in limiting expression to the RNA level, which eases environmental hazard concern upon the accidental release of a GMO containing this biobrick. Therefore, the new biobrick parts submitted should not raise any safety issues.
The necessary facility, equipment and handling procedures associated with Level 2 Biosafety concerns were met:
1.Pipetting aids
2.Biosafety cabinets where applicable
3.Laboratory separated from other activities
4.Biohazard sign
5.Proper safety and disposal equipment, including autoclave
6.Personal protective equipment, worn only in the laboratory
7.Screw-capped tubes and bottles
8.Plastic disposable pasteur pipettes, when necessary
All precautions with respect to recombinant DNA were observed:
1.All waste was autoclaved before being thrown away.
2.Researchers practiced aseptic technique and personal hygiene and safety precautions
3.Procedures likely to generate aerosols are performed in a biosafety cabinet
4.Bench surfaces were disinfected with ethanol.
4.Potentially contaminated waste is separated from general waste
Safety Questions
1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose: The materials used in the lab are non toxic to health of individuals as well as to the environment. One of the major reagents that is used is GelRed which is used as a substitute for Ethidium Bromide. Gel Red is unable to penetrate into cells and so is a non-mutagenic agent. As well it has the same spectral characteristics as Ethidium Bromide and so has the same effectiveness of use. The project itself is safe even if released into the environment by design or accident since the part being expressed is the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Unless the sequences are mutated, the project poses no risk.
Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to these questions.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity? No
- threats to environmental quality? No
- security concerns? No
The parts that are associated with the project this year are at the same level of risk as the any of the regular parts that already exist. All parts are constructed in an antibiotic containing backbone so that accidental release"

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the plasmid.
To take advantage of this discovery, we wanted to test if shortening the time between the dilutions would improve the editing rate. By diluting every 12 hours instead of every 24 hours we not allowing the cells to reach stationary phase and therefore are constantly replicating in the exponential phase. We used our CAMERA protocol and adapted it to dilute into fresh medium with antibiotics and inducers every 12 instead of 24 hours.
The difference in mutation frequencies from the two experiments (24 hr dilutions and 12 hr dilutions) was found at each time point. The standard error of the mean was also calculated. Because each difference lies more than two deviations from zero, we are at least 95% confident that the more frequent dilutions increase the mutation rate.
Based on these results we are confident that our hypothesis, keeping the cells in exponential phase would increase the rate of base editing, is true. With this information, all of our future experiments with base editing will involve diluting every 12 hours instead of 24 hours. Alternatively, we can utilize a bioreactor, which will constantly supply the bacteria with new media and therefore keep the cells in exponential phase and improve base editing efficiency.
Base Editor
Due to the fact that the base editor we used did not conform to iGEM’s BioBrick (RFC 10) compatibility, we synthesized DNA from IDT for the CDA and ugi proteins, which were codon optimized to remove BioBrick sites, and utilized a dCas9 from the registry BBa_K1323002 in an effort to assemble our own base editor.
Our first attempt at assembling this plasmid involved using Gibson assembly with 30 bp overhangs between each part and the pSB4A5 low copy number backbone. We attempted varying concentrations, amounts, and ratios of pieces, but none of our experiments produced colonies.
After multiple attempts at assembly using Gibson, we transitioned into using overlap extension PCR. Then we attempted golden gate assembly. Using PCR we added BsaI or BbsI type II restriction enzymes sites to the ends of each of our parts each with a unique 4 bp overhang. These parts would then be ligated together and transformed. Once again we attempted using various concentrations and ratios of pieces; however, we never produced colonies with the correct assembly. We additionally attempted assembling the base editor stepwise, 1 piece at a time, but to no avail.
We learned from our advisors that sometimes plasmids will not successfully transform or be grown up when in a low copy backbone. So we transitioned into assembling"

More importantly, these workspaces and this filesystem was implemented such that it will be expanded for cloud services in the future.
Neptune's Build & Assembly Pages | Priya Kapadia
After the user has designed the microfluidic chip, they can then move on to select hardware components to match their needs. They would need to first input the volume of liquid they would like to dispense, and the precision they require. Neptune would then search through its database of servos and syringes to recommend hardware combinations to the user based on complex calculations involving torque, the range of pulse-width modulations, the bandwidth-delay product, and so on. Consequently, users are provided with a large personalized list of items that they can choose from. The user can then map the hardware to the dispensers on the chip that they just designed. The mapping allows Neptune to calibrate the dispensers for the experiment. The user is then provided with an ordering list consisting of all the parts that they need for the experiment. The ordering list would include the new hardware that the user has just selected, some predetermined items such as a roll of 3D printing support, and also some variable items like the number of 6-32 screws for instance. These would be calculated using the user's choices and the chip at hand.
To ease the usage and to help the user put all the pieces together, Neptune's Assembly Page takes the user through a step by step process where they can make and connect all the pieces required to control the microfluidic device. Currently, the users can download all the file required to 3D print the infrastructure of the hardware we suggest to them in the Build page. However, moving forward, both the Build and Assembly page would allow for the user to input their own servo and syringe combination into Neptune. The ability for the user to create custom 3D printing files are currently in development. Aside from that, the Assembly page includes descriptions on how to create the infrastructure, mill out the microfluidic chip, connect the Arduino to the hardware, and set up the system for control.

THE IDEA
Our aim in this part of the project is to detect when the yeast starts to ferment. To do this, we are going to use two gene constructions. The first construction consists of the ADH2 promoter fused to the YAP1 protein coding sequence. In the second construction the TRR promoter is fused to the GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) coding sequence.
We use the ADH2 promoter (alcohol dehydrogenase) to sense the glucose/ethanol concentration. When this promoter is activated, YAP1 is expressed. This protein will attach to TRR promoter (thioredoxin reductase), which will become activated if the constitutive yeast protein SKN7 is in its oxidized form and also interacts with the promoter. This activation will enable transcription of GFP. H2O2 has to be added in order to oxidize the SKN7 protein.
Outline
- We ordered the DNA constructions: pADH2-YAP1 protein and pTRR-GFP protein which comes in the bacterium plasmid pUC57.
- We already had the Yeplac181 and Yep352 yeast vectors in our laboratory.
- We carried out four transformations in E. coli, one for each DNA molecules (the two constructions and the two vectors), in order to clone them. See the Transformation Protocol Using Heat Shock .
- We obtained several E. coli colonies in four dishes and took some colonies of each DNA (two constructions and two vectors) to grow them in liquid medium overnight  at 37 ºC in a shake chamber.
- The next day we extracted the DNA molecules. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- We obtained the purified constructions (both in pUC57 plasmid) and the purified yeast vector (YEplac181 and YEp352).
- We digested the four DNA molecules with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. See the digestion protocol .

Two parallel                             experiments were performed to determine whether there was a deviation in the results of our                             previous experiments.

Following the last experiment, we thought that 500 ng/mL antigen fixation is currently                             reasonable. So we did the effect of antibody concentration of 1000 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL at                             an                             antigen concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figure (6) a, b), where we will self-assemble the upper                             and                             lower slides. And considering the damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the                             self-assembly                             of the slide, the slide was dried at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the                             same                             time, the antigen fixation process still adopts the method of soaking. Three sets of                             parallel                             experiments were performed separately.
Then we also made a set of antigen concentration of 500 ng / ml, antibody concentration of                             1500                             ng / ml (Figure (6) c). However, the method of soaking the immobilized antigen was not                             adopted,                             but the previous dropping method was employed.

Our nightmare
Last year, Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, China, suffered from serious tap water pollution caused by benzene leaking into the drinking water source. Although it happened in April, 2014, citizens in Lanzhou are still in the dark about the safety of their drinking water. If you look at the whole world, it is easy for you to find that the whole world is in a nightmare of water pollution. Water pollution accounts for 80% of all infectious diseases reported by WHO. World-wide around 1.1 billion people lack access to improved water sources. There is no doubt that millions of people care about the water quality and are eager to know whether their water is safe and available.
Our human practice
Last year we designed a novel microbial fuel cell (MFC) system and were able to detect the concentration of PNP (p-nitrophenol) in aqueous solution. So this year we decided to create a convenient and low-cost device to detect some contaminants in water such as heavy metal ions. At the beginning of our program, we carried out our human practice both in China and abroad as we needed to know the present situations and people’s attitudes to water pollution all over the world.
Human practice in China consists of questionnaires and public education. Outside China, we did the Internet survey by Twitter, microblog, WeChat and other approaches and got many useful data from 9 countries.
Questionnaires
Aiming at the difference between China and western countries, we designed two kinds of questionnaires including a Chinese questionnaire and an English questionnaire, which is basically similar ( Chinese questionnaire , English questionnaire ). We totally acquired 369 questionnaire responses.
The survey in China was carried out both online and offline. We used an online survey website and collected 148 effective questionnaires. We also got 136 effective paper questionnaires in Lanzhou city. As to the English questionnaire, we put it on the surveymonkey website and promoted it by Twitter, WeChat and other media to get more data. Finally, we recycled 85 effective questionnaires from 6 different countries (Australia, Canada, USA, Japan, Portugal, Singapore) located in four continents. All of these countries belong to developed country.
We drew some interesting conclusions from all of the 369 questionnaires.

MFC
Instead of exploiting more water resources, which has more and more negative influence[1], it's better to make less pollution and treat water pollution.[2] And we must know what kinds of contaminations in the water and how much are them. So we chose MFC (Microbial Fuel Cells) to detect the heavy metal in water.
So, what is MFC?
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide new opportunities for the sustainable production of energy from biodegradable, reduced compounds. MFCs function on different carbohydrates but also on complex substrates present in wastewaters which is an ideal approach to solve both pollution problem and energy crisis. Compared with traditional chemical methods of sewage treatment, MFC is environmental friendly and widely adept by various condition[3].
A MFC converts biomass energy directly into electricity. This can be achieved when bacteria switch from the natural electron acceptor, such as oxygen or nitrate, to an insoluble acceptor, such as the MFC anode. A typical microbial fuel cell consists of two compartments: anode and cathode compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). In the anode compartment, microorganisms oxidize the fuel and generating CO2, electrons and protons. Electrons are transferred through an external electric circuit to the cathode compartment, while protons are transferred to the cathode compartment through the membrane. Electrons and protons are consumed in the cathode compartment, combining with oxygen to form water.
Figure 1. The working principle of a microbial fuel cell.
Substrate is metabolized by bacteria, which transfer the gained electrons to the anode. This can occur either directly through the membrane or via mobile redox shuttles. MED, redox mediator; Red oval, terminal electron shuttle in or on the bacterium.[4]
After electron generated, the electron need to be transferred out of the microbe, The mechanism includes two methods:
1.Direct transfer mechanism: Electrons are directly transferred from the microbe’s cell membrane to the anode surface (A), nanowires transfer the electron through conductive appendages, termed “nanowires”, grown by the bacteria.(B) 2.Indirect transfer mechanism: Microbes employ a secondary biomolecule ----- electron transfer mediators(ETMs) to shuttle the electron to the anode(C).

“SnapGene was born of frustration. Ben Glick, a cell biologist and experienced cloner, realized that a huge amount of effort is wasted because researchers make avoidable mistakes when planning their cloning procedures, and because records of cloning procedures are incomplete. [...]
This problem has a solution: good software. If molecular biology software were easier to use than pen and paper, researchers would naturally plan their cloning procedures with computers, and electronic records could be automatically produced. [...]
Working with labs around the world, we created software to meet the everyday needs of molecular biologists. Each enhancement has generated new ideas, and SnapGene is still in active development.”

A good way to check that you’re in the right spot is to wiggle the pipet tip every so slightly, and see if you can feel the walls of the well. When you’re confident you’re in the right spot, slowly eject the ladder into the well. The ladder is heavier than the buffer and will sink into the well. Try to avoid bubbles.
14) For each sample, in a small PCR tube, add 10uL of the DNA sample and 2uL of 6X Purple loading dye
15) Load each sample into a well in the same way you loaded the ladder. Use a new pipet tip for each sample.
16) Once everything is loaded, double check the gel is oriented in the correct direction.
17) Triple check the gel is oriented in the correct direction. (Waiting an hour only to find out your gel ran off the wrong edge and all your samples are lost is tragic.)
18) Plug the electrophoresis device into the power source. Make sure the lid is closed. If you touch the buffer while the power source is on, you will be dangerously shocked.
19) Change the power source settings to 90 volts.
20) Turn the power source on and run the gel until the dye gets close to the end but dont let it run off the end. Usually an hour to 90 mins.
21) When the gel is done, turn off the power supply, then unplug it before opening the gel box and removing the gel.

Agar plate preparation
Back to protocols .
Agar plates are used for cell cultures. Their preparation is relatively simple: first an agar broth is mixed and autoclaved. Then an antibacterial agent such as Ampicillin is mixed in. Finally, the solution is poured into disposable petri plates and let gelify for 20 minutes around a bunzen burner flame, as illustrated below.
Agar broth
The antibiotic agent will depend on what kind of plasmid is used. Listed here is an example for Ampicillin (used for plasmids carrying the Ampicillin resistance gene).
Mix the following in a large bottle:
Ingredients for 1 l of LB Agar
Product
Amount
NaCl
10 g
Tryptone
10 g
Yeast Extract
5 g
Agar
20 g
H2O (deionised)
fill to 1 l
Adjust pH to 7.0 using 5 M NaOH.
Autoclave.
Keep in 55° C bath after autoclaving (that's where it will arrive if autoclaved in Bart's lab).
Add 100 mg filter-sterilised ampicillin.
Mix on heating mixer, until homogenous (don't close lid completely).
Warning: the broth starts gelification as soon as it cools down. Store it in a warm bath to keep it liquid. If it does gelify, just warm and mix again (with magnetic mixer).
Pouring the plates
Arrange empty petri dishes in a crescent around a Bunzen burner. Half-fill them with agar broth. Stack another layer of empty dishes above, and repeat until all the broth has been poured. One liter of broth fills approximately 30 plates.
Leave the plates around the flame for approximately twenty minutes, until the gel is solidified. Then replace lid and store in fridge.

Figure 2: Suggested reaction mechanism of bisphenol A degradation and BioBricks needed for this reaction in vitro.
In 2008, the iGEM team from the University of Alberta submitted the codon usage optimized bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 to the registry of standard biological parts in the so-called Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). Via this assembly standard it is very easy to build fusion proteins. These already existing protein domains will be fused together with the NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase gene from E. coli to the gene encoding the fusion protein FNR:Fdbisd:P450bisd which subsequently will be fused to an S-layer gene. We have already shown that the Fdbisd:P450bisd fusion protein is degrading BPA more effectively in E. coli than the polycistronic bisdAB gene ( data here ).
NAD+ detection
Our selected NAD+ detection method utilizes a molecular beacon based approach. These have been initially described in 1996 as nucleic acid probes that fluoresce upon hybridization ( Tyagi et al., 1996 ). For this effect the ends of a single-stranded DNA molecule are labeled with a fluorophore as well as with an appropriate quencher. Due to a formed stem-loop both are in such a close proximity to each other that no fluorescence signal is detected.
The molecular beacons closed state can be applied to a bioassay detecting NAD+ even in very low concentrations ( Tang et al., 2011 ). Using two complementary targets hybridizing side-by-side with the hairpin enables NAD+-dependent DNA ligation (nick-closing) by E. coli DNA ligase. Only after closing the gap between both hybridized targets the stem opens and the secondary structure gets broken down to a linearized probe-target hybrid. The immediate consequence is a disruption of the close proximity of the fluorophore and the quencher, so that an excitation with light is converted into a visible fluorescence signal. Since NAD+ concentration determines DNA ligase activity, which is responsible for the formation of the molecular beacons open state, the emerging fluorescence directly correlates with the NAD+ concentration. Additionally, the highly selective NAD+ bioassay has a low limit of detection compared to other methods.
Because of the signal stability and the suitability for daily use the NAD+ bioassay can be coupled to NADH"

In one study, the removal of arsenic from mining tailings ponds was done by  Rhamnolipid biosurfactants, which decreased the interfacial tension between contaminants and tailings, increasing the metal’s mobility and thus separating them [8].
Another current method of metal removal from tailings ponds is bioleaching. Bioleaching is the use of organisms as a catalyst to leach certain metals from their ores, by turning the metal sulphide crystals into sulphates and metal [9]. This is used to oxidize the sulphide materials left behind from mining, in addition to extracting the valuable metals from the tailings. This bacterial oxidation technology is advantageous due to its use of natural bacteria already present in the tailings and its relative simpleness. [10].
Comparison of Our System
Biosurfactants
Our system of recovering heavy metal ions from tailings ponds is more effective than biosurfactants in a couple different ways. The removal of metals by ionic biosurfactants is thought to occur in the following order: the sorption of the biosurfactant to the soil surface and complexation with the metal; the detachment of the metal from the soil to the solution; and the association with micelles. Heavy metals are trapped within the micelles through electrostatic interactions and can be recovered through precipitation or membrane separation methods[11]. Our system is more beneficial than biosurfactants because it is more self-sustaining with our phage infection system; additionally, biosurfactants are affected by the slightest change in temperature and pH levels. They also require a higher concentration of carbon and nitrogen for growth and production. All these factors combined give us insight to the possible benefits our system compared to biosurfactants.
Bioleaching
In comparison to bioleaching, our system is more favourable. One benefit is that our system does not produce heat. The sulphide oxidation present in bioleaching is an exothermic process, which releases large quantities of heat, therefore requiring a cool environment in order to prevent the bacteria from dying. Our system would not require this. In addition, our system is self-renewable, which demonstrates the potential for greater metal removal efficiency. Our phage capsid display technology is complex, yet it provides a potential alternative for the extraction of metals from tailings ponds.
Incorporation
In order to efficiently integrate our system into the removal of metals from mining and oil sands tailings ponds, we propose a solution using multiple cisterns. It would not be feasible to implement our system directly into the tailings"

Introduction Lung cancer and biomarkers BREATHtaking Detection Switch Output References
Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer forms today and due to the lack of good detection methods, it is one of the deadliest. A suggested approach for detection of the disease have been to use specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in elevated levels in the breath of lung cancer patients.
BREATHtaking is a biosensor for detection of lung cancer through the analysis of exhaled air from patients. The biosensor is designed as an AND-gate and consist of olfactory receptors from mouse and rat incorporated into two different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When these receptors detect specific VOCs, a CRISPR/Cas9-system is initiated  and mating is induced between the two strains. The CRISPR/Cas9-system is designed to partially delete the ADE2 gene in the fused, diploid cells and cause a colony colour change. The colony colour change in the biosensor will indicate presence of VOCs in the patient’s exhaled breath.
Lung cancer & VOCs as biomarkers
Lung cancer is the cancer form with the highest death toll, causing 1.69 million deaths globally in 2015 [1]. One reason for the high death toll is the late detection of the cancer, due to symptoms appearing first in the later stage of the disease.
Three different stages are used to characterize lung cancer; I, II and III. The magnitude of the disease is based on size of the tumor and the extent of spreading to lymph nodes and other organs in the body [2]. A majority of the lung cancer cases today are diagnosed in stage III with a 5-year survival rate of 5-14%. An earlier detection at stage I or II would increase the figure to 45-49% which clearly show that early detection is a key to increase the chances of surviving lung cancer [3].
At the appearance of the first symptoms, a chest X-ray is used today to scan for tumors. The scan can indicate the position and size of the tumors. Despite being a non-invasive procedure"

Un cop assolida la presa, un nou mòdul genètic s´activa, conduint a la mort del patògen o la cèl•lula cancerígena. L´equip de Heidelberg segueix dues estrategies diferents per aconseguir l´esmentada mort. La primera estrategia es basa en toxines bacterials i la segona en virus específics per bacteria. Les toxines són normalment produïdes per certes soques de bacteries per matar altres bacteries. No obstant, aquestes toxines també són capaces de matar cèl•lules cancerígenes, transmetent així a la soca assassina aquesta capacitat. Per al sistema de prova, l´equip fa servir informació genètica de producció de toxines bacterials. Aquesta informació serà introduïda a les cel•lules assassines i modificada per a que només s´activi quan la propia cèl•lula ha assolit la soca presa. L´activació porta a la producció i l´alliberament de toxines, obtenint com a resultat final la mort de la cèl•lula presa.
En la segona estrategia per matar la presa es fan servir virus de bacteria, que infecten de forma natural cèl•lules d´E. Coli. Durant l´infeccio, el fag injecta la seva informació genètica a la bacteria, forçant-la a produïr nous fags, que seran alliberats a posetriori. Un cop alliberats, els fags són capaços d´atacar altres bacteries. Per aquest motiu, en aquesta estrategia s´aprofita específicament l´efecte dominó que permet matar un alt nombre de cèl•lules presa amb un nombre reduït de cèl•lules assassines.

Surgery cannot cure Crohn's disease but may be needed to treat complications such as abscesses, strictures or fistulae. Crohn's disease can recur in the healthy parts of the intestine, usually at the resection site.[1] Postsurgical recurrence of Crohn's disease is relatively common. Also, surgeries possess their own risk such as infection.
Drugs
Chemical drugs for IBD are tailored for each patient. So doctors must consider various factors to determine drugs and doses.
Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms. Available drugs include antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunosuppression agents (TNF inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab), Nicotine and Iron supplementation. Immunosuppression are usually beneficial to patients. However, it may make the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy.
Fecal microbiota transplant
FMT is the process of transplantation of fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into a recipient. It is a relatively new treatment option for IBD which has attracted many attention since 2010 and many related standards has not been completely established yet.  This therapy needs strict tests for donors, and the curative effect is not significant enough so far.
Our team iGEM2016 ShanghaiTechChina_B is striving to provide new angles in treatment. We chose IBD as an entry point and designed a complete set of therapeutic methods to treat it by utilizing our engineered E.coli. Bacteria treatment has many advantages. It targets precisely, cures conveniently and costs less. Actually we are hoping our approaches can also be applied to treat other intestinal diseases in the future.

Brette (Assistant professor in INSA Lyon, doctor in economic sciences) and our partners (Assystem, EDF). We also have a realistic idea of the technical difficulties thanks to the visits we made in nuclear installations (central of Tricastin, area of Centraco) and discussions we had with a Chemist of the nuclear power plant of Bugey.
To get an industrial application technically realistic, our biofilter has to be designed as a modular innovation, what means that this solution can be applied without any major modification of the structure of the power plant or of the treatment center (plumbing, circuits of the different components, ...). Thus, design of the cartridge of the biofilter is fundamental to be able to be used into the circuit of nuclear effluents, then be treated as radioactive waste.
From those discussions we know that our project is plausible and could interest industrialists but some changes have to be made regarding the uses of our biofilters.

Cobalt released during the opening of the nuclear reactor may represent 150 TeraBecquerel (TBq) of radioactivity (500 m3 of contaminated water with a radioactive Cobalt estimated level of 300 gigaBq / m3).
If the Cobalt biofilter is used as shown above, dose rate for only 1 of the 150 TBq will represent 0,4 sievert per hour (Sv/h) whereas the authorized rate is up to 20 mSv per year.
Calculation of dose rate:
Dose Rate = 0.54 * C * E * P / d²
with
C = the activity Curie
E = energy radiation in MeV
P =  the percentage of emission
d = distance from the radiation source
To treat 1TBq of Co60 with d = 1m (1TBq  = 30 Curie)
EP = 2.5
we can estimate Dose rate
DR = (0.54 * 30 * 2.5) / 1²
DR = 40 rad / h
DR = 0.4 Gy / h
DR = 0.4 Sv / h
This exposure rate supposed that if we want to use our ""Cobalt Buster"" biofilter, human operators will have to be protected from this high level of radiation, which means that a concrete wall of at least one meter has to be built for each parallel biofilter, and all manipulations"

Interlab study - Aim & Results
The goal of the interlab study is to obtain GFP fluorescence data from the iGEM teams all around the world for about twenty constructions. This will permit to observe the result repeatability across technics, strains and teams.
There were two sub-parts in this study:
The mandatory one: obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP and compare them.
The Extra Credit assignments: we choose to study the entire Anderson library of constitutive prokaryotic promoters (J23100 to J23119) .
This library corresponds to 19 constitutive promoters containing some nucleotide mutations on the -35 and the -10, as shown Used Biobricks and plasmids .  The idea is to compare the expression strength of promoters according to mutations, from the maximum amount of fluorescence data in order to have significant results.
Required Devices
The three required constructions shown various fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.5, as shown on graph and bar chart below.  As shown on corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm, the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm is linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter.
Theoritically constructions I20260 and J3101 were similar, constructions and alignments in sillico matched perfectly. The difference between these constructions lies on the assembly way. However we obtained, as some other teams (University of Oxford, Paris-Bettencourt and ITESM-CEM), significant GFP expression difference. There is probably a Biobrick standard  construction problem, which relates to the traited question on our Phylosophy subsection.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the"

Proof of concept
Demonstrate your work
Last year, we devised Flavorator which preserve food by fragrance component with antibacterial effect and introduced its concept. We chose geraniol and farnesol as the fragrance having an antibacterial effect, and we made E.coli possible produce these fragrance components by recombination. However, the synthetic amount of geraniol and farnesol was lower than expected, and it is not sufficient for practical use.
This year, to improve functionality and feasibility of Flavorator, we focused on the production of farnesol instead of two fragrances for three reasons. 1. Farnesol does not impair flavor of food because it is almost odorless.  2. Farnesol has a high antifungal activity than others. 3.

Proof of Concept
Continuous culture
The main focus of Project: Exepire in the lab was the robustness of kill switches in real world conditions. By looking at the effectiveness of the kill switches in continuous culture we have begun to show potential failure rates over time. By simulating a continuous culture that would take place on a much larger scale in industry, we have shown the potential failures that need to be addressed if kill switches are to replace traditional chemical and physical bio-containment.
Before starting the project we spoke to Prof. Robert Beardmore EPSRC Leadership Fellow in the Mathematical Biosciences at Exeter University. Much of his research has been into antibiotic resistance. We discussed how high selection pressure is applied by prolonged use of antibiotics and how kill switches may be analogous to this. It is clear that cells which develop a mutation that inactivates the kill switch would be strongly selected for. It was estimated that functional loss of the kill switch would occur in a short amount of time as a result, and if this was the case, could have strong implications for kill switch longevity. To test this we decided to use a ministat to perform a continuous culture. The ministat was developed in the Dunham lab at the University of Washington (Miller et al, 2013). Each ministat chamber is fed from its own media container via a peristaltic pump, with the culture volume set by the height of the effluent needle in the chamber. Air is bubbled through flasks of water to hydrate it and then used to agitate the culture. Chambers were inoculated with freshly transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) and samples taken to test if the kill switches were still viable. By simulating in miniature how a kill switch might behave in an industrial setting, the ministat provides a proof of concept for how a kill switch might be maintained in larger chemostats during a continuous culture. A protocol for running experiments in the ministat can be found here

UK Teams Meetup (Organised by Westminster Team)
Bringing microscopy to iGEMmers
In order for UK iGEM teams to meet, socialise and discuss their projects ahead of the Jamboree, the Westminster iGEM team organised a two day meeting in London. As the Hardware track was new to this year’s competition, and being the only team following this track in the UK, we felt this would be a fantastic opportunity to introduce other teams to the track and highlight the important role of hardware in synthetic biology.
Our workshop took the form of three stations, each covering a slightly different aspect of our project and each with a different discussion focus:
Optics Bench
A working set-up of our first optics bench, and demonstration 3D printed material. Discussion points:
3D printing and rapid prototyping
Principles of open-source hardware
Inverting the Raspberry Pi camera lens
Field of view and resolution calculation
Microscopy Awaits
A working set-up of our latest microscope prototype, brightfield and fluorescence modes, fully motorised and video streaming to the Webshell. Discussion points:
Importance of, and our difficulty with, illumination
Remote control over Webshell
Epi-cube explanation
Stage flex-principle demonstration
Build Your Own
An interactive demonstration on building our microscope from scratch. Discussion points:
Importance of documentation and instructions
Design choices
Discuss improvements required
How to use Arduino and Raspberry Pi
The entire team was involved, and this allowed members of other teams to chat and ask questions at all three stations while the equipment was being run.  The level of enthusiasm from other team members was extremely encouraging, and we were very surprised by the number of questions about the hardware track in general. We hope that as a result of our worksop, some teams may consider it for next year’s competition.
Perhaps one of the most important outcomes of the workshop was in raising awareness of the role of open source hardware (OSH). We emphasised the degree of collaboration and community that it fosters, in the context of our own project. Underlying this is the ability of other iGEM teams to build, modify and improve our microscope in the spirit of OSH and the competition. We invited and encouraged other team members to look at our designs, tinker with them and think about how they might alter"

i. These microorganisms are unlikely to cause human disease or animal disease of veterinary importance. Ideally, however, staff members should be subjected to a pre-employment health surveillance procedure regarding past medical history.
ii. Prompt reporting of illness or laboratory accident is desirable and all staff members should be made aware of the importance of maintaining good laboratory safety practice.
2. For BSL- 2 (level-2)
i. Pre-employment or pre-placement health surveillance is necessary. This screening should include the past medical history. A clinical examination and the collection of a baseline serum sample would be advantageous and, in some cases, may be necessary.
ii. Records of illness and absence should be kept by the laboratory director and it is the responsibility of the laboratory worker and his own medical adviser to keep the director informed of all absences due to illness.
Monitoring should ensure that:
i. Only highly trained personnel are entering in the facility.
ii. Person working in the facility are not transporting the laboratory materials including hazardous organism outside the laboratory environment either without permission or without proper transport strategy with prior approval from competent authority.
iii. Person working in the laboratory are well aware about the microorganism(s) to be handled and its associated risks.
iv. Accidental spill or splashes are cleaned immediately, reported and recorded.
3. BSL-3
i. Protective solid-front laboratory clothing shall be worn by workers when in the laboratory and shall NOT be worn outside the laboratory.
ii. An eye protection policy should be in place. Eye protection devices must be worn when the chance of eye contamination exists.
iii. Respiratory protective equipment should be used if the microorganism has higher possibility of spread through aerosolization.
iv. Appropriate gloves must be worn. Frequent glove changing and handwashing is standard practice.
v. Cleaning and re-use conditions (if permitted) should be clearly defined.
vi. Medical examination of all laboratory personnel working in the containment laboratory is mandatory. This examination should include a detailed past medical history and clinical examination.
vii. A baseline serum sample should be obtained and stored for future reference.
viii. Employees either immunocompromised or being treated with immunosuppressive drugs should not be employed in containment laboratories.
4. BSL-4
i. Personnel who enter the suit area are required to wear a one-piece, positively pressurized, HEPA filter-supplied air suit. Air to the suit must be provided by a system that has a 100% redundant capability with an independent source of air, for use in the event of an emergency.

Foreword
We were the first Cardiff University team to enter iGEM, and only 2 of our PIs had experience with synthetic biology, so there was a steep learning curve, hence we sought out assistance when required. From this project we will have gained valuable insight, and are well placed to mentor future Welsh teams.
As a smaller team than most, all members got dirty in the lab to some degree, as well as giving a hand in public engagement events. That said, there were still defined roles in the team.

Environmental, Social, and Economic Impact
For years scientists have been observing the Violacein Pathway. Originating from the Amazon and marine protozoa, the pathway produces violet pigments (Violacein) in common bacteria. Today this pathway is produced in laboratories to dye textiles and is studied for its medicinal properties. Violacein is unique as it has both antibacterial and tumoricidal properties, and thus at the frontier of cancer research. Despite numerous studies, little is known about the capabilities of Violacein and its full effect on protozoa and eukaryotic cells.
Our diagnostic culture imaging will increase efficiency of those studying the Violacein pathway and other pathways with colored signals. An analysis of the RGB value will improve accuracy and precision in measuring the amount of Violacein, Prodeoxyviolacein, Proviolacein and Deoxyviolacein present in a culture. Our project will also add to the current information on violacein and eukaryotic organisms as we are using yeast cultures.
L-tryptophan, the first step in the Violacein pathway, is an amino acid which increases serotonin in the brain and functions as an antidepressant (""L-tryptophan""). High doses can lead to chronic muscle pain and cognitive deficiencies. Violacein's effect in eukaryotic cells on the molecular level is also still unknown. Therefore, additional testing should be conducted before humans receive high exposure. It is also imperative to wear personal protective barriers between the cultures and human skin.
What is the effect of the release of this waste into systems?
A major concern is waste that is generated from an increased production of Violacein. Fifteen percent of healthcare waste produced annually is biohazardous waste. Like most non-sharp biohazardous waste, the end result of the Violacein Pathway will be incinerated or autoclaved.

(For generating capsules with a diameter of ~230 μm the following parameters were chosen: inner diameter of needle 130 μm, speed 6 ml/hour, voltage 5000 V, distance between needle and gelling bath 1 - 2 cm)
Capsule wash
Let the capsules stay in the gelling bath for a few minutes.
Gently pour the gelling solution containing the capsules through a filter (mesh, pore size 40 μm), while holding the filter holder tube at an angle.
Put the filter holder containing the capsules in an unused and sterile beaker, gently flush the capsules with the washing solution (mannitol solution if coating the capsules in poly-L-lysine) using a 25 ml graduated pipette (repeat 2 times).
Put the filter holder containing the capsules in an unused and sterile beaker, gently resuspend the capsules in the desired volume of storage medium or continue with coating the capsules in poly-L-lysine.

Prepare fresh poly-L-lysine solution.
Following the cell encapsulation, wash the capsules in mannitol (as described under the capsule wash protocol).
Transfer the capsules to a poly-L-lysine bath (with magnetic stirrer).
Wait 10 minutes before filtering the capsules (as described under the capsule wash protocol).
Gently pour the poly-L-lysine solution containing the capsules through a filter (mesh, pore size 40 μm), while holding the filter holder tube at an angle.

Generate HemH knock-out using lambda-red mutagenesis method
Following this, our team is keen in helping Macquarie team to generate HemH knock-out bacterial strain by using another commonly used bacterial genome editing approach, known as lamba-RED recombination system. The HemH gene is knocked out by replacing it with a flp-flanked Kanamycin selection cassette. Due to the accumulation of protoporphyrin ring IX substrates, HemH knock-out resulted in light-sensitive bacteria that grow only in the dark.
Red: 50 nt Homology arms used for the PCR of KanR cassette. Purple: Primers used for colony PCR screening
Mutant screens were then conducted after 2 days of bacteria growing. The below gel image shows one of our screening results.
a) Colony PCR with primers on hemH. b) Colony PCR with primer Kanamycin gene.
After HemH knock out, there should be no bands appears for HemH gene in the gel image while a band size of 1000bp reflecting Kanamycin gene is expected to be shown. It is unfortunate that we failed to knock out HemH gene. We had screen for hundreds colonies but none turned out to be positive.To explain the survival of bacteria against Kanamycin resistance even though Kanamycin cassette is not inserted into their genome,might be that pKD4 that originally serves as template plasmids for flp-flanked Kanamycin cassette are not fully digested with DpnI.  The second possibility is due to random insertion of Kanamycin cassette.
Team Macquarie helped us too!! :))
Last but not least, we would like to acknowledge and thank Team Macquarie’s effort in helping us with tasks stated as follow:
1. With RT-PCR primer designed and sent by Team Macquarie, our team was able to finish characterising the gene expression for the Mg-chelatase plasmid on time.
2. Team Macquarie also helped us to characterise two SpCas9 mutants, 462( BBa_K2130001 ) and 459( BBa_K2130002 )  . p.s. They also footed the shipping bill too. :P
To do so, our team had changed the FLAG purification tag into 6xHistidine tag that associated with plasmid carrying mutated SpCas9 as Team Macquarie only has kits for His-tag purification. Following purification, an in-vitro assay assay was"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," of society can minimise harmful impact (Gross, 2010). In the case of synthetic biology, the cross-borderness means interdisciplinary action, regaining trust for technological developments amongst the public, and transcending political borders to envisage the transnational community in which synthetic biology operates. Within iGEM operations, transdisciplinarity has still proven to be unfavourable towards the social science of emerging technologies. While the synergetic linkage between engineers, biologists and computer scientists has occurred in a rather spontaneous way, the social sciences still have to overcome the constraints of priority considerations. In contrast to the playfulness of constructing a new genetically engineered micro-organism, constructing a trusting atmosphere is rather seen as a duty. As such, there is a discrepancy between the joy that comes from creating novelty, and the incidental embellishment of creating novelty to bring well-being and progress to society. As scientific apprentices, they probably already feel rather inclined to be preoccupied with the biotechnological puzzle that synthetic biology is.

(2) Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy electromagnetic radiation to act on life, changing the structures of biomolecules to achieve the aim of destroying cancer cells which are sensitive to radioactive rays.  The radioactive rays applied in clinical treatment are X-ray and γ-ray.  Future researches focus on exploring and applying new radioactive sources, accurate location of irradiation site, treatment plans and enhancing sensitivity towards radioactive rays.
(3) Surgery: including radical operations, palliative operations, and exploratory operations sharing one purpose of eliminating tumor tissues completely.
There are no breakthroughs in cancer surgery.  The main obstacles are lack of accurate detection method for the range of tumor invasion and the explanation for different reactions of immune system. Though surgical techniques have been greatly developed, the trend for surgery is to narrow the extent of operations to ensure the completeness of organ functions.
(4) Immunotherapy
There is one certain effective immunotherapy at present, with local injection of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) to cure melanoma.  Transfer factors and immune ribonucleic acid (iRNA) have certain curative effects as well.  Some new immune drugs have yet to be identified and product standardized.
2. Bacteria therapy
Nowadays there are three major problems in the tumor therapy, which are inadequate tissue penetration, low tumor targeting and limited toxicity to all cancer cells. These drawbacks prevent effectual treatments and are associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. However, bacteria can carry out the ideal functions to overcome these limitations. Therefore the bacteria therapy has several advantages superior to common chemotherapy.[1]
1)It's self-propulsion and can penetrate into tumor regions that are inaccessible to passive therapies.
2)The bacteria are able to sense the local environment and make decision about when and where to release the drugs.
3)When the bacteria carry the reporter gene, they can be easily detected and can provide information about the state of tumors and the effects of the treatment.
4)Anaerobic bacteria can highly colonize the hypoxic areas of tumors, invading the tumor cells.  The invading bacteria can reproduce unlimitedly escaping from immune cells. [2]
5)These bacteria can not only inhibit the growth of tumor tissues through parasitism in tumor cells, but also secrete natural toxin to kill surrounding cancer cells.
6)Bacteria have large genome and can carry multiple exogenous genes.  Researchers can also modify bacteria with gene engineering and synthetic biology techniques to improve their lethality upon tumor cells. [3],[4]

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," reason through profit.
e) Aspects of legality
Apart from the patent rights mentioned before, approvals have to be obtained before a plant can be built. The utilization of genetically engineered micro-organisms in closed systems is regulated in the European directive 2009/41/EG. The directive ensures the safety of human health and environment. For this purpose, means of confinement and protection that prevent exposition are reviewed. Emergency guides are mandatory in case of accidents.  These requirements should easily be met when constructing a plant to degrade PET by using artificial bacteria, if the planning is done conscientious. The usage in a defecator is more difficult. Can this still be assumed a closed system?  Respective requests will be harder to achieve. An eventual release of the bacteria to the global oceans for the purification of the environment will most possibly be rejected, since the side effects cannot be evaluated. Another aspect is the question of property on the PET. If eventually it will be profitable to filter PET from the sea for use as a crude material to process industrial usable substances, it raises the question of who possesses the PET and if everyone could exploit it at their own discretion.  Within the territorial waters it would be the assignment of the states to issue options of exploitation. Beyond these zones this is more difficult. At this time, these questions are of no importance, since there are no practicable methods of filtering and the technique is not established yet. They have to be kept in mind though.
Ethical criteria
One important aspect of technology assessment is an ethical discussion about the used appliances, especially when biological or anthropological techniques are used. The evaluation of those in the prospective technology assessment of Bender is divided into four parts. Each part is evaluated for the compatibility and it´s possibilities of promotion. The four parts are:
Human orientation
Social orientation
Environmental orientation
Future orientation
a) Human orientation
Like described earlier, humankind is threatened by the consequences of PET enrichment. A reduction of the concentration of PET would lead to an improvement of living conditions for every human being indipentent of social and financial standard. A technology is human compatible when it reduces risks for health without leading to other grave consequences.  A production of toxic side products has to be averted. This is the case when Catechol is the end product. Therefore special filters have to be used to eliminate Catechol from water. The new synthesized organisms must not be harmful for humans especially when they find their way out into nature. This risk is reduced by lowering the viability of the bacteria like described before. A risk of gene transfer with other bacteria cannot be ruled"

As you can see on the graph, the culture media with buffer in them has low pH variation. We have processed the membrane collected after 10 days of fermentation and the table below is the data we have collected.
As the statistics show, when pH=5.75～5.25 ,the yield of BC the most optimal.Meanwhile, when pH=5.25 and 4.75, the yield of BC are higher than the control group by 11% and 7%.
Therefore, we hope we can maintain the pH at 5 in the environment during G.xylinus fermentation.
Transformation  of E.coli
Due to the production of acidic substances like glucuronic acid during G.xylinus fermentation, the accumulation of acidic compounds lead to the decrease in pH. In order to maintain the optimal pH for producing bacterial cellulose, a mechanism to produce alkali substances is required. We choose model strain E.coli considering its benefits such as having a clear genetic background, easy technical operation and short culture time. Therefore,we plan to modify E.coli to have the ability to respond to the variation of pH and enable it to produce alkali substances when the environment is acidic enough. Hence, the alkali substances produced can maintain the optimal pH for G.xylinus to produce BC.
First, we need to find a switch with the function of sensing the pH level in the environment and respond accordingly. Luckily, we have identified a proton type of promoter P-asr located on the activator protein binding domain. When pH is around 5, it can activate RNA polymerase to combine with template DNA precisely resulting in the expression of downstream sequence. The pH for the activation of P-asr is very close to the optimal  pH for producing BC. Therefore, we decide to use P-asr as our switch.
After that, we have identified a gene GlsA with the function of producing alkali substances via the expression of glutaminase. This enzyme can catalyse the conversion of  glutamine and water to glutamate and ammonia. The ammonia will combine with H+ to increase the pH in the environment.
We have verified its capability of producing alkali in DH5α
Based on what we have acessed, we know that GlsA is activated when the pH is below 6. The graph above also demonstrates that the pH variation in the culture media of E.coli also fluctuate around 6.
We add the gene of P-asr"

SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," within China as part of the the wider Asian market as well as expansion into the wider global market.  Our hopes from this meeting we so that we could gain more appreciation about both the opportunities that exist, and of the complexity surrounding, the development of a viable “green economy”, and how microalgae research likes ours can play a role in this endeavor.
After a productive discussion with the head of the marketing department of Euglena, we understood that although nutrition has long been a primary focus of biomass production, increasing biomass production can be used in many different application. This idea is specified when we were introduced with their 5F model, in which it explains that biomass can be applied to food, fiber, feed, fertilizer, and fuel, following a sequence to commercialize from high-value product to low-value product. With such strategy applying one product into multiple usage, lots of cost will be saved.
Figure 1 - the 5F model of microalgae biomass. As quantity of product increases commercialization also increases, however, value of product is decreased. Using the whole biomass to produce products from the whole cell is an attractive proposition for business and also can have a greater societal impact.
Besides productivity, another problem we are facing is the perception from the consumer. A research conducted by the School of Forest Resources and Conservation from Florida University shows that 54.4% of the respondent to be “not at all knowledgeable”about the topic while 31.6% of the respondent expressed “negative”or “highly negative” towards the topic. With the general population being unaware of the product itself, our team decided to design an education outreach program that improve the public awareness of the topic. Our education program aims to provide a basic introduction to the public about what is biomass and how does biomass work, and to shape a perception that our product is reliable.
Meeting with Dr. Kuldell
In order to further explore the challenges facing second level science education with respects to preparing students for careers in STEM, our team, inspired by the our own experiences with the excellent BioBuilder™ curriculum, scheduled an online meeting via Skype with Dr. Natalie Kuldell.
Dr. Kuldell is a professor in the Department of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where, among other things, she develops discovery-based curricula with an aim to bring highschool students into the heart of synthetic biology. As a co-developer of the BioBuilder curriculum, she is an outstanding person to talk to about both the positive effect of teaching engineering and design in biology, and the potential barriers facing educators to its implementation.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," shown, that a vaccination in mice with the binding domain of BoNT-A in mice protected them botulism, by neutralizing antibodies [] . Transferred to our project, this shows the importance of an unmasked the binding domain for the shuttle mechanism to work properly. The binding domain is mainly build of beta-sheets and has two subdomains. The crucial part of this domain is the ganglioside binding loop with a conserved tryptophane at position 1258 [] .
Structural Analysis
As a first step to deimmunize this domain, we obtained the crystal structure (PDB ID: 3N7K) and performed a 10 ns MD simulation in order to check the stability of the domain.  We used the AMBER99SB force field with the MD simulation software GROMACS 2016.3.  The RMSD of the simulation slowly rises during the MD simulation up to a value of 0.3 nm (Figure 8.1). This can be largely explained by the characteristics of the structure itself, since the structure contains many large loops. An overlay of the structure before and after the MD simulation shows, that the beta-sheets stay in their initial position, whereas the loops show some conformation change due to their flexibility (Figure 8.2). This information about the stability of the protein is needed, because we wanted verify the stability of the structure after the amino acid substitutions using another MD simulation. We concluded that this structure is sufficiently stable for the analysis after the introduction of the point mutations.

Figure 8.2: Structure alignment of the botulinum toxin C binding domain before and after a 10 ns MD simulation.
Epitope Removal
The second step was the calculation of the best point mutations in order to reduce the immunogenicity by our tool BERT, calculated on the three most prevalent alleles in central Europe DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*15:01. As input of our tool we used the crystal structure 3N7K and a MSA of the binding domains of the other known botulinum toxins and toxin related proteins.

4. OPTIONAL QUESTION:  Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or security issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
This year our team has developed an innovative way to deal with the safety problems during the study of synthetic biology-- Three Laws of Synthesis Biology. Read as follows: 1. Once an altered plasmid gets into bacteria that does not aim at adopting the plasmid, the suicidal mechanism of the plasmid will be executed. 2. Once the mutation accumulates to a certain degree, the suicide mechanism of the bacteria will be executed. 3. Once an infected bacterium is away from its regular surroundings, the suicide mechanism will be executed. We have illustrated the details in related parts of human practice.

Generally speaking, this whole process wouldn’t be very expensive compared the current ways of gut inflammation testing. We used the price of Mutaflor as a model and comparison; Mutaflor sells 20 capsules for $28.95, but our patients would only need one capsule for inflammation testing, so that the prime cost would be around $1.5 per capsule. This, is much cheaper than any methods currently commercialized (estimated prices of existing detection methods are listed below).
Blood testing (without insurance) would range from $700 to $2589; stool testing would generally cost $5 - $100, testing in hospitals are generally more expansive, and in most hospitals stool testing can only detect a few common compounds or bacteria (e.g. shigella and salmonella in China); colonoscopy is even more expensive, ranging $1000 - $3764.
Thus, our product will be able to offer a much more accessible price.
Then about the response time. As we did in our previous experiments, our bacteria can correctly and distinctly response to different concentration of the two chemical compounds after 12 hours of cultivation, which is shorter than the normal digesting time (14-24 hours). Considering the capsule (or the bacteria) might not get into contact with inflammation too early, so that there is still possibilities that the bacteria still haven’t have enough time to produce violacein or chromo-protein when digested. Since we might commercially start with insoluble capsules, patients might need to keep the capsule for 12 more hours to cultivate the bacteria and to let them show their color. When we further develop it into gastro-resistant hard capsule, some bacteria would be left in the gut for days, so that patients would be able to determine the inflammation level by observing the excrete of the next day.
For further instructions and details in using this capsule, see our guidance( Applied Design ).

Germany’s biggest MeetUp of young Synthetic Biologists
The first weekend in August, we hosted the biggest MeetUp of young Synthetic Biologists in Germany. At this event, we did not only talk about science but also performed some sporting activities which was a canoe race at the Lahn, the Marburg’s river. Through this event, several collaborations between different iGEM teams came into being.
Altogether, 9 teams participated including the ones from Aachen, Bielefeld, Bonn, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Freiburg, Goettingen, Tuebingen and us with overall 60 students of different fields of study. Represented were among others biologists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists, physicists as well as social and media scientists.
At the beginning of this event on Friday evening, we mixed the team members and formed small groups of about 8 people and walked through the Oberstadt – Marburg’s city center – where we had dinner in one of the 126 bars.
Saturday morning, we met at the old university building where we were greeted by our supervisor Gert Bange, the director of the LOEWE center for synthetic microbiology Bruno Eckhardt and the coordinator of the international Max-Planch research school Wiebke Wlotzka. Afterwards, every team got the opportunity to present their own project, talk about their arisen problems and exchange experiences to solve them.
In the afternoon, we went to the stairs in front of Marburg’s university canteen at the Lahn and performed several canoe races. Three members of every team competed against the other teams. The final winner was the team from TU Darmstadt in a head-to-head race against team Aachen.
During a barbecue, many discussions about possible improvements and applications for the earlier presented projects arose. In the evening, a celebration was hosted in the inner city. The event was ended with a collective breakfast at the camping site where most of the participants stayed the night.
Overall, the weekend was a really exciting experience for our team and we are looking forward to repeating it in the next year.
"
BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-stage, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder to be in the bottom right of the plane. During the first iteration, we brought the holder to position by traveling the span of the plane fully every time, which caused it to jam into the sides and also stall the motors. From there, we realized that we needed a method for the plane to communicate to the Arduinos in order to stop the motors when it has reached the correct position.
Below are clips of a Creo assembly demonstrating how the XY-stage should be and the first physical iteration of the XY-plane.
Refining Our Design
For the final design of the XY-stage, our team decided to 3D-print all of our supports in order to increase accessibility and decrease to cost of the hardware components of TERRA. All parts were printed using the UPrint SE with ivory ABS stock material. Previously, the holes of the 3D-printed parts were too small, mostly due to the relative inaccuracy of this fabrication method, so the new iteration of the supports include clearance holes rather than tight fit holes.
We also chose to choose standard, close-loop timing belts in order to minimize the problems we were encountering with ensuring the tension in the timing belts were correct and that the belt would not slip over the pulleys. Using closed timing belts also eliminates the problems with gluing together ends of the timing belt.
In order to send our plate holder to the correct position, or its home position, we needed a technical and reliable solution. Our team decided to integrate contact switches to the plane, allowing us to consistently and accurately home our system every time we run a new protocol, ensuring that the output from the microfluidic device dispenses to the correct wells of a microtiter plate. This also allows us to further remove human error from our system. This was done by creating negative features on some of the 3D-printed supports to hold the sensors in place.
The CAD and STL files are available on our GitHub in order to allow users to easily recreate our system.

Repurposing the Syringe Pumps
Our team decided to repurpose Neptune’s syringe pump hardware to develop our control syringe system because the 2016 team had designed and validated a DIY platform for automating syringe movement. Since the syringe pumps were used to gradually push a syringe to dispense at a constant rate in Neptune’s project, they were able to demonstrate a high"

1 Microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
A microbial fuel cell(MFC) is an electrochemical device which converts the chemical energy of fuel to electrical energy by the catalytic actions of microorganisms.[1]
Compared with energy from fossil fuel, such as oil and coal, MFC is of plethora advantages over other kinds of energy generators, e.g. wide sources of reactant, no emissions of environmental polluting gases (such as SOx, NOx, CO2 and CO), high conversion in theory, mild reaction condition, as a result, lack of sonic pollution, and so forth.[2]
Benefited from those merits, MFCs have a wide range of potential applications. For example, MFCs are suitable for powering electrochemical sensors and small telemetry systems to transmit obtained signals to remote receivers while traditional batteries cannot because of restricted lifetime and frequent changes and recharges. Additionally, realistic energetically autonomous would probably be equipped with MFCs that utilize different fuels like sugar, fruit, dead insects, grass and weed. Such systems can solely power itself by MFCs to perform some behavior including motion, sensing, computing and communication. [3]

2 Typical exoelectrogens of MFCs
Several types of biofuel cells including microbial fuel cell and enzymatic biofuel cell have been well documented in the literature. Various microbial or biochemical fuel cells have been developed using Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Proteous vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species and redox enzymes as biocatalysts.[4]
Of all the MFCs above, Shewanella species are best known for extracellular electron transfer(EET). Shewanella, a facultative anaerobe, has been widely used as a model anode biocatalyst in MFCs"
