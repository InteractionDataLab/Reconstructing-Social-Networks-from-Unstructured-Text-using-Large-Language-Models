Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," with yeast, the fimE KO strains appeared to form clumps which precipitated to the bottom of the eppendorf tubes, whilst fimH KO and the fimH KO with the BBa_K1850011 construct did not show any clumps.
Picture 1. Results seen after 1 hour of mixing 500 ul of yeast and E.coli, both grown for 24 hours to saturation. Some minor precipitation has formed in all tubes due to bacterial cells sitting down due to lack of turbulence. * indicates induction with 0.05% rhamnose.
Since the pSB1C3 backbone, in which we received the part BBa_K1850011, is a high copy number plasmid, we wanted to avoid over-expression and the possibility of inclusion body formations by transferring the part to a low copy backbone (pSB1T3) obtained from the part BBa_J04450. This way, our transformed strain possessed both Kanamycin (due to the Keio mutation) and Tetracycline (from pSB1T3) resistance. These bacterial strains were grown in LB Medium with both kanamycin and tetracycline antibiotics and the saturation OD was half  (OD600  1.5) compared to the one of fimH KO and fimE KO strains (OD600 3). In order to have comparative results, we diluted the culture in half (OD600 1.5) and the results remained the same.
Confirmation of fimH 49 KO+ RPMrel expression in the fimH KO strain
To validate the expression of the BBa_K1850011 construct, we grew three fimH KO cultures; two were transformed with the RPMrel containing construct, one of which was induced with rhamnose and the last one was transformed with an RFP insert in the same vector as a negative control. Samples were collected at specific time points from each culture, sonicated,   centrifuged and finally we separated the supernatant that contains the correctly folded proteins from the pellet. We did a Bradford assay to determine the protein concentration of each supernatant. Afterwards, we run on an SDS-Page 25 ug of the total protein from each sample. The image below shows the SDS-Page, stained with Coomasie G250.
According to the literature, we expect the fimH protein to appear at 30 kDa. Because the pRha has been reported to be leaky, a low intensity band is most likely to appear even in the uninduced samples. We also want to prove that increasing the duration"

UESTC-software,2016,Team:UESTC-software#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," way of acquiring new conceptions. Teachers are surprised to see that it isn’t only a kind of edutainment but also an integration of math and biology. In the activity, “To Be Scientists Tomorrow”, we held a Bio2048 game. A parent, as a biology teacher, was delighted in Bio2048, and she thought it was very educational and necessary to be introduced and used in class. Surely, it was a recognition of our work and we are trying our best to realize the idea. We are willing to develop more tools like Bio2048, combining education with interest and focusing on the contents and forms. We believe, our work will influence more people to learn and research biology.
Evaluation of Inspiration
We do Human Practices to practice our thoughts and get inspirations. However, we are surprised to find the effect is bidirectional.
In Puyang lecture, we got the inspiration of our project. At the same time, the operation of building plasmids was an opportunity for the students to stimulate their creativity and imagination. We interviewed the public, it was a way to contact them with science. Some products appear to solve the inconvenience of life. So, everyone should dare to imagine. As to students, their rich imagination was an eye-opener to us. Introducing our ideas to pupils will deepen their understanding of biology and show the great prospects for the development of Biology. These practices arouse people’s interests in biology and make them improve their initiative, especially to the students, who undertake the mission of continuing to move forward.
We can see that our Human Practices are mutually beneficial and win-win.
Impact on Our Scientific Project
Fig.12.Our presentation in iSWU.
Human practice, which is necessary for the birth of a project, means that every design and change should be related to humanity and make more and more practice. Therefore, the impact on our project will be the center we consider and summarize.
When we first tried to make our inspiration come true, we interviewed and asked people for advice, and our instructor, classmates, friends in iGEM Southwest China Union gave us lots of suggestions, which were about icon design, conception definition, user interface, compression algorithm and so on. As the video you can see, the three questions are the origin of our inspiration, which provides continuous ideas and creations for us.
During the interview and invitation, we completed designs, then some interviewers in different occupations including primary school and middle school students, passers-by and teachers, provided their feedback to us, most of which was the feeling of this game and some of them helped us improve our methods.

Public Engagement Entrepreneurship Applied Design
The BrockU iGEM team made significant efforts this year to encourage and promote the exploration of science to students among varying levels of education and to members of our community. Our team was particularly focused on engaging with students in elementary school, as they are young, impressionable and very curious. Throughout our endeavours, we focused on keeping an open and clear dialogue in order to bridge the communication gap between our research and the intrigue of our community.
Please see below for the specific ways in which we spread scientific enthusiasm to our community.
Power Cord
November 12, 2017
One of our members, Marvel (featured on the right), volunteers at the Brock Research and Innovation Centre, where she assits members who have spinal cord injuries and neurological disorders exercise to improve their motor abilities.  Through that position, she also promotes research participation and literacy by informing members of the ongoing research projects at Brock, including the iGEM project, as well as how they can contribute.  Many research projects require participation from people with spinal cord injuries or neurological disorders so these members are very important to reach. Many members participate in research at Brock as a result.

Lambert_GA,2015,Team:Lambert GA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP was expressed in the colonies. RFP was subsequently used to test our foldscope.
Ligation of our constructs into pSB1C3 and pSB1T3 plasmids was carried out and they were transformed with NEB 10 beta E. coli and then placed on chloramphenicol and tetracycline plates respectively to grow. The chloramphenicol transformations were successful and the plates grew colonies. However, the tetracycline transformations did not yield growth. Transformations were carried out again for the pSB1T3 plasmids but again they yielded no results. The colonies on the chloramphenicol plates were taken and grown on liquid cultures, mini prepped and then ran on the gel to find the base pair length of the DNA. Due to the fact that the pSB1C3 plasmid had a similar base pair length with our constructs, the gel was inconclusive. (pSB1C3 has a base pair length of 2070 bp, Fusion construct is 1828 bp, Bidirectional construct is 2118 bp, and Bicistronic construct is 1929 bp and so the base pair length of the constructs could have been covered up by the plasmid base pair length.)

Dnmt1 (731-1602) construct (Song et al., Science 2010) provision by Dr. Bashtrykov upon approval from Prof. Dr. Song. Planning of protein purification with His column and further assays including the proof of cirularisation and activity/specificity
A pRSFDuet-1-derived plasmid encoding murine DNMT1(731-1602) (Song et al., Science 2010) under the control of a T7 promoter was obtained and sequenced. Protein purification was prepared with AG Prof. Dr. Russel (Bioquant). E. coli Rosetta(DE3) were transformed for expression, and induction with IPTG was performed in a 3 l scale.
The constructs for circularization of the truncated DNMT1 were planned using the obtained and verified sequences.
The cells expressing DNMT1 were harvested and lysed by sonication or using a french press.
Primers for the sortase cloning standard were designed and ordered.
The efficiencies of DNMT1 expression and the different lysis methods were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Cloning of circularisation standard construct with sortases proceeded.
Two further lots (1.5 l culture-scale) of mDNMT1(731-1602) were prepared to rule out that the low expression level of the first try was caused by human error. Substrates for the activity assays were designed and ordered.
Native mDNMT1(731-1602) was purified from the first two rounds of expression using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted fractions showed successful expression of Dnmt1(731-1602) at low but detectable levels.
The purification of the native mDNMT1(731-1602) was finished. To verify expression, an analytic gel was made from samples of the purified lots. Nanodrop measure and band portion on the gel was used to estimate concentration of purified linear DNMT1. Material for methylation activity assay was prepared: annealing of DNA substrate, reaction buffer, TAE buffer for polyacrylamid gel.
This week was used to proof feasibility of the methylation assay for DNMT1. We establish the conditions for restriction digest detection via polyacrylamid gel. Starting with pretty bad results of blurry gels, we changed  from TAE to"

We found that our high school’s students share the same opinion about GM food as the general public. There is a basic lack of information about the mechanisms of GM food production and function, which leads to misunderstanding about the subject. After seeing the importance of promoting GM food, we collaborated with the school magazine Imaginist.
School magazine - Imaginist
We reached out to Imaginist, our school magazine, to discuss the legitimacy of GM food. In the October issue of the magazine, we presented a positive but objective opinion towards GM food. We argued that for different cases, where different GM food is designed according to various types of mechanisms, some mechanisms are rational and may lead to a reliable improvement of the product. At the same time, some GM food may result from random mutations. We need to examine GM food carefully before it appears in supermarkets, but advantages of GM food should also be acknowledged properly.
Club
Joining clubs and student organizations provides students the opportunity to work with their peers, explore complex issues not encountered in the classroom, and to be part of something larger than the seats they occupy in the classrooms.  We established iGEM club within our school in order to spread knowledge of genetic technology. We have organized two activities this year: knowledge lecturing and experimentation.
Many members of our club are unaware of basic molecular biology concepts such as applications associated with DNA, ribosomes, and the basic principle of the central dogma of biology. Therefore, we offered three lectures to provide a brief view of biology at the molecular level.
In the first session, we introduced the concept of synthetic biology. Beginning with the cell theory of Leeuwenhoek, we showed how human interpretation of living organisms changed and how we use biochemistry as a tool to understand organisms at a molecular level. We also incorporated the core concepts of bioengineering: modularization and standardization.
In our second and third meetings, our lecturers showed the whole process of a typical genetic engineering experiment, from obtaining the genetic sequences, to cloning:  building vectors, transformation, and finally identification. We wanted our club members to know how the common technology is used in genetic technology, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), aids in understanding the purpose of our machine and its abundant usefulness. Since these concepts are abstract, we presented them through text, pictures, and videos. After each lecture, we provided a Q&A section, helping club members better understand these concepts.

RNA-based Delay: Biosynthetic AND gate
It has been proved that in transcriptional cascades the responses in time can vary among individual cells in a population, the loss of synchronization suggests the need for additional regulation devices [ 4 ] such as autoregulatory motifs or feed-back loops. In our project we decided to apply an extra control based on RNA and post-transcriptional control.
It has been shown how RNA molecules play important roles in regulatory mechanisms. Nowadays, synthetic biologists have elucidated many features of these molecules and have re-engineered them in order to increase or give new biological functions [ 6 ]. Besides, the modularity present in different biological circuits and logic gates analogous to those from electric components has allowed building biological components. One example of this, and in which we are interested, is biological AND gates. In this kind of components, the output depends on the presence of two inputs [ 7 ]. Riboregulators are RNA molecules which can perform both features, expression control and AND gate configurations. Therefore, we plan to construct a delay-device based on riboregulators (figure 9).
Figure 9. Biosynthetic AND gate. Combining an AND gate configuration and RNA-based post-transcriptional regulation, a device which might allows us to produce a delay is shown. Only when the key and the lock + ribosome binding site + GFP gene are together the output can be generated.
Preliminary approaches
Riboregulator
In bacteria, several factors affect translation initiation, including ribosomal recognition of the mRNA’s RBS and the start codon (AUG). Recognizing the importance of RNA interactions between the ribosome and RBS, and based on work on endogenous riboregulators, Isaacs et al. [ 8 ] sought to regulate bacterial gene expression by interfering with ribosomal docking at the RBS. From the outset, their objective was to create a modular post transcriptional regulation system that could be integrated into biological networks and implemented"

Welcome
Welcome to iGEM 2011 at UC Davis!
The four of us have been hard at work on this year's project. We've fine tuned a powerful (and simple) part family generation process, and used it to expand the functionality of the LacI promoter, R0010. We also mutated GFP!
In addition, we developed KO3D , an interactive, cross-platform javascript plotting library for displaying scientific data on the web in 3D.
We had a great time at the regional competition in Indianapolis and look forward to seeing all of the other teams at the World Championship at MIT!
Our Project
This is the third time a team at UC Davis has competed in the iGEM Jamboree. This year, we are focusing on foundational advances for BioBrick circuit synthesis. Part families, groups of parts with a unified function and differeing characteristics, are some of the most useful parts of the registry. Our project aims to streamline the process of expanding basic parts into part families, from promoters to protein-coding genes.
We set out to create useful mutant libraries of commonly used parts, starting with the repressible LacI promoter. You can read more about our project here.
We think that thorough characterization should be a priority for all parts submitted to the registry . You can view information about our project here . You can also review our characterization process and characterization data for LacI on our data page.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,". First, the plants must be clutivated for months in government-inspected facilities; then, the low quantities of target cannabinoids (THC and/or CBD) must be extracted and purified to form the final product. To make matters worse, plants tend to make several variations of the target compound rather than just one; this further reduces the yield, and doesn't really match the strict manufacturing standards of other pharmaceutical products, such as aspirin or paracetamol.
Ultimately, the drawbacks of this so-called ""pharming"" technique mean that these products must be sold at higher prices. However, several companies are now unlocking the power of synthetic biology to make the production of cannabinoids easier. A front-runner in this is GW pharmaceuticals - by mutating genes within the Cannabis plant to alter their activity, they have been able to adjust the relative proportions of different cannabinoids that the plant produces.
The flow chart below shows how the biosynthesis of each product is controlled by each of four regions (known as ""loci"") within the nuclear DNA of the plant. As you can see in the shaded region, the relationship between certain loci and the cannabinoid synthesis pathway is still not fully understood!
The aim of GW pharmaceuticals is to alter the activity of these loci, and therefore bias the cannabinoid synthesis pathway towards the production of CBD and THC, so that the yield from their plants can be increased. Using the products from their plants, GW pharma is selling a drug called Sativex (which contains an approximate 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD in an alcoholic solution) to help combat spasticity in multiple sclerosis sufferers; this drug has been legalised in several countries including the UK, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy. Sativex is also being trialled for use in the alleviation of nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and has proved very successful so far.
So GW pharmaceuticals could be on to something, and for more information on the biochemistry of the cannabis biosynthesis pathway, check out the footnote at the end of this article. However, perhaps a more exciting prospect for cannabinoid synthesis is being studied by the research group Hyasynth Bio. They are attempting to engineer yeast that can make any one of the dozens of cannabinoids found in the natural plant. They believe this platform could be used to supply cannabinoid compounds for pharmaceutical applications faster, cheaper, and more safely than through pharming methods!
So, it appears that Cannabis can have several uses away from the recreational scene, and may prove extremely beneficial to sufferers of diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. If you want to read more synthetic"

Additionally, we constructed fundamental frameworks composed of the Monobody or Nanobody constant regions, which can easily be extended for creating a specific binding protein or even your own library, as it is discribed in the following text. For that you only had to design your specific variable regions and get them synthesized in one or more parts.
Create your Monobody library:
To create your own Monobody library, we constructed a fundamental framework ( BBa_K2082000 ) composed of the Monobody constant regions and RFP instead of variable regions, which can easily be exchanged with randomized variable segments. Due to this, an easy selection trough visual control is possible. To insert self-constructed variable regions, you have to design a randomized insert with fitting overlaps to the adjacent constant Monobody sequences (Fig. 1). To integrate them, by replacement of RFP, the backbone with constant parts ( BBa_K2082000 ) should be amplified by using the primers MB-bb-fw and MB-bb-rev . Afterwards the variable fragments, containing overlaps, can get inserted in the gained backbone by Gibson assembly.
Figure 1: Overview of the Monobody construction. An individual insert can get integrated in the Monobody CDS. Constant regions are colored in green, variable regions are colored in blue.
Create your Nanobody library:
For creation of a unique Nanobody library you can use our framework, containing the constant Nanobody segments ( BBa_K2082001 ). In this case, it is only necessary to create one variable segment, because in the used scaffold , we have only randomized the sequence of the third Complementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the main binding CDR . Amplifying BBa_K2082001 with primers NB-bb-fw and NB-bb-rev results to a backbone, to insert a double stranded and overlapping variable insert by Gibson assembly, to built a unique Nanobody library.
Figure 1: Overview of the Nanobody construction.Variable CDR 3 is colored in blue.
Implementing diversity
It would push the iGEM parts registry forward and help future iGEM teams, if it would be possible to submit several plasmid libraries, encoding different binding proteins, enzymes, aptamers, or other useful proteins. So all following iGEM teams can build on it and screen the diversity for their desired protein with custom properties"
Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the RFP ( BBa_E1010 ) we wanted to implement in our Cre reporter cassette works as expected, the RFP was cloned into the pTUM104 vector under the control of the pGAL1 promoter. Yeast cells were transformed with this construct and grown in medium with 2% galactose. The RFP fluorescence intensity was then determined in the plate reader. We used different media to resuspend the cells after centrifugation (as indicated in figure 1).
Figure 1: Relative fluorescence units normalised to OD600. Data were obtained from 3 independent biological replicates.
In figure 1 one can see that the RFP-construct containing cells show a significantly higher RFP fluorescence than the wild type cells. In addition to that, it shows that the media for resuspension does not strongly influence the  fluorescence.
In order to check fluorescence of the Cre reporter cassette we expressed the complete construct ( BBa_K1680025 ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the pTUM100 plasmid ( BBa_K801000 ). Microscopy images show that RFP is expressed in these cells (see figure 2).
Figure 2: Fluorescence and brightfield pictures of cells expressing the Cre reporter stop cassette. The left picture shows the bright field channel, the middle picture the RFP channel and the right picture the overlay of both channels.
Analysis of the Cre reporter cassette
In order to assess the function of our Cre reporter regarding recombination, a plasmid containing the stop cassette was digested with EcoRI and PstI to get linearised backbone DNA and the stop cassette DNA. Then, purified Cre recombinase was added and incubated at 37°C. At certain time points samples were taken, heat inactivated and loaded on an agarose gel.
We expected that the backbone DNA (around 5 kb) stays unaffected (except possible DNAse contaminations in the purified Cre recombinase) in all samples, while the stop cassette (around 3 kb) should show a shift of approximately 1 kb (DNA size between the two loxP sites). In addition to that, a 1kb circularized DNA fragment should be visible. Figure 3 shows the experimental results.
Figure 3: Agarose gel showing the Cre reporter cassette incubated with Cre recombinase.
It can be seen that the backbone DNA fragment stays unaffected during the experiment, while the stop cassette DNA fragment intensity slightly decreases. Furthermore, after 60 and 90 minutes an additional fragment can be seen at around 2 kb, which represents the"

Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
Project design safety
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. Because the core of our project is  allowing bacteria to commit suicide. Considering biosafety, firstly we selected Escherichia coli as the host cell when implementing the project. To avoid the number of pathogenicity, we limited its number under a specific range. Second, we selected the toxic protein which does no harm to human body. Third, in the process of implementation of the project we chose the RFP as a reporter gene which can be detected directly without adding any harmful reagents. At last, we even used inducible promoters to control the expression of toxin protein genes in gene circuits.
Lab Safety
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli strain DH5α and E. coli Top 10 are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pSB1C3, pKD46, pKD3, pSB3K3, pSB1K3, pSB4K5 for E. coli) are not harmful for humans.
See more in Notebook / Equipments & Materials
Because of the nature of our project,  contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:
① Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
② Don’t deal with the wastes at random.
③ All experimenter must wear protective equipment such as gloves and Lab coat.
④ All equipments that came into contact with biological material (such as tips and glass glassware) must be autoclaved.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli KRX carrying a fusion protein consisting of ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, ferredoxinbisd and cytochrome P450bisd differ from the cultivations with the other BPA degrading BioBricks. Thus, the model for these cultivations has to be adjusted to this behaviour. First of all, no diauxic growth is observed so the growth can be modeled more easily like
(6)
The BPA degradation starts when the imaginary substrate is depleted, like observed in the other cultivations with BPA degrading BioBricks. But it seems that the BPA degradation is getting slower with longer cultivation time. So it is modeled with a Monod-like term in which the specific BPA degradation rate is dependent from the BPA concentration:

with the maximal specific BPA degradation rate qD,max and the constant KD.
Figures 13 shows a comparison between modeled and measured data for cultivations with BPA degrading fusion protein E. coli. In Tab. 1 the parameters for the model are given, obtained by curve fitting the model to the data.

4.7 Sensitivity, Privacy Invasion and Minimal Invasivity
With our sequencing method we have been able to detect a single molecule of EPO doping DNA form a 3.45 nM sample. Further protocol optimization will thereby make our analysis even more sensitive. Additionally, with some optimization, our prescreen can detect up to 29 fM of doping DNA ( Baetsen-Young, et al 2018 ), making the complete approach into a very sensitive method.
Furthermore, we made an extensive model of the response of the human body to different administration methods of gene doping. From this model we derived the most likely ways in which athletes would be gene doping and established a detection window based on our sensitivity. From the analysis, we found that we will always be able to detect gene doping. Therefore, the gene doping screening could be uptaken in the regular doping testing programs and will not entail further privacy invasion of athletes.
Lastly, we have been focussing on blood for the extraction of cell free DNA. The professional athletes we spoke to however indicated that urine testing is the predominant form of testing. Therefore, we looked into urine based cell free DNA testing. According to Casadio et al 2017 , cell free DNA concentrations of up to 138 ng/µL can be found in urine samples.  We are therefore confident that in the near future our method can be extended to urine samples with an adapted sample preparation.

The software is also able to compute the maximum amount of base pairs that can be modified in the bacteria which corresponds to 400,320 bp.

Collaborations
We collaborate with teams from all over the world. We send our message and key to the teams Wageningen and Eindhoven, we analyzed a BioBrick for Wageningen and we filled in a few surveys. In addition we also send a survey to a lot of teams, which has also been translated to Chinese, thanks to XMU-China. Finally, we helped translating protocols to Dutch for METU HS Ankara.
Read more about our collaborations.
Education
After a survey we found that 26% of the respondents did not know what bacteria are. We set it as our aim to enhance public awareness of bacteria and of genetic engineering to overcome this problem. Therefore, we invited more than 150 students into our lab to do some Bio-Art with colourful bacteria and gave a lecture about CryptoGErM. In addition, we guided/supervised several students in their high school thesis. They did their first cloning with GFP in E. coli and B. subtilis and experienced pros and cons of  working with the different bacteria. After the Giant Jamboree we will be giving lectures about our project during a science event in Groningen.
Read more about our educational part.
Outreach
To communicate our project to general society we gave an interview on the local radio, engaged with them at the night of art and science, had a feature in the university paper and in the magazine of the biology study association. We had more visual representation through a videoclip made by Unifocus and even reached the national news agency (NOS). More in-depth communication of our project to the scientific society was conducted at a barbecue  organised for the staff of the university, workshops at the Utrecht campus party and a presentation during the Dutch Biotechnology Conference and at the Groninger Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute (GBB).

We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
6. After receiving the primers, you are ready to perform the PCR (see protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR ). Be aware that the addition of the linker to the primer may increase the melting temperature of the primer.

Seamless assembly
Seamless assembly is often required when constructing fusion protein or if large genetic parts have to be assembled in pieces, e.g. when constructing  complex enzymes and synthases for fungi.
1. If you want to design a construct where all parts are seamlessly assembled go directly to step 2. Otherwise the standard linkers should be added to the parts that do not need to be fused seamless according to the linker table . For more details see the 'creating new parts' section.
2. To design the primers for the seamless assembly the software PHUSER can be used. This software was created by the DTU iGEM team from 2009.

Designing a Device to Characterize Starvation-Based Genetic Part
AUG - SEPT 2016 | A collaboration with the Northeastern 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
We designed a microfluidic device for Northeastern University's iGEM team to help characterize their starvation-induced genetic part, by flowing cells through a set of cell traps placed after a gradient generator, then flowing two variable amounts of nutrients through the inputs of the gradient generator, causing a variable amount of nutrients to hit each cell trap, and cause a variable expression level of the starvation-linked fluorescence. Unfortunately, due to difficulties on both sides, the device and the cells to put through it were never realized. The preliminary sketches and designs are shown here, however.
Open Source Materials and Synthetic Biology
Open source materials encourage a cooperative and connected community in any field of research. It allows individuals and labs to easily share their ideas for others to build off of and can inspire even greater creations. So we teamed up with the BU 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team to investigate the current place of open source materials in Synthetic biology and how, moving forward, open source materials could impact the direction of the field. We recorded our findings biweekly through posts in a collaborative blog entitled ""Who Owns What"".

Our Petal Death Protein (PDP) part (BBa_K179200) was design to produce a modest amount of Oxalic acid. The PDP gene was obtained from Dianthus caryophyllus (Carnation) (Clove pink). PDP catalyzes the production of Oxalic acid from Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate + H2O = oxalic acid + acetate. The first 3 amino acids represent a propeptide and are not included in the PDP sequence. The PDP gene is under control of the constitutively active medium transcription promoter (J23107) and a strong RBS (B0034). This combination was chosen to allow us to tune the amount of oxalic acid produced through control of PDP production. Mutation of the transcription promoter to strong or weak activity will result in more or less PDP production and subsequent changes in oxalic acid production. The same principle can be applied to the RBS from strong to medium to weak. We tuned the oxalic acid production to achieve mite death at the lowest possible concentration while preventing any possible harm to bee health.

Arizona_State,2012,Team:Arizona State#FieldApplications_-_-_TEXT.html," in an ideal environment where they are able to grow readily. Although E.coli can be present in water does not mean an outbreak will occur. Our biosensor would ideally be able to detect these pathogens no matter how many colonies were present. Although an outbreak may not occur, the water could still be monitored more closely to prevent an outbreak.
How many tests should be done for an outbreak?
In each of the case studies that were researched, it became apparent that each outbreak has its own characteristics. For example, in 2011, there was an outbreak that took place in Germany where there was a very high rate of expression in adults, especially women (Rohde). Since each outbreak is unique in its own way, it is difficult to determine how many tests should be done to determine the severity of the outbreak. According to a case study about an outbreak that took place in Alpine, Wyoming, physicians were seeing an increased rate of patients who presented with bloody diarrhea (Olsen). More cases began showing up not only in Wyoming, but also in the states Utah and Washington (Olsen). Prior to the outbreak, the Alpine municipal water system was tested multiple times each month for coliform counts. In this case, they were positive for E.coli in the months April, May, and June (Olsen). It was not until late June that the outbreak occurred, and by middle of July they had found the source of this occurrence. Once the outbreak was detected, stool samples from infected patients were then sent to a lab for further testing. From the time that the outbreak began to the time that the source was found was about 3-4 weeks (Olsen). During this time, tests were being done by multiple agencies such as the Wyoming State laboratory and the Utah Department of Health State Laboratory (Olsen). Using the biosensor that our team has developed, the severity of the outbreak would be extremely decreased. Although regular water samples are taken, once the water tested positive for pathogens, water contamination warnings should have been implemented in ensure that an outbreak was minimalized. With the biosensor designed by the ASU iGEM team, our biosensor would be pathogen specific to detect whether that pathogen is present or not in water. Our biosensor would be able detect pathogens in water within minutes of running the experiment. This would greatly decrease the amount of people that potentially could get sick.
What are the current practices?
E.coli outbreaks have been known to occur in different sources, such as food, water, and plants. It has been shown that before an outbreak takes place in water, there are usually signs of E.col"
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so on. To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital. She did a lot of researches related to antibiotic resistance. She introduce that currently antibiotic resistance is a really urgent issue that needed to be treated seriously. For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics. We introduced our project and explained our goal of establishing a markerless integration visual selection system. She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance. She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice. Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.
Collaborations
SCU-China:The project of SCU-China focused on the antibacterial deodorant insole. However, they met some trouble in microbes. Therefore, using our advantages, we helped them verify the antimicrobial effect of the insole. At the same time, we found our mathematical modeling unsatisfactory, so we invited their talented group members to provide technical guidance for us.
UESTC-software:UESTC-software encountered problems when synthesizing DNA primers,so we helped them. Additionally, considering that we had several models, we hoped to achieve visualization of the models by using software.

Southwest Union:After five months of experiments, our project began to take shape. Meanwhile, we have just received a meet-up invitation from the Southwest Union (iGEM meet-up in southwest China). Simulating the final round, this meeting set up presentation, poster exhibition and free discussion. Together with the SCU-China, UESTC-China, UESTC-software and SICAU-China, we knew much detailed information about the competition, such as the progress and the judging criteria. All the teams exchanged suggestions with each other and build up deep friendship.
CCiC Conference:As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams"

That way, the money needed would be resourced back to research facilities, like the one his son was a participant, and they could continue to work on finding a cure. So, Senator Smith and his campaign managers began to devise a plan, and that’s how his platform became one that focuses on a healthier tomorrow for all!! Behind the scenes: Senator Smith had a friend that was doing research in vector-borne diseases for an environmental health company. Over dinner one evening, the friend shared his inside information about the advances that were being made to identify vector borne diseases. The friend shared how there was a device that could potentially be life changing because not only could it detect current vector-borne diseases but also it could potentially detect future diseases. This was the answer to Mr. Smith’s question of how to get people to rally behind the push to do research and development, especially in light of the recent outbreak!
The plan in motion: Mr. Smith met with his friend and told him about his plan to invest in research and how he needed to get people to see this was a crucial topic. He needed people to vote for him. His friend knew the sorrow he was experiencing, and could hear the desperation in his voice so he said he would help him. After all, he thought what harm would it really cause (but he didn’t know to what extremes Mr. Smith would go to get what he wanted). During this meeting, the friend let Mr. Smith in on a secret…He told him that there were other states besides Florida that were under surveillance for infected mosquitoes and that Texas and New Mexico might have the next outbreaks. Later that week, Senator Smith was granted access to data before it was released to the population. Pursuing the lead from his friend, his initial idea took on a new light… He focused on the data from Texas and New Mexico and saw that certain parts of states were under surveillance. He paid close attention to two very popular national parks that were closed, due to this investigation. (Remember, this was information that was confidential and the public would not have access to this information. It was only for security cleared personnel.) “It is not too big of a lie to tell people that their states are infected with arboviruses since it will likely be the case in a short time”, he told his team. So one of his friends who is a computer engineer decided to enter new data in the database so it would appear that Texas and New Mexico were highly infected areas with arboviruses. The aftermath: A few days later"

The marker excision protocol was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section for both strains, here named:
Original name
Name after marker excision
MC-RFP
MC-RFPflip
MG-RFP
MG-RFPflip
Three colonies grown after the overnight incubation at 43°C (step 4 of marker excision protocol) were analyzed for each plate. These 6 clones were called MC-RFPflip-A,B,C and MG-FRPflip-A,B,C.
Validation of the loss of pCP20 and the resistance marker: all the 6 picked colonies failed to grow on both Amp (100 ug/ml) media and Cm (12.5 ug/ml) media. They could only grow in LB without antibiotics, thus validating that the pCP20 helper had been actually cured and the R6K-CmR DNA containing the Chloramphenicol selection marker had been actually eliminated.
Validation of the length of the integrated part: colony PCR was performed for all the 6 clones, using MC1061 and MG1655 without integrants as negative controls. Primer pairs VF2/VR and P1/P4 were used to validate if the passenger of interest was still present in the genome and the length of the entire Phi80 locus respectively after the marker excision.

Figure 7: colony PCR with P1/P4 on all the 6 flipped clones. The blank is the reaction mix without bacteria. Expected amplicon for correct construct in the correct position: 2.3 Kb. Expected amplicon for the non-integrant strain MG1655: 546 bp.
PCR results with primers VF2/VR showed that all the 6 clones still contain the passenger of interest, i.e. PconRFP, in the genome after the marker excision. The reaction blank, the MG1655 strain (neg control) and also the other samples showed some extra bands, but the ~1.2Kb amplicons of MC-RFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C had the correct length and was much brighter than the other bands.

4.Results
Model 1 : Release
We chose two variables to find the best  release amount of phage after helper phage infecting. The first variable is the  time after we input helper phages M13KO7 into E.coli (JM101) with phagemid pBluescript II SK(-).(We have put BBa_I13521 inside as an reporter gene.)This is the time for helper phages to infect bacterium.
After the infection, we added kanamycin  into these JM101 for selection becauseJM101  can get kanamycin resistance only when they are infected by M13KO7. Then we  incubated these JM101 so they can have time to release phagemid-carrying phage,  and the incubating time is the second variable in our test.
As we can see in this figure, the most  amount of phage being released is at the time when we add kanamycin after 30  minutes of infection and then incubate them for 14 hours. Under this condition,  the best releasing amount of phage is 4×1010 pfu/ml.
This modleing is been helper by NCTU-Formosa. They  analyzed our data and made this modeling.
Thanks NCTU-Formosa!!! You are our best friend!
Fig4.1  Model1
 
 
Model 2 : Infection Rate
Then we came up with another question: Under  which condition will we get the best infection rate of our phagemid-carrying  phage? We believe this is influenced by the MOI between phages and bacterium.  MOI means multiplicity of infection, it is the ratio of agents (phage-carrying  phage) to infection targets (E.coli JM101). So we choose MOI as the variable, and incubate bacterium for 1 hour  after infecting.
In our test, we found that as long as the  MOI is higher than 6 pfu/cfu, the infection rate can access 100%. This is an  exciting result!!

Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
We tried to compensate for yesterdays delays. Thias performed a PCR reaction on short BioBrick inserts of J61100, J61101, J61107, J61117, J61127 and B0034. We wanted to investigate if this would save time in the long-run compared to transforming and plasmid isolation. The PCR reaction was run at varying annealing temperatures to figure out which temperature gave the best result.
After analysis on gel we deduced that a temperature of 50 °C was optimal.
At the end of the day we performed a Restriction digestion reaction on the amplified PCR products as well as the previously isolated I13401 and pSB3C5:

These are parts of successful results of mating mentioned above.
To sum up, the mating switcher can be presented in kinds of yeast with different forms. This proved that our Mating switcher was fast, flexible and efficient.
Meantime, we cultured the transformed yeast in 5mL liquid SC-Leu at 30℃ and 220 rpm for 12 hours ( Take three samples at a time). We used one sample for centrifugation to precipitate the yeast and the remaining two remained unchanged. The difference was the fluorescence value we need, then we calculated the average value of them. The excitation wavelength was set at 540nm and the emission wavelength was set at 635nm. Hereafter, we measured the yeast concentration at OD600. At last, we divided the fluorescence value by OD600 to normalize the value and the result data was as follows.
Fig.2-9. Normalized fluorescence value was calculated by dividing fluorescent value by cell concentration(OD600)
Fig.2-9 Normalized fluorescence value was calculated by dividing fluorescent value by cell concentration(OD600)
From the data we can found that the fluorescence intensity of the modified yeast was more than twice that of the wild type. Low red fluorescence was detected after yeast mating, which can be attributed to the influence of β-carotene.
DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
Our mating switch plays an important role in many respects, such as including heavy metal treatment and cell signal switching. And we created a novel method to prove the effectiveness of the switch in an intuitive and effective way. The terminator of the first part (PVUVC) terminates the expression of the downstream gene, proving the validity of the switcher, and the second part (PVRVC) creates an evident method of color conversion to determine the state of the switcher.
Aiming to increase the Vika-vox system efficiency, we let Vika enzyme saturate expression, but the efficiency was still relatively low. We hypothesized that this phenomenon was caused by degradation of the Vika enzyme in the YPD culture medium. We’d better change the composition or proportion of YPD ingredients to find out the best culture conditions. We are looking forward to more research in this field so that we can make this system work better and even perfectly.
We use the RFP as the reporting protein. But there exists a drawback that it’s detected with an expensive device. A more intuitive reporting strategy need to be developed, maybe it can be seen by bare eyes like E.coli in the near future.

The third plasmid, p3, had a Chloramphenicol resistance and a high-copy-number origin of replication.  The p3 plasmid contained two devices.  The first device was a Lac promoter followed by a medium strength Ribosome Binding Site, in turn followed by the coding sequence for the LsrR regulatory protein and a terminator.  The second device was a pLsrA2 promoter followed by a medium-strength Ribosome Binding Site, in turned followed by the coding sequence for a red fluorescent protein (RFP).  The p3 plasmid was used only in the LSR-based inverter system under study (i.e., p1+p3).
The following steps were carried out for each individual plasmid:  Synbiota RDP assembly, transformation into the DH5-alpha strain of E. coli, streaking onto LB-agar plates with selective antibiotics, colony PCR, overnight incubation using selective antiobiotics, glycerol stock preparation and plasmid min-prep.  The DH5-alpha strain of E. coli was chosen because it was LuxS-negative.  As such, the E. coli in the systems under study would not produce the AI-2 quorum sensing molecule and interfere with the intended experiment.  The E. coli transformed with p1 were rendered competent and transformed with p2 and p3 to obtain p1+p2 (control) and p1+p3 (Lsr-based inverter) two-plasmid systems, respectively.  The doubly-transformed cells were plated, colony-selected, and had glycerol stocks prepared.  Then fresh 5mL overnights of the control and Lsr-test systems were commenced in LB plus Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol and either 0mM or 1mM IPTG (for a total of four overnights).

Our target audience are patients with a viral infection. The corresponding doctors acting as the intermediates. We also plan to sell stocks to governments in order to fight a sudden outbreak in the fastest and most efficient way with a minimum of infections. Health is and will always be one of the greatest treasures in life and we want to preserve it.
Market and competition:
In the beginning, the market was rather small due to its focus mostly on small research teams. But due to the recent of new viruses like Denge, Ebola and most recently Zika the demand risen significantly. The more frequent appearances of several epidemic viruses are alarming and as a reaction to that more and more researchers choose to further tackle the new threat. So the demand is on the rise. The market itself is always changing as soon as a new method is introduced. Several groups are testing new procedures and systems. When it proves to be sufficient, it is fast adapted by everybody in the field. The competition we will face are producers and license holder of current antibodys and antibody production methods. These still involve immunization of animals like rabbits or mice. This can only be done by specially equipped labsor ordered from a producer of antibodies. These already available methods are time consuming and expensive. We offer a cheap and fast method that can be applied even in small labs. We can also easily modify our system to the clients likes and demands while current producers are more limited in their product range. Because our system is aimed mostly at research groups, there are only a few barriers to enter the market. We are acting as the intermediates before clinical applications. For research use only products have very few limitations for example the declaration of dangerous chemicals or GMOs which handling procedures have to be added.
Goals:
We intend to provide researchers with the sufficient equipment to start their research and quickly produce results that can be medically applied. The system was designed to focus on a wide range of targets. Furthermore, it can be used in various fields of research and in a lot of contexts. Our vision is easy accessible binding proteins that are quickly available and affordable for small labs. Therefore, even a small research groups with a limited budget can use it. Our short time goal is to quickly introduce our system to the market and collect as much feedback as possible to further improve our Evobody production. The longtime goal is to establish our system as the starting point for all target or binding protein related research. We also want to develop our range of products and offer sites for fusion proteins to widen the field of applications.

Density
The cultures were grown overnight. In the morning, the absorption was measured to compare population growth. All tubes were cloudy with cultures apart from the control.  Both strains in minimal medium grew at the same rate, proving that the indole-free strain was still vigorous. For both strains the minimal medium + casamino acids contained approximately twice the bacteria concentration as the minimal medium alone.  This was expected as the lack of tryptophan and inability to communicate population number via indole production restricts the growth of bacteria. There was no significant difference in population concentration between the tryptophan and tryptophan free medium for the E. coli TnaA knockout strain. This is understandable as indole is used as a primitive quorum sensing molecule which allows E. coli to control its growth rate with regard to population density. With the ability to produce indole removed, tryptophan availability is no longer as big an advantage. There was a slight increase in population for the wild type E. coli grown with tryptophan compared to those grown without it. This shows tryptophan does limit to some degree the growth of bacteria but not very much.
Odour
To compare scent given off, all cultures were grown to the same optical density. When this was achieved, the tubes were smelt blind by different people outside our own lab. The E. coli TnaA knockout strain, when grown without tryptophan, had a pleasant odour which has been described as having 'smokey notes'  and 'reminiscent of squished grapes'. The smell is very distinct from the faecal smell produced by wild type E. coli strains grown with tryptophan, and different but not hugely so from the smell of wild type E. coli grown in the minimal medium without tryptophan.
The wild type E. coli smelled only very mildly in the tryptophan free minimal medium but of course had the full pungent toilet smell that we expect when incubated with tryptophan.
Conclusion
1- The TnaA knockout strain grew as quickly as the standard E. coli strain, thus demonstrating its fecundity. This strain did not produce such a pungent smell showing that indole is in large part the culprit.
2- E. coli grown on minimal medium produces drastically lower amounts of indole, skatole and other foul-smelling tryptophan derivatives, and therefore have a less pungent smell.
The culture in minimal medium took 6h longer to reach the given population density than those grown in LB"

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#MAGE_-_-_TEXT.html,". subtilis strains
Overview
Compared to E. coli, the B. subtilis has more native NRPS’, therefore it has more NRP precursors natively available. Proof and optimization of MAGE in B. subtilis would be valuable knowledge for developing novel NRPS’. To proof the concept of MAGE in B. subtilis we designed oligos that could introduce a point mutation in the s12 subunit of the ribosome, inducing streptomycin resistance [1]. In order for MAGE (Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering) to work at a high efficiency, a strain with inserted recombinase and inhibited or knocked out mismatch repair gene has to be used [2]. In our project, two different recombinases were used: a recombination protein Beta from the E. coli phage Lambda, which was codon optimized for B. subtilis 168, and GP35, a recombinase from the B.subtilis phage SPP1 [3]. The mismatch repair proteins known as MutS and MutL were knocked out by transforming pSB1C3_recombinase plasmid into the B. subtilis W168. Since the MutL protein is dependent on the binding of MutS, the knockout of the mutS disables the function of the MutL protein [4].
Four Bacillus subtilis strains which expressed a recombinase were created by genetically engineering the wild type strain 168:
∆amyE::beta-neoR
∆amyE::GP35-neoR
∆mutS::beta-neoR
∆mutS::GP35-neoR
The growth of all the mutants was compared to the wild type to test for growth bias. The growth of ∆mutS::GP35-neoR, ∆amyE::beta-neoR and ∆amyE::GP35-neoR was shown to be faster growing than the wild type strain.
 
Achievements
We made the following four B. subtilis strains
∆amyE::beta-neoR
∆amyE::GP35-neoR
∆mutS::beta-neoR
∆mutS::GP35-neoR
 
Methods
All the strain were made by homologous recombineering. For this purpose four different plasmids were assembled. Two plasmids contained homologous regions to up- and downstream of mutS and two plasmids containing homologous regions to the amyE locus. "

The following are the experiment results:
For the matlab program, since we only have the absorbance of GFP, the curve fitting step becomes difficult. Still, we use the open source, OPI tool box to solve the dynamic model parameters. We’ll now show the following parts by steps.

He also has experience working with the EPA in Taiwan on wastewater treatments. We interviewed Mr. Brown about our methods to clean NPs in WWTPs and how to achieve our goal of implementation. With his expertise in the field of wastewater treatment, he provided us some suggestions as to how we could turn our project into reality.
For example, we asked him if there were differences between rural and urban plants that we should take into consideration when thinking about implementing our project. He responded that the biological processes used for treatment remains the same regardless of facility size. This helped us think about and design our final prototype, which can potentially be used in both rural and urban treatment plants.

Size Verification for M1-12(1C3)
Digested 1 ug of each  of the sequence verified plasmid from yesterday with EcoRI and PstI in a 50 uL reaction.
Used NEBuffer 2.1
Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hours, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Run 15 uL of digest on 1% TAE gel, with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Size Analysis of Putative M1-12(1C3). The expected size for a digested 12-mer is 1324 bp. The expected size for a digested 9-mer is 1018 bp. The expected size for digested pSB1C3 is 2029 bp. The slight size difference ins sequence sample 4 is due to the inclusion of the T7 promoter-RBS sequence from BBa_K525998.
Results indicate that what we believed to be M1-12(1C3) is in reality M1-9(1C3). This results is most likely due to contamination during the transformation process, possibly from the glass beads used to spread bacteria.

BostonU,2015,Team:BostonU#Mammalian synbio#Current Challenges_-_-_TEXT.html," of a barrier. Such a team might instead settle on a “less optimal” chassis. In contrast, teams that do actually perform research in the most optimal possible chassis may have a slight advantage with judging, but are not necessarily formally rewarded for doing so.
Here, we have presented some key problems or issues that we believe might currently be surrounding mammalian synthetic biology work in the iGEM community. Read on further to look at some of the preliminary solutions we have proposed as a first step in thinking about this challenge."
ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". We successfully simplify the three-plasmid system based on our reference, and obtain a good result. After adding two inducers, fluorescence value changed apparently. Its response time is around 2 hours. After coupling with the light-induced system, the overall response time can be matched up with the oscillation period.         Meanwhile, logic gate system has some problems. Firstly, T7ptag has a high possibility of leak, possibly caused by pBAD, or by E.coil’s endogenous tRNA.         Secondly, we integrate the logic gate input and output parts together in a single plasmid. And these two systems may have mutual negative effect.         Thirdly, the logic gate plasmid is relatively large and according to the references, the tRNA we used is toxic and may cause damage to the cell. That makes our bacteria grow relatively slow.         
6.Future Plan
        (1)Change Promoters. Due to the inequality of these two circuits, we have constructed a plasmid (Bba_K1886016) to change the position of plac and pbad promoters. After verifying the changed logic gate, we could learn more about its precision. And thus, we can explore the influence caused by input circuits towards the whole logic gate.         (2)Integrate with the light-induced system to verify the cipher machine’s function (first generation).We have already constructed a plasmid using light-induced promoter to replace an existent one. Next, after co-transformation with bacteria, we can verify the response time of the integrated system (light-induced + logic gate), and thus, verify the cipher machine’s basic function in its first generation.         (3)Integrate with the light-induced system, and the oscillation system, to verify the function of Enigma.We have already constructed a plasmid (Bba_K1886010，Bba_K1886011，Bba_K1886012，Bba_K1886013) for Enigma. Our next step is to verify its function in the microfluidics device.         
Notes:
        1.We use MG1655 as the chassis, which contains the Lac operon system and Arabinose operon system. If you use a strain does not contain these systems, you need to add the corresponding repressor protein into the circuit when constructing plasmid .         2.Make sure A600nm is more than 0.3 before you add sugar into the bacteria solution.         3"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"
Hong_Kong-CUHK,2015,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," conclusion, but the immediate response we received from the people whom we have approached and invited to complete the questionnaire. Most people refused to participate, some due to not having the time, but many due to the disinterest of the topic. In some cases, we would even receive half-finished forms as some people claimed that they seriously have no interest on synthetic biology, therefore they were reluctant to spare the time to complete the questionnaire. These real life reactions, even though not reflected on the data analysis, but it reflects the indifferences and ignorance toward synthetic biology or even basic sciences in Hong Kong.
As a result, we decided to hold the following activities in order to raise people’s awareness on synthetic biology. We tried to reach as many people in the general public as possible, through the social media, such as YouTube and Facebook. On the other hand, for some of the activities, such as out-reach, we mainly focused on secondary school students and university students because they represent the “new” generation, whose actions can cause a bigger impact to the future of our society. Moreover, their educational background allows them to have a better understanding of the topic, which is much more efficient given limited time and resources we have. Detailed of the workshops can be found later in the report.
The following activities aim to raise people’s awareness on synthetic biology to address the problem of lacking appropriate promotion on synthetic biology.
2. Video clips
We were looking for an effective way to attract the attention of our target audience. And what’s the better way than the use of short video clips to deliver the information which we wanted to promote? With the busy life style which most people now have (especially in Hong Kong), we needed a direct and convenient way. Apart from the easy access to watch video clips online, links of video clips can also be easily shared. Therefore, using videos to promote synthetic biology is a good way to increase people’s knowledge toward synthetic biology. We have made two video clips; the first one is to promote synthetic biology and our project; and the second one to promote the iGEM competition and introducing our team members.
Video on promoting synthetic biology and our project
CUHK iGEM 2015 Project Video
As we have mentioned above, one of the age group we wanted to focus on is young people with an educational background. Hence, we have put this video on the channels which allow us to communicate with people of our target audience, which are Facebook and Youtube. This video simply consists of pictures full of drawings along with the narration to present synthetic biology and what our project is about to the audience. This is an excellent"

View the About our Lab and Safety sheets for uOttawa iGEM 2014.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The University of Ottawa has a Biosafety Committee that works with the Office of Risk Management and the Vice President of Research to ensure that all biosafety regulations are met. A lengthy description of their role can be found here .
Our lab falls under BSL-1, meaning that no special design and practice features are necessary as we are not working with organisms which are dangerous if ingested or airborne. The sections of the guide dealing with recombinant DNA and genetic manipulation state that most recombinant DNA work is safe, but containment level and pathogenicity should be considered. Containment level is addressed above, and none of the strains we worked with was pathogenic. Therefore, we did not need to discuss our project with the biosafety committee.
All lab members are required to take both a biosafety course and a lab safety course prior to getting their access card for the lab. Each course consists of a full day of lecture outlining risks and necessary precautionary measures followed by a take home exam that is marked by the lecturer. Upon passing the exam, lab members received certificates to verify that they had passed and could work in the lab.
In addition, the Government of Canada has issued a lengthy set of guidelines pertaining to biosafety.

Overview
RhamCOLIpid: Engineered E. coli producing rhamnolipid for green enhanced oil recovery
Surfactant is a compound that lowers surface tension between two liquids (e.g. oil-water) or liquid-solid. One example of naturally occurring surfactant is rhamnolipid. Rhamnolipid has a broad application, starting from enhanced oil recovery, oil spill and pollutant management, to industries such as food, cosmetic, and health care. But unfortunately this biosurfactant is produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia utilises optimised rhlAB gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for rhamnolipid production, combined by LacI control and reporter protein for controllable and observable production in E. coli. This rhamnolipid-producing E. coli is named RhamCOLIpid. Produced rhamnolipid is further tested for one of its usages, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). EOR using rhamnolipid is expected to serve as a green alternative to increase oil production in Indonesia.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Public Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM and the Strange Nature Writing competition. Please see the video below:
Furthermore, we wrote and published articles on Comet.is which is aimed at high school students, university students and recent university graduates, please see 'For university students' for a list of the articles we wrote.
 
For university students
Our main form of outreach toward university students was in writing and publishing articles on a burgeoning and government sponsored website Comet.is which is aimed at high school students, university students and recent graduates. Our articles covered a range of topics from our iGEM experience to considerations of ethical issues of synthetic biology and the potential of synthetic biology.
Here are some excerpts:
""All this leads me to refer to synthetic biology as a ménage Ã  trois of a discipline, utilizing engineering, biology and computer science to produce a fantastically creative activity.""
""Given assistance in the form of grants or human resources, entrepreneurial forums along with student competitions like InnovationACT and iGEM have the chance to inspire entrepreneurialism in students. It is in these opportunities for students to go on entrepreneurial adventures, replete with late nights, red bulls and a shot at winning a grand prize – that the next generation of entrepreneurs is born.""
""A prime example of this is in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, which I am a team member of for the University of Melbourne this year. Our team stretches across many disciplines; from telecommunications and business to chemical engineering and science communication, even information technology - we are practically the UN of fields and backgrounds.""
""Participating in IGEM can definitely be categorized as having an experience and not just joining a team. The competition brings together all the components of completing a project for undergraduate students to be part of, a little like a trial run of a Masters or Doctorate course.""
Here are the links to our articles:

The bacteria was resuspended in 25 mL of M9+ media. The OD600 reading of the resuspension was 0.617. In two 250 mL flasks, we mixed 6 mL of E. coli B in M9+ media, 1 mL of high titer lysate (~3x10^9 pfu), .5 mL of bromodeoxyuridine (final concentration 200 ug/mL), 100 uL adenine (final concentration 20 ug/mL) and 200 uL uracil (final concentration 20 ug/mL).
We let one flask incubate on a shaker for ___ hours (until _:__ pm) and the other incubate on a shaker for ___ hours (until _:__ pm).  The bacteria was pelleted and the phage-containing supernatant was transferred to a new test tube and refridgerated at +4C.

Our mutagenesis liquid cultures were not removed from the flask on Wednesday night; instead, they were pelleted on Thursday morning. We will test the titer soon to see if it worked and didn't get diluted or destroyed.
Today, we will: Change top agar concentrations so they will solidify Test plaque sizes on new top agar Do a dilution series on the T1 and mutagenized phage
6/17/13
Today we did our agarose plaque size test.  We took 2 uL from our T4 stock diluted to 10^-6 and infected 0.5 mL of E. coli B.  We made seven identical test tubes, and plated each in varying concentrations of agarose and broth. We tested .8% agarose, .4%, .3%, .2%, .15%, .1%, and .075%. These will incubate overnight at 37C and we will measure the change in plaque sizes as the concentration of agarose decreases.
Also, we spot-tested our T1 dilution series (10^-3 to 10^-11) on a plate of E. coli B to make sure it infects.  If it works ok, we will plate out each dilution level so we can get a good estimate of the PFUs in the T1 stock and start mass producing T1 for later steps in our mutagenesis procedure.

Finally, for the GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) expression in response to and presence of gold compared to copper, both the assay after 12 hours (Figure 2) and 24 hours (Figure 3) show that the GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) is specific to gold with minimal to no expression in the presence of copper. The visible red in the copper wells are minimal indicating that it appears our amino acid change was successful at significantly decreasing the sensitivity of the genetic circuit expression in the presence of copper. Figure 7 shows the GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) construct change in expression in the presence and response to gold over time.

Unfortunately, our cell-free assay did not work and we would have required more time to troubleshoot our protocol to determine why it did not success. A possible reason for our lack in success in our cell free assays was that we found that the NEB PureExpress (a cell-free transcription and translation system for E. coli translation) may have required modifications towards plasmids/BioBricks (such as possibly including a T7 promoter). Please refer to the notebook section for what we attempted to do.
A future direction this research may encourage is to take our GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) BioBrick and be able to create a cell-free paper-based system as it would allow an alternative, cheap and quick method for the detection of gold. Our BioBrick has already been modified ( Gols P118A, BBa_K2048002 ) and characterized to have a decreased sensitivity to copper compared to its unmodified version ( GolS, BBa_K"

Background
Protein plays a significant role in performing physiological functions[1]. However, in diseased cells, protein carrying out a certain function may indicate the proceedings of disease. Such protein could be sorted to biomarkers, which have been regarded as the targets of disease detection and treatment in recent years.[2]-[4] Therefore, detecting those biomarkers of protein-type becomes more and more critical to biological and medical fields.
There are two main detecting approaches to detect a particular protein in a complex sample. One is direct determination of the content after purification, and the other is binding assays which include a target recognition probe and a signal transducer. The former approach includes gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, nickel column and more. While on the down side, these methods involve high costs, strict equipment requirements and other drawbacks, which are not suitable for promotion and application. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a typical representative of the latter approach, nevertheless, such assays using antibodies as affinity ligands have cross-reactivity of antibodies compromising the specificity to the target of interest.[5] What’s worse, the premise of using ELISA is to find the corresponding antibodies, but the fact is that not all proteins can find their specific antibody protein. That is to say, the use of ELISA is also limited.
In terms of binding assays, using aptamers as affinity ligands to recognize specific proteins are better than those using antibodies. Aptamers"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#background_-_-_TEXT.html,"gillus nidulans
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is a model organism and therefore in contrast to most other aspergilla, has a well characterized sexual cycle and a well-developed genetic tools for manipulation (9,12). Furthermore, in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction.
The genetic analysis has produced a deep understanding of both the physiology of Aspergilli and the organisation of the genome (13). This research has advanced the study of eukaryotic cellular physiology and contributed to our understanding metabolic regulation, development, DNA repair, morphogenesis, and human genetic diseases (12). Furthermore, the recent sequencing of the complete genome of A. nidulans has created a tremendous potential to obtain insight into important aspects of fungal biology such as transcriptional regulation, secondary metabolite production and pathogenicity (14).
Gene targeting
Gene targeting facilitates precise genome manipulations, called site directed alterations. They are performed by deletions, replacements and insertions at a target locus. Gene targeting is achieved by transforming fungi with a suitable linear DNA fragment that contains sequences that are identical to the target site in the genome, see figure below. Fungi can integrate linear DNA fragments in its genome by repair of double stranded breaks (15).
Two mechanisms for repair of double stranded breaks ensure that a linear piece of DNA is integrated into the fungal genome; homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ), also called illegitimate recombination (15). HR involves interactions between homologous sequences, whereas NHEJ involves ligation of the ends independently of DNA homology (16). Precise genome manipulation can often be tedious and time-consuming, because fungi appear to favour NHEJ over HR resulting in low gene targeting efficiencies (15).

The use of virtual parts, however, goes beyond just the representation of biological parts. The virtual parts can also be used to represent bioenvironmental elements which are intracellular events occurring in cells or chassis. These bioenvironmental elements become interfacing parts that act as ""glue"" for the aggregation of the standard biological parts.
We refer to the standard biological parts as physical parts and the interfacing parts as non-physical parts.
Development Life Cycle:
Another concept, that can be borrowed from software engineering, is the software development life cycle (SDLC). We used, as a basis, what is known as the classic life-cycle paradigm or waterfall model, see Figure 2.
e-Science:
""The term 'e-Science' denotes the systematic development of research methods that exploit advanced computational thinking""
Professor Malcolm Atkinson, eScience Envoy
e-Science is an enabling concept. It aims to allow the sharing of resources required in science across administrative borders.
Sharing is accomplished by tapping into techniques such as cloud and grid computing.  
 
Web Services:
Web services are set apart from other types of services by the communications protocol they use. To be part of what is known as the Web, using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a prerequisite.
Web services, regardless of the architecture chosen, enable programmatic access to on-line resources and therefore more and more services are developed and become available on-line.
SOAP web services: The Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP as it is popularly known was originally designed to be a RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol using HTTP as the transport protocol. It was later extended to allow for other transport protocols such as the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) (Kennard and Stiver, 2000). SOAP is a packaging protocol for sharing messages between applications (Snell, 2001).
RESTful web services: Roy Fielding described REST, Representational State Transfer, a software architectural style (Fielding and Fielding, 2000). REST uses the WWW as a starting point. Fielding refers to the WWW as the Null Style. As such it is an ideal architecture for web services.
Workflows:
A workflow can be described as a sequence of connected steps or work activities that are followed to produce a required outcome. The sequence and the ways the steps impact on each other are regulated by a set of rules (DiCaterino et al., 1997 ).
The processing of the information drawn from all the distributed sources can be accomplished using workflows."

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#DegradationConstructs_-_-_TEXT.html,"XenB also displays an apparent capacity to denitrify Nitroglycerin (NG).  It has been demonstrated that XenB catalyses the NADH-dependent cleavage of nitro groups from NG, releasing nitrite (Figure 3). P. fluorescens XenB also exhibits five-fold regioselectivity for removal of the central nitro group from NG compared to P. putida XenB.

As nitrate is released from the degradation of Nitroglycerin, there is a suggestion that construct could be built upon to work simultaneously as an explosive degrader and soil enricher, thus taking an environmental toxicant and converting it into an environmental benefit.
The XenB Construct: ( BBa_K1398001 )
The coding sequence for P. fluorescens XenB has been deposited within GenBank (accession no. AF154062 )20 and this forms the functional unit of our construct ( BBa_K1398001 ) (Figure 4):
Figure 4: The XenB construct depicting the constituent parts of the construct.
 
The construct contains the coding sequence for XenB ( BBa_K1398000 ). Expression of XenB is driven by a Lactose-inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) coupled with a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The construct is terminated using a double terminator made up of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 .

Firstly, like XenB, NemA has a dual capacity to degrade both TNT and Nitroglycerin.
NemA has a high degree of homology (87% identical) to pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase ( BBa_K216006 ) from Enterobacter cloacae.22 The E. cloacae PETN reductases and E. coli NEM reductase showed broadly similar activity profiles, with high activity against nitrate esters.23 However, NemA was shown to have a higher substrate preference for PETN and Nitroglycerin than PETN reductase, the uncharacterised gene of"
