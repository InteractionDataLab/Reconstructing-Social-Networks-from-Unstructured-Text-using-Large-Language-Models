Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Waste Degradation: SRF_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolites. The results from the metabolic model suggest that the amount of pha B is especially critical and increasing its level should give us more P(3HB). (Please see our modelling section for details.) To do this, we designed constructs with stronger promoters to up-regulate the expression of the operon.
We designed and constructed two new constructs for increased expression of the operon (including pha B). The first construct uses the constitutive promoter J23104 and the RBS 0034 with a following scar site TACTAGAG in front of the ATG of the pha C gene. The second construct was designed as a hybrid promoter incorporating BBa_J23104 and the original promoter first, followed by the native promoter and RBS, due to recent results of high expression from a hybrid promoter [1] . The region containing the native  promoter and RBS is 352 nucleotides long and might contain important regulatory elements and therefore we were interested to test the hybrid construct in comparison to both the native and constitutive promoter configurations.</
Chassis Design: Tolerance to Waste ▼
We chose the MG1655 E.coli strain as chassis because it constitutively expresses genes that make it resistant to toxic waste degradation products, such as Ethylene glycol.  The aldA and fucO genes have an important role in decreasing the toxic effects of ethylene glycol by converting it into glycolaldehyde which is a link to the cell`s central metabolism. We have received these genes from the registry and future work could be to express these in Bacillus or cellulose-degrading organisms to make them tolerant as well.
Enzyme Secretion Strategy ▼
E.coli is commonly used as a chassis in innovative iGEM projects that aim to prove a concept and make the case for a novel function in a biologically engineered machine.  In our case, we aim to degrade and synthesise plastic and the degradation part of our system needs to be extracellular. There are many strategies for secretion. You can read about these on our Secretion Guide page and find the corresponding biobricks and projects. If you are currently in the process of designing a Genetically Engineered Machine in E.coli, this page provides a good starting point to look for information.
We chose the pelB secretion tag as it has been demonstrated to work in many cases, sometimes with very high transport efficiency (3). pelB has been used in iGEM projects for many years and is part of 50+ constructs. The UC-Davis team last year used it to secrete LC-Cut"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"etic protein derived from Avena sativa’s Phototropin 1. In its dark state the J$_{\alpha}$-helix located at the C-terminus is bound to the core of the protein. Upon irradiation with blue light (~460 nm), a covalent bond between a cysteine residue on the LOV2 protein and a flavin mononucleotide chromophore causes the J$_{\alpha}$-helix to unfold, which in turn exposes the C-terminus (Spiltoir et al, 2016) .  This property is very useful, as short amino acid sequences can be attached to this end of the LOV-protein, for example a PTS1. The idea for this project was to attach PTS1 to the C-terminus and the protein of interest to the N-terminus. Upon irradiation with blue light, the fusion protein would be imported into our compartment. We used a mutated version of LOV2 whose C-terminus has an increased dark-state binding affinity. This is caused by the substitutions and T406A and T407A. These mutations greatly reduce the possibility of the J$_{\alpha}$-helix being exposed in the dark state. Our PTS1 sequence consists of the amino acids LQSKL. As a proof of concept for this construct we fused sfGFP to its N-terminus:
Figure 9.1 Level 1 plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-LOV2-PTS1 fusion protein
This was done in order to visualize our experiment’s results during microscopy: upon successful import of the fusion protein, one would observe GFP fluorescence localized to our compartment. Otherwise, the whole cell would be illuminated.
Pex7 import
The idea behind this project is to initially block the protein of interest’s PTS2 with a fluorescent protein which can be removed by an optogenetically activated TEV-protease. For this project we use the protein Phytochrome-B from Arabidopsis thaliana and its interaction partner PIF6. These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradiation by red light (660 nm) and separate upon irradiation with far-red light (780 nm). We used this property to activate a split version of a TEV-protease whose split halves were each fused to one of the two optogenetic proteins.
The TEV-protease was obtained from the Biobrick BBa_K1319004. This variant contains the anti self-cleavage mutation S219V."

Team Activities
The 2017 iGEM project was much more than just studying, wet lab work and building a microscope. We had a lot of fun besides the work which contributed to a great year and made our team grow closer together. This makes lab work much more fun, appearing conflicts can be solved more easily and a lot of new friendships have been built. We all learned from each other: the physics students got an introduction to synthetic biology, the biology students got in touch with programming, new students learned from more experienced students and vice versa. But scroll down and see what we did during the 2017 iGEM year!
Project Monitoring
Our iGEM team has a lot of team members and as most of you probably know, team work is not always easy. That’s why we decided to have a project monitoring team. It means that we have people supporting us during working processes and help us to optimize specific routines. Our team organized team building events, workshops about scientific skills which are useful for our scientific career and furthermore. Our project monitors are students who are working in different biological research fields but are also trained to support interdisciplinary teams and have experiences with different team projects. Project monitoring exonerates the team coordination and helps to re-focus again in stressful situations, helps to mediate in conflicts and try to improve our qualities as a team.
The Start: Kick-Off
In January 2017, the iGEM team started to meet every tuesday and brainstorming about the 2017 project slowly processed. We did some literature research, found a project, discussed it in our meetings and finally decided to carry this project out. The very first team event was the kickoff event. We got to know each other better, introduced ourselves to the team and talked about our ideas and visions for this iGEM year. The team structure was developed and discussed, some team rules were specified and we had a barbecue and a pub quiz.
Workshops
In order to teach everyone about cloning, the BioBrick system, other molecular biology basics and some basic HTML were taught to the new students in various workshops. Several computer programs were introduced, such as SnapGene or SciFinder. Presentation trainings, pitch workshops, leading skills for group leaders were trained as well as workshops about scientific writing were held, to improve certain soft skills. Additionally we had weekly Journalclubs.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.
Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers’ ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs. Check Integrated Human Practices page.
We learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals, they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
Inspirations of our project
How to come up with an idea or to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Learning related policies
Motivation
To know more policies which may affect our project, and to discuss the questions we don't understand in policies.
Practices
We searched the related safety policies on iGEM website. We got together and discussed any problems if we couldn't understand the policies. Especially, we discussed the biosafety issues and different risk groups.
Inspirations on our project
The risk group of chassis is one of the safety standards to assess the chassis. Besides, whether a part is attached to ""Red Flag"" tag or not is another way iGEM uses. As an intact software for synthetic biology, S-Din should engage this function.
Figure3: We are discussing biology safety.
Consulting the Biosafety and Ethics Advisor
Motivation
How to guide the public attention to bioethics and biosafety is the urgent need before we design and develop our project. We are particularly concerned about one question:
What are biosafety risks easily ignored by us in a virtual genetic design in the computer?
Practices
In September, our team visited Prof. He Zhumei, a biosafety advisor from Biosafety Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. He not only researches biology but also devotes to guiding the public to bioethics and biosafety.
Figure 4: Prof. He Zhumei is explaining biosafety for us.
Prof. He was surprised by our visit. He said it was commendable for us to consult biosafety problems. Half an hour of happy"

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of GEO. This system would include biological containment with parts that can be integrated in the genome of any Escherichia coli chassis and called SafetE.coli. We hoped this system could be used by all future iGEM teams, which would be a great time-saver and would give an easy access to requirements in terms of safety to all iGEMers. In addition to this system, our project also includes physical containment with a brand new encapsulation device based on silica beads also intended to prevent the escape of Genetically Engineered Coli. Finally, as our survey showed us that in 2015 as for the previous years, biosafety did not appear as a high priority, we thought we could also help the community by providing a biosafety guide for future iGEM teams. The idea was to help iGEMers to think about biosafety issues their project may raise early in the conception of their projects. By this way, parts would be designed and the chassis chosen with biosafety in mind.
iGEM Survey
We wanted to design a chassis that could be used as broadly as possible in iGEM, so we asked in our survey to iGEM teams which organism they chose as chassis. Among the 37 teams (representing 12% of all teams) that answered our survey , 29 worked with, at least, E. coli as chassis (5 teams worked with E. coli and with one or more other chassis). Eight teams worked with other chassis (S. cerevisiae, HEK293…).
Figure 1: Results of the survey
The wide use of this bacterium encouraged us to consider E. coli to build our safe chassis. E. coli is often chosen because of it is easy to handle, fast growing and the high level of knowledge is available for this organism.
In our survey, we also asked teams whether they had considered the possible effects of the release of their organism in the environment. We had a wide range of responses, from a simple ""No"" to ""we designed a kill-switch mechanism"". We were surprised to note that 8 of the 29 teams who worked with E. coli thought that strains commonly used in the laboratory could not survive in external environment. This led us to design an experiment to test this claim and to determine whether E. coli could survive or not outside of laboratory conditions.
Some other teams did not seem to worry about the accidental release of their organisms in the environment (""we hope that there is no accidental spill"", ""we do not anticipate this happening"" or ""this organism is intended to be used in a lab"

As the outer compartment would be dependent on the continued coexistence of the two units, the entire GMO system would be purged in case of a breach . To implement this feature, the inner chamber would be covered with Carbon Black, which has the ability to absorb sunlight, thus leaving the compartment itself in darkness.
The process of constructing our device would be through an extensive use of Injection Moulding, which is considered pricey equipment. The material is expensive at 4-5.5 USD per kg at orders above 1 metric ton, according to Mr. Christiansen, but its longevity and durability means it would not need to be replaced for a long time. Lastly, we discussed the reusability of Polycarbonate, which he assured us was of no concern, as the material could be reused and recycled with ease.

Workshop with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen
For the purpose of getting a business perspective on our project, we met with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen. She arranged two workshops for us based on a business model canvas. She encouraged us to view our project, as if we meant to make startup business. These workshops gave us a better comprehension of society’s pull and pushes on a project like ours. This forced us as a team to get to the bottom of what we found important about our project.
Upcoming Meeting with Borgernes Hus
Borgernes Hus i.e. House of the Citizens is a new initiative offered by the City Central Library. The initiative aims to offer guidance and advice to projects such as ours. It is meant to aid Odense in its journey towards the status of becoming a modern Danish city. Unfortunately, the building remains under construction until after our trip to Boston, meaning that they have been busy with the construction while our project was underway. It is for this reason that we, along with director Jens Winther Bang Petersen, agreed that a future collaboration would be the most suitable solution.
It is our hope, that a collaboration with Borgernes Hus will be of assistance to future iGEM teams from SDU as well as other students from Odense.

Detection of alteration in food
In the case of ice-cream, refreezing it after it has melted decreases its flavor and quality.
Because of the covering on food, it is difficult to detect any changes with bare eyes.
Design an organism that changes gene expression when temperature rises abnormally.
By incorporating sensors (made of the above mentioned microorganisms) on the covering, it is possible to detect changes.
Microorganisms that detect many changes
Atmospheric pressure sensing microorganism that changes color depending on pressure: incorporating it into balloons may produce balloons that change color as they rise in altitude.
Microorganism that can detect differences in chemical structure of ingredients in food: May be able to differentiate between good cheese and bad cheese.

A word of advice from 2010 Korea University iGEM team members
- Think again about the meaning of Synthetic Biology. Stick to this concept and try to come up with an idea.
- Come up with ideas that may potentially be useful and have a value as itself.
- Don’t be too held up with coming up with new ideas. You can always use existing ideas and be creative with them. Or, you can also try to prove that same result can be obtained through a different process.
-Simple detection is NOT original. Approach same subjects from different perspectives.

Human Practice / Other Activities
Due to the critical opinion of the Europeans about genetic engineering, it was very important for us to clarify the goal of our project.  We think that it is necessary to tell people about possibilities and risks of the synthetic biology so that they can make their own opinion about this topic without beeing affected by media. As part of our efforts we set up a homepage, created a facebook page, competed in a funny science slam, got an article in a big local newspaper, met other iGEM-Teams, organized an information stand in our city and visited some local schools. We also took care to provide our homepage in english as well as in german so that people more people are reached. Below you can get an impression of the work we did additionally to our main iGEM project.
One activity which goes beyond our project is the support of the proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property .

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," order to enhance its effects on the activation of the plant natural defenses since it has been shown that sulfated curdlan is much more effective (see previous page [3]). However, all Curdlan biosynthesis is dependent of nitrogen starvation and various parameters. We want to simplify all of this.
Figure 2: Schematic representation of the (1→3)-β-glucan synthetic pathway [2]
Before starting the project, we took a few weeks to decide which host organism we would use and how they could be useful. To begin with, we looked at three different organisms: Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compared their β-glucan metabolic pathways. We rapidly eliminated Bacillus subtilis from our possible hosts due to its lack of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of (1→3)-β-glucans (Figure 5). However, we found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally produces Curdlan in its cell wall, like Agrobacterium. Furthermore, Escherichia coli is only missing one enzyme (the β-Glucan synthase) to synthethize Curdlan. We therefore concluded that we could keep these two organisms: one where we would overexpress the (1→3)-β-glucan synthase using a constitutive promoter and one where we would insert the ability to create Curdlan by adding the enzyme that is needed throught the crdASC putative operon.

To sum it up, we would like to produce Curdlan in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then sulfate it before spraying it on grapevine leaves as a preventive treatment against Downy mildew infections. That way vineyards can continue to produce good wine and make everyone happy.

In addition, they incorporated the RNA aptamer that they aimed to characterise, tRNALys3-iSpinach, with our stress promoter ( BBa_K2819010 ), for us to characterise. Both teams agreed on constructing the constructs from both teams simultaneously, using the set of primers which Team CUHK has designed. They advised us to use overlap PCR in our constructions, a technique that we don’t usually use in our lab.  We took their advice and were delighted to find out from our gel electrophoresis results that our overlap PCR was successful!
Gel Electrophoresis of PhtpG1-RNA aptamers
With their help, we eventually succeeded in constructing the RNA aptamer plasmids! We managed to successfully construct our plasmids, as well as Team CUHK’s parts. Subsequently, NUSGEM assisted CUHK in characterising their parts. We measured the fluorescence intensity given off by the RNA aptamers under different temperatures according to the assay protocol provided by them. After we obtained the results, we sent them the data obtained from our characterization. They subsequently found that that tRNALys3-iSpinach-D5 gives off a higher fluorescence reading than tRNALys3-Spinach 2.1, a previous biobrick ! Figure 1 refers to the graph which they have obtained from their analysis.
Figure 1: Graph was plotted and provided by Team CUHK
Last but not least, CUHK also hoped to carry out their survey with a wider audience, so NUSGEM did the survey and spread the word of their survey to help them with gathering responses in Singapore.

Inoculate 10mL of LB with ER2738 from a plate and incubate with shaking ~3-4 hours (mid-log phase, OD600 ~ 0.5).
While cells are growing, melt Top Agar in microwave and dispense 3 ml into sterile culture tubes, one per expected phage dilution. Maintain tubes at 45°C.
Pre-warm, for at least one hour, one LB/IPTG/Xgal plate per expected dilu¬tion at 37°C until ready for use.
Prepare 10 to 103 -fold serial dilutions of phage in LB; 1 ml final volumes are convenient. Suggested dilution ranges: for amplified phage culture supernatants, 10^8 – 10^11; for unamplified panning eluates, 10^1–10^4. Use aerosol-resistant pipette tips to prevent cross-contamination, and use a fresh pipette tip for each dilution.
When the culture in Step 1 reaches mid-log phase, dispense 200 μl into microfuge tubes, one for each phage dilution.
To carry out infection, add 10 μl of each phage dilution to each tube, vortex quickly, and incubate at room temperature for 1–5 minutes.
Transfer the infected cells one infection at a time to culture tubes containing 45°C Top Agar. Vortex briefly and IMMEDIATELY pour culture onto a pre-warmed LB/IPTG/Xgal plate (200µM IPTG, 30µg/mL X-gal). Gently tilt and rotate plate to spread top agar evenly.
Allow the plates to cool for 5 minutes, invert, and incubate overnight at 37°C.
Count plaques on plates that have approximately 100 plaques. Multiply each number by the dilution factor for that plate to get phage titer in plaque forming units (pfu) per 10µL. Multiply by 100 to get the pfu/mL.

InterLab
This year, GeneHackers participated in the iGEM Interlab Study aimed to help provide a standard basis of measurement for GFP fluorescence using a plate reader. Through the generous help of the Dickinson Lab at UChicago and our wonderful grad student advisor Simone, we were able to calibrate the standard GFP measurements using silica beads that resemble E. Coli. when scattered with light. Using the standard protocol provided by iGEM, we were also able to determine the number of Colony Forming Units (CFU) in positive and negative control samples in order to help determine a relationship between absorbance and CFU. The only issue we had with this process was in transforming DH5A cells with the test DNA provided by iGEM. However, through collaboration with Northwestern’s iGEM Team, we were able to come up with a slightly altered process of transforming the DNA that involved an extra resuspension step before plating our transformations. Ultimately, this led us to successfully grow the DH5A cells containing iGEM’s test DNA and continue with their protocol in order to successfully contribute to this year’s iGEM Interlab Study!"

Second app implemented
The second shiny app we impelmented was the timeline app. It counts teams, awards or students within each year and puts the numbers in a bar plot. For the plot we again use RCharts but this time with nvd3. In order to prevent errors we had to add empty values to the data since nvd3 can't handle incomplete datasets.

== Text analysis drafts == For the text analysis we used python and it's nltk platform (see [1] ). The only text corpus used was the stopword corpus.
Independent of the analysis done a ""stemmer"" was run on the abstracts, which reduces all words to their very basic form. For the topwords and information content calculation simple counting was performed and for the information content the proportion of the stopwords corpus in the whole was determined.
For the extraction of the meshterms a list of terms in synthetic biology from Paul Oldahm and his colleagues (Oldham, P., Hall, S., & Burton, G. (2012). Synthetic Biology: Mapping the Scientific Landscape. PLoS ONE, 7(4), e34368. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034368) was used. Here the stemmer was applied to both the abstract and the words list and the matches were again counted.

Creation of several design suggestions
During a meeting we decided to create three design proposals, so that the team could vote which one they like best. Out of the three one should be a modern design similar to other web pages, having a virtual third dimension. With regard to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy we wanted one ""spacy"" design and lust but not least one alchemical / old fashioned design to fit our team logo.

Throughout the Worm Buster project we have at many times felt the need for assistance or input on different parts of our project. Without those small but immensely meaningful things our project would never had gotten this far and in the worse case never been possible at all. Therefore we would like to express our gratitude to all the people that supported us throughout the project.
Project Support and Advice
Margareta Krabbe, Senior Lecturer at Uppsala University: Margareta is our primary PI, our course co-director and our closest university contact. We can easily say that this project could not have been possible without her help and guidance. She has taken care of administrative parts like booking of lecture halls, labs and getting us a iGEM-hub on campus. She has always listened to our needs and has strongly contributed in creating a good working environment for the team. We also want to thank her for the work she’s done together with our Human practice group regarding the Symposium.
Anthony Forster, Professor at Uppsala University: Anthony is our course co-director and have given us support at all situations, both in the lab and some subgroups. He has kindly offered his expertise and provided us with valuable contacts and materials, such as cells and reagents, throughout the project. We are very grateful to have such an experienced professor within the field of synthetic biology to support us.
Alice Anlind, Research engineer at Vidilab: Alice has kindly given us advice throughout our project. She has not only introduced us to the common problem of poor diagnostic tools applied to detect parasitic infections in horses, she has along with Bitte Ljungström and Sara Ljungström also been able to support us by letting us borrow some reagents from the lab at Vidilab. In addition, Alice has been very helpful by running our samples through Vidilabs’ minION device that we couldn’t get ourselves.

06-19: Meeting with Doctors Without Borders, regional manager
She explained that the detection of cholera in the patient is simple because the symptoms are known. She told us that our system would be more useful treating water tanks in villages far from cholera camps rather than tourists. Indeed, governments often hide epidemics from tourists and tourist places take enough precautions to avoid tourists’ contamination.
You can read the result of her testimony here.
06-23: Beginning of the marketing approach
A marketing approach has been initiated to study the strengths and weaknesses of our two potential products and to determine the approach to sell them. Thanks to a SWOT analysis on both products, we realized that the product to treat water in a flask is not adapted to the market. This product is therefore abandoned and we focus on a product that processes a larger volume of water, suitable for villagers in the affected countries.

Cystic Fibrosis Trust Conference
News of The Lung Ranger spread quickly in the local community, and we were thrilled to be invited to present at the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust Conference in Manchester. This national conference saw leading experts in Cystic Fibrosis research, clinicians, and funding agencies gather to discuss novel treatments and national concerns relating to CF.
Gillian and Jenny from the team highlighted the use of Synthetic Biology as a novel, viable and powerful option for CF management and care. Our project had also addressed key points highlighted by directors and researchers of the CF Trust, including; managing digital data, personalizing care and ‘Putting the patient voice at the heart of CF care’ (Oli Raynor, Special Adviser, Research & Patient Involvement at Cystic Fibrosis Trust).
It was clear from the feedback that we were attempting to address an unmet clinical need, and this was further evidenced when we received messages on social media from people watching online.

Human Practices shapes the future and the very being of all science. Human Practices includes (but is not limited to) the purpose, effects and impact of science on society. A realm where ethics, economics and E.coli all intertwine.
To better understand the inner workings of the Vibrio cholera quorum sensing system we produced a series of computational models to simulate the operation of Vibrio cholerae. Based upon differential equations and solved computationally via the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method our models provide a comprehensive view of Vibrio cholerae quorum sensing and bi-stable switching behaviour. To find out how we designed our models from the blackboard to the CPU check out our modelling . This work is potentially a flexible framework for future quorum sensing modelling. Possible future extensions can be other diffusion models for quorum sensing, other quorum sensing systems, etc. Different models are proposed as an example.

Introduction
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out to many individuals, including one of our MLAs, the Minister of Environment, to get her support for our project. We talked to rural beekeepers in Southern Alberta to ask about the viability of our project, and to our city council. We also spoke with an urban planner to see how we could make our city more “bee-friendly”. We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal. Many people signed a petition  we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.
Government
Our project focuses on combatting Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomonon in which the majority of the worker bees die or leave the queen behind, in a variety of ways, including genetic engineering and community outreach.  One method of supporting the bee population, and thus tackling Colony Collapse Disorder, is through urban beekeeping. Urban beekeeping has proven successful in many regions of Canada, but it is illegal within Lethbridge city limits. In order to understand the implications of this bylaw, and potentially amend it, we decided to reach out to local policymakers and urban beekeepers.
City Council By-Law
Dinula and Ronja presenting at City Council
Prior to 1983, residents of the City of Lethbridge were able to beekeep within city limits. However, an amendment to Bylaw 3383 now prevents residents from being able to do so. In Southern Alberta, bee populations are currently decreasing dramatically, with reports saying that North American beekeepers are losing approximately one third of their bees each year. As a way to help the bee population, our team made it a goal to try and have this bylaw amended"

1. Aim
1. Is the insert DNA in the plasmid present or absent?
2. Much easier than to isolate and purify the vector.
2. Good to know before the start
1. Take typical measures to prevent PCR cross over contamination, keep your bench clean, wear gloves, use sterile tubes and filter pipet tips.
2. Include a no-template control and positive control in parallel.
3. Thaw and keep reagents on ice.
4. Mix well before use.
5. The longer the amplicon, the longer the extension time: Use 15 sec/kb extension.
6. Use 90 sec extension for multiplexing.
7. Run an annealing temperature gradient from 55 °C to 65 °C to choose the best specificity conditions. Do not"

Software
The first talk in the software route was on ""automated synthetic biology"" by Chris Grant. The main issues in this talk were the streamlining of high-throughput processes by the use of robotics. The next talks were on computer modelling of metabolic pathways/genetic circuits (by Miriam Leon & Rob Stanley). An interactive workshop took place after the talk with the repressilator system being used as an example.
DIY Bio
The overall aim of this set of workshops was to construct an open souce spectrophotometer. Software for data collection/manipulation was downloaded. The basic principles of 3D printing was explained. Components of the open source we constructed using 3D printing.
Extra Lab
In the extra lab sessions, the tricks of the synthetic biology trade were put to use. The use of molecular crowding agents (namely PEG) was used in order to spead up the ligation reactions. The use of PEG reduced the reaction times by 50%!
Wednesday 17th June
Morning Lab
The plates that were inoculated on Tuesday were checked for any colonies. no growth was observed on the negative control plate. The chloramphenicol provided the selective pressure that would promote the growth of E. coli cells that were transformed with plasmid. Single colonies were picked and grown in liquid media (5 mL LB containing 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol) for plasmid harvesting. It was noted that there was significantly more transformants in the electroporation method of transformation. It was difficult to pick single colonies off the electroporation plates.
Software
The principles of wiki design was discussed by Lewis Moffat (UCL 2014 iGEM team). The logic behind html coding was explained. As a workshop a spoof page was set up and images & text were uploaded to the page. Everyone involved in the workshop got hands-on experience in directly uploading & editing a wiki page.

NOTE:
10X buffer should be added in the reaction such that its final concentration is 1x (e.g. - in a 50 ul reaction 5 ul of buffer would be added).
Amount of DNA to be added depends on concentration and the amount of DNA to be digested.
Make sure that the restriction enzyme does not exceed more than 10% of the total reaction volume, Otherwise the glycerol and the EDTA in the enzyme storage buffer may inhibit digestion process.
Enzymes on ice, when not in freezer
Mix by pipetting
A 50 μl reaction volume is recommended for digestion of 1 μg of substrate
Control DNA (DNA with multiple known sites for the enzyme, e.g. lambda or adenovirus-2 DNA) with restriction enzyme to test enzyme viability
If the control DNA is cleaved and the experimental DNA resists cleavage, the two DNAs can be mixed to determine if an inhibitor is present in the experimental sample. If an inhibitor (often salt, EDTA or phenol) is present, the control DNA will not cut after mixing.
Cleanup of the PCR fragment prior to restriction digestion is recommended. PCR components can inhibit enzyme activity. In addition, the polymerase present in the PCR is active during the digestion step, and can modify the newly created ends by blunting them.
Some enzymes may bind tightly to the substrate DNA. This binding can result in smearing or the presence of unexpectedly high molecular weight bands on a gel. To prevent this, add SDS to a final concentration of approximately 0.1%, or use Gel Loading Dye, Purple (6x), which contains sufficient SDS to dissociate the enzyme from the substrate.
To prevent star activity, make sure that you use the recommended buffer, that the amount of glycerol in the reaction is no more than 5% of the total reaction volume
Gel Extraction
Excise the DNA fragment from agarose gel with clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice. Add 3 volumes buffer QG to 1 volume of gel( 100 mg gel = 100 ul). ( if we have 18 mg of gel take around 20 ul of buffer QG)

We designed a product which contains E. coli with the gene fragments to detect toxins. We embed E.coli into microcapsules. We have a biological safety system. The embedding of E. coli saves cost and time and has high-efficiency detection mechanisms. Our experiment results indicated that immobilizing E. coli can successfully detect toxins. Besides, our work on biosafety issue is to reduce the risk that the E-coli will leak out and contaminate the environment. We have developed triple biosafety certificated mechanisms that will reduce the risk. We developed our product which has been successfully experimental test of feasibility. For example, 4ppm copper ion can induce the microcapsule glow within five minutes. ( See our product )

We have set up a modeling pipeline. We divided the modeling project into 3 parts :
diffusion,
parameter fitting,
modeling of the genetic circuit itself, which comprises
a deterministic model
a stochastic model.
We know that the modeling challenges will be to model how integrases work, and to model the delay between reception of a quorum sensing signal and production of a quorum sensing signal by the receiver cell. Indeed, a colony could switch itself OFF when it should be ON, if it receives QS1 and produces QS2, for example. If a delay is present between reception of QS1 and production of QS2, the colony will produce GFP before it is switched OFF, and as GFP is stable enough, it will stay visible during a long time and the self-switching OFF won't be observed. This delay should be modeled.

Week 1 : Project selected
Wednesday, May 28th
After more than one month of endless meetings and passionate debates, we finally chose the project that will keep us occupied in the next five months. From the beautiful pattern made by the Sierpinski triangles, we will focus on cellular automata and try to implement one.
Sierpinski triangles appear when the rule 90 is followed by every cell on the grid :
Pattern given by rule 90 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
Ideally we will use a microfluidic chip. We could also use a 3D printed agar plate like this one to load the colonies. On this grid we can implement the rule 6, which is the simplification of rule 90 considered as a rule with 2 inputs : each cell computes a simple XOR gate of its two parents.
Arrangement of p and q cells on the chip
Pattern given by rule 6 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
The logic part will be built with integrases and the colony-to-colony communication will use quorum sensing.
Every colony will receive two quorum sensing signals (QSp and QSq) from the two cells above it. These two signals trigger the production of two different integrases r and s in the colony. Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the colony produces only r or only s, the terminator is"

We are team UCAS, consisting of 13 UCAS (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences) students from different grades and different majors. We gather together for the same aim of innovating in synthetic biology and disperse apart to strive in our areas of expertise. We think, we talk, we practice, we progress. We wrangle, we reconcile, we laugh, we love. We are a team, we are a family, we are team UCAS.

Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”

Our story
Most of all, iGEM has been a great character defining experience. To us, it is the story of an idea that started to form in the mind of a few team members, years ago, and who finally came to fruition. This is their story…
There are two sides to this story, one in Biology School, the other in Bioengineering School both at UCLouvain.
On the biology side, there were Antoine and François, two Second year baccalaureate biology students. One day, as they were working on an assignment on synthetic biology for their biochemistry class, they stumble upon iGEM’s website. It was love at first sight and from that day on, they could never really shake off the idea to be part of such a competition. UCLouvain had never participated but they were convinced that by the time they would reach their Master degree, they would surely have.
On the other hand, Kilian found out about iGEM in September 2015 while watching a documentary called “Fabriquer le vivant” , literally “Making Life” ( video available on Youtube ). Excited, he had to talk about iGEM to his classmates! Professor P. Morsomme, giving a class on Biochemical Analysis as this great discussion took place, intrigued by the uncharacteristic fervor of the students, had to jump in. This was not the first time, he had heard about such competition and he referred Kilian to Antoine. Together, they managed to gather around them enough people to start calling themselves: “The first UCLouvain iGEM Team”.
Hopeful but not vain, they knew it was going to take a lot more convincing to get UCLouvain Professors and the University on board. Members of the team set out on a quest and went door to door looking for the required academical support. Finally, Professor P. Soumillion and Pr. B. Hallet answered the call. They decided to take the lead and give a home to the team in the Biochimestry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganism Unit at the Life Science Institute.
Many brainstorming sessions took place in order to discuss objectives and to decide how we should"

MadLab panel discussion - 7th February 2013
The first conference that the team attended was organised by the Manchester Digital Lab (MadLab). MadLab is a community project that organises events in many different disciplines, but the team was most interested in the DIY Bio event that we stumbled across. A panel discussion was held called ‘Local Bioeconomies’, themed around what synthetic biology can do, and public literacy of this subject. The panelists included; Asa Calow, DIY Biologist and Founder and Director of the MadLab in Manchester; John O'Shea, artist and creator of the world's first bio-engineered football; Philipp Boeing, UCL iGEM ‘11/‘12 and London Biohackers; and Rod Dillon, lecturer in biomedicine, School of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University.
After the panel discussion, the team mingled with the speakers and the other guests and got some useful feedback for our early project ideas, and also some valuable advice about how to successfully plan and execute an iGEM project in general. It was a really interesting event that properly kicked off our thinking into human practices. You can watch a video all about it below!
Future Perspectives in Synthetic Biology - 8th February 2013
The following day, 8th February, the team attended a conference hosted by the University of Manchester, titled “Future Perspectives in Synthetic Biology”. The guests and speakers in attendance were a mix of academics from within the university interested in biotechnology, and industry representatives from such companies as GlaxoSmithKline and Syngenta. We already had some project ideas in mind at this point, but the various talks by faculty staff and guest speakers proved very useful for narrowing down our search. We gave a very brief presentation to the guests, introducing the iGEM competition and what it entails.
Coffee and lunch breaks were used as networking opportunities! We presented a poster with more in-depth"

Mid-Atlantic Meetup
In keeping with the collaboratory spirit of iGEM, this year we were fortunate to participate in a mid-Atlantic meetup organized by The University of Maryland. In attendance were William and Mary, University of Virginia, Pittsburgh, Richard and Montgomery, and University of Maryland. Going into the meetup, we were focused on advancing last year’s project of creating a bacterial detection system by making a fusion protein of factor C – a protein in horseshoe crab blood that undergoes an auto catalysis in the presence of gram-negative bacteria – and HCG. We were excited at the potential of collaborating with the teams in attendance, especially as it pertained to possible protein detection systems. You can read more about the meetup on UMaryland's wiki .

Georgia Meetup
Rehmat and Christina went to Emory University at the O. Wayne Rollins Research Center to discuss project ideas and future collaborations with other Georgia teams who are participating in iGEM for this year. Each team discussed an overview idea of their project as well as what they have planned up until the Jamboree.
The number of people who attended this event made it possible for us to really connect and foster a more “at home” setting where we could each share some challenges we all faced. We all got to open up a little as we spoke about limitations of our labs and were able to get a full understanding of the inner working of each team’s lab.    After attending"

Meetups & Collaborations
Among the greatest opportunities offered by iGEM, the most thriving one is the potentiality to meet and work with scientists from all over the world, either by building on already existing professional network, or by collaborating with iGEM teams. You can read here about our interactions with other teams.

- August 29th-30th: Meetup in Bordeaux
KU Leuven
Owing to our successful posters presentation at Exposciences
Midi-Pyrénées , the organizers asked us to participate in the International Exposciences which took place in Brussels, Belgium, between the 19th and the 25th of July.  We met four representatives of the iGEM KU Leuven team (Belgium).
For an entire afternoon, we exchanged views about our projects and particularly about the modelling part since both teams were using different software and methods to model cell behaviour. iGEM KU Leuven team uses (among others) the MatLab software to model various cellular phenomena and we are using Opflux software to evaluate cellular capabilities.
Meet-up in Bordeaux - 29th/30th August
The French-speaking meet-up took place in Bordeaux on the 29th and the 30th of August. Numerous teams were represented there: Bordeaux, Paris Saclay, Paris Pasteur, Leuven (Belgium), EPFL (Switzerland), Aix-Marseille and our own team.
The program of this meet-up was very complete, from the discovery of Bordeaux through a tour of the city to the presentation of each project and activities prepared by some of the teams.

China Petrochemical Development Corporation
We got the permission to enter the most dioxin-polluted area in the world and got to know procedures they’re                 applying to break down dioxin in soil. The major methods are wet method and heat method while microorganism                 method is still under breakthrough. Since this method is what we’re doing, they are highly interested in                 and looking forward to our application later in the future. Additionally, we had planted several of our experimental                 plant ( Vetiveria zizanioides) in the area and will test the concentration of dioxin in the soil to see if the                 plant is sure to break down dioxin few months later.
Vetiveria zizanioides
Dajing Biological Engineering Company
Thanks to ShanghaiTech iGEM team for visiting the company and bringing our questions to get feedback as below:
Q: The plant Vetiveria zizanioides is an example of phytoremediation. According to this fact, endosymbiotic                     microorganism should be able to multiply. How do you examine the sample of soil microorganism on the                     effect of it?
A: By testing the quantity of the chemical aimed in degradation.
Q: Does the application of genetic modified microorganism have environmental concern?
A: We don’t have any applications in this field.

For each sample, we measured the percentage of DsRed expressing cells and their geometric mean relative fluorescence intensity compared to untransfected controls. We used a GFP expressing plasmid as a transfection control and measured the percentage of GFP expressing cells as well.
To account for difference in transfection efficiencies between the three cell lines we performed the following transformation, calculating the Cellular Fluorescence Intensity for each sample:

To account for differential promoter activity and leakage between our cell lines, so as to be able to compare our results and gauge the performance of our circuit across cell lines we performed an additional normalization step by dividing the CFI of each sample with the CFI of a control plasmid in that cell line, namely pCMV-DsRed-sfGFP-SV40, obtaining the Normalized Fluorescence Intensity, the measure we use for our circuit output.
Functionality of the Inversion Module
The double-inversion module necessary for our circuit function is actuated through a Tet-On system which translates the repression on rtTA caused by the “high markers” ,i.e. the upregulated miRNAs, to a reduced post-transcriptional repression on the output plasmid caused by the synthetic miRNA FF4, which is coded downstream of pTRE and therefore increased output. So, we begun by testing whether our Tet-On system along with our synthetic miRNA FF4 were functional in the absence of miRNA control on rtTA, therefore expecting higher circuit output in the Doxycycline uninduced cells.
As expected, we observe a 4-fold increase in circuit output in the uninduced cells, allowing us to proceed with our experiments.
Classification performance of various circuit topologies
We proceeded by closely examining the classification performance of three circuit topologies; A, B and C characterized by extensive overlap, between Caco-2, our cell line of interest, and HEK-293 and A549.
In addition, we investigated the effect of altered ratios between the components of the inversion module and demonstrated that the system functions best on 1:1 ratio compared to the 2:1 used most often in Tet-On systems.

We ran into more problems attempting to purify the T7 phage.  While we were at first able to get a clear band of phage using the cesium chloride gradient we were no longer able to achieve the same results.  We focussed on creating a gradient that would allow the T7 phage to band once again but we did not have any luck in doing so.

Spencer Chen
Some people think Spencer is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Spencer can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Spencer however, is definitely the meaner twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Spencer likes to read Ancient Greek and Roman literature, which has limited to no real-world application to his life. He is however, passionate about immunology and genetics research. He is a freak of nature with many bodily disorders. For example, his arms and legs are different lengths. He idolizes Thomas Keller and secretly wants to drop out and make haute cuisine for a living.
Steven Chen
Some people think Steven is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Steven can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Steven however, is definitely the nicer twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Steven is also strangely obsessed with all things Medieval Europe but that is about all that makes him interesting; he is actually a really boring person. His research interests are in the field of biochemistry, cell biology, biomedical engineering-- though why these interest him I couldn’t begin to understand. Steven really likes eating bread. He likes his bread plain, just like his personality.
Maneesh Gupta
A true Renaissance man, and a true ladies man. Any task you give Maneesh, from PCR to programming, will be done flawlessly. Just don’t try to get him to leave his house in the process. He’s the master of all things barbecue and Boolean, tasty and triangulated, mathematical and manly. But vegetarians beware, he's Maneesh Gupta, and he’s so delicious.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," With a desire to explore synthetic biology, he found iGEM had the perfect goals for him. iGEM also provided a first-hand look at how these principles of biology and engineering could be applied to actual, beneficial goals in the world, and he was happy to see such a passionate, determined team around him at the University of Maryland. Deven is also the president of an a cappella group and assists with a biophysics lab on campus.
Jacob Premo
Jacob is a Junior Biochemistry and Microbiology double major. He is particularly interested in studying genetics and the mechanisms underlying drug effectiveness. As a second year team member, Jacob has enjoyed assisting with new member training and managing the laboratory space. Outside of iGEM, Jacob spends his time reading, watching movies, and playing with his dog.
Joyce Song
Joyce is a sophomore neurobiology & physiology major. She joined iGEM because she loved the concept of a student-ran research team that tackles real world issues with synthetic biology. In her free time, she loves to go play with her dog, go on hikes, and binge-watch Netflix.
Paula Kleyman
Paula is a junior studying bioengineering. This is her second year on the UMaryland iGEM team. She really enjoyed working on the team the year before and learning how to design and create a novel synthetic biology project and came back for more. She is also interested in pursuing a career in education, possibly finding a way to integrate her biology and engineering knowledge with classroom work. Her favorite activities outside of academics are running, singing, and playing guitar (but not at the same time).
Richa Beher
Richa is a sophomore Cell Biology and Genetics major at the University of Maryland who aspires to become a physician-scientist. She joined iGEM to gain research experience and explore synthetic biology applications with like-mided individuals. On campus, she is part of service organizations, Terrapin Trail Club, and the Club Triathlon team! In her free time, she enjoys eating good food, backpacking, listening to music, and hanging out with friends.
Rohith Battina
Rohith is a sophomore biochemistry major at UMD. He is interested in pursuing a career in the field of infectious diseases research. He enjoys doing iGEM because of its application to real world problems and how it fosters teamwork. In his spare time, he plays tennis and reads books.

We got colonies for pAK13CK and ran a colony PCR. The PCR didn’t show anything, but the primers are not ideal, so we will miniprep and digest screen. We digested PCRs of pC13BR, pC13BQ, pC13CD, and pC13Y with KpnI, HindIII. They were all cleaned. We digested miniprep of pC13BN with KpnI and HindIII. This was cleaned and dephosphorylated. We prepped pC13BN miniprep for sequencing with primer 31. Miniprepped pC13AY, pC13BF, pA13AM, and pA13AW cultures and will quantify tomorrow. We prepared pA13DC colonies 3 and 4 and pA13DB colonies 1 and 4 for sequencing Tuesday morning. We then reran a Vent PCR for pC13CB and grew up liquid cultures of the same colonies. We ran a gel for pC13A which showed that the PCR failed. We then redid a Vent PCR with the addition of MgSO4 for pC13AF, pC13CV, pC13I and minipreps of pC13L. We made 5 pAh13G cultures from glycerol stocks, and we electroporated pC13BJ, pC13BK, pC13BL, and pC13BM to make glycerol stocks.

DLUT_China_B,2018,Team:DLUT China B#LiquidCrystalMoleculesPerturbationsModel_-_-_TEXT.html," the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).
The radial distribution function can be computed via computer simulation methods. Because the                         peak of the radial distribution function appears at 0.5nm, so the spacing of 5CB molecules is                         around 0.5nm.
Calculate the range of β2-M that can perturb 5CB
We assume 5CB molecule as a ellipse (\(a\)=1nm, \(b\)=0.1nm), we got the tilt angles of three                         molecules by Matlab.
Fig.9 The tilt angles are 43°, 64°, 90° respectively.
\(\therefore\)Maximum radius of β2-M that can perturb 5CB (Fig. 5):
\(R_1=[2\times\sin (64^\circ )+1]\mathrm{nm}=\)2.8nm
Verification
In the liquid crystal experiment, the droplets dropped on the slide have a radius of about 2                         mm.
$$\therefore S=\pi R^2=4\pi\times 10^{12}\mathrm{nm^2}$$
The molecular weight of β2-M is 11800, the volume of the droplet is 10μL.
The area disturbed by each protein molecule is:
$$r=2.8\mathrm{nm}$$
$$S_0=\pi r^2=7.84\pi\mathrm{nm^2}$$
When the picture is just full colorful, the number of molecules contained in the droplet                         is:
$$N=\frac{S}{S_0}=5.1\times 10^{11}$$
$$m=\frac{11800\times 5.1\times 10^{11}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{g}$$
\(\therefore\)Maximum concentration is:
\(c=\frac{m}{V}=\)1000ng/mL
That is to say, when the concentration reaches 1000ng/mL, the image starts to be completely                         bright. This is in good agreement with our experimental results. The following are the results                         of the liquid crystal experiment.
A. 500ng/ml(β2-M)
B. 600ng/ml(β2-M)

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"ptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a proteolytic activity could be assumed caused by the clearance observed. Contrary to our former beliefs, it could now be deduced that exchanging tyrosine doesn’t result in a change of activity. Consequently, tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site is not essential for the activity of subtilisin E. Unfortunately, we were not able to prove the principle of our project regarding tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site, as it seems to be not essential for the proteolytic activity. Thus, exchanging tyrosine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid more precisely ONB-tyrosine will not influence the activity of the enzyme. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020006
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (Y77X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020005 . In opposition to the exchange of tyrosine77 against tryptophan, the named tyrosine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TAG, which codes for ONB-tyrosine, if the corresponding tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So tyrosine will be exchanged against ONBY in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme in the presence of the needed ONBY tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging tyrosine against a larger amino acid namely tryptophan showed no difference in the activity compared to our working subtilisin E expression system , tyrosine77 in general not influences the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. And the replacement of tyrosine against ONBY will not cause an inactivation of the protease."

Overview
    In our system, we have three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    To contruct our farmers, we contructed a new part invertase(BBa_K2250000/BBa_K2250001/BBa_K2250003). Our E.coli MG1655  can not utilize sucrose as its nutrients. Invertase catalyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, thus providing nutrients for all bacteria. See the intervase test for more details.
    To realize the role of the warrior, we utilized a kind of molecule called AHL([N-]acyl-homoserine lactones). There are several kinds of AHLs, which bind to different receptors with different affinity. AHL together with the receptor can bind to specific promoters and activate the corresponding gene. We want to design a gene circuit with orthogonality.In other words, we want the warrior to kill bacteria from the other group but not from its own group. To accomplish this, we did the orthogonality test to select the comparatively best pairs.
    After the construction of our warriors, we tested how the warriors really work. We have two standards to see if the warriors are fitted or not. First, the warrior must have good orthogonality. That is to say, the warrior must kill its enemies but not itself. Second, the killing ability must be neither too strong nor too weak. We carried out the killing test to test our warriors.

Design
To test the concept of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated phage therapy, a three step experiment was needed.
CRISPR-Cas Vector Synthesis
The first step was to design a spacer RNA sequence to specifically bind within a target gene but no where else in the E. coli genome.  An RNA sequence was designed to be complementary to a unique sequence found within the neomycin phosphotransferase gene.  Using restriction digestion and ligation the spacer sequence in BBa_K1218011(CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid) was replaced with the new targeting spacer sequence.
Verification of CRISPR specificity
The second phase of the project was to transform the targeting CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid into BW23115(::kan) E. coli to verify that Cas9 can be directed to a specific sequence determined by the spacer and that double stranded breaks in the genome are sufficient to kill a bacterium. The CRISPR-Cas plasmid has been shown to effectively kill bacterial strains when expressed within targeted bacterial cells if the spacer is complementary to the target cell’s genome¹ ² ³.   The specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 killing has been demonstrated to be specifically cytotoxic to a single nucleotide mutation, meaning strains of bacteria differing in a single SNP can be differentiated by the CRISPR guide RNA².  However, creating an effective delivery mechanism for the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid remains a large obstacle.
Phage delivery of CRISPR-Cas9
The third part of the project attempts to solve the delivery mechanism problem"

Using the PCR products from 7/11 (gel purified and extracted w/ kit), the following digests were performed:
Reaction mixes: 10 μL DNA, 1 μL BSA, 1 μL enzyme mix, 2.5 μL buffer, 10.5 μL water (total volume: 25 μL) Reactions at 37°C for 2 hours. ES mix used EcoRI buffer, XP mix used buffer 3

The above was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (removes DNA <40bp, so the end fragments from the PCR should be removed).
Using the E1 P45B 7/11 miniprep DNA, a P45 EX digest was also performed. Reaction mix: 4 μL DNA, 1 μL BSA, 1 μL enzyme mix, 2.5 μL buffer 2, 16.5 μL water (total volume: 25 μL). Reactions at 37°C for 2 hours. Although this had the PCR purification procedure done, it still needs to be gel purified.

● Last, excessive accumulation of ROS will affect the survival of engineered strain.                             Feedback Module can ensure modest cell survival.
Screening Promoters
We screened out a lot of promoters for regulator                                 components (GAL1p), feedback                                 components (CTT1p, GLR1p                         , TRX2p, TRR1p, TSA1p, SOD2p, GSH1p, GSH2p, GAL1p                         and MSY1p), and output                                 components (FBA1p, TEF1p, TEF2p, ENO2p, PCK1p,                         PDC1p and PGI1p)                         to find the promoter with the most suitable expression for detection. Additionally, because of                         the plug-and-play characteristic, the selected promoters with different expression strength                         also provide the possibility and alternatives for future application under different                         conditions.
Design                     Modeling
Modeling is an important part of synthetic biology. A science can only be truly perfected when                         it successfully applies mathematics.
Considering that fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 can only characterize the relative level                         of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but can't give the absolute content of intracellular ROS                         quantitatively, we established the model based on Michealis equation and some assumptions,                         which can convert fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 into the intracellular H2O2 concentration. As a result, the output signal of roGFP2-orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and                         higher application value.
Detecting Antioxidants Elegantly
If you want use our product to detect antioxidants, all you need to prepare is

The subnetwork presented below was obtained from MetExplore platform and presents all reactions from the KEGG and ByoCyc databases involved in the production or consumption of formate. This map will help us predict the likely consequences of a PFL-induced formate overproduction in Apicoli.  In fact, formate is harmful to our bacterium and is normally metabolized to other products to prevent toxicity effects and redox imbalance. We thus have to find the balance between producing enough formate to kill the varroa without killing Apicoli.
Figure 3: Metabolic network of all reactions involving formate happening in E. coli
Butyrate network
Contrary to formate, butyrate is not naturally produced by E. Coli. E. coli possesses an enzyme called ( Butyryl-coA transferase (or Acetate-coA transferase) that yields butyrate, but this reaction cannot happen spontaneously in the organism due to the lack of butanoyl-coA, its substrate (Fig. 5). A careful analysis of the biosynthesis pathway shows that the enzymes responsible for Butanoyl-coA production (EC.2.1.3.19 phosphate butyryltransferase , EC.1.3.1.44 trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+) , etc.) cannot be found in our strain. Hence, in order to obtain butyrate, we chose to introduce a complete production pathway relying on genes originating from different organisms in Apicoli (see Attract).

Presentation
To go further in the development of our project, we decided to use a method called Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Flux Variability Analysis (FVA). It is based on the model EC_iJO1366 [1]. This is the most recent model concerning E. coli K12 MG1655.  EC_iJO1366 is a stoichiometric model defining all metabolic paths (as of today) in this particular strain.

- TOP10 + J23101;
- TOP10 + J23106;
- TOP10 + J23117;
The antibiotics were added in a ratio of 1:1000 (thus in 5 mL, we have added 5µl). After cloning, we putted the 50 mL tubes at 37°C at 200 rpm.
FACS (250µL of K1583000) did not result in a relevant fluorescence signal in the construct. Therefore, we decided to do the transformation again. Thereby, we found out that we did not use the correct backbones for the interlab. I13504_pSB1A2; J23101_pSB1C3; J23106_pSB1C3; J23117_pSB1C3.
The backbone for our own construct is pSB4K5. For the transformation, we did use the protocol (2). Then we have grown the cells on the plates: I13504 and pUC19 on AMP, J23101, J23106 and J23117 at CAM and pSB4K5 at KAN.
07/07/2015
The plates of 06/07/2015 were checked.
Colonies were picked from each plate and added to 5 mL of LB and 5 µl of AMP, CAM, KAN (for pSB4K5) and furthermore the antibiotics that belong to the rest. The antibiotic added was added in a 1:1000 way (like shown with the example of KAN). Cultures were then putted at 37°C at 200 rpm for growing.
In order to let the colonies grow overnight, the 5 ml cultures were refilled with fresh LB to 20 mL (with 20µl of antibiotics). Afterwards, the cultures were putted at 37°C overnight at 180 rpm.
08/07/2015
Cultures were taken from the 37°C shaker and we proceed to isolate the plasmids and store the cultures at -80°C. For this, the protocol for making -80°C stocks was followed (10). For this a cell pellet was used (pellet obtained after 10 minutes centrifugation at 2000 rpm), resolved in 0.5 mL LB and 0.5 Glycerol (80% solution).
Plasmid isolation was performed and the plasmid J23101, J23106 , J23117, I13504. After the protocol, the plasmids were stored at -20"

University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team
We have been working with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team on the curriculum development aspects involved in both of our projects. Their project focuses on producing a cell-free system that would be used as a teaching tool in high schools. As both of our teams need research completed on curriculum development, collaboration is the perfect idea. Research done by both teams was shared with each other. For example, a team member from the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team interviewed a group of science teachers from Winston Churchill High School for further opinions and suggestions on integrating another scientific component to the curriculum. This interview expanded to include a member from our team as well. Members of our team also reviewed the education modules that they developed. Another aspect in this collaboration includes having our team act as a practice audience for a project presentation from the collegiate team, to evaluate our level of understanding of their project. Their team also attended meetings of ours to provide feedback on our presentation prior to two competitions this season. In addition to this, members of their team have been mentoring us in lab work, and coding, and have also provided general guidance during team meetings as advisers to the team.  Their team also tested our melanin construct (BBa_ K281401) using the PURExpress system to see if it could be successfully produced. This helped provide further characterization of the part. As the collegiate iGEM Team's project focuses on creating a cell-free system, their system should be able to produce pigment as well.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#jp_-_-_TEXT.html," ). It is notable that in comparison with China and South Korea, Japan has more private companies participating in synthetic biology research. In fact, one third of the entries for Japan in the SynBio map are private companies. Japan has the largest bio-technology industry and therefore large capability for private companies to be involved in synthetic biology.
Although Japan is a leading Asian nation in synthetic biology, its footprint is relatively small compared to synthetic biology in western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, with 360 and 50 entries on the SynBio map respectively.
However the SynBio Map may not provide an accurate picture of synthetic biology in Japan since, as mentioned previously, relevant work there is classified under more traditional fields. In the SynBio map webpage, it states that the entries listed are strictly those indicated as synthetic biology work. Many researchers in Japan who do studies that could be seen as synthetic biology have not felt a need to classify their work as such, particularly when it is already classified under another category (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Japan is one of the Asian countries that send relatively many universities to participate in the iGEM competition.  12 teams from 11 different Japanese universities participated in the competition (in 2012, Tokyo University had two different teams).  In 2012, out of 51 Asian teams, 11 of them were from Japan.  Also, Japanese universities have shown great achievements in the competition. It can be perceived by the fact that all Japanese universities that participated in 2009 and 2010, managed to get medals (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
In 2006, Chiba University and Tokyo Institute of Technology are the first two Japanese universities that joined the competition. Tokyo Institute of Technology participated all the subsequent iGEM competitions. They received Gold medals in every year from 2007 until 2012. Chiba University only participated from 2006 to 2010 (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
The following table summarizes the achievements of the Japanese universities from 2006 to 2012 iGEM competition.
Biotechnology Industry & Funds
The market size of biotechnology industry in Japan is around US$ 18 billion. Biotech clusters in Japan exist in 5 major cities, Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Most biotechnology industries in Japan are operated as business activities within pre-existing large technology Japanese corporations.  In 2010, the Japanese government invested US$ 50 to 60 billion in science and technology, with life science being viewed as an"

Add 250 ml of Solution II and mix the sample by gently inverting the  tube 4 to 6 times. Do not vortex or shake the sample vigorously. The bacterial  suspension should begin to clear which have lysed the bacterial cells in this  step. Warning: Do not stop here for more than five min, as the high pH  hurts your DNA!
Add 350 ml of Solution III and mix by gently inverting the tube 4 to  6 times until a flocculent white precipitate forms. Do not shake vigorously, as  it might break the genomic DNA.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min at  room temperature to pellet the cell debris. You should see a white precipitate  in the tube after the centrifugation.
While the samples are centrifuging, for  each sample, label a clean HiBind Miniprep Column which is to assembled in a  2-ml collection tube
Apply the supernatants from step 8 to the  columns.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min at  RT. Discard the flow-through in the collection tube.
Add 500 ml of Buffer HB to wash the Hibind Miniprep Column.  Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min at RT. Discard the flow-through in the  collection tube.
Wash the  column by adding 700 ml of DNA  Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1  min at room temperature and discard the flow-through.
Then centrifuge the tubes again for 2 min  to remove all the moisture.
Place the column in a clean 1.5 ml  eppendorf tube that is labeled with the plasmid name and group number. To elute  the DNA, add 50 ml of Elution Buffer  to the center of each column. Let the samples stand for 2 or more minutes at  RT, and then centrifuge for 1 min. The sample in the centrifuge tube (bottom)  is your plasmid DNA.
Discard the column and save the sample in  the eppendorf tube by placing it in the freezer (-20°C).

RMIT IGEM Team 2010
Hello from RMIT!
RMIT is located in Melbourne, Australia and thus far it looks like the team will consist of students studying biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences, possibly bringing on board some chemical engineering students as well. Watch this space!
Project Summary The objective for our iGEM 2010 team is to create a biological system that will produce a peptide at a low economic cost. This machine includes the use of a bacterial plasmid (vector) that will incorporate a T7 promoter under control of lac elements to express a soluble theromostable protein carrier molecule to allow for sufficient production of the peptide that will be added to the vector by a process of ligation-independent cloning. The peptide will be separable by thermal release from the carrier protein for simple bioprocessing and process intensification. We believe that this system can then be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag associated with its manufacture and development to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research or treatment.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Conclusion
Concluding, we reflected our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenge considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which things were beyond the scope of the project and we identified things we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible. Thinking from these four different perspectives was really effective. We were able to reflect the project on different levels, even though the team composition was balanced more towards the experts and system integrators.
Summary
The goal of the workshop had two sides. For iGEM, this workshop will be a design evaluation/reflection exercise. For the CEE it is important to receive feedback on the Engineering Roles; possibly determining more engineering roles and match specific skills with the roles.
To conclude, we reflected on our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenges considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which aspects were beyond the scope of the project and we identified aspects that we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible.
