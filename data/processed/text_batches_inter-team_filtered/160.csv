Sequence Description
Coding
RcsB is a receiver protein which acts as a positive regulator of a number of genes including capsule genes responsible for colanic acid production.
Coding
Dam (DNA Adenine Methylase) The methylase encoded by the dam gene ( Dam methylase ) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of the adenine residues in the sequence GATC, this protects the DNA from cleavage.
Coding
Colanic acid global regulator ygiV (B3023) increases the production of colanic acid further in conjunction with RcsB by acting as a repressor for mcbR/yncC promoter. YncC/mcbR normally repress colanic acid overproduction so as to increase biofilm formation.
Coding
Waal Ligase is an enzyme responsible for the ligation of an O-antigen to the core oligosaccharide in the Gram-negative bacterium's outer membrane.
Coding
OtsA is the first of two required in the conversion of glucose to trehalose .
This enzyme catalyses the following reaction:
UDP-glucose + D-glucose 6-phosphate -> UDP + alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate
Coding
OtsB This enzyme is the second of two required for the conversion of glucose to trehalose .
This enzyme catalyses the following reaction:
alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate + H2O -> alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate
Coding
Cellulase mainly catalyses the reactions that changes crystalline cellulose to cellobiose and then finally to glucose. This cellulase is protease resistant.
Coding
Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme that breaks down phenylalanine to tyrosine . Deficiency of this enzyme activity results in the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria .
Coding
Opiorphin is a pentapeptide that inhibits the breakdown of endorphines. This results in powerful painrelief. This part contains an enterokinase cleavage site to facilitate synthesis and subsequent activation.

British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Notebook#Week 16_-_-_TEXT.html," characterize the synthases in C41 bacteria. This time, they were going to not evaporate any of the pentane. It was suggested that evaporating the pentane, while reduces the volume, also evaporates away some of the product as they are very volatile. This is particularly true of alpha-pinene and beta-pinene.
There were several methods that could be tried. Daisy talked to Chris Keeling and he says that they do the in vitro assay in the GCMS vials (the 2 mL vials). This way, they do not have to transfer the pentane.
The other method was to try in a smaller glass vial, such as the yeast preparation vials.
Daisy and Joe decided that because we have four samples:
alpha-pinene - done in yeast preparation vials (can hold larger volume)
beta-pinene - done in GCMS vials
1,8 - cineole - done in yeast preparation vials
1,8-cineole - done in GCMS vials
In addition, some of the samples throughout the preparation to the GCMS were taken and run on an SDS-PAGE to confirm protein expression.
Some of the problems with this batch was that the amount of time it took to grow to absorbance 0.8 was much longer than usual. This may be because the usual incubator at 37 degrees was not available. Joe instead had to use the 38-39 (slight variation in temperature) incubator. It look a couple of hours longer to grow to that temperature.
Daisy asked quite a few people to see if they knew whether growing it at a higher temperature would affect enzyme function or inclusion body formation. Most people could not give an definitive answer as to whether it would severely impact enzyme production. Regardless, growing bacteria at 38 to 39 is not great. However, due to the amount of time we have, we decided to proceed with the pellets anyway.
The results came back:
alpha-pinene - GCMS data
beta-pinene - no data
1,8 cineole - no data
1,8 cineole - no data
alpha-pinene and beta-pinene were grown at the same time in the same batch with the same incubator. The only difference was the way the in vitro assay was set up. The alpha-pinene was set up in a yeast preparation vial with a larger volume of enzyme as opposed to beta-pinene which was done at a much smaller volume.
Beta-pinene was later re-done with the yeast vial preparation method for the in vitro assay.
The protein samples were run on an"

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," ODE system are defined as the derivatives of the solution with respect to the parameters. We choose to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis, which is meant to be used for exploring the sensitivity over a larger domain without calculating derivatives.
A scan of parameters as well as sensitivity test can be done using R, with the package ODEsensitivity. We primarily employ the ""Morris Method"" for global sensitivity analysis. Morris Method is also known as Morris' OAT Method, where OAT stands for ""One At a Time"".  Namely, when using Morris Method, one parameter value undergoes is changed during each run. Parameters change within a confined parameter space, while a sensitivity measure named ""the elementary effect"" is calculated during each run.
$$[EE_i=\frac{f(x_1,x_2,...,x_i+\delta ,...,x_k)-y}{\delta}$$
In the test, $\mu^*$, the mean of the elementary effects, is used to measure the influence of a parameter on the output. The larger it is, the more this parameter would influence the model. $\sigma$, the variance, is a measure of non-linearity and/or interaction effects of the parameter.
4.2 Sensitivity Test of the Parameters
What is robustness? Robustness means some properties of the system are able to remain the same under perturbations. In our case, if our model is ""robust""  Here are some plots showing the elementary effects of several parameters. As expected, $\mu^*$ and $\sigma$ tend to increase over time.
Figure 10     Results of Sensitivity Test. Two Parameters Have Especially Large Impacts on the System When Perturbed.
These are just two pieces of snapshots of the results of a series of scans. Apparently, two parameters stand out to be much more sensitive than any other parameters. The lines that represent them are specially highlighted. These two parameters stand for “efficiency of lux pR promoter” and “binding affinity of luxR-AHL to lux pR”. Intriguingly, these two parameters involve lux pR, which is a primary interest in our project. In previous parts, we have already analyzed how lux pR efficiency greatly impacts our system. This accords with the conclusion drawn from the sensitivity test as well.
Following numerous repetitive runs of sensitivity test, we confirmed the only those two parameters addressed above are significantly sensitive to perturbations.
Based on this, we can say that our system is generally robust, as minor changes to the majority of the parameter values does not significantly affect the results. For now, our simulation results"

Overview
After designing a large number of RNA-based thermosensors, we began to consider about how to measure these thermosensors to get their melting temperature, intensity and sensitivity. After reading a large amount of relevant literature, we designed the following measurement device, which consists of a promoter, RNA-based thermosensor, sfGFP and double terminator. We have added different types of measurement devices to the Parts Registry.
Figure 1. Diagram of the measurement device.
The measurement protocol has been added to the Protocol page, you can click here to read. And for more information about the results , you can visit our results page.
Measurement Device
1. Promoter
In the selection of promoters, we have done pre-experiments to select suitable promoter for different types of RNA-based thermosensors, in order to get the valid expression intensity between different RNA-based thermosensors and avoid the inaccurate results.
2. RNA-based thermosensor
RNA-based thermosensor is the temperature sensing element, which involves the Shine-Dalgarno （SD） sequence. We have designed four different types of RNA-based thermosensors. For more information about the design of the RNA-based thermosensor, you can visit our Design page. Click Here!
3. sfGFP
sfGFP, superfolder Green Fluorescence Protein，is the reporter protein of measurement device. It develops fluorescence about 3 fold faster than mut3 GFP and reaches 4 fold higher absolute fluorescence levels. Fluorescent colonies can be identified with the naked eyes even without UV or blue light illumination. Additionally it is more stable in vitro and refolds faster after in vitro denaturation with respect to mut3 GFP.
Since we used the Golden Gate assembly this year, the sfGFP from iGEM parts registry cannot be used because it contains the commonly used IIS restriction enzyme site. In order to solve this problem"
BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,": Activation of astrocytes was performed to confirm that our C8D30 astrocyte cell line can accurately model resting and reactive astrocytes for our experimental design.
Importance:Our project is based on the assumption that reactive astrocytes are a main factor in ALS and therefore our product is designed to specifically disarm them. Without a “reactive astrocyte” experimental group, we can not test the efficiency and specificity of our product in reactive astrocytes when compared to other cells in the system.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Achivements_-_-_TEXT.html," since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Survey Analysis
When we had chosen to create a worm buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practises group. The modeling group worked with creating a analysis program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"binant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

Microfluidics parts (chips created)
Our team designed and made 4 microfluidic chips. At the beginning, we also used the MITOMI chip .
When designing the chips, the team took into account the future users and the current iGEM classification of parts. We considered it best to construct our chips as composite microfluidic parts, so their sub-parts could be used and combined in multiple ways. The flow and control layers can be separated and reused, as well as all the basic structures (chamber + connecting channel), nodes, array parts,...

The picture below shows the process we used to piece together our design:
The blue F2620 part is our promoter. It detects the presence of P. aeruginosa by its quorum sensing factors.
The green E0840 part is our reporter. It is the gene for the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).
The blank ring is our plasmid that holds the assembly. Its part name is pSB1T3. It uses tetracyclene for its antibiotic selection.

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," make it easier to eventually create a website. Alyssa met with Professor Griffin, who specializes in community-based research and outreach. We worked on the PowerPoint and brochure for our Bioengineering Lab, and the PowerPoint is now playing and visible to anyone passing by our lab.  GSCC got back in touch with Alyssa on possibly organizing a field trip for Girl Scouts to the BEL. In addition to that, Alyssa communicated with Kelley Clark from the STEM Education Alliance to organize education activities with AP Bio/9th Grade Bio students in the fall.
Week 3 (June 12 - June 18)
Wetlab Summary
This week, we were held up a great deal due to not being able to send for sequencing. We are currently in experiments to confirm pdts are working, and cloning inducible sfGFP pdt parts to be able to measure speed. We are switching over to pLac instead of pBad, which entails additional concerns due to the need for a repressor.
Outreach Summary
Alyssa got in touch with Jacqueline from GSCC to discuss doing activities with the Girl Scouts. We will host about 50 girls on two Saturdays either in September or October. For the database, we've gone back to 2011 outreach projects but will likely end up going back to 2008. Alyssa started organizing a speaker series, and three professors have agreed to speak. Theresa and Alyssa started working on a video for our project. Sejal finished updating the K-5 and 6-8 activity booklets.
Week 4 (June 19 - June 25)
Wetlab Summary
We finally confirmed an mf-Lon and pdt combo. We currently have characterization of J23100 tags along with a pBad mf-Lon. We are also trying to functionally confirm a J23116 mf-Lon, and characterize R0011 (pLac0-1) pdts with pBad mf-Lon. One issue we have been running into is with mf-lon causing toxicity/growth inhibition. We will aim to tune our parts around this. The graph below shows evidence for mf-Lon induced toxicity. The J23100 construct does not possess a pdt and fluorescence decreases despite that no GFP is getting degraded.
Outreach Summary
We set up the dates for the GSCC visit in October. We have continued to enter entries into the database spreadsheet and have decided to house the database in the wiki so it will be accessible to other iGEM teams and iGEM leadership. We made and edited the script for the viedo describing our"

Introduction
Since the system we design is used for synthesis of polyketones, it is necessary to ensure the supply of various substrates. As a typical substrate of diversified polyketones, propionyl-CoA is needed to reach the level of enough concentration. Thus, we knock out some pathways in E.coli to increase the concentration of propionyl-CoA. Moreover, we enhance the pathways that convert propionate into propionyl-CoA. By the way, sfp gene is also integrated into BL21 (DE3), and BAP1 is achieved after all of these modification.
Design
In E.coli, propionate is converted into propionyl-CoA and then utilized for metabolism with the steps catalyzed by proteins of the prp locus. Specifically, PrpE is in charge of the converting part, and PrpRBCD utilize propionyl-CoA as a metabolic substrate. Therefore, we delete prpRBCD genes in order that the ability of E.coli to utilize propionate as a carbon and energy source was eliminated. However, propionyl-CoA can only be produced through the converting reaction, so the prpE gene was placed under control of an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter.
By the way, using homologous recombination, a single copy of the sfp gene under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter was integrated in the prp operon of BL21(DE3), yielding E. coli BAP1.
The sfp gene product, which is part of the surfactin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis, can effectively modify ACPs from all PK"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

We used the Epoch GenCatch Advanced Gel Extraction Kit .
Procedure
Gel Extraction
Using a razor blade, excise the gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest under the illumination of LONG wave length UV light (be sure to wear goggles and to cut out as little extra agarose as possible)
Measure the weight of the gel slice using a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
Add 3 volumes of GEX buffer to 1 volume of gel (100 mg of gel slice is roughly equal to 100 ul)
Incubate at 55C on a heating block for 5-10 min until gel is completely dissolved (invert the tube every 1-2 min during incubation)
Place an extraction column onto a collection tube. Load 0.7mL dissolved gel mixture onto the column.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 5000rpm and discard flow through.
Repeat step 5 for the remaining mixture if the mixture is more than 0.7mL.
Wash the column once with 0.5mL of WN buffer by centrifuging for 30 seconds at 5000 rpm and discard flow through.
Wash column once with 0.5mL with WS buffer by centrifuging for 60 seconds at 5000 rpm and discard flowthrough.
Centrifuge column at 12000 rpm for another 3 minute to remove residual ethanol.
Place column onto new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 15-30uL of elution buffer onto the center of the membrane.
Stand the column for two minutes and then centrifuge (Remove cap of microcentrifuge tube) for 60 seconds at 12000rpm to elute the DNA.
Nanodrop to obtain concentration of DNA.
Store at -20 freezer.

This model is built to select neurons which may have signal connections with AWA and AWB and to determine the specific promoters to express gene in them.
After we successfully integrated ord-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP fusion genes in C. elegans(Caenorhabditis elegans) respectively, we can train worms by stimulating neurons AWA and AWB. After that, we hope to focus on the neuron network change due to new learning behaviors.
To achieve that, GEM-GECO, as calcium indicator, will also express in the downstream neurons of AWA AWB. We use our optical platform to receive the output signal of GEM-GECO when the neurons are activated. We expect to witness that for example, after worms are trained to be addicted with alcohol, the neuronal activation pattern surrounding the AWA AWB neuron will also change. New signal connection pathway may be built among neurons.
Firstly, we assume that the strength of a connection is positively correlated with the number of synapses, including synaptic outputs from any group of presynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the total synaptic outputs of the presynaptic neurons and synaptic inputs to any group of postsynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the synaptic inputs of the postsynaptic neurons.
2 steps are considered to design the further experiment:
Select the neurons that are strongly connected with AWA AWB.
Select specific promoters to express GEM-GECO in the neurons.
Fig.1 The purpose of this model is to select promoters used in neurons which have greatest probability to be lighted on when AWA and AWB are active.

 Previousrelated projects
 
In 2010 iGEMcompetition, Queens-Canada team submited halorhodopsin from H. salinarum as biobricks and inserted thisgene to C. elegans. However, it wasnot well characterized. This year, we are trying to clone halorhdopsin from N. pharaonis, which has already beensuccessfully introduced and proved to perform complete light cycles in E. coli, to our biobrick system1. We aim to characterize the efficiency ofthis halorhodopsin to be a well-documented biobrick and a useful tool in E. coli.
 
In previous iGEMprojects, various light sensors have been developed, including red light sensor(UT Austin, 2004), green light sensor (Tokyo-Nokogen, 2009) and blue lightsensor (University of Edinburgh, 2010). They are all light-induced fusiontranscription factors that trigger gene expression under the control ofspecific promoters, facilitating simply on/off switch and light-coupledcommunication. However, our design makes halorhodopsin not only a dynamic tunablelight sensor – by coupling with chloride sensitive promoters (e.g. Pgad),but also an energy converter – by storing solar energy as osmolality potentialand further converted to electricity. Our project would provide a wilder scopeof applications from signal transduction and gene regulation to energygeneration.

1.     Introductionof mechanism
In the nature, the water cycle is drivenby solar energy. One part of the water cycle is that solar energy evaporateswater in the sea to become fresh water through inland precipitation. Fromanother point of view, during evaporation, the entropy of different ions in thesea, mainly sodium, chloride and potassium, decreases as ion concentration iselevated. It is a common phenomenon when high concentration solution of acertain solvent, such as sodium chloride, is diluted, the entropy of thesolvent increases and the energy is released as heat. Thus the ocean isactually a gigantic energy reservoir. Its energy is transformed from solarenergy and stored as salinity"

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," for drug production you probably mind less.
When we talk about medical uses, it’s the epitome of the conflict between safety and benefit. So you were saying before that most research doing is more on the structural level of how the network function. Maybe you are not looking at medical app.
Do you see the conflict between the safety and the benefit being such a barrier that it might take decades for this technology to be applied or did you find in your research that there is a way to predictably create networks already that might be able to make safe medical application?
In my research no, but I think the field is quite far in this question. For example Prof. Fussenegger at the ETH Zurich, does a lot of work for medical applications. They already proved in mice that they can fight different diseases for example diabetes or  skin diseases. To be honest, I don’t know, how far they are to get the approval to do human trials.
Another thing to consider is how bad the disease is. If it the last hope, then people are willing to take more risk that than if the  disease can already be cured by some existing drug.
Last question! Do you see a world in the future with everything around us that could be engineered? Like where everything is modified, like food is more nutritious. Etc.
Last question! Do you see a world in the future with everything around us that could be engineered? Like where everything is modified, like food is more nutritious. Etc.
It’s a bit scary no? But, to be honest I think there is not much different between this and breeding right? We ‘ve been doing this for centuries, we are just getting better at it! EPFL:
The difference, I guess, is we were doing it without knowing the mechanism behind it, and now we know. Like carrots weren’t orange until the 1800s, so we clearly changed their genes, but now we could do it much, much faster.
I think that’s it for the interview. Thank you very much. We won’t take more of your time! It was really informative and interesting discussing with you.
And good luck and enjoy the Jamboree."

In the second construct, the cI repressor thermolabile (cI(Ts)) from biobrick BBa_K098995 will be used instead of the wild-type repressor. In this case, the repression is lost for temperatures above 42°C (T2) and the bacterial cells should be red.
In the third construct, the cI open reading frame will be under control of the RNA thermometer of biobrick BBa_K115017 (Pthermo). With this construct, the cI translation will not occur for temperatures below 32°C (T1) and bacterial cells will be red. However, if the bacteria are grown at temperatures above 32°C, the cI repressor is synthesized and active, repressing the lycopene biosynthesis, bacteria will be white.
Finally, the fourth construct is a combination of biobrick BBa_K115017 and BBa_K098995. The expression of the cI repressor thermolabile cI repressor is dependant of  RNA thermometer; with this construct, the repressor is expressed above 32°C but inactivated at 42°C. The cI-controlled lycopene biosynthesis genes will generate red bacteria when grown below 32°C or above 42°C and colorless bacteria between 32°C and 42°C (Fig. 5)

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," Our aim was to genetically engineer phiSBRC in such a way as to render it capable of suppressing toxin production within the C. difficile cells it integrates into. This would mean that even the non-lysed C. difficile cells would become non-pathogenic and would make the engineered phiSBRC phage a viable therapeutic to combat CDI.
One consideration when choosing to work on a therapeutic for humans was the importance of consulting the relevant legislation, public perception and other human practices issues. It was thought that there may be a degree of concern about the idea of introducing genetically engineered phages into patients. For this reason one of our human practices goals was to gain data on public perceptions to our proposed therapeutic. This involved a focus group, expert interviews and an analysis of commentary of a phage themed online video. A key finding which we integrated into our project was the importance of the means of administration of the phage for influencing public perception. As a result of these investigations we opted for encapsulating our therapeutic; serendipitously this was in accordance with the scientific literature which we consulted on the means of phage delivery. Also, in accordance with the information we gained, we created a phage therapy information leaflet. It not only serves to educate the publics on phage therapy but can also be given by physicians to patients who are receiving the treatment.
One approach we took to investigate the feasibility of our engineered phage against CDI was to create a mathematical model of the phage/bacterial cell lifecycle. The model was used to answer a question we encountered while designing the laboratory work. Our overall aim was to design, build and test a genetic construct which suppresses toxin production in C. difficile and subsequently modify the phage to express our construct. The plan to modify the phage involved using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to integrate our construct into the prophage genome. As part of this approach a region of DNA must be removed from the target genome, as such we had the option to remove a region of the phage genome which may further enhance our end product. The specific gene we considered removing encoded a holin; this enzyme is responsible for lysing the bacterial cell at the end of the phage replication cycle. Without the holin the phage would be unable to lyse the cell it resides in. It was thought that this may be useful since in the gut our model suggests we would produce subpopulations of C. difficile some of which have been infected by our modified phage (lysogens) and are as such non-toxigenic while others have not been infected and are therefore capable"

Description: Professor in Environmental Pharmacology at University of Gothenburg. Director of Antibiotic Resistance Research. He also investigates the influence of antibiotics on organisms in sludge and wastewater.
Input:
No organisms with the improved laccase can be released in the environment. The gene could pass through to pathogenic bacteria and serve there as a novel resistance gene.
If you want to target antibiotics you need to focus on locations where the concentration is high enough to reach a selective level.
For implementation you could focus on industrial effluent where effluents are high enough to reach selective levels.
Look into proposed discharge limits based on the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNECs) of your targeted compound.
Adjustment:
Strengthened the direction of immobilization since no modified organism are used at site of implementation.
We investigated the upstream hot spots where pharmaceuticals are produced or are undiluted.
We took the PNECs from literature as the base for future regulations (see our developed Student Standard together with ISO).

3.Changchun International forum of Oncobiology and Translational Medicine
On June.19th, 2016, Jilin_China Team attended Changchun International forum of Oncobiology and Translational Medicine. We interviewed the experts in cancer biology about the current trends and newly developed methods of treating solid tumors. In addition, we also asked their advices on our project.
3.International Forum
Professor Yun Dai from Jilin University gave a lecture about precise targeted therapy and drug-resistance in hematologic malignancies. We consulted him about drug-resistance. He told us there are two kinds of drug-resistance: primary resistance and long-term resistance. He also used one repressor named HDAC as example. It has curative effect to treat neoplastic hematologic disorder, but it has unsatisfactory result to treat solid tumors. Although HDAC is effective in vitro, it still needs more experiments to be verified. He also mentioned that if we want to develop a real drug, we should consider safety tests, pharmacology researches and clinical trials as well.
3.International Forum
Professor Cheshi Chen from Kunming Institute Of Zoology, CAS, gave a lecture about the development of new animal models for breast cancers. He discussed four kinds of common animal models: spontaneous animal model, experimental animal model, implanted tumor model and PDX model. He also mentioned some alternative animal models of breast cancers in addition to these commonly used laboratory mice.
Assistant Professor Boyi Gan from the University of Texas MD discussed energy metabolism and sensing in cancer. We asked him some questions about current cancer therapies. He told us that although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have low targeting, these two therapies are still major treatments in clinic application. Some new methods, such as targeted therapy and immunization therapy, may demonstrate better targeting effects, but they still have many weaknesses. Targeted therapy is designed to treat patients with specific mutations, so the rates of mutation largely determine the efficacy of the treatment. Immunization therapy can educate patient’s own immune system to cure cancer, and it is now widely used in clinic. He suggested that our group should verify whether bifidobacterium could educate human immune system.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," will use to approximate the 12 V of our system, we have an efficiency of about 75%. This means electrical work (12 A * 12 V) is 144 W, which will generate 0.75 * 144 = 108 W of mechanical work.
Using the DC Motor power equations given by Micromo we calculated the maximum RPM from the given torque.
Using the calculated torque to drive the load and theoretical maximum power given, the model predicts that the motor generate an RPM much more than the 12,199 RPM necessary. In reality, the motor will draw less current once it hits the max rotational speed of 1400 * 12 V, rather than reach this theoretical maximum. This proves that the motor is capable of running the centrifuge at a speed fast enough for miniprepping plasmid DNA.
Stress Simulation
There were two aspects of the lab-in-a-box that we wanted to simulate: the stress on the PLA based centrifuge rotor during centrifugation and the effect of unbalanced shaking on the motor. This was extremely important for safety, as we didn't want the 3D printed pieces or the motor shaft to be destroyed and cause injuries in the process. We use AutoDesk Fusion and PTC Creo in order to simulate the stress put on them.
For the centrifuge, two tests were simulated. The first was using AutoDesk Fusion, where the centrifuge piece was subject to the angular acceleration found through our calculations. Using PLA for our rotor piece and plastic casing filled with dense metal as our microcentrifuge tubes, we found that there was minimal concern for too much load, but that the load was mostly concentrated in a ring between the holes where the centrifuge tubes were placed. We increased the distance between the holes for centrifuge tubes as a result, even though it decreased our capacity.
For our shaker, we used PTC Creo and subjected the parts under 100 N m of torque, which represents the initial stress felt as the shaker was accelerating. We found that there was managable stress placed on the motor shaft, which allowed up to proceed with our 3D printing and construction

Centrifuge Speed Requirement
When designing a product, it's important to define a problem or need correctly before finding the solution. During our design process, we realized we never questioned whether or not the speed (17,900 x g) required in the miniprep protocol was actually required for plasmid extraction. If it were possible that it could be done at a lower speed, it would"
NUS_Singapore,2017,Team:NUS Singapore#Model P_-_-_TEXT.html," a delay in killing is due to propagation delay. In the Automated Circuit, propagation delay occurs because of the complexity of the circuit. With each added part and its respective interaction, the time taken for changes in the environment to be recognised in the output response increases because of the increased processes. In other words, the more complex the genetic circuit is, the longer it takes to generate output. To rectify this issue, it is possible to increase the promoter strength and RBS of the parts in the circuit, however, this comes at the risk of increasing metabolic stress.
For more information about the complete model of the Automated Circuit including sensitivity analysis, and optimisation of the Automated Circuit, click here .
Figure 12 The Functional Model of the Automated Circuit. Note the time taken to repress IM2 in Wastewater (45-50hrs) is slower than in the Simple Circuit.
Comparison of Simple Circuit & Automated Circuit
Comparing the two designs, we can observe that both have their own advantages and disadvantages. The Automated Circuit offers increased response control, modularity, and buffering against some mutations and error. The Automated Circuit offers increased response control because each of its input sensors is independent of each other. Therefore, a user can not only develop complex logic to control output, but can also rely less on ensuring that all sensors work 100% since the output can be reliant on multiple input sensors. For example, unlike the Simple Circuit where the input promoters are cascaded, in the automated circuit, the input promoters are independent and therefore in the case of a leaky promoter, the effect it has on the output response is less in Automated Circuit than in the Simple Circuit. In addition, the Automated Circuit offers modularity because a user can simply replace the input sensors with other input sensors and make slight modifications to the kinetics involved. However, in the Simple Circuit, a user were to use different sensors, they may need to overhaul the genetic circuit design depending on the promoter types. Finally, the automated circuit offers buffering against some mutations and small errors. Because of the intermediate processes involved between input and output, some small errors caused by mutation are not significant in changing the output response of the genetic circuit. On the other hand, if mutations occurred in the Simple Circuit, because of the cascaded configuration and high dependency on parts, errors will have a large effect on the response output and can potentially cause failure.
However, there are limitations that exist in the Automated Circuit that are made up for in the Simple Circuit. One of the biggest drawbacks in the Automated Circuit is complexity. With increasing complexity comes issues surrounding propagation delay, metabolic stress, and construction difficulty."

Virtual Hospital
ATOMS Türkiye team offered a very new approach to synthetic biology this year. It is  Virtual Hospital, where synthetic biology meets futuristic medicine.  This new approach includes lots of imagination, new diagnosis&treatment methods, future–proof synthetic biology and even collaboration.
To explain what Virtual Hospital is; We all know that today's technology was someone's dream a long time ago, and now it's real. It makes us thinking that, what if all project ideas we elected because of its safety issues could be made in the future easily. it’s a whole another topic that people are okay with radiotherapy and chemotherapy  but not getting genetically engineered cells in their body. This idea courages us to imagine more dependently during the project finding process. For example your grandpa wouldn't think of a bacteria which can take a photo, detect an illness or show how many celcius degrees a volcano's crater is. Now this are all real, and it means it is possible for today's synthetic biology solutions to be applied to medicine in a near future. By the way, the message we want to give to all iGEMers -especially Health&Medicine project makers- is, that you  are able to feel in creating projects without getting worried of its feasibility or future. This doesn’t mean we’re deleting ethics&safety aspects but thinking more open-mindedly.
 
After releasing a trailer of Virtual Hospital, we have prepared and released short informing videos in order to explain what kind of ideas could be useful in our futuristic hospital. Then we asked other teams if they want to join us with their projects or other ideas. UCL iGEM Team was interested in, so we turned their project ‘Mind the Gut’ into a Virtual Hospital part. Both UCL and ATOMS iGEM teams enjoyed this collaboration, hopefully we can courage iGEMers to be more dependent while building our future with synthetic biology."

For example, researchers have genetically modified commensal bacteria to secrete keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) for treatment of colitis. If these bacteria were to be developed into a product, it would be controlled under the Biologics Program, similarly to our project.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," adhere to these issues. For example, it would be good to make it impossible to publish in high-impact journals without adequate proof that they considered certain ethics and standards. This would stimulate such an activity enormously within the synthetic biology community. There are also research projects funded by the EC in which the grant is awarded based on to the inclusion of ethical, legal and social aspects in the project.
6. Justice
When you have this powerful way of distributing goods and making new kind of things, how to answer the questions about the ‘Justice’ aspect, like: “Who should get the benefit?”, “Who should win or lose?” and ""What about ownership?""
These are very fundamental and political questions. It is not within the scope of the EC to answer such questions but it’s a matter for the member states to hammer out a consensus about this together with the European Council. But in our market economy it is the market that decides who will be the winner and who will get the benefits and this is certainly not always in accordance to global justice or solidarity criteria.
Synthetic biology entails several of these discussions in it. As mentioned earlier for example with bio-fuels, the discussion about food vs. energy related applications and whether or not is just to cut forestland's. The GMO issues have a long history of discussion about equitable sharing of generic resources, for example, in Brazil the rain forest is very rich in biodiversity and harbors a very interesting potential for pharmaceutical companies to see which exotic genes they can find there. Should there be some kind of reward for a country for finding a commercially useful gene? Should there be some reward for this find in monetary terms if this provides to be a market success? These were all questions also raised during the GMO debate. In pure synthetic biology these questions are also important as now entirely new and synthetic things are created.
Open-Source vs. Patents
In the field of synthetic biology a big question is the one about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and patents and whether an open source or patent approach should be used. This is going to be crucial in the way this field will be defined in the future and in the way its research will be carried out in the future.
The K.U.Leuven iGEM team wondered if this issue was not already raised with the GMO debate? It turns out that for GMOs patents are indeed used.  But synthetic biology raises new issues: in the GMO debate era there was no such movement like the BioBricks. This idea of having genetic parts available to everybody is completely new. The biotechnological community finds open-source a big hurdle, as our"

Fluorescence value is an important synthetic biology signal, but it can vary widely in different instruments. As a result, comparing the fluorescence output of test devices by creating a standard fluorescence curve can accurately standardize the amount and fluctuation of GFP fluorescencein in provided kits. In the fluorescence curve measurement, we used the fluorescein powder delivered by committee and made a serial dilution in the 96-well plate according to the protocol. 4 replicates were measured in total.

Cell measurement
The calibrations experiments above ensured us to complete the cell measurements under the standard conditions. In order to get the valid measurement results, the following tests were all finished with the same settings as we used in calibration measurements.
1)preparation
First of all, we transformed the given plasmids into E.coli K-12 DH5-alpha on the plates of LB medium with chloramphenicol of 25μg/ml in 37℃, and picked 2 colonies of each plate over night, inoculating into 5ml Luria- Bertani liquid medium with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol, incubating in 37°C at the speed of 220 rpm for 16hrs.
Secondly, the cell cultures were diluted to the concentration of Abs600=0.02 for target start and were transferred to the same LB medium of 12mL in 50mL falcon tubes, at the same incubator above. At the time of 0 and 6 hours of incubation, we took off 500μL into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes of each colony of 8 devices, and placed them on ice to prevent from further growth.
Last but most importantly, we pipetted 4 replicates samples of each devices, 100μL per well, into a 96-well plate. Samples were laid out according to the plate diagram shown in the protocol.

Source of the Idea
        As the pollution of heavy metal is serious, and the current methods of detection                     are complex and expensive, this year SCUT-China_A team want to develop an efficient and low-cost method                     to detect heavy metal ions.
        Our idea is inspired by the release of neurotransmitters from synapses. When                     a nerve impulse is transmitted to the postsynaptic membrane, the calcium ion channels would be opened,                     so that the synaptic vesicles would be transported out of postsynaptic membrane and release the neurotransmitters.                     Because the neurotransmitter is pre-synthesized, when the impulse arrives, the membrane is able to respond                     immediately and quickly. In similar way, we make an effort to combine the lysis gene and a kind of ""chemical                     signal factor"" to form a report module which can quickly respond to specific ""impulse"".
Report module
1. Lysis
        Aimed at imitating the release of neurotransmitter, we looked up some researches                     about the mechanisms of the phage’s infection on E. coli: when the phages infect E. coli, the bacteria’s                     cell wall would lysis, so that the viruses could be released. We got the lysis gene SRRz from the phage, and tried to standardize it to build up a bacteria lysis module.                     The results indicated that This lysis module could cause rapid lysis of E. coli, and the expression of                     lysis gene is much more efficient than previous reporters such as GFP.
2. Chromogenic Reaction
        We decide to look for a kind of ""chemical signal factor"" that can serve as our system’s                     “signal factor” (like the “neurotransmitters” in nerve cells). For the purpose of having obvious and                     clear phenomenon, an endogenous enzyme which can lead to chromogenic reaction would be our ideal choice,                     because the catalytic reaction of the enzyme is rapid and even a small amount of enzyme could result                     in clear phenomenon. What's more, we can he calculate the amount of enzyme relatively accurately by measuring                     the consumption of the substrate or the"

Shuna Gould : 3rd year Biochemist. Self-styled ""lab rat,"" she is paranoid about sterilization and actually understands what's going on (or does a good job faking).
Siming Ma: 2nd year Biochemist. Usually found reading a scientific paper, his approach to everything is either ""they're bacteria, we have NO IDEA what they might do,"" or, ""it'll be fiiiiiiineee.""
Vivian Mullin: 2nd year Biochemist. Does stupid dances when bacteria change colour, produces awesome roadmaps--at the cost of every piece of paper in the lab and several sharpies.
Megan Stanley:  2nd year Physicist. ""BUT I'M A PHYSICIST!"" and ""GUYS, WE NEED A PLAN!"" A fan of decision-making, which is very useful when the rest of us are faffing.
Alan Walbridge: 2nd year Engineer. Champion of wacky ideas (galvanotaxis and bistable switch anyone?), and he also doesn't have swine flu.
Crispian Wilson: 2nd year Geneticist. Mostly likely to bring us delicious desserts he made himself, also most likely to ask a question NOBODY can answer.

Tuesday, 7/16: In the morning, Heather and I prepared ourselves for the afternoon demo session to high school students. We went over what we would say, and then did a run-through with Consuelo. Afterwards, Heather worked on the drag and drop of bacteria, while I worked on improving the aesthetics of our website. At 2 pm, the high school students came and we ran them through the demo. We were a bit short on time, but overall it was a successful experience. Then, in the afternoon, I worked on writing code that would put all the messages we encode into DNA into the GAE datastore. This way, we will have a record of all the messages that are encoded.
Wednesday, 7/17: This morning, Natalie Kuldell from the BioBuilder workshop visited our lab along with high school teacher Rebekah. Once here, all three teams gave presentations and live demos of their projects thus far. It was good practice, and I thought my demo with Heather went very well. Professor Kuldell really liked our application too, and that was definitely a confidence booster. In the afternoon, I set about fixing the dictionary display, which surprisingly turned out to be harder than I had imagined.
Thursday, 7/18: Today we met with both Orit and Consuelo, who advised us that it was time to start focusing on the look and feel. In addition, it was time to start working on our poster as well, as we are aiming to have them printed out and ready by next Wednesday. As as result, Heather and I spent some time in the morning discussing possible themes, and then spent the afternoon working on our poster. With the general layout decided and all parts of our poster written, the lab went to Bikram Yoga for a night I will never forget - what an experience!
Friday, 7/19: Today the HCI lab hosted a farewell party for our interns since it was their last day in the lab. All of them really grew on me so it was sad to say goodbye, but we'll be seeing them again at the poster session! The rest of the day was spent working on the two mockups that we will show Orit next week. For me, personally, this was a big challenge since I'm not very good at design. I'm much more the person who favors implementation once the vision is made, rather than coming up with that vision. But I worked it through. In the afternoon, the team went into Boston for some bonding time with BU. We spent a"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Silk_-_-_TEXT.html,"2011. Safety evaluation of silk protein film (a novel wound healing agent) in terms of acute dermal toxicity, acute dermal irritation and skin sensitization. Toxicol Int, 18, 17-21. . The silk from Bombyx mori, a domesticated silkworm, has been used for biomedical suture material for centuries and has been much characterized. We ended up choosing silk from the spider Nephila clavipes, which is another extensively characterized silk LTMAN, G. H., DIAZ, F., JAKUBA, C., CALABRO, T., HORAN, R. L., CHEN, J., LU, H., RICHMOND, J. & KAPLAN, D. L. 2003. Silk-based biomaterials. Biomaterials, 24, 401-416 .
The many properties of silk have been used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. It has been shown to be biocompatible, have material versatility  and mechanical robustness GIL, E. S., PANILAITIS, B., BELLAS, E. & KAPLAN, D. L. 2013. Functionalized silk biomaterials for wound healing. Adv Healthc Mater, 2, 206-17 . It has also been suggested that spider silk has bactericidal properties WENDT, H., HILLMER, A., REIMERS, K., KUHBIER, J. W., SCHAFER-NOLTE, F., ALLMELING, C., KASPER, C. & VOGT, P. M. 2011. Artificial skin--culturing of different skin cell lines for generating an artificial skin substitute on cross-weaved spider silk fibres. PLoS One, 6, e21833. .
Spider silk has not been used as much as cocoon silk for commercialization due to the restrained production. It has always been more complicated to produce spider silk compared to harvesting it from cocoons. N. clavipes' silk line is characterized by polyalanine and glycine-glycine-X regions, where X often is either tyrosine, glutamine or leucine. This  gives the dragline toughness, stiffness, strength and extensibility. It is noticeable that this silk line can super contract (meaning it can shrink up to 50% of its original length and generate substantial forces

The main advantage here is to select potential useful bacteria from soil, isolate them, and screen all of them, on fabrics, thanks to a high throughput assay. Nevertheless, it implies a selective bias, as some interesting microorganisms may not grow in the media we chose, or cannot compete with other microorganisms present in the soil.
To tackle this problem, we also followed another approach:
We screened our samples for a microorganism growth directly on anthocyanin-enriched media, and for anthocyanin degradation by absorbance measurement. The idea here is to screen for bacteria that could use anthocyanin as their sole carbon source, and thus degrade it, or that could simply metabolize it. After identification of potential interesting microorganisms, we would isolate them, characterize them, and then test them on stained fabrics.
Therefore, the main point of our team is to put in evidence already existing anthocyanin-degradation metabolism in nature, so that we could isolate the enzymes, and potentially optimize them thanks to the binding domain team results.
Week 27th June - 3rd July
The first step is to define a systematic protocol for the selection of microorganisms from our samples.
It includes :
Determine samples conditions of collection, storage, and treatment before microbes culture.
Determine the selective and nonselective media we will use for culture and the number of dilutions per samples.
After streak and isolation, determine an efficient way to characterize the strains.
For the second approach, where we test directly an anthocyanin-degradation natural metabolism, define the controls.
Therefore, during this week, we focused our work reading articles dealing with bioremediation and isolation of bacteria from soil samples.
Nonetheless, we rapidly had to tackle the following issue: Such approaches implies protocols of microorganisms culture on anthocyanin enriched media or even as a single carbon source. Or, anthocyanin isolation and purification is hard to achieve, and consequently, this chemical compound is really expensive. We cannot afford to buy it in high quantity.
Considering this problem, we decided to take a deeper look in the anthocyanin chemical structure, so that we could potentially find a cheaper substitute molecule for our assays.
Anthocyanin is a phenolic compound which belongs to the Flavonoid family. Flavonoids have a basic structure of C6–C3–C6. Depending on their structures, flavonoids may be classified into about a dozen groups, such as ch"

Summary :
In IGEM, safety is taken seriously. In the lab we have used some dangerous products such as gel red for the electrophoresis, so we had special consideration regarding safety issues.
Safety Training and Lab Rules :
For our project we safely used strains of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli.
All researchers and experiments have been trained in applicable lab safety to insure that no bacteria are inadvertently released into the environment.
During either internships or through classes we had at school, we received proper training on safety in the lab. Before we started our experiments for IGEM competition, we received as a team an additional safety training, after what each of us received a detailed video on safety in the lab in case we wanted to refresh our memory. Our safety training included topics such as:
Rules about protocols in the lab,
Protective clothing and equipment (lab coat and if necessary, gloves and googles),
Waste management (biohazard, defiled glassware, …),
Chemicals products handling and their conservation according to their labels,
Use of various machines (open bench, chemical fume hood, ...) and
Emergency procedures.
So, we learned measures to take in case of spills, burns, injury, different types of danger in the lab, conditions to safely perform experiments and keep the lab area clean for the sake of everybody’s experiments.
Organism used :
E. coli DH5alpha
Risk group: 1
This microorganism is not dangerous to healthy adult humans.

Vector sequences were not detectable in the patients blood or urine at an examination 48 h after an infection with AAV-2 29.
In absence of Rep proteins, the vector DNA stays extrachromosomal and is not frequently integrated.
Concluding all these informations and regulations, the project that we have designed in this year is clearly classified as BLS 1.
General biosafety regulation in Germany
Which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
In Germany all work that includes recombinant DNA technologies is regulated by the Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik . This law regulates general aspects in the life sciences and refers for more precise interpretations in §4 to the Zentrale Kommission für die Biologische Sicherheit . The ZKBS is a commission composed of 20 technical experts that releases yearly statements to actual issues of biosafety. So far the ZKBS released three stratements affecting the work with Adeno-associated viral systems 26, 27, 28 . These documents were used to assess the dangers that could arise from our project to team members and the enviroment.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
At the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg for all concerns of security the Stabsstelle Sicherheit is responsible and to contact if questions arise. Especially for questions of biological security Dr. Petra Markmeyer-Pieles is cognizant. We contacted her a first time befor the begin of our project in March when it was clear that the Adeno-associated Virus (AAV-2) was chosen as the topic of our project. At that time she proposed to do the cloning in the"

Collaboration with Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU-China)
At the beginning of our project, we met with the team from HZAU-China who have participated in iGEM competitions several times.  Since this is our first competition, they shared their experience with us.  They presented their last iGEM project to us to demonstrate the competition process, and also gave us useful suggestions on the construction of our wiki.
Because they are physically close to us, we were able to build a deep collaboration with them.  Very early in our project they supplied us with plasmid backbones and primers from the 2016 DNA Distribution Kit.  This enabled us to get started on our experiments before we received our 2017 Kit.  They made their plate reader available to us, collaborated with our interlab team, and helped us with procedures and with data comparison and analysis.
They also assisted us with modeling.  They helped us understand the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB, and showed us how to use the computer for modeling.  They gave us the idea for the establishment of the dynamics model, and gave us a lot of advice about quasi-steady-state approximation and data analysis.

Entrapment
i) Introduction
After conversion of methane to methanol, the successive step is the entrapment of methanol. Methanol is an alcohol form of hydrocarbon methane and includes hydroxyl group. Hydroxyl radical groups are highly reactive and, and so short-lived; however, they form an important part of radical chemistry. Hydroxyl groups are especially important in biological systems and their chemistry because free radicals tend to form hydrogen bonds both as donor and acceptor. This property is also related to their ability to increase hydrophilicity and water solubility. Therefore hydroxyl free radicals cause damage to oxidative cells and cellular membranes. In order to produce the methanol for further industrial manufacturing in cellular organism, the organismic conditions should be adjusted. In the light of this, for our bacterial system we transferred the protein coding sequence(named as LUSH) of Drosophilia melanogaster to attack to free methanols and hydroxyl group. Here is some structural information about protein LUSH.
ii) Background
LUSH is an alcohol-sensitive odorant binding protein expressed in the olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster, and it is used as a model system to investigate the biophysical nature of alcohol-protein"

We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

Applied Design
We designed a novel technique to t evaluate the expression of miRNA in this project. Previously, miRNA sponge was thought as an effective inhibitor for miRNA and used for miRNA function study in cells. Now, we used them as a monitor to evaluate the expression of miRNA. Our data indicated miRNA sponge may be a novel part for diagnosis colorectal cancer in the future. Our data suggested the slope of the standard curve of miR-21-sponge-2s is better than miR-21-sponge-6s, suggesting the more sensitive of miR-21-sponge-2s as a monitor (Figure). Meanwhile, previous studies indicated miRNA sponge is an effective inhibitor of miRNA, which suggest that this part should be a potential therapy to treat colorectal cancer in the future.

SynBio Day
During the meet-up in Munich all the german iGEM Teams had the opportunity to participate in a Workshops. The participants at the Workshop agreed to an All Germany SynBio Week, which was scheduled in the second week of August.The day we chose was the  15th of August. On the SynBio Day we planned to present our project to the public of our city, Göttingen. The idea behind the SynBio Day was to increase awareness and the ridding of any prejudice or fear of Synthetic Biology. These aims could be achieved by talking face to face with all kinds of people on public places or making informative posters addressing aspects of Synthetic Biology in order to reach people via social media. Furthermore, we did a survey to get an idea about the general opinion of the public about Synthetic Biology.
On this SynBio Day from 10 AM to 5 PM, our team members talked to the citizens of Göttingen at an information booth, which was located at the iconic Gänseliesel in the city center. By showing lively and comic posters, we caught the attention of many. People of different ages stopped by the booth, looked through all the posters and asked questions. Most of them were very curious about the field of Synthetic Biology and our topic especially. Our team members took pleasure in answering all their questions and as a bonus, cakes and muffins were offered to thank them for their attention and interest.

Table 2: The above table simply depicts information about possessors     of parts and their contact information and the popularity of the parts     for groups. Parameters heading, refers distinctive experimental details     unique to the usage of parts which should be decided by groups.
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

To enable the use of DeTaXion to these ends, multiple requirements had to be integrated into the applied design.

Ethical issues among GMO’s and Detaxion
The use of GMO has increasingly come under scrutiny in a range of different fields, with public resistance mainly focussed on its appearance in our diet. Herein, the application of the GMO matters: use of GM animals for the production of pharmaceuticals is viewed far less negatively than use for food (PEGASUS. (2012). Final Report - PEGASUS (Public perception of genetically modified animals - science, utility and society). European Commission CORDIS, United Kingdom). Being a subject of strong debate, it is important to ascertain these ethical concerns for our project and product design, as our biosensor naturally is a GMO. As our sensor is best utilized directly in the field, it is implied that our genetically modified bacteria leave the laboratory to enter the outside world - safely contained within our device - leading to the primary concern of introduction into the environment. This introduction of a modified bacterium is potentially harmful, as it could disrupt ecosystems, introduce antibiotic resistances in other species, and have harmful health effects on humans. These concerns were echoed by Martin van den Berg (deputy director of the Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences), who stressed the importance of containment of our E.coli within our device to prevent introduction. Our device therefore contains a number of safety measures to prevent this, such as adequate sealing and storage, and stringent cleaning and washing steps. For more information on how we integrated these safety issues into our applied design, visit our applied design page . Bacteria themselves also contain a number of safety measures: it is firstly comprised of a weak lab strain, with poor survival chances as a result. The bacteria also contain a killswitch-system preventing survival outside of the device. With this approach, we ensure safe use of our device outside of the laboratory.
Ultimately, utilitarian ethics plays a large role in the public perception of GMO. If the public is sufficiently aware of the urgency and importance of achieving a specific goal, it will be more likely to be open to the use of GMO (Hersh, M. A. (2002).

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#app scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," highest research priorities in biotechnology and modern medicine. When first-line and second-line antibiotic options become limited by resistance, healthcare providers are must resort to antibiotics that may be more toxic, are frequently more expensive, and often less effective . Research has shown that patients with resistant infections are often far more likely to die and those that do survive face significantly longer hospital stays, delayed recuperation, and long-term disability.
A treatment option considered prior to the discovery and spread of antibiotics, bacteriophage therapy has an extensive and controversial history but has recently returned as a research subject of intensive speculation. Bacteriophage therapy faces difficulties of regulation, bacterial resistance to phages, limited host range, manufacturing, delivery, and the side effects of bacterial lysis . Recent advances in macromolecule delivery, biotechnology, synthetic biology, and bacterial diagnostics provide the potential to overcome past obstacles. Thus far, utilization of bacteriophage for the prevention of Listeria monocytogenes growth on meat products has been approved in Europe and the United States and various academic and commercial sectors are currently attempting to successfully bring bacteriophage therapy through the clinical stage. Such efforts must be joined by approaches both rigorous and varied to successfully bring bacteriophage therapy from “the bench to the bedside.”
Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aereus (MRSA)
Each year, in the United States alone, a conservatively estimated 2 million individuals are infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. At least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections, many others succumb to associated complications. Beyond the human cost, antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs that the U.S. estimates to be as high as $20 billion in excess healthcare costs and additional $35 billion due to lost productivity each year (in 2008 dollars).
One of the most prevalent of these antibiotic-resistant infections is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus – more commonly known by the acronym MRSA. Infecting over 75,000 individuals each year, MRSA is one of ten antibiotic-resistant bacteria that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has classified as a “Serious Threat” in their 2013 report. Until recently, MRSA was almost exclusively contracted in medical facilities but evolving strains have emerged in the community capable of causing severe infections in otherwise healthy people . These new strains of MRSA infections are classified as community-acquired (CA-MRSA) as opposed to their hospital acquired counterpart (HA-MRSA) . The majority of community-acquired infections are skin infections while HA-MRSA often begin as skin infections but develop into life"

We also decided based on the results of this experiment and previous experiments we have decided that TMB is the optimal substrate for our system. Overall TMB produces a colour output that is much easier for the human eye to see as well as that it can be in  a less harsh substrate solution which limits the potential of functional disruption of other proteins on our strip. We could potentially explore more sensitive substrates to see if they interact with Prussian blue ferritin differently or are more sensitive with our system. We also tested Prussian blue ferritin in a basic prototype housing. You can see the results of this experiment on the Prototype page .

What did we build this summer?
In order to make use of the data we have gathered from characterizing commercially purchased horse spleen ferritin in our strip system we had to develop constructs that would be functional in our strip system. The first ferritin part we constructed and and purified the protein from this summer is BBa_K1189018 (Figure 17). This part consists of the heavy and light subunits of ferritin fused together. These subunits will still successfully assemble to form the fully assembled ferritin nanoparticle. Also attached is an E coil which will allow this protein to bind with proteins that have a fused K coil. In the case of our system this will allow us to bind BBa_K1189018 via coil interactions as a reporter to BBa_K1189029 ; one of our DNA binding constructs.
The second construct of interest ( BBa_K1189021 ) is once again composed of our ferritin subunits but this time it has a TALE protein directly fused to the ferritin subunits ("

——Please follow our chase for the most brilliant star of sRNA!
Brainstorming is going on and on throughout the whole summer vacation. We have considered quite a lot mechanisms involved in RNA-RNA interactions.
Firstly, we focused a lot on cis-acting sRNA because they have completely complementary pairing sites. We speculated that they could bind strongly together. Besides, completely complementary binding might facilitate our calculation for reaction rates(k), which is likely to serve as our key factor for predicting RNA interaction.
However, something in our minds changed when we coincided with Hfq which showed that this RNA chaperon can play an extremely important role in RNA interactions. And we began to target moreinformation about trans-encoded RNAs as our candidates for comparators and ratio sensor to neglect the impacts exerted by Hfq and the results suggest that our persistence is correct.
When referring to our ratio sensor design, many ideas died while seldom of them survived. RNase-coupled degradation was once the most brilliant one we regarded as. However, it seems that RNase tends to destroy the key pairing sites, rather than the whole structure. So we immediately gave up that idea and focus more on inert structure forming and orthogonal design. In fact, both of them concentrated our knowledge for sRNA-mRNA interactions. And fortunately we do finish our experimental design two weeks before.
Our modelers always give us interesting ideas for designs which enable us to adjust our direction. It is the mutual cooperation that yields today’s achievement!

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"ation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure 2).
Next, 5 µL of 8µM DNAzyme was added to the quadrants containing bacteria. To check for background fluorescence, 1 µL of DNAzyme was added to the quadrant labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were left to incubate for 1 hour and viewed under UV light as an alternative to using a fluorescence gel imager.
Results
Unfortunately, the experiments conducted by Calgary iGEM proved unsuccessful. They were unable to detect fluorescence following the addition of DNAzyme under UV, let alone whether B. subtilis displayed a lack of fluorescence. Due to limited DNAzyme, repetition of the experiment was not possible.
There are a variety of improvements required if we are to continue with this collaboration. The first is checking the stability of the DNAzyme during the shipping process. The DNAzyme was pelleted when it was sent to Calgary, and they resuspended it before usage. Our team should check DNAzyme activity in our own lab using pelleted form to rule this out as a potential interferant. The second factor to consider is the use of UV vs fluorescence imaging. It would be optimal if Calgary gained access to a fluorescence gel imager (Typhoon Imager) to be consistent with our experiments and imaging.
Future Directions
Once the DNAzyme has been optimized, there is one big factor to take into consideration: use of the DNAzyme by non-specialists. If this collaboration were to proceed, our DNAzyme would need to be usable by Mars colonists and without the need for extensive bacterial culturing and plating. As well, a faster readout is required. The current 1 hour of incubation is quite long if the DNAzyme were to be used as part of a leakage monitoring system. The last aspect to consider is the activity of the DNAzyme in a variety of sample matrixes, without sample enrichment. Bacterial detection has to occur without pure bacteria, and in the bioplastics synthesis system there will a variety of molecules present that should not interfere with the DNAzyme. These are all considerations that would be taken into account when designing the DNAzyme for use in a Mars colony.

A poster of the mathematical modelling results was presented to the college of Science, Engineering and Food Science in UCC to encourage mathematical students to consider bioinformatics.
Visit to a Microdistillery
Upon arrival at the micro distillery, we were initially given a short tour of the facility. This consisted of a main storage area with equipment for future developments (whiskey) and labelling machinery. Here we enquired about the value of our biosensor to Kieran’s business. We were informed that during his business set-up, they hoped to test the first batch of Poitín. However, they found it extremely difficult to find someone in Ireland who would test for them, as most larger companies have their  own lab for testing. They would have to send a sample abroad for testing. Kieran said he believed there would definitely be a market for inexpensive, rapid testing for methanol in alcohol.
While it is not an issue for his gin distillation, as the process starts off with 96% ethanol, Kieran said the biosensor would certainly be useful in months to come as they began their whiskey distillation process. We were told that generally a producer can tell immediately by taste and smell that there is methanol contamination in a batch, however this is obviously lacking in qualitative and quantitative parameters.
Kieran noted that methanol testing is dependent on the revenue officer of the distillery, making it a regulatory requirement for some. An example of Black’s distillery in kinsale was used as their production process was delayed by months when they were required to test their produce. We were shown the different flavourings that are added to the gin and shown the distiller machine.  Any distillate found to have methanol in it is discarded immediately, for both taste and safety."

Error Prone DNA Polymerase I
The mechanism of DNA replication takes place in the cell nucleus. The polymerases are responsible for the replication of the entire DNA. One of these polymerases is the DNA polymerase I, which plays a role in lagging-strand replication of chromosomal DNA. Moreover, the DNA polymerase I also has the task to do proofreading and plays a role in replicating ColE1 plasmids (Camps et. al 2003). ColE1 plasmids are characterized by the ColE1 origin of replication (ori). During the lagging-strand synthesis the DNA polymerase processes RNA primer (˜20 nt) and fills gaps during DNA repair reactions (Allen et. al 2011). Sometimes errors occur during the synthesis of a DNA strand. These mistakes may have big effects. They can lead to diseases or death of the organism, when a gene is damaged that is essential for survival. To reduce the frequency of mistakes the DNA polymerase I checks its work by using its own proofreading functionality.

What is biosafety?
Biosafety guidelines evolved as a protection for laboratorians in the field of microbiology, understanding the risks associated with various manipulations of agents transmissible by different routes.  Different biosafety levels provide increasing attention to personnel and environmental protection.
There is a definite hierarchy of controls that need to be in effect. Upper level management must set the general tone that safety is a high priority. Crucial to safe working conditions are the various types of specialized equipment available to serve as primary barriers between the hazard and the laboratorian. These range from simple gloves and other personnel protective equipment to simple (sealed centrifuge heads) or complex (biosafety cabinets) containment devices.
Up
Levels
A Biosafety Level reperesents the biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed facility. Levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 to the highest at level 4.
Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1)
This level is suitable for work involving well-characterized hazards not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans, and of minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.
It includes several kinds of bacteria and viruses [including canine hepatitis, Escherichia coli, varicella (chicken pox)], as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against biohazard are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some facial protection. The laboratory is not necessarily separated from the general traffic patterns in the building. Work is generally conducted on open benchtops using standard practices. Usually, ""contaminated"" materials are left in open (but separately indicated) rubbish receptacles. Decontamination procedures for this level are similar in most respects to modern precautions against everyday microorganisms (i.e.: washing one's hands with anti-bacterial soap, washing all exposed surfaces of the lab with disinfectants, etc). In a lab environment, all materials used for cell and/or bacteria cultures are decontaminated via autoc"

Results of the expression plasmid transformation
Only samples 78 to 82 had colonies after overnight incubation--these were the same colonies that were electroporated, instead of chemically transformed. Because we only added 1 ul of our cells to the plates, it is possible that this was not enough sample for us to see colonies, especially since chemical transformation is not as efficient as electroporation. The samples on the LB+spec plates had what appeared to be unspecific growth around the edges. This may be because the spec did not diffuse evenly. We will be re-plating all of our samples later today, on new LB+spec plates.

Edinburgh_UG,2016,Team:Edinburgh UG#Error Correction_-_-_TEXT.html," previously    used checksum by one or more orders of magnitude.
Optimal Rectangular Code
The Optimal Rectangular Code (ORC) is a type of error correcting code that is present in all of our BabbleBricks. When the checksum detects an error the next action is to checks the ORCs in each word and use them to correct any errors that have taken place as follows:
Unfortunately, the ORC can only locate and fix single base pair errors however the properties of the ORC facilitate another added level of error correction.
Beyond Optimal Rectangular Codes - The SuperFixer Function and Levenshtein Distance
If the Optimal Rectangular Code (ORC) detects more than the single base pair error it can fix using its normal actions the SuperFixer function is called. The SuperFixer uses the ORC and works out all the possible words in the lexicon that fit this pattern. For any given ORC this is a maximum of 4 words and indeed there are many words that have unique ORC’s. Once the SuperFixer has narrowed down the possible words the list of possibilities is compared to what appears in the actual DNA and the sequence with the lowest Levenshtein distance is used in the translation. Levenshtein distance is a metric which shows the number of deletions, insertions or substitutions it will take to turn one string (or sequence) into another.
By taking the minimum Levenshtein distance we always work under the assumption that the smallest number of errors is most probable. This assumption gives the best performance across errors of different magnitudes due to the robustness of DNA as a molecule making small errors considerably more likely than larger ones.
Overall Performance
Finally, this graph represents the performance of our entire error correction system on errors of varying magnitudes:
