Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB binding with Ni, which can be stated as follows:
Combine 2.1 2.2 2.3, and we can have:
As is proposed above, LI is linearly dependent on the number of free state promoter. That is to say,
Substitute 2.4 into 2.5, we can get the following equation:
Further substitute 2.6 into 1.4, now we have obtained the final expression of LI, in which time and the concentration of Ni2+ are the variables.
discussion
1. Luminescence intensity versus time curve with a constant concentration of Ni2+ ions
According to the relevant data in the literature and obtained by experimental measurements, we roughly made a function image of the brightness signal as a function of time, and the image is as follows.
From the above figure, we can see that the intensity of luminescence increases with time. When the time is longer, the intensity of luminescence will gradually become a fixed value, that is,.
2. Relationship between final luminescence intensity and Ni2+ ion concentration
From the above figure, it is not difficult to see that as the concentration of Ni2+ continues to rise, the final luminescence intensity is also increasing, and according to the formula derived above, this is a linear function relationship, which means that the linear response of luminescence intensity to Ni2+ concentration can be achieved by this system.
HBUT-China: Experimentg
Overview
Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. The  philosophy of our team is to use salicylic acid to induce glucose dehydrogenase expression to enhance the strain's pentose phosphate pathway, giving the strain a growth advantage. EmrR protein can inhibit the role of the downstream promoter PemrR, so that the gene downstream of PemrR can not be expressed, but salicylic acid (SA) can bind to emrR to eliminate this inhibition. Our team sets the gene of PemrR downstream to gdh, using SA to control this route. After the our team replaced gdh with mCherry, HUBT-China helped us induce the expression of mCherry by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal"

This is the first time for our team JNFLS_China to participate iGEM competition this year. As a new team, it is necessary and indispensable for us to communicate and collaborate with other teams. Here we will introduce our cooperation project and we appreciate all the teams and people that ever helped us.
1. Communication with Shenzhen_SFLS team
In early August this year, we were invited to Guangdong Shenzhen for meet-up by Shenzhen_SFLS team. So some players of our team went to communicate friendly with them at the auditorium of Shenzhen Foreign Language School. We started with drawing a picture to describe the experience of our performing project , then we introduced ourselves project each other, asked some questions and discussed the possibility of collaboration . In the pictures explanation and discussion process, we understood gradually and learned much from each other in which We had lots of fun!
Besides above, we listened to a report regarding the mechanism, application and advantages of transgenic plant by a PhD who gave us some opinions and suggestions for our project. We visited the library, assembly hall, stadium and a big beautiful campus which are very exciting us. Unfortunately, we have to end our meet-up hastily because of the typhoon coming.
2. Collaboration wth OUC_China team
We contact the OUC_China team from Ocean University of China which is located in the same province with us. We communicate iGEM projects and experiment advantages each other. Since our team members perform experiments in a lab equipped with advanced instruments of Shandong University, we are skilled at fluorescence measurements with the guidance of teacher and graduate students. So we helped OUC_China team to determine some fluorescence data of their one device in this season project https://2016.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Collaborations
3. Collaboration wth FAFU_China team
When we talked with FAFU_China team, they showed a very strong interest at the phenomenon that the fluorescent intensity of the experiment group is stronger than normal group.

5.5 Amplification from a plaque test
I) Purpose
Test the procedure for creating phage liquid culture from a single plaque on a plate
II) Expected Outcome
In spot test, we should see plaques until the phage dilution series became too diluted.
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.4; ×6 plate from 5.3 T7 phage selection method test ; LB from 4.3
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Amplifying phage from a single plaque (5.5)
To a test tube, add 1mL of E coli BL21 overnight (5.4) and 4mL of LB
Stab one of the plaques on a ×6 plate from the 5.3 T7 phage selection method test with a 1mL pipet tip, puncturing the agar. The plaque in question is labeled with a circle.
The pipet tip is then dipped into the overnight/LB solution. The solution is then pipetted up and down several times to maximize the amount of phage that gets into the solution.
The solution was then incubated for approximately 24 hours (5.5 noon - 5.6 2:00pm )
2. Spot test to test amplification results (5.6)
Phage liquid culture was purified and spot test was performed using procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification . Stock created was labeled 5.4

PROGRESS REPORT
Goals
Run a dilution series to test the titer of our mutated phage stock. Start selecting for small plaques and learning how to pick them and titer them out. Run multiple UV tests and compare mutated phage stock with the normal stock.
Accomplishments
Summary of what we did:
During this period we began with T4Do stock and grew it in liquid culture with 5-bromodeoxyuridine to mutagenize it. Then, this mutagenized stock as well as the standard T4Do stock were subjected to UV light in a BSL-2 hood in Dr. Breakwell’s lab.  We found that it takes about 9 minutes to destroy all or almost all of the phage in a 20 uL drop on parafilm in the center of the hood.  We tried to then select small plaques and culture them to see if they would remain small, but we saw no such trends. We ran a titer on the mutagenized phage stock but saw no indications that the phage actually infected the bacteria and propagated; instead, it appears that the stock may have just been diluted. This would explain why both seemed to behave similarly after being irradiated with UV light.
After we received E. coli B, we tested whether all of our phage stocks will still infect this slightly different host. All of our phage showed a positive result on the spot tests, but for some reason the titer for T1 did not work.  T4Do produced plaques on E."

Equations
After drawing a profile of our project, we should make the process of every event more clearly. So, we have constructed the models of our three circuits by the principles of biochemistry.
First, we have constructed a model related to the circuit 2, the most complex one, with the help of Tsinghua-A. Then, in order to compare them, we have also constructed the other two based on the model of circuit 2. In our model, we use ODE to describe the process of chemical reaction in organisms.
In general, we have divided the chemical events in our bacteria into three parts, the transcription of DNA, the translation of RNA, the production of micromolecule-compounds. The rate of each event can be described by ODE listed below.
Circuit1:
Circuit2:
Circuit3:
m_CI1,m_CI2, m_CheZ, m_TetR, m_TrzN, m_LuxI represent mRNA of different protein.
CI1,CI2, CheZ, TetR, TrzN, LuxI represent proteins.
p_AHL represent the AHL produced in each cell.
We have used matrix to describe the state of AHL and the location of every bacteria. By the way, we have also made the density of bacteria related to the distance of bacteria. At last, we have considerate the degradation of atrazine as well, though which proved to have little influence on atrazine latter. And a space lattice of ""culture dish"" is demonstrated below.
Space relation:
e_AHL represent the AHL in the environment.
PXn, Pyn represent the location of bacteria.
Cdn represent the density of bacteria in a lattice.
Atz represent the atrazine.
Markov Chain:
The markov chain is used to evaluate the reliability of limited times of simulations and the robustness of our circuit.

Week 8: June 17 - June 21
While attending the University of Calgary Veterinary Medicine Beef Cattle conference, we learned a lot more about the beef processing industry. Our project was well received by ranchers and members of the cattle industry who found it a practical and applicable option.
In the lab, we ran a colony PCR on the TALE target sequences and ran agar gels (figures 5, 6 and 7).

Figure 6.Colony PCR on TALE target sequences.
Figure 7.Colony PCR on TALE target sequences.
The PCR products were purified and digested with AflII and PstI and then ran on a gel, producing two bands as expected at ~500 and ~2100 bp. BBa_J04500 only produced one band as expected since it did not have the AflII cut site (figures 8 and 9).

However, TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) had a mutation in the RVD region of the second repeat making it specific for a cytosine instead of a thymine. Because of that, we will have to design new primers to add the new TALE B target sequence to the RPF generator.

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy protein degrader_-_-_TEXT.html,"ogenesis (Julio et al., 2000). These results indicate that ssrA tagging system play a major role in bacterial physiology.
The SsrA tag contains binding sites for the SspB adaptor and ClpXP protease (Levchenko et al., 2000). The SspB adaptor enhances substrate delivery by tethering SsrA-tagged proteins to the ClpX, which unfolds the tagged protein, and then translocates the denatured polypeptide into ClpP for degradation (Fig.1)(Sauer et al., 2004). The binding affinity of the ssrA tag to the SspB and ClpX plays key role in modulating substrate choice (Flynn et al., 2004) and the efficiency of degradation (Hersch et al., 2004; McGinness et al., 2006). One of the mutants, called LVA tag, further accelerates the degradation of tagged proteins compared to the wild-type LAA tag (Andersen et al., 1998). LVA tag has been applied to construct a fast synthetic gene oscillator, because it decreases protein lifetime and increases temporal resolution (Stricker et al., 2008). Thus, we added the LVA tag to FPs to maximize the temporal resolution of these reporters.
Fig.1 Molecular mechanism of SsrA-SspB system

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Overview
This summer,we collaborated with two 2017 iGEM teams.We have been mentoring a new team, SiCAU-China.We helped ZJU-China detect the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma on the process of Phytophthora infestaning tobacco. SiCAU-China helped us build a expression vector. ZJU-China assisted us with the detection of the TCP(trichlorophenol) remnant in soil. Besides, we did a favor of constructing iGEM teams for Chengdu NO.4 High School and Chengdu Huaxi High School (University of Electronic Science and Technology secondary school). With our help, it’s likely that they will establish their own iGEM team next year.

Respectively inoculated Phytophthora and Trichoderma into tissue culture tobacco with differentiated root, stem and leaf.
Specific method of inoculation: dig a some amount of medium (about 0.5cmX0.5cm), then use about 6ml up water to rinse its mycelia and spores, finally take 1ml solution from it, then pour it into the tissue culture"

Introduction
This year our team focused on completing several human practices initiatives. By delving into both the environmental aspects, and the business realm of the project, we worked to gain a complete understanding of the implications of our project. As well, through participating in an online scientific journal, we gained feedback from experts and scholars, which helped improve our scientific writing skills.
BioTreks Paper
One of the means of communication is scientific writing. To practice this, we contributed to an online journal called Biotreks. Biotreks is a journal that publishes design articles on synthetic biology written by high school groups. We wrote a design paper about our project, SynthetINK called ""Synthetic Ink: using synthetic biology techniques to produce biological pigments in Escherichia coli"" and received two awards from writing it, “Best in Education and Best Visual Communication.” It will be published in the fall of 2017. Judges and other students were also able to give us feedback, allowing us to improve the article and the overall project design. Writing a scientific paper has helped us gain a clearer understanding of our project so we can adequately plan experiments for the future.
Business Plan
To investigate the viability of a product like our own in the massive ink industry, we have conducted interviews such as the Greg Vilk interview or the interview with Dave Warwick. Also, we have created a simple business plan to outline business elements such as some marketing techniques, licensing plans and details for up scaling. This plan is a large piece of our research into the potential viability of turning this product into a business. We concluded that it would be very difficult to compete with other ink products if we were to take that course, given the condition of the market today. In the future, we feel that a product such as our own would do significantly better in the business world, as the global energy market begins to turn away from a non-renewable source such as petroleum, and embrace more sustainable methods of energy generation.

Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ids we worked with: pMG36ET on the left, and pSB1C3 on the right
Observations and Inferences
As previously described on the main page for BBa_K592025, a vibrant blue colour was produced by transformant E. coli colonies with the BioBrick construct in pSB1C3 within 24 hours (Figure 2).
Figure 2: K592025 BioBrick ligated to p25 in pSB1C3 and transformed into E. coli. A vibrant blue colour can be seen in transformant colonies.
Due to the low copy number of pMG36ET, the blue colour of amilCP was less vibrant in E. coli transformed with the construct in pMG36ET than in bacteria transformed with pSB1C3. The BioBrick could still be used as a reporter in E. coli with this plasmid, but it was not as obvious a colour change as in the higher copy number plasmid, pSB1C3. When transforming the BioBrick construct into S. thermophilus, the resultant transformants (selected for with erythromycin) did not produce any blue chromoprotein even after several days. We checked that amilCP was present in this bacteria by isolating the plasmid DNA through a miniprep, and then running it on an agarose gel to verify that the size was correct. The higher copy number native S. thermophilus plasmids obscured the results of this gel and we were unable to tell whether pMG36ET was present in the bacteria. In order to check this, we then transformed TOP10 E. coli with the miniprep, and the transformant cells were a pale blue colour. From this it can be inferred that S. thermophilus did have the pMG36ET vector containing the P25-K592025 construct.
Figure 3: Pale blue TOP10 E. coli cells which have been transformed with an S. thermophilus miniprep containing the shuttle vector plasmid with amilCP. The bottom row of cells are control cells producing no pigment.
Despite the presence of amilCP in the transformed S. thermophilus, no pigment was produced even after several days. We have come up with four hypotheses as to why this could have occurred:
The ribosome binding site B0034 was not suitable for S. thermophilus- therefore, translation of the gene was not able to occur and blue chromoprotein was not synthesised. This is unlikely due to the consensus sequences of ribosome binding sites for"

Example
Synthetic biology is all about creativity, and sometimes the standard is just not enough, making it necessary to combine the above mentioned customizations. The figure below illustrates that ""Plug 'n' Play with DNA"" makes it possible to assemble a degenerate linker (red), a non-degenerate linker (yellow), introduce a non-degenerate point mutation (X) as well as a degenerate point mutation (N) into one plasmid in just ONE round of cloning.

Tips & Tricks
Design primers så the Tms between forward and reverse primer are within 2-5°C.
Remember that the annealing temperature should normally be 3°C under the Tm. However, when the linker is added to the primer, the Tm is increased. We have experienced that the best results are obtain when the final annealing temperature is above 62°C, if the primer have a Tm around 59°C to begin with.

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a huge burden on the Egyptian community due to its high prevalence and its late detection which is largely attributed to the lack of specific and sensitive markers. This was the reason why we chose it as the villain in our story.
The interviews we conducted with various experts served only to strengthen our belief in the importance of the success of our project and the impact it might have on our society.
 
The CRISPR effect
It's true, last year's project didn't turn out as we hoped! And that was probably why most interviews revolved around what went wrong and how we could correct it, the results of our conversations were as follows:
We will construct two synthetic circuit instead of one; the first is similar to last year's circuit but with modifications in our design and lab protocols to test the feasibility of the idea in the HCC cell culture. The second circuit will involve the use of CRISPR gene editing to knock in our chosen circular RNA into the genome, two issues regarding the second circuit were solved
through the help of one of our experts which were:
Our main design depended on knock out of a mutated gene inside the HCC genome but our discussions made us consider that knocking in of our gene would result in better outcome.
We decided to use a sgRNA to create double stranded breaks instead of using 2 gRNAs to induce single stranded breaks on both strands of the target genome. The loss of efficacy would be compensated by the use of homology- directed repair. This change is the result of our discussion with Dr Vincenzo Coppola from the cancer and genetics department at the University of Ohio.

He also told us that the toxicity of a NP is directly related to its size, but there are currently no regulations or guidelines that specify the toxicity of different types and sizes of NPs. With the increased use of NPs in society, Dr. Roam believes that more attention should be placed on waste management, risk assessment and regulations.
After our first visit to the Dihua WWTP, we learned that the sludge removed from wastewater is either 1) sent to landfills, 2) used as fertilizer, or 3) incinerated. We asked Dr. Roam if aggregated NPs in the waste sludge would still be harmful to the environment if disposed using current methods. He said that all of these sludge disposal solutions are still harmful to the environment, but they are better than letting NPs flow into bodies of water. He advised us to target removal of NPs in the wastewater treatment process before it is discharged. (Interviewed by Candice L. and Justin Y.)

Dihua Wastewater Treatment Plant
In order to learn firsthand about the effect of NPs in WWTPs, we visited the Dihua WWTP (迪化污水處理廠). Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people who work there. They confirmed that the current facilities are unable to remove NPs from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during the wastewater treatment process. Throughout the year, we visited and talked to the Dihua WWTP several times about where and how our project could be implemented in their current system. These conversations and visits played a huge role in shaping our construct design, prototype design, mathematical modeling and overall purpose for our project.  (Whole team activity)
We plan to add our bacteria to either the deep aeration tanks or the secondary sedimentation tanks. The disinfection tank will then kill the bacteria used in previous tanks.Figure: Christine C.

Team Macquarie Australia
The NTU Singapore iGEM team was pleasantly partnered with Macquarie team for collaboration. The project involved for both our team were quite different, in which Macquaire team dealed with photosynthetic system while our team dealed with CRISPR-based gene editing technology. Thus, we had made several Skype meetings with Macquaire team and more frequently emailed each other to share different concepts of the projects. Finally, both teams had reached consensus in using the CRISPR-based gene editing technique for both of the teams’ works.
Our Skype session with Team Macquarie :)
Compare the gene expression level of Mg2+ Chelatase Operon genes by RT-PCR
With the intention of producing functional Mg-chelatase that eventually give rise to  Mg-protoporphyrin product, Macquaire team had constructed a Mg-Chelatase plasmid ( BBa_K1998000 ) that consist of ChII1, ChID, Gun4, ChII2, CTH1 and ChIH genes, in which their expression are co-regulated under pLac promoter, with ChIH expressed under a second pLac promoter.
Team Macquarie had overexpressed the genes and ran SDS-page gel to check the expression of the genes. However, without antibodies for these proteins, a western blot could not be done to verify the identity and quantity of the protein. Thus, our team had helped them to quantitate each of the gene expression level by RT-PCR.
The results of RT-PCR is shown as below:
Relative Expression of Mg2+ Chelatase gene after IPTG induction
Formula: 2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1= Ct(uninduced operon genes)- Ct(Ampicillin gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes)-Ct(Induced Ampicillin gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2- ΔCt(control)1"
KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal_-_-_TEXT.html," gave cell B a shot of AHL which is degraded in time and watched how it responded on it. Our simulation results were plotted in figure 6. We see that cell B starts with CheZ production untill a maximum, after which production slows down and the protein is degraded. This corresponds with a decrease in AHL concentration. After some time, cell B's internal network has switched and RFP production starts. We notice that the production rate is slower than CheZ production. From this simulation we can conclude that the network we modeled is able to adapt to the AHL concentration and that the reaction is the wanted reaction. We do also notice that it takes a long time (10 000 s) until most CheZ is degraded. This can form a barrier on the real life performance, since only a small amount of CheZ could suffice to give the cells the possibility to move.
Figure 6: Simulation of cell B with an initial shot of AHL
Sensitivity analysis
Now we are going to check which parameters have the biggest effect on the output and are the most important. We can quantify this effect using derivatives: $\frac{\delta {output}}{\delta {parameter}}$. The parameters with the largest sensitivity values, are the ones that should be best characterized. Furthermore, if they are controllable, they could be varied to our wishes. The sensitivity analysis will be executed in Simbiology. This analysis uses complex-step approximation to calculate derivatives of reaction rates. This technique yields accurate results for the vast majority of typical reaction kinetics including ours. We will use full dedimensionalization so we can compare the results.
For cell A the outputs are the amount of leucine and AHL in the medium and Adhesine. We took a time integral of the sensitivities and plotted it in figure 7.
The leucine medium is dependent on diffusion of leucine out, leucine consumption, degradation, transcription and translation of ilvE mRNA. We also notice that not all Ping-Pong Bi-Bi constants are equally important. The parameters kf1, kf-1 and kcat are the most important while kr1, kr-1 and kcat3 are the least important.
AHL medium is highly sensitive for variations in luxI translation, degradation of LuxI and LuxI mRNA and for the catalytic activity of LuxI.
Adhesine-YFP is sensitive for translation, degradation and transcription.
From these results we can conclude that all outputs are dependent on variables closely related to themselves. Indeed, since there is production of AHL and LuxR in the cell, the transcriptional network is always active so the steps concerning"

Model - Coacervation
To understand the physics behind the coacervation method requires a brief introduction into the theory of polymer solutions. Consider a solution of positively and negatively charged polymers (polycations and polyanions respectively) of equal valence $Z$, and that no salts are present in the solution. It will be implicit that throughout all that follows, temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ of the solution are fixed. For simplicity, we assume that we have a symmetric solution, which means that the volume fraction of the polycations $\phi_+$ equals the volume fraction of the polyanions $\phi_-$, so that $$\phi_+=\phi_-=\frac{\phi}{2}$$
Note that this does not imply that the polymers are of equal length. What we will now do is make use of the so-called “lattice model” to represent our solution. In this type of model, the solution is represented as an infinitely large grid (we do not care what happens at the boundary), in which each square can be occupied by part of a polycation, polyanion, or by a single solvent molecule of volume $v$. This $v$ will be our basic unit of space in the lattice, and we define the effective chain length $N$ of the polymer to be its volume in units of $v$: $$N=\frac{V_{polymer}}{v}$$ In the graphical representation of our lattice model below, the sites occupied by polycations and polyanions are represented with + and - respectively, and the sites occupied by solvent are left empty.
Figure 1: Lattice model. In a lattice model, a solution is represented as a lattice of which the sites are occupied by any of the components of the solution. By calculating the energies of the interactions between different sites, this leads to an expression for the free energy of the whole system.
In this lattice model, one can now define interaction energies between all different neighboring pairs of sites, and calculate the energy of any configuration of the whole system (Figure 1). We are particularly interested in the Helmholtz Free Energy, since we have assumed constant temperature, pressure and volume. The full derivation of this energy ranges beyond the scope of this description, but the interested reader is encouraged to read references Doi 2013 ; Perry & Sing 2015 ; Veis 2011 .

Where km1 and km2 are integration parameters. As transcription and translation processes could enter steady state in a short period of time, here we directly considered steady state of mRNA, mRNA-rib and RFP, where
Finally, we calculated fluorescence:
The equation demonstrated the connection between fluorescence and lactic acid, thus, the concentration of lactic acid could be measured by fluorescence through the system. We set km1=10 and use promoter J23100, then results showed how these different substances changed with the lactic acid concentration. (Fig. 9)
Fig.9 Concentration of P170, mRNA, mRNA-rib and fluorescence change with the lactic acid.
Fine tuning:
As RcfB plays a key role in induction of P170 promoter, we firstly conducted constitutive promoter fine-tuning. Different constitutive promoters were constructed with downstream RcfB. We built up models to compare the function of these promoters (Fig.10). Results showed that J23100 had the highest effectiveness.

Click here to see TJU's description of our collaborations
Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes glsA, NhaA and NhaB. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously.

Our model mainly focused on functional genes and enzymes. Assumptions we made are:
(1) enzymes will only work in proper pH range and are not activated at other pH level.
(2) To prove function of our device, initial intracellular pH is set to ideal value.    For acid resistance device (Fig. 1), description of reaction processes are:

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#2 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," re-freezing of glycerol stocks as this can reduce the viability of the bacteria.
Tip: For precious strains, storage of 2 stock vials is recommended.
Tip: When recovering a stored strain, it is advisable to check the antibiotic markers by streaking the strain onto a selective plate.
Agar plates
Plates of streaked bacteria can be sealed with Parafilm and stored upside-down at 4°C for several weeks. Bacteria should always be streaked onto plates containing the appropriate antibiotic to ensure that selective markers are not lost.
To obtain well-isolated colonies, streak an agar plate as follows:
1. Flame a wire loop, and cool on a spare sterile agar plate.
2. Using the wire loop, streak an inoculum of bacteria (from a glycerol stock, stab culture, or single colony on another plate) across one corner of a fresh agar plate, as shown in the figure Streaking bacteria on agar plates.
3. Flame and cool the wire loop again. Pass it through the first streak and then streak again across a fresh corner of the plate.
4. Repeat again to form a pattern.
5. Incubate the plate upside down at 37°C for 12–24 hours until colonies develop.

Typical colony PCR reaction Mix together the following on ice; always adding enzyme last. For multiple samples, make a large master mix and aliquot 50 µl in each PCR tube (also on ice).
38 µl sterile distilled water
5 µl 10X PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.0% Triton X 100)
3 µl 25 mM MgCl2
1 µl 10 mM dNTPs (10 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP. dCTP)
1 µl 20 µM forward primer
1 µl 20 µl reverse primer
0.2-1 µl Taq polymerase
50 µl total volume
To each cold PCR tube containing the PCR reaction, add a small amount of colony. To do this, use a fine yellow pipette tip attached to a pipetter (set at 30 µl to avoid addition of air into the PCR reaction) and pipette up and down to mix.

Notes on transformation efficency
Expected transformation efficiency is 1 x 106 cfu/ug of pUC19 DNA, but we should expect a 2-fold decrease in efficiency due to use of LB instead of SOC (a derivative of super optimal broth, SOB). We should also expect a decrease because we thawed the frozen competent cells at a temperature above 0ºC. Ideally they should be thawed on ice, or by hand if needed 8 .

As for synthetic biology, its awareness rate is greater than our expectations, but there is still a long way to go in science education, especially in biological methods for waste water treatment and synthetic biology. On the one hand, we have to appropriately strengthen people's concerns about biological methods for treating sewage. On the other hand, we must work harder to increase the popularity of synthetic biology and try to shape a more positive and realistic biological image, especially considering that it is not just environmentally friendly. It is the responsibility of iGEMers to focus on the popularization and improvement of synthetic biology.

Conference of China iGEMer Community
The ShanghaiTech University, the organizer of the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC), is a beautiful and modern university. They held a very successful and meaningful conference. Everyone learned a lot from it. There were many excellent doctors who had some wonderful academic report. There were also many senior iGEMer who were very patient for us to answer questions. And there were also tea breaks and other arrangements for everyone to communicate. On CCiC, almost all the outstanding universities in China had gathered together. We not only discussed each other's iGEM projects, but also talked about learning and living. CCiC let our team members exchange experiences with many excellent people, help our iGEM team develop better, and let us be more determined to do our best.Last but not least, it let us love biology more!
Our biggest gaining is to learn the HP projects of many excellent universities and helped our team make progress. Learning from the excellent work of other universities, we also benefited a lot,which let us have time to improve our problems. There we got a lot of inspirations and improved our work:
1. In terms of questionnaires, we studied various ways of asking questions from other outstanding universities.So changed some of the sentences we set up to make our questions more subtle and more meaningful.
2.  CCiC built a bridge for iGEMers. Thanks to it，We have the cooperation with OUC-China . They designed a comic about synthetic biology, which are very cute and easy to understand. It is very suitable for us to pass on the synthetic biology knowledge to the children. They are also very willing to accept this form of teaching.
3. We have a wide variety of HP. During the presentation, we listed them"

Handbook
When we started our Human Practices, it was hard for us to understand exactly what human practices entangled and what was required for a team’s human practices to be successful. We had to spend a lot of time just reading about the topic to know where and how to start.
During NiC, informational presentations were held, in these presentations human practices were emphasized and displayed as something many teams forget about, put too little energy and/on or starts too late with.  From these presentations, we had the idea to make a clear, easily understood handbook for all new teams to consider in the beginning of their human practices. We also skyped with the iGEM team from Lund (a new iGEM team!) and introduced the idea of a HP manual. They confirmed the need for such a handbook by saying “That is a great idea and it would've helped us a lot in the beginning if we had such a manual!”.
We decided to base the handbook on the work of previous successful Human Practices teams. We sent out questionnaires and received answers from Stockholm 2016, OLS Canmore 2016, Imperial 2016, Groningen 2016, Bielefeld 2015, William and Mary 2015, UofC Calgary 2016, Cornell NY 2016, Paris Bettencourt 2016.
From these teams, we received very positive feedback about our idea:
Luis Suarez from Groningen “I think it is a great idea of you to start such a manual! Starting HP can be confusing and challenging.”
Rachelle Varga from Calgary “What a great idea! I’d be happy to answer your questions about the 2016 UofC_Calgary iGEM team.”
Allison Bricknell George from Paris Bettencourt “It´s a good idea, please share the result when you're done with this!”
Thanks to these teams, we were able to complete a great handbook for"

Fragment RB70/71 is wrong because RB71 is wrong. We repeated the amplification with RB78 instead of RB71.
Fragment KH3/RB46 is very weak, so we try to improve this reaction as well.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," and coworkers that after lysis, highly active cell extracts can be produced with a single centrifugation step and a subsequent run-off reaction at 37 °C ( Kim et al., 2006 ). The run-off reaction facilitates degeneration of endogenous DNA, whereby the background expression is reduced ( Pratt, 1984 ). A final centrifugation step after the run-off reaction can be helpful ( Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ).
Indeed, many researchers have proven that it is possible to further minimize the costs per reaction down to a fraction of cents ( Calhoun and Swartz, 2005 ; Kim et al., 2011 ; Sun et al., 2013 ; Caschera and Noireaux, 2015 ). Protocols for preparation of cell extracts, especially for efficient lysis of harvested cells, have been described in recent years ( Shrestha et al., 2012 ; Kwon and Jewett, 2015 ). With the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) method, it became possible to  tag and purify all necessary proteins for translation ( Wang et al., 2012 ). This approach has the potential to simplify and reduce the costs for cell-free in vitro reactions based on purified components ( Kelwick et al., 2014 ) .
These papers inspired us to experiment with selfmade E. coli cell extracts, aiming to develop protocols for the production of cheap cell extracts and to open cell-free protein synthesis to the iGEM community.
Advantages and possible uses
In general, the developments in CFPS proceed into two major directions: These are on the one hand the production of large quantities of proteins (Scale-up direction) without needing recombinant hosts. On the other hand the aim is to investigate distinct proteins or protein synthesis procedures at a small scale for a minimum of costs, and to enrich a protein of interest in a minimal volume (miniaturization direction) ( Alexandrov and Johnston ).
With in vitro Transcription-Translation, it long was difficult to produce identical or higher amounts of active proteins when compared to in vivo. Recent publications proof that this is now possible and that the scale-up of CFPS becomes more and more efficient ( Caschera and Noireaux, 2014 ; Kazuta et al., 2014 ).
CFPS offers great advantages over classical overexpression in living cells: The reaction is not restricted to the experimenter by a cell wall, so one can add exactly the components to the reaction that are needed, for example additional co-factors, inducers or catalysts. One recent example is the use"

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Hardin postulates that one pursues its own interest and as a consequence if a resource (e.g. a pasture) were to be exploited freely by anyone, it would rapidly be destroyed as everybody would try to take the best slice out of it. Hardin concludes : “Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.”
However, Elinor Ostrom's (1933-2012) work, which led her to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009, broadened the economists' mind on this particular topic.
The new commons
Ostrom emphasizes the fact that Hardin “was actually discussing open access rather than managed commons” (Hess & Ostrom, 2006). Using this argument among others, she pointed out the weaknesses of Hardin's thinking : contrary to his theory, a lot of resources have been responsibly managed as communal goods over many centuries in Europe, before being privatized through the “enclosure” movement from the 15th to the 18th centuries.
Her study made her precise the commons' concept. Throughout many examples, she ended up characterizing it as a “jointly owned legal set of rights”. Besides, in contrast to Hardin who offered only two solutions (privatization or nationalization) to the supposed “tragedy of the commons”, she distinguished this form of property and management of resources from both traditional private (market, companies) and public (planning, State) economic approaches : each community managing a commons fixes its own rules by defining a governance framework and some “bundles of rights”. The latter which specifies the access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation rights are distributed to the different actors exploiting the resource in order to manage it jointly, and efficiently according to a defined hierarchy.
Ostrom insisted on the uniqueness of every case of commons she (or her students) studied. Nevertheless she succeeded in identifying a set of founding principles each sustainable commons fits :
“clearly defined boundaries should be in place
rules in use are well matched to local needs and conditions
individuals affected by these rules can usually participate in modifying the rules
the right of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
a system for self-monitoring members’ behavior has been established
a graduated system of sanctions is available
community members have access to low-cost conflict-resolution mechanisms""
Conclusion
The huge energetic and environmental challenges every country will have to face in the following years call for institutional and organisational innovations capable"

Generation of binding proteins by directed evolution
This year the iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec aims to create a system for generation of synthetic binding protein     the so called Evobodies. The system works by creating a library of binding proteins and increase their affinity     towards a target by directed evolution. As a starting point we randomise the binding regions of synthetic     antibody-mimetic frameworks. Following we screen this library for affinity towards a target by using a bacterial     two-hybrid system. To further increase the evobodies affinity, we combine the selection via the two-hybrid system     with an in vivo mutagenesis system. Doing this we hope to generate strong and specific binding proteins by combining     the powerful genetic and the speed of E. coli with the biological idea of antibody generation and maturation in vertebrates.
We aim to create this system as an alternative to conventional binding generation systems. We hope that it is better?! Was soll hier hin

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html," 8). The results of the bromophenol test with liquid cultures was however hard to assess, since we did not have any positive controls to compare with.
NahR/Psal
We initially tested the NahR/Psal promoter system with dTomato on a pSB1C3 plasmid. The cells containing the plasmid were streaked on agar plates with different salicylate concentrations in the agar medium. Similarly, we also examined liquid cultures with different concentrations of salicylate in the solution. Both of these tests showed that the bacteria were producing the dTomato protein in presence of salicylate, independent of the salicylate being in liquid culture or in the solid growth medium. It can also be easily observed that the fluorescence increased with increasing salicylate concentrations (See figure 14 and 15). The measurements were made with  the fluorometer that our team built in order to be able to characterize this system. These results were compared to MACS measurements on the same colonies, and can be viewed on the fluorometer site. This is a further improvement of the  characterization of BBa_J61051 done by the iGEM team Peking 2013 .
IMAC
The chromatograms of ModLac and CueO (Ecol) showed very low protein concentrations (see Figures 9 and 10). The eluate fractions from the IMAC did not show any enzyme activity. Examination of these fractions with SDS-PAGE (see Figure 12) also showed that there were no, or very low concentrations of protein in them. This raises the question as to what went wrong in the purification method. The theory of IMAC rests upon the fact that his-tagged proteins will bind to the column and not elute until a high concentration of imidazole is pumped through the column. Enzyme activity was found in the lysate of CueO and its mutant, which means that there were functioning proteins prior to the IMAC. Possible explanations as to why no activity was measured in the eluate could be that the protein concentration was too low in the elution fraction (due to dilution) or that no protein bound to the column. This was confirmed when enzyme activity was found in the initial wash of the column. These results point toward the fact that something went wrong with the interaction between the protein and the column. It is unlikely that the nickel ions had not bound to the gel, since the columns had a clear light turquoise colour after being loaded. Also, the colour was not washed away during the IMAC procedure. There is a risk that the polyhistidine-tag"

Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meetup 2015
This year we had the amazing opportunity of hosting our first ever regional iGEM meetup at the University of Maryland. This meetup provided an opportunity for iGEM teams from around the region to come together mid-way through their projects to learn from each other, practice presenting, build relationships for future collaboration, and acquire valuable feedback from their peers. The University of Virginia, College of William and Mary, Duke University, and Rock Ridge high School were all in attendance. Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project including their progress, goals, and any difficulties they experience so far, followed by a Q&A period with the audience.
The College of William and Mary presented on their project of measuring the intrinsic noise generated by commonly used promoters in the iGEM registry.

Guest Speakers
Supplementing the presentations given by each team were several guest speakers who kindly helped make the meetup a great and informative learning experience and expand the context of what we are doing with iGEM to issues beyond the lab on a national and global scale.
Special Agent Edward You of the FBI spoke about the relationship between iGEM and the future of national security as synthetic biology and DIY and community labs continue to grow with the growth of iGEM, and his work in creating a strong relationship between the biology community and the law enforcement to promote biosecurity without hindering progress.

Collaborations
We collaborated with many iGEM teams during the course of our project. Thereby, we engaged in a bi-directional exchange. On the one hand, we cloned constructs for the iGEM team Freiburg, provided help to other iGEM teams (PCR First Aid Service) and many more. On the other hand, we performed an inter-lab study to validate the performance of our mutagenesis plasmids.

Noah Beggs
I am a senior biology major this year and transferred to Hendrix last fall. I first became interested in IGEM through a genetics lab with Dr. Murray, where we worked with a sample kit of BioBricks. The next semester (this past spring) an official IGEM team was created, and the enthusiasm and effort that has been put forth by all members is awesome. Personally I have always been interested in doing a medically related project, so the idea that we chose is a particularly cool one to me. In my spare time I fight crime as Cyclops.
Jay Stanley
I am a third year Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major. I hope to pursue a career in synthetic biology following graduate work. I am attracted to working in the field of synthetic biology because of its inherently clever approach to solving problems. The concept of bio-machinery working together to create something of human design is beautiful. In my spare time I fight crime as Wolverine.
Chase Davis
I'm a biology pre-med student at Hendrix. I've always been fascinated by genetics. IGEM has been a way for me to get a lot closer to one of my interests. It's always been a belief of mine that bioengineering is the most important kind of engineering just due to the sheer possibility of what could be created. In my spare time I fight crime as Gambit.
Krystal Kim
Hi! I'm a Junior BCMB major from Manchester, Tennessee. I learned about IGEM from Dr. Murray's Genetics lab last fall semester. Bioengineering is fascinating to me because of the incredible amount of applications it has, from research to energy to the medical field and more. In my spare time I fight crime as Storm.
Dr. Richard Murray
Dr. Murray is the advisor for the Hendrix College IGEM team. He has a B.Sc. from the University of Western Ontario ('90) and a Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario ('97), and teaches Cell Biology, Genetics, Developmental Biology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, and a Senior Seminar. His lab was the site of the majority of our project's development, and his help in advising and educating us was invaluable. In his spare time he fights crime as Magneto.

Lux Operon under T7 promoter ( Main Page-BBa_K819008 )
We successfully improved the easy-of-use of “lux brick” ( BBa_K325909 ) part constructed by Cambridge 2010 iGEM team by placing the coding sequence of luxbrick (luxCDABEG) and related RBS under T7 promoter ( BBa_I712074 ).
T7 promoter separates sensing/circuitry functions from pathways/actuation. It is encoded in genetically distinct regions while linked with other circuits by providing the output for the circuits that drive the expression of phage polymerases. Luxbrick under T7 promoter is very modular, because it is transcribed by T7 polymerase, which can be placed under any other promoter, forming a interface between luxbrick and other systems.  Once transformed into BL21(de3)strain, high protein production can be achieved rapidly after IPTG induction.Final concentration of IPTG should be round 0.05mM.
To note that the incubating temperature should be no higher than 30oC, or the heavy Lux complex can easily aggregate.   Optimum incubating conditions provided by Peking i"

FREDsense Technologies: Our Vision
Our mission is to Build Better Biosensors by providing a diverse platform technology to the world, with a focus on monitoring water samples - faster, cheaper, and more reliably than competing technologies on the market.
Executive Summary
FREDsense Technologies Business Concept.
We are FREDsense Technologies, a Calgary-based venture developing biosensor detection systems to rapidly determine toxicity in water samples. Our first product is a sensor for general toxicity. Capable of reporting an output in under five minutes, it is cost effective due to the simple materials used in its construction, and highly robust through built-in control systems. Currently, we have submitted a provisional patent on our technology, which has a wide variety of uses as a platform technology with numerous different potential markets beyond this first iteration.
Our product fits into the environmental monitoring market, a market that has been established as a byproduct of the oil and gas sector, which produces over 200 million litres of waste water per day. This waste is contained in massive lakes known as tailings ponds, which pose a serious concern to both the environment and to industrial processes. Alberta’s Provincial government enforces a zero discharge policy of water from these ponds, and government regulation requires that oil sands companies monitor their tailings ponds. As well, regulation enforces monitoring water quality in the surrounding lakes,"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"R forms a complex with 3OC6HSL and then activates         downstream promoter, pLuxR (BBa_R0062).
After the activation of pLuxR promoter, LuxI protein (BBa_C0061) then expresses. LuxI is an autoinducer synthetase         which catalyzes 3OC6HSL from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in cell. The entire part from pTetR to LuxI generates         a positive feedback loop, because it increases the concentration of 3OC6HSL/LuxR complex and hence induces pLuxR more strongly. The 3OC6HSL molecule can also diffuse back to the extracellular environment and affect the nearby         cells.
With its positive feedback loop, the sensing module is able to convert from signal receiver into signal emitter whenever         it receives 3OC6HSL molecule. Thus, it is expected to increase the efficiency of activation in a targeted environment.
Potential Issue
The issue that previous iGEM team encountered (See experience in BBa_F2620) is the leakiness of pLuxR promoter             (BBa_R0062). It is a situation when there is little expression of gene even without initial activation of AHL.             This time we improved by adding sequences of antisense RNA Binding regions and antisense RNA in which their interaction             can inhibit the translation of excess mRNA.
First, the antisense RNA Binding Region (ABR) is placed right before our targeted Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS),             which is upstream to the LuxI (BBa_C0061) and GFP (BBa_E0040). Second, the antisense RNA is placed downstream             the positive feedback loop and its reporter together with a medium strength promoter, pLuxL (BBa_R0063).
The antisense RNA we use has two important characteristics that will help reduce leakiness. Firstly, it comprises               of sequence that is complementary to the sequence of mRNA of ABR. The affiliation of antisense RNA to the complementary               ABR prevents ribosome from binding to the mRNA of the targeted RBS. Secondly, it has a Hfq binding site, which               is suspected to recruit RNase to degrade the targeted RNA chain. (Wagner, 2009)(Hoynes-O’Connor & Moon, 2016).               In consequence, translation of LuxI:GFP mRNA will be reduced, and so will the leakiness of pLuxR.
To see the theoretically expected behavior of the construct with and without asRNA, please refer to our model

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.

To interpret the above data, we first compare the constants of dissociation, Kd. In this context, Kd represents [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]/[Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor] at equilibrium (Bisswanger, 2008); therefore, a lower Kd would represent better inhibition: more bound GzmB compared to free GzmB.
We can also analyze the Ka, the association constant. Ka is the inverse of Kd, and can be found as [Gzmbinhib-Inhibitor]/ [Gzmbfree][Inhibitor]. This represents the relative amount of bound molecules, so that a higher Ka represents stronger binding affinity. Compared to the mouse inhibitor Serpina3n, human ACT3m has a lower Kd and a higher Ka, which suggests stronger inhibition. This conclusion is in agreement with Marcet-Palacios et al., where this novel inhibitor was also compared to mouse Serpina3n (2014).
The Hill constant may also be considered to analyze the nature of the inhibitor-GzmB complex. With n>1, Serpina3n is likely to bind to multiple sites on GzmB (Weiss et al., 1997). ACT3m, in contrast, has a n<1, meaning that it likely binds competitively to selective and perhaps singular sites. This information is interesting; taking the association constants into account, this means that despite less opportunity to bind, ACT3m still acts as a better inhibitor than Serpina3n.
Inhibitor Concentration Calculator
The following equations were developed with a question in mind:
How much inhibitor is needed to bring GzmB levels back to normal?
Since there are many diseases that cause inflammation, and thus increased levels of GzmB, we created a calculator to determine the amount of treatment needed for any GzmB-related diseases. The model can show the relative percent decrease of GzmB as the inhibitor concentration increases. A patient could obtain information regarding their condition and calculate the amount of treatment needed.
Given that

Soo hun Park whom we contacted, teaches in the college of Law in Sookmyung Women’s University and is also the education committee member of The Korean Association of Institutional review boards. He is one of the most informed specialist on the field of bioregulations and ethical concerns of developing biotechnologies in Korea.
The interview questions were mainly dealing with current bio legislations of Korea and ethical laws that cope with upcoming technologies in the field of biotechnology. As Bioethics and Safety Act(생명 윤리 및 안전에 관한 법률) stand at present, we discussed the highly limited circumstances which we could apply gene therapy and the newly introduced crisper technologies in genetic engineering of humans. Due to the article 36 of the act, these therapies are forbidden in fetus or germline cells in Korea while in the UK these experiments were authorized by the law. Drawing comparisons of bioethics laws in different countries led us to conclude that genetic engineering in Korea is especially under strict regulations and also negatively portrayed by the media. The ministry of health and welfare claimed that they would lift the regulations in 2015 but there were no significant acts of amendment yet. From the interview, he mentioned the guideline of new direction; the ethics of synthetic biology and emerging technology, which is a risk-based approach on new technologies such as synthetic biology. He noted the fact that unlike the US there are no guideline in Korea but only restrictions. In addition, he explained the process of how the KoNIBP committee makes a decision on updated agendas related with conflict between ethics and technology. Furthermore, we inquired about the genetically modified microorganisms(GMM) and what regulations were they restricted by after being consumed by humans. Only the GMMs that are intake by human or human derivative materials are controlled by this bioethics and safety act.
The interview helped us get a grip of the current technology and ethical challenges they pose. This helped our team analyze the reasonableness and rationality of the current legislation of bioengineering and synthetic biology in Korea. Although this interview covered genetic engineering techniques related with human on a limited basis, this field is the actual hot spot of conflicts and ethical debates. Our team indicated that further discussion should be held in public to bring up the resolving solution that may lead to rational atonement.

Week 1 (29.6.2015 - 5.7.2015)
This week we transformed two of our future BioBricks which we were kindly given by members of our lab. The decarboxylase (AADC) as well as the aminotransferase (CvATA) were provided inserted into pET-28a
Both AADC and CvATA were transformed into E. coli Bl21 using a standard transformation protocol and plated on LB agar Kan.
Colonies were observed after overnight growth (Fig. 1), plates were then stored in the fridge over the weekend for starter cultures to be set up on Monday.
Figure 1 LB agar Kan plates showing colonies for AADC (labelled DC) and CvATA (labelled CV) after overnight growth at 37°C.
Week 2 (6.7.2015 - 12.7.2015)
This week we blunt end ligated eight of our gBlocks (esaR, esaR v2, cepR, cepR v2, esaI, CFP, mRFP, bla) that are needed for the assmebly of two different variants of pCERI into pJET 2.1 respectively, transformed them into E. coli TOP 10 and plated some of the obtained transfomants on LB - Amp for plasmid preps.
Those plasmid preps were cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes and an analyzing gel (Fig. 1-3) was run to check for correct size of the inserts.
Correct plasmid constructs (marked with a green arrow) were sent for sequencing.
The remaining plasmid DNA of the 11 correct vectors was cut and purified to be used for future OE-PCR

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#NaturalSystem_-_-_TEXT.html,"s generate variability in the viral receptor protein that specifies tropism for ligand molecules, and encode polypeptides that are designed to tolerate sequence variation. A C-type lectin fold displays amino acid sequence variability. The lectin fold provides a static scaffold that helps balance diversity with protein stability. A reverse transcriptase mediates the exchange between two repeats, a variable repeat (VR) and a template repeat (TR).
The BPP-1 genome contains a variable repeat (VR) of 134 base pairs on the gene coding for the Mtd. This variable repeat is variable across every specimen of BPP-1, with variations isolated to 23 discrete nucleotides. Downstream from the variable repeat is the template repeat (TR), which serves as a master copy and is never permanently altered in wild-type phage (Medhekar).
Occasionally, during the viral assembly process, the TR is transcribed, and then reverse transcribed by a reverse transcriptase coded for by the brt gene further downstream from the mtd gene. This process introduces site mutations at the 23 extremely specific nucleotide locations. These nucleotides are all adenines, and are changed to any of the four possible nucleotides. The resulting cDNA strand is then directed to the location of the VR and integrated into the genome, replacing the VR itself (Guo). All of this results in the assembled viral particle having a different sequence in the mtd gene, and thus a different Mtd protein that is capable of binding to another target on the surface of Bordetella.
Comparable Systems in Nature
The human immune system can generate upwards of 1012 antibodies with unique antigen-binding sites. It is remarkable that such enormous diversity can be generated from far fewer numbers of genes, and does not disrupt the overall structure of the antibody. This strategy of shuffling and combining parts has been tried-and-true throughout the tree of life, and has conferred an adaptive advantage to many species – including ourselves! Evolution trends towards making the most out of a handful of tools, and it’s no wonder that we are interested in upholding this principle for our own projects (Alberts).

Sorting cells - A method is needed to sort cells by their ability to bind the venom proteins - One such method would be to have the cells secrete their anti-venom proteins and then flood the cells with venom. The best cells would survive and the weak ones would be killed. However, this may cause the production of proteins that bind the venom components that are less dangerous such as phospholipases and oxidases. It would be more important for the anti-venom to inhibit the neuro-muscular disruptive proteins
- One effective method would be to use Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, which is able to sort cells by their fluorescence. See: http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/FACS.html - This would require a system that expresses a fluorescent reporter in response to the binding of venom proteins to the cell-surface proteins, but I cannot be too specific until I know how the anti-venom proteins are going to be expressed - Yet another method would cause the death of any cells that do not bind to the venom with high enough affinity - it would be similar to the methods employed in T-cell selection in eukaryotic immune systems, but would be more tricky as it has to occur in a bacterium - The ideal then, would be to have all the cells that have little or no binding affinity killed, and then those that do bind express GFP so that the fluorescence can be quantified and the binding can be rated - Again, I'd need to understand the anti-venom proteins before I could suggest any particular systems - Perhaps a second species of bacteria could be used to express the venom proteins on their surface, and come into contact with the anti-venom producing cells, causing contact-dependant stimulation, so that those that interact by the venom-antivenom complexes will be stimulated to divide whilst the remaining cells will potentially be killed See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085179 (Text by Frank)
In vivo mutagenesis - we need a method for random mutagenesis of peptides to create high affinity binding proteins to the multiple components of venom - PCR based mutagenesis is namely used for site directed mutagenesis and has several biases that make it not ideal for random mutation - in vivo homologous recombination inherent to yeast can be exploited for protein mutagenesis (Pirakiticulr et al., 2010) MAGE (multiplex automated genome engineering) See: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n725"

Cell-Free Systems as Universal Expression Platform In Synthetic Biology
Genetic modification of microorganisms is an essential method in the field of synthetic biology. By ‘thinking outside of the cell’ a cell free transcription/translation (TX-TL) system has emerged to be a true alternative by expanding the capabilities of a natural biological system from in vivo to in vitro 1 . While commercialized TX-TL systems exhibit good reproducible results, they are only available at high cost. Contrary to commercial systems, home-made TX-TL systems are affordable but come with the drawback of high batch-to-batch variations after time-consuming preparation steps. Further investigations in the optimization of the protocol for TX-TL preparation are necessary to create an easily accessible platform for the research community. Our iGEM team developed a protocol for the easy and high-quality production of a cell extract, which can be reproduced in any laboratory without the need for expensive equipment. This TX-TL system can be used to measure protein expression, genetic circuit performance and other synthetic biology tools.
Optimization of TX-TL Preparation and Quality Control
Translation Efficiency
To obtain a high quality cell extract, we focused on the optimization of several key factors:     The culture conditions were optimized by screening for the optimal cell density to harvest cells. Assessing several different lysis methods, we identified sonication as the cheapest, most accessible and reproducible way for the production of our TX-TL protein expression system. Furthermore, the upscaling of TX-TL preparation was demonstrated by using a bioreactor for cell cultivation.      Elaborate steps like the removal of the endotoxin Lipid A from the TX-TL were rendered obsolete by designing a suitable mutant strain for TX-TL preparation. For this purpose, TX-TL was prepared with a strain lacking the msbB gene to disrupt the lipid A biosynthesis pathway. By this the lipid A concentration could be lowered by a factor of 49 compared to the cell extract prepared using the wild-type strain (0.06 EU/mL).
The produced TX-TL went through further quality control checkpoints consisting of measuring  protein content, as well as an activity assay via"

This is a fusion protein formed with a Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) and semi-rationally designed copper binding domain (HHTC-Re) as subunits. There are two metal binding domains, allowing for two copper atoms to be bound to each protein molecule. GSGGSG linkers were added in between the CBD and HHTC-Re subunits to spatially isolate the individual domains while still allowing for flexibility.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," part                                 of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made.                                 The name Hefei was first given to the county set up in the area under the Han dynasty in                                 the 2nd century BC. During the 4th to the 6th century AD, this crucial border region                                 between northern and southern states was much fought over; its name and administrative                                 status were consequently often changed. During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907)                                 periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century,                                 when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.
Hefei plays an important role in scientific research in China. It has seven national                                 laboratories, second only to Beijing: The National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Chinese: 国家同步辐射实验室; pinyin: Guójiā tóngbù fúshè shíyàn shì), the Hefei National                                 Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale (Chinese: 微尺度物质科学国家实验室; pinyin: Wēi                                 chǐdù wùzhí kēxué guójiā shíyàn shì), both of which are under the University of Science                                 and Technology of China. It also has the Institute of Solid State Physics, Institute of                                 Plasma Physics, Institute of Intelligent Machines, High Magnetic Field Laboratory                                 (founded in 2008), Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, all of which are under                                 the Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences which belongs to the Chinese Academy of                                 Sciences.Hefei is the location of EAST, an experimental superconducting tokamak magnetic                                 fusion energy reactor.

SJTU-Software
We have always maintained a good relationship with SJTU. We met at Taiwan and shared our thoughts about the development of Biohub with them. They think highly of the feature of experiment record.
""Your experiment recording provides a simple and quick method for routine experiment. It could save a lot of time for us experimenters. They create the template of the experiment process which could record each experiment clearly and show the experiment to others easily. It is very convenient to sharing the ideas of experiment and communicate with each other. However, there are also some things which need to be improved. Some experiments may do two or more things in the same time, for example, when experimenters centrifuge something and they need to operate supernatant and precipitate separately so that it may be better to improve the function at these situations. Also, you could add visualization function in the editor which makes the showing process more clearly.""
We really appreciate their suggestions and now we are doing our best to improve our project.
UESTC-Software
We invited UESTC to experience Biohub and they gave us useful feedback. ""Biohub’s UI is awesome and has a sense of science and technology. Also, Biohub can respond fast and smoothly. However, there are also some places need to be improved. For example, there is no introduction to the function of Biohub at its homepage. Besides, it would be better to add the user guide to editor which could be very important for green hands.""
We have got a lot from their feedback and now we have improved our function and made our project better.
Team USTC
We had communicated with Team USTC frequently and realized that writing the experiment reports may be a difficult and duplicated thing. We got the inspiration from them and decided to develop our project now. During the process of developing, they helped us to build a professional and easy-to-use editor and a powerful search engine to help experimenters work effectively. They provide the knowledge we need and experience the functions and help us improving our project."

EPFL iGEM team on Aug 22, 2016
  
The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan has been held grandly at National Cheng Kung University Tainan. There were 19 iGEM teams from more than 5 countries attending this Meet-up Conference. Nice to meet iGEMers from the other 19 teams in this wonderful, pleased, and beneficial journey. The main programs are inclusive of presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing, round table, Tainan cultural tours etc. We truly believed that by this conference, all of the iGEM teams could have been able to achieve better visions and impress our world. And there was an amiable judge who is from igem HQ coming to see our poster and give us great numbers of precise ideas for human practice.
6 iGEM teams in NYMU on Aug 6, 2016
We got interacted with six iGEM teams from different schools in National Yang Ming University. Students from NCCU came to learn how to organize iGEM; TGU iGEM team from far China Shanghai flied here to join us; TSA high school iGEM team attended this party too. In the end we made a lot of Chinese, American, Taiwanese iGEMers as our friends. After project presentation, we had the activity of World Café hosted by NYMU iGEM team. It is a structured conversational process, consisting of several tables with one specific topic on each table, and this was led by a table leader and topics regarding iGEM or synthetic biology were discussed by 5 to 6 participants for 20 to 30 min per round. By moving between a series of tables, a great number of attenders can link ideas, facilitate open and intimate discussion, and in the long run access the collective intelligence or wisdom in the activity.
We're having our sincere gratitude to 6 iGEM teams from 6 schools, encouragement and advices of everyone and NYMU's instructor, Dr. Chuan-Hsiung Chang, the cozy environment and activity video NYMU offered, the pictures NCTU iGEM team provided, and our senior advisor, Timothy Chan En Haw who is the 1st CGU iGEM team co-founder coming with us.

Mind the Gut: Effectors
had a look at their TPH1 plates. Nothing has grown, again! We are deciding to change our strategy from gel extraction to the 2A assembly! We will subclone the TPH1 into the PSB1A3 backbone today and attempt transformation again. If we succeed with that, we will subclone it into the expression cassette on CAM-resistant backbone in the beginning of next week.
Improvement of Biobrick
After the RFP cultures did not grow on the Ampicilin medium we made made a new culture on chloramphenicol because we thought it might be a mistake in the registry. However, they did not grow on that plate either. A liquid control without antibiotics worked well, so at least we know that the cells (initially) are alive. We think that the the transformation did not work. Maybe there is a problem with the DNA too. We used the liquid cultures of the GFP we made on Tuesday to make minipreps and to use them with the promoters from the interlab-study.
High School Collaboration
The collaboration we have with UCL-academy is taking shape. We introduced them to the basics of wiki-design, modelling and let them help us with the ligation and subsequent transformation of the GFP constructs we made this morning.

Sir J. A. Muir Gray
Meeting sir M. Gray during his visit to Egypt was such an honor. he influenced us from his flood of knowledge..
He made it clear to us that in order to get the succeed at finding a well established screening programme or any trial for therapy, lies in the idea of being well organized.
He stressed out that working in a systematic approach can lead you to find the answers or solutions for any problem. He liked the idea of our project and encouraged us to carry on our work.
 
 
 
 
Dr Ahmed El-Awady
PCommended us on our choice of idea and stressed that the acting of miRNA as TLR ligands is an interesting area of research.
He also pointed out that miRNA-TLR ligands may aid in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which some evidence has proven its contribution to carcinogenesis.
Prof. Sir Magdy Yacoub
We invited dr Magdy Yacoub (Professor of Cardiothoracic surgery and Imperial College of London) to discuss our topic and the importance of the miRNA as a modulator of the immune response.
He was fascinated by the idea yet he stressed out to be focused on what we need and we actually implement. “The immune system is not something to be tampered with.” He clarified.
Dr Tarek Tawfik
We sat with Prof. Tarek Tawfik (Former Deputy Minister of Health) to explain our project idea and why we thought it was relevant. We went over the specificities of our project especially mentioning our idea in using lentivirial vectors in therapy.
Safety, an issue we faced while speaking to him, because generally many safety concerns surround the use of lentiviral vectors. We explained that it wasn’t feasible for us to use such vector because its lab safety is no.3 or no.4 and Igem only let us use bio lab safety no.1 or no.2.
Prof Hany Hafez Lotfy
, we held several closed discussion with Prof Hany concerning the most efficient ways of implementing the new radiological technological advances in the early detection of cancer. He took our team to seminars where we deliberated, back and forth, about our iGEM 2018 hypothesis for the early detection of colon cancer along renowned scholars of his field.
