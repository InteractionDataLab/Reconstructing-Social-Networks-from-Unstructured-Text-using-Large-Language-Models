Figure 11. Immunodetection of envelope protein of CHIKV within an excess of BSA (A) Principle of experiment. CHIKV-specific 3E4 antibody is represented in red. (B) Photography of membranes after the interactions were revealed.
Then, in the presence of an excess of non-specific proteins such as BSA, we showed that we maintained the specificity of our detection method (data not shown). To determine whether mosquito proteins can interfere with the specific interaction between viral proteins and specific antibodies, we coated PVDF membranes with CHIKV-specific antibodies, and we conjugated CHIKV envelope protein in presence of an excess of pathogen-free mosquito proteins. Then, we incubated coated membranes with conjugated mosquito proteins in the presence or absence of CHIKV envelope protein. We noted a basal level of interaction between the CHIKV-specific antibody 3E4 and mosquito proteins (Fig. 12). However, we noted an important increase of signal when CHIKV envelope protein is present in the mixture. It is obvious that we have to improve the specificity of our detection method in the presence of mosquito lysate.
Figure 12. Immunodetection of envelope protein of CHIKV within mosquito lysate (A) Immunodetection of E(CHIKV)within mosquito lysate by using specific 4E3 antibody on PVDF membranes. (B) Quantitative representation of previous data.
In addition to the fact that these results showed that our detection method worked, we also plan to determine the sensitivity of the method by using different amounts of CHIKV envelope proteins in the mixture.  Finally, when patches became available after pressure assembly of cellulose-C2 protein, we repeated the immuno dection assay experiment on the composite patches (cellulose-silica + fusion protein). By replacing the membrane by the patch, we observed a signal when CHIKV envelope protein is present, but non-specific interactions are clearly visible (Fig. 13). We can explain this observation by the fact that it was difficult to wash patches since they a little brittle in full liquid shaking conditions. A better packaged version, with vertical flow could improve the fluidics and stability of the experiment. Moreover, heterogeneity of degradation between the patches contributed to the fact that we cannot come to a conclusion (signal intensity was measured by mean intensity in regions of interests). In parallel, we did the same experiment to detect YFV envelope protein into infected mosquitoes (day 11 post-infection) (Performed by a coach with BHS clearance, see Safety conditions). As previously, no conclusion can"
UCSF,2010,Team:UCSF#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM seemed a perfect combination of what I wanted and more. It was a chance to work with others as a team in a welcoming environment. It also gave me the chance to learn new skills that I would normally not be exposed to until further down in my education. My iGEM experience was interesting. It could be tiring and frustrating at times, but it was also very fun and rewarding. iGEM also creates a sort of independence in people that isn’t as easy to find in the classroom. Overall, the iGEM experience was wonderful and well worth the long hours spent on it. As a bonus, I got to meet some very interesting people as well and make some good friends too.
Connor Grant
My name is Connor Grant and I just graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and will be a freshman at UCSD next year. I almost didn't join iGEM because it conflicted with soccer, but in the end I decided (with some encouragement from my biotech teacher) to spend the summer in the lab at UCSF. iGEM was a great way to learn lab techniques that are used very often in company and University research all over the world. It was good to get experience working in a lab and interacting with post docs and PHD students. It was a good experience over all and I'm glad I did it.
Hannah Yan
I recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School of San Francisco and am attending Barnard College. For me, iGEM was a chance for me to see if I wanted get into the field of science and to do something awesome during the summer. It really has been a great experience, with its ups and downs. Despite all the failures I have encountered while doing my cloning and minipreps, the ecstatic feeling I get when something worked made everything worthwhile. During iGEM, I was able to use the skills I had learned in biotechnology class and I learned a few new ones as well. I think my experience at iGEM will help me a lot when I decide to pursue the field of science in the future. My summer has been extremely academic, but being able to work with friends and on such a great project has been a lot of fun.

Figure 12.  Activity assay of NodC with higher NodC concentrations. The concentration of NodC starts with 1600 ng and was then titrated in 1X glycosyltransferase reaction buffer the presence of 100 μM of UDP-N-acetylglcosamine and 10 mM N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor substrate. The higher concentration was used to show a higher turnover of the substrate. The reaction was performed as described before and the luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Each point is an average of two experiments (N = 2), and the error bars represent the standard deviations. RLU = relative light units.
Discussion and Outlook
In our research, we show that the nodC gene can successfully be expressed in E. coli and the functional enzyme can produce chitin oligomers. This is a great chance to synthesize chitin oligomers in an environment-friendly way. Biosynthetical production of chitin oligomers forms the basis for the specific synthesis of chitosan (deacetylated chitin) and therefore is also highly relevant to all biotechnological and medical applications of chitosan.  The specific qualities of chitin or chitosan, the non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, are supportive for application in medicine. In addition the bioactivities, like the promotion of wound healing, hemostatic activity or antimicrobial activity indicate an implementation in the field of wound management [1] . These beneficial properties improve by decreasing the length of chitosan. Hence, the oligomeric chitin produced by NodC is a great precursor for medicinal chitosan production. For our project we will use chitosan to manufacture a hydrogel for treating burn wounds.
The production of chitin is the first step in generating a chitosan hydrogel band-aid ecologically. Further modifications of the chitin are the deacetylation to chitosan ( see Deacetylase ) and linking with a fluorophore ( see Chemistry ).  The production of chitin in E. coli is not only beneficial for our project but for a variety of applications, like a fungus control agent in agricultural applications. Some of the applications of chitin or chitosan are quite promising, for instance"

Project Overview
We studied the efficiency of rho-independent transcription terminators which are essential parts of synthetic genetic circuits using both theoretical calculation and experimental methods. We first developed a theoretical model. This model calculates the free energy of RNA folding and predicts the secondary structure of terminators. Based on the secondary structure, we developed an algorithm that predicts the efficiency of the terminator. The software (TTEC) based on the algorithm is available at www.terminatorefficiency.com (Figure.1). We also collected existing data from various publications and built up a database for comprehensive study on terminator efficiency (Figure.2).
Figure 1, TTEC website
Figure 2, Terminator Efficiency database
To validate our theoretical prediction, we performed biological experiments. We constructed a vector expressing RFP and GFP and designed 100 terminators to be inserted between RFP and GFP sequences (Figure 3). We measured the fluorescence intensity of RFP and GRP, respectively, which were further used to calculate the efficiency of the inserted terminator. We found that the experimental results are in a good agreement with theoretical prediction, and our model is useful for studying transcriptional regulation. Our terminator efficiency measurement protocol has been submitted to Biobrick foundation as a technical standard(BBF RFC 90).
Figure 3: Plasmid design
TTEC is the first published software to predict the efficiency of terminators. Our work will help to characterize the transcription regulation and predict gene expression.

UNITS_Trieste,2011,Team:UNITS Trieste#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," PEACEFUL
23 years, Neuroscience student.
He is from Trieste and had his BSc in Biotechnology from the University of Trieste.
The peaceful one of the group. He never complains of his work and is never angry or nervous. When you see him in the lab he is always doing his work quietly and serenely, and he always welcomes you with a smile. Unfortunately, though, shooting the rubber band of his gloves to the people passing in the hallway of the lab has become his favourite hobby, and he has a good shot so he never misses his target.
He is a member of the eukaryotik lab, and cells are so happy when he is around them!!

Aim Phosphorylation and characterization of cellulose at position 6
Protocol followed as described in the paper mentioned. Percival Zhang, Y. H., Cui, J., Lynd, L. R. and Kuang, L. R. A transition from Cellulose Swelling to Cellulose Dissolution by o-Phosphoric Acid: Evidence from Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Supramolecular Structure. Biomacromolecules, 7, 644-648 (2006)
Cellulose (200 mg, 0.62 mmol) and distilled water (0.6 mL) were added to a 50 mL glass tube. Slowly, ice cold o-phosphoric acid (15.2M, 10 mL) was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring. The suspension turned into transparent slurry within minutes.
This mixture was stirred for one hour on ice. Subsequently, 40 mL of ice cold water was added resulting in a white clouded suspension. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4°C for 20 minutes. Then the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in ice cold water. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4°C for 10 minutes. The washing cycle was repeated 4 times. Afterwards the pellet was washed one time with Na2CO3 (2M, 1 mL) and ice cold distilled water (39 mL). Finally, the pellet was washed with distilled water until pH 7.
Assumptions made for a successful phosphorylation reaction
The 31p-NMR spectrum showed one peak (-4 ppm), expected to be from phosphoric acid. The lack of the phosphate peak from cellulose is supposed to be due to lack of solubility in D2O. Nevertheless, it is suspected that the phosphorylation of cellulose at the 6th position was successful. Based on the same observation made as were described by the protocol followed[1]. Furthermore, the phosphorylated cellulose dissolved"

Overview
The final step in our detection method consists on measuring and analyzing DNA molecules that have been selectively tagged for sequencing. We have succeeded in developing such a method based on the use of our own designed fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 ( Picelli, et al, 2014., Hu, et al, 2018 ). This page is dedicated to describe how we designed this novel approach, how this was tested and what applications this method can be extended to.
Targeted DNA enrichment during library preparation
We focused on the Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing platform as the core technology to measure and obtain DNA sequences from samples. In this sequencing platform, DNA molecules diffuse through a protein pore embedded on a silica membrane. Changes in electrical signal due to this DNA diffusion are measured. The specific changes in voltage are sequence dependent, and software tools from ONT can convert this signal into DNA sequences. On one sequencing device (Flow-Cell), more than 2000 active pores can generate data at the same time. The amount of data produced from this type of sequencing is truly gigantic, and efficient data analysis of these measurements is crucial to filter and compare data ( Jain, Oslen, Paten & Akeson, 2016 ).
To control this molecule diffusion through the pore and facilitate the determination of specific sequences, the DNA molecules to be sequenced are attached to a so called motor-protein. This protein regulates the rate of diffusion through the nanopore and is indispensable for this type of sequencing. During library preparation with ONT an enzyme called transposase is used to randomly fragment DNA sequences and add DNA adapters. These DNA adapters are ligated to another DNA molecule attached to the motor protein in a subsequent step ( Jain, Oslen, Paten & Akeson, 2016 ). We aimed to change the fragmentation step of this reaction with a newly designed fusion protein that will make this adapter integration sequence specific. Thus, during library preparation, specific DNA sequences will be favourably"

Scientific research comes with many complex implications, and we have considered many, including not only the basic science of our project but how our project relates to the community. We have discussed these questions on our wiki . Additionally, our team participated in an ethics discussion organized by UC-Santa Cruz at the West Coast iGEM Meetup. We debated the importance of sustainability of large-scale research, land occupation and resource distribution. We also discussed intellectual property rights and how withholding information from competing companies can deter the progress of research.

Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry.
UCSF_UCB has improved the characterization for the yeast TEF1 promoter. This part has been submitted multiple times by multiple teams, resulting in 3 twin parts in the registry ( BBa_K431008 , BBa_K563004 , and BBa_K319003 ).  We have improved all of these parts by adding on a graph displaying the expression strength the TEF1 promoter. We measured the expression level of GFP and compared it alongside pTEF1 mutants and established a comparison of its strength as a constitutive promoter.

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"unit protein which converts ammonia (NH4) to an intermediate called hydroxylamine (NH2OH).  HAO then converts the hydroxylamine to nitrite (NO2-).  During this conversion process, cytochrome c554 accepts an electron from HAO, and then passes this electron on to ccm552.  The terminal electron acceptor in this chain is quinone.  AMO and ccm552 are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane, and all other proteins in this process are found in the periplasm.
Mutant 2: Anaerobic
The second mutant incorporates the Nir region from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (shown in yellow). NirS converts nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), while removing an electron from NirM .  The remainder of the Nir region is necessary for the synthesis of NirS, and so we have included these genes as well. NOR , which is present natively in E. coli, converts nitric oxide to nitrous oxide (N2O).  In contrast to N. europaea, E. coli is not a nitrifying bacterium and so does not convert nitrous oxide into nitrogen to complete the denitrification process.
Plasmids
Mutant 1
The final plasmid for Mutant 1 should be the following which includes all genes on one plasmid:
In order to simplify and to be able to debug each part of this pathway separately, we first implemented the genes individually.  Unfortunately, we did not have time to combine all the genes into the final plasmid, but we were able to verify that the AMO containing plasmid is working as designed .
Mutant 2
The final plasmid for Mutant 2 is the following:
Since we had difficulty extracting Nir from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one piece, we split it into two pieces to be extracted seperately and then re-combined them with USER cloning.
USER Cloning
To assemble our plasmids we employ uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) cloning [4]. This technique enables us to speed up the cloning process, to clone seamlessly, and to assemble many fragments in one reaction. The steps are:
PCR: The backbone and all fragments are amplified as linear products containing a uracil instead of a thymine at a specific position. This requires specially designed set of primers with a tail that will become the overhang and a polymerase that is able to perform uracil-insertion.
We are using the non-commercial polymer"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," of major changes to a proteins sequence and structure even after translation. Although this mechanism alone offers a huge amount of possible applications highlighted in our toolbox, it would be advantageous to have control over the time and location of the splicing reaction especially for in vivo applications. However, the fact that inteins are attached to the protein they splice off from makes induction in whatever way rather difficult.
Controlling Inteins
Different ways exist for controlling the intein splicing reaction. In the literature this is mostly referred to as conditional trans splicing (CTS) or conditional protein splicing (CPS). The oldest method of inducing protein splicing is to chemically control the activity of inteins by changing the pH or redox state of their environment. This has been achieved for a multitude of inteins such as Ssp DnaB [1] or Mtu recA [2] . Yet the major drawback is obvious: These methods are only effectively applicable in vitro and usually depend on complexly purified reagents.
Within the past decades, more advanced systems were designed involving the binding of different ligands or the fusion of inteins to various protein domains. For example Mootz et al. succeeded in inhibiting the splicing reaction of an synthetically engineered version of Ssp DnaE through the addition of rapamycin [3] . Similarly, the S. cerevisiae VMA intein has been conditionally activated by rapamycin induced complementation of FKBP and FRB protein domains. There have previously been attempts to light induce inteins with an analogous system in which the VMA intein halves are fused to the chromoproteins Phytochrome B (PhyB) and Phytochrome Associated Factor 3 (PIF3) [4] . Upon light induction at 660 λ nm PhyB and PIF3 assemble bringing the intein halves together to initiate splicing. Although most certainly a useful tool, these principle can only work for inteins with low affinity to each other and therefore with rather low reaction rates. When using faster inteins, the corresponding halves bind to each other with significantly higher affinity and thereby start the splicing reaction independently from the binding state of their coupled protein domains.
We therefore came up with a new method to inhibit an intein's function light-dependently using LOV2 domain photocaging.

The J-alpha helix is clearly identifiable in the front bottom. The part suitable for photocaging (that is the part downstream of the I539"

How the L.A.S.S.O. Fits into The Lung Ranger
Aims
Objectives
How the L.A.S.S.O. Fits into The Lung Ranger
The biological detection systems are potentially capable of detecting the presence of the bacterial species forming the focus of our project. However, it is  unlikely to be capable of generating a quantifiable measure of bacterial load if used in isolation.  Indeed, even a qualitative output from the systems would require it to be used in conjunction with sophisticated laboratory equipment. We therefore created the Light Amplifying Signal Sensing Object (L.A.S.S.O.) -  a device which, when used in conjunction with The Lung Ranger, is potentially capable of quantifying the bacterial load by utilising the biophotonics phenomena. The L.A.S.S.O. would allow for more frequent mobile monitoring of lung infections in CF patients, offering early detection and thus improved treatment, quality of life and ultimately,  increased survival times.
Aims
The main aim was to design a relatively inexpensive device that would be easily used with little training, thus making it a device that both medical staff and patients alike would be comfortable in using. In the future, the device should be capable of being used away from the clinic. To address this aim, the team had to:

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Wetlab#Part Design#BioBricks#PyeaR+LacZ_-_-_TEXT.html," in favour of getting the best data we could from Edinburgh's BBa_K216009 part.
The rest of this page is dedicated to the procedure followed in the attempt at creating the PyeaR + LacZ construct, and also points out some of the difficulties encountered along the way. The first figure is a virtual map of the construction of the new BioBrick, containing the barest details of the work that went in.
The steps to achieve the new construct are as follows, assuming you have pure concentrated stocks of both original biobricks ( BBa_K216005 & BBa_I732017 ):
Procedure
Step one - double digest of both BioBricks.
BBa_K216005
30.0μL Purified BBa_K216005 Plasmid DNA
0.5μL BSA 100x
5.0μL NEBuffer 2 10x
1.0μL PstI
1.3μL SpeI
12.2μL ddH2O
Total volume: 50.0μL
BBa_I732017
30.0μL Purified BBa_I732017 Plasmid DNA
0.5μL BSA 100x
5.0μL NEBuffer 3 10x
1.0μL PstI
1.3μL XbaI
12.2μL ddH2O
Total volume: 50.0μL
Both were incubated at 37°C, BBa_K216005 for 2 hours and BBa_I732017 for 3 hours. After 2 hours, the BBa_K216005 digestion mix was removed from incubation.
Step 2 - phosphatase treatment of BBa_K216005 to prevent recircularisation.
BBa_K216005 phosphatase treatment
50.0μL BBa_K216005 digestion mix
7.0μL alkaline phosphatase buffer 10x
7.0μL alkaline phosphatase
6.0μL ddH2O
Total volume: 70.0μL
Placed back in 37°C incubation for 1 hour.
Step 3 - Agarose gel
Added 1/5 total volume loading buffer to both the BBa_K216005 phosphatase mix (~14.0μL) and the BBa_I732017 double digest mix (~10.0μL). Ran the gel at 100V for 2 hours with a 1kb DNA ladder for reference.

Business Overview
Synbiologica Ltd is a group of science students at the University of Lethbridge who plan to develop the Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR) for the highly specific detection of hormones. The company is currently comprised of four science students with varying academic backgrounds.
BEAR is a small device attached to a test subject or patient that will be able to monitor changing hormone levels in the subject bloodstream, first as an immediate point-of-care test and eventually as a real time hormone detection device. BEAR will be used primarily in research and in future diagnostics. Once the BEAR prototype has proved to be effective in a laboratory setting, Synbiologica Ltd will pursue a patent on the device. Synbiologica Ltd plans to use the licence-out business model to sell the BEAR device to biotechnology companies who are already well established and who have the resources to manufacture BEAR on a larger scale. These companies also have employees who specialize in marketing and sales of products. Synbiologica Ltd currently does not have employees skilled in these fields.
BEAR will be manufactured and sold as a two-part system. It will contain a reusable apparatus that will contain a hormone-sensitive modular component. We are unable to elaborate on the exact design of this system in order to protect our proprietary information.
Synbiologica Ltd is targeting hormone researchers as the primary market. Researchers who use animal test subjects for hormone analysis will need to purchase an appropriate number of BEAR apparatus’ to accommodate the number of test animals in the experiment. In a typical experiment, at least 5-10 test animals and an equal number of control animals will be used and enough BEAR devices will need to be purchased in order to test many subjects within a shorter period of time. BEAR is also a more efficient means of individual testing. If a test on an individual must be performed and a sample from the subject cannot be stored due to"

Finally it was terminated by SV40 poly(A) signal Termination (BBa_K2217005).
 
Fig-4 Composite Part BBa_K2217022
Part BBa_K2217022 was composed of CMV Enhancer as well as CMV Promoter (BBa_K2217000 and  BBa_K2217006 respectively) as constitutive promoters to enhance the transcription process of the laci that was submitted (Ba_K2217012). We also improved the fragment’s characterization by adding the miRNA binding site of the miRNA mir-1825 as determined computationally using circ interactome database [4] where we hypothesised its function as a trigger for miRNA binding and synthesis. Finally, it was terminated by SV40 poly(A) signal Termination (BBa_K2217005).
Fig-5 Composite Part BBa_K2217023
Part BBa_K2217023 is composed of lac operator (BBa_K2217016) and the lac promoter (BBa_K2217017) as a weak constitutive promoter in a trial to improve characterization of ceRNA network using yfb (BBa_K2217014) detection using flow cytometry. Finally, it was terminated by Poly_gh termination (BBa_K2217015).

Gel extraction
Nanodropped the digested DNA fragments extracted from the gel: pSB1C3: 15.2 ng/µL, Dsp: 1.3 ng/µL
Results
Successful digests for both the Dsp and pSB1C3, correct band sizes were observed. The bands extracted were the Dsp band and 2.0 kb band in the pSB1C3 backbone.
Gel extraction pictures and gels:
The mass of microcentrifuge was tared and subtracted from the sample+microcentrifuge mass. The masses recorded were the masses of the gel extracted: Dsp band:
Mass of Dsp: 0.5229 grams
Mass (ng): 21 (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.213
Observed size (kb): 1.2
Mass of pSB1C3 backbone: 0.2018 grams.
Mass (ng): 1 band was 250 ng and the other band was 375ng (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.11 kb and 2.029 kb
Observed size (kb): 1.2 kb and 2.0 kb
The gel bands extracted were the Dsp band size 1.2 kb and the 2.0 kb pSB1C3 backbone using the Gel Extraction protocol.
Volume of QX1 added for pSB1C3 was: 600 μL as 3 folds more so mass=200 mg so 200*3=600
Volume of QX1 added for Dsp was: 1.5 mL as  folds so mass=500 mg so 500*3=1500
Results
A very faint band of size of ≈ 3 kb which is the band of interest was observed, along with other bands. This band is most likely the band of interest as it corresponds to expected ligated product of size 3.2 kb.

The brick toy is composed of the following parts.
Here is the base board where all the other parts can be put.
Here is the recombinase part, indicating the DNA sequence between two action site of one recombinase. These two triangles represents the action site of the recombinae.The part can be plugged on the base board and can be turned around. You can also plug two recombinase part together so that the sequence can be turned twice.
Here is the DNA sequence without recombinase action sites. These parts are the same as the recombinase part mentioned above, except that they do not have the triangles, so they do not turn under any circumstances.
Here is the promotor part. Promoters answers to inducers and start the expression after induction. The promoter part here has a track on both side which can hold the little patch indicating the inducer. When a patch is put on the track, it means that the promoter answers to the inducer.
The promoter can be plugged into the grooves at the side of both recombinase part and normal DNA sequence part mentioned above.
Here is the coding sequence part. It can be plugged into the recombinase part and the normal DNA sequence part mentioned above. The arrow at the front indicates the direction of the expression.
Here is the terminator part. It indicates the end of expression.
Finally, here is our circuit demonstrated by this model.

During the visit
Our project focuses on the construction of a new kind of cellular memory machine which is capable of recording the changes of a signal in an extended time period. This aspect of our memory machine can be extremely useful in monitoring the chemical changes in the environment. So we contacted one of the biggest sewage plant in Shanghai—Xinchu sewage plant and paid a visit there.
After talking to the workers at the sewage plant, we had some new ideas.
The biochemical reaction pool where all the microbes works hard to lower the COD value is exactly where we may put our engineered E.coli to do the monitoring work.
Although data like COD value and pH of the sewage is dynamically monitored, some other important data like the amount of heavy metal is more difficult to detect. So, When it comes to real world application, we may have a closer look on the monitoring of heavy metals.
The reaction pool is more than 10 meters deep, but the regular sampling of the sewage can only cover"

Experimental (wetlab) planning
The figure above depicts the work flow involved with biological engineering projects. The design and synthesis phases are dependent on product specifications, components to build with and tools to put them together - these phases are synthetic biology-driven.  The systems biology-driven steps are the analysis and model steps, which take advantage of high-throughput omics measurement technologies, bioinformatic approaches to organizing the generated data and computational biology methods to simulate biological systems. The design and model stages are largely carried out computationally whereas the synthesis and analysis steps require the use of the laboratory (i.e., wetlab).
Synthesis
The substrate we're working with is DNA, which we can isolate and clone from a natural source, find within a repository such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, or have fabricated (i.e., chemically synthesized) by a DNA synthesis company such as DNA2.0 or GENEART.
Once you have your DNA, you're ready to get started with the realization of your design.  Usually, the first step is the bacterial amplification of your starting material, DNA, which is usually housed on a plasmid.  Therefore, first transform E. coli with the appropriate DNA and allow the bacteria to propagate, thereby amplifying the amount of your DNA. The properly transformed bacteria can be selected for by including the appropriate antibiotic in the growth medium.
Specifically, you should spread out the (hopefully) transformed cells on an LB-agar dish and culture overnight. After selecting 5 colonies from the dish the next day, you should grow up 5 overnight liquid cultures (5mL volume is good).

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ly controlled manner. For this we plated our copy control plasmid strains on inducer gradient plates with antibiotic. The results are shown in Figure 11 below. In all cases we see a zone of replication surrounding the center. Cells far from the center are unable to survive and reproduce, since they cannot make the plasmid which gives antibiotic resistance. For the strongest promoter, even at the outer edges of the plate some cells survive, but the cell density is reduced. This is consistent with the relatively irrepressible nature of the strong promoter as seen in the copy number and plasmid loss experiments (Fig 9 and 10). While this result looks similar to the ordinary colour repressor gradients shown earlier (see Fig 11 (IPTG gradients) above), note that the dark regionsof the plate that are closer to its circumference are completely free of cells, as opposed to having cells which are simply expressing the gene at a somewhat lower level. Therefore, with copy number control alone, we should to be able to achieve a very high dynamic range of spatial colour control.
                        
Fig 11. IPTG and ATC gradient plates spread with cells containing plasmids that express the repressors LacI (IPTG plates) or TetR (ATC plates) constitutively driven from Pr-3. Each plasmid contains one of several repressor-regulated origin promoters (see Fig. 8) indicated by the plate label.
Circuits for programming spatial colour expression
With these new copy-controlled plasmids as a starting point, we turned to the question of how we could use them to control two (or more!) separate colours at once. Some interesting issues are raised by controlling genes with plasmid loss. In Figure 12 below, we show two designs using only copy number control. They are both two-plasmid systems; with the similar origins maintained by the use of two antibiotics. Both plasmids use repressible origins, so that maintenance requires inducer in the presence of repressor. The two designs differ in the location of the repressor. In one system, which we call auto-repressive, the repressor is expressed by the same plasmid which it is repressing. This is similar to the copy-controlled plasmids we constructed and tested above. In the other design, which we call cross-repressive, each plasmid is repressing the other, but not itself. In both cases removal of an inducer will result in plasmid loss and selection of one of the plasmids and its colour;"

AlkL characterization
Effect of AlkL on cell growth
As shown in literature, the AlkL protein may be toxic when overexpressed and inhibits the growth of its host. We decided to test the severity of this toxicity and compare by using Anderson promoters of varying strength. We chose a gradient of expression strength, ranging from strong (0.7 measured strength) to intermediate (0.5 measured strength), to weak (0.3 measured strength) for this experiment. As a control for comparison of growth rate, we chose E. coli DH5A that was transformed with a plasmid of similar size to our parts plasmid. This is because we wanted to ensure plasmid size was not the factor that limited growth of the host. This plasmid in question contained BBa_I13401 as the insert, which had only 27 extra bp than our alkL-containing plasmids.
The 4 bacterial samples, including 3 parts and 1 control, involved in this growth curve experiment were first inoculated overnight in LB. Then, they were diluted by 100 times in a conical flask and put in a shaker at 37C for an 8 hour period. A sample of 100ul was taken every hour and put in a 96-well plate. Absorbance at 595nm of each sample was then measured by an Envision Multiplate Reader. In total, for each bacterial sample, 2 trials of triplicates were used throughout the 8 hour period.
Of all our parts, BBa_K2764001 had the strongest promoter strength, followed by BBa_K2764002 and then by BBa_K2764003. The control, had the same promoter strength as BBa_K2764001.Taken individually, the absorbance-time charateristics of each strains are as follows:

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Recomination_-_-_TEXT.html," four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product (P). The reverse reaction also occurs.
This product can separate into two separate plasmids (P1, P2) whose Cre can bind and unbind from the lox sites in the         same manner as before
The knockout eﬃciency can be calculated as
.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In our model, we do not consider the other products that could form from Cre-lox recombination. In particular, two         original plasmids with 2 Cre at one lox site on each plasmid could theoretically recombine to make a joint plasmid         together based on the principle of Cre recombinase. However, this is less likely because the lox sites are located         much further apart than those on the same plasmid. Thus, in order to simplify our model and limit the number of species         to be considered, we do not consider them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the Recombination module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
4.1 Cre-lox Recombination
Fig. 1 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre tends towards 53.5 % after around 5000 seconds         (around 83 minutes). While this knockout eﬃciency is not particularly high, we will show in the population dynamics         model that, over time, it results in most of the plasmid eventually being those of the knocked out.
4.2 Cre-lox Recombination without Reverse Reaction
In our construct we use lox66 and lox71, which are mutants of loxp for which the forward reaction is highly preferred         over the reverse reaction because the product of recombination includes a mutant loxp which has a very low tendency         to recombine. Because we were unable to ﬁnd reaction constants for the reverse reactions of lox66 and lox71 in the         literature, we simply simulated a version of the model where the reverse reaction is ignored for reference.

Metabolic Engineering of E. coli for Cis 1,4-polyisoprene (Latex) Production
Abstract
With rising costs in synthetic rubber chemical synthesis, environmental blight, and deforestation diminishing the annual yield of natural rubber plantations, a new alternative for latex production is needed to address its global demand shortfall.  To address this issue, we sought to transform the latex synthesis pathway into a single cell organism that could be grown in bioreactors, such as Escherichia coli.  Due to its low doubling time and ability to be cultured in bulk, genetically modified E. coli capable of producing latex offer a promising solution for fast, high yield latex production. Through genetic manipulation of the endogenous methylerythritol phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway and transformation with rubber production genes from Hevea brasiliensis, we developed a transgenic single cell organism capable of converting glucose into cis-1,4-polyisoprene, the primary chemical constituent in latex.  Not only is our modified organism capable of producing cis-polyisoprenes quickly, but also in high yield.
Figure 1: MEP/DOXP pathway. The rate limiting step is the first step, in which pyruvate and G3P are converted into DXP. Through constitutive expression of DXS we are able to accelerate the process and push the equilibrium of the reaction towards favoring the products, IPP and DMAPP.[20]
The problem with production
Produced by the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, natural rubber is an emulsion consisting of numerous proteins, starches,"

October
We obtained fliC deletion strains from the Yale Coli Genetic Stock Centre (CGSC): JW1908-1 and YK4516. We made these strains competent by the CaCl2 method. Then we successfully transformed our constructs into JW1908-1, grew liquid cultures, and performed motility assays. After approximately 18 hours, no motility was shown in the flagellin, J04450, RFP deletion, or RFP insertion constructs. Our future work will include performing motility assays for the rest of our constructs, transforming our constructs into YK4516, and sending out parts out for sequencing. It appears that we have successfully ligated s-doc-RFP under the J04500 promoter, evidenced by the appearance of a few tiny fluorescent colonies on a ligation plate, so we are continuing to work on our super chimera of 5 different proteins. We are planning to perform experiments with our sdoc-RFP cultures to determine whether the dockerin-RFP proteins are successfully being secreted extracellularly, and if so, whether or not they can latch onto cohesin-expressing flagella.

Biosafety
Although the manipulation of DNA does not involve the use of live organisms, the utmost care must still be taken with all reagents and equipment in order to minimise the risk to the user and avoid any potential damage to the environment. The follow Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) describe the various hazards associated with the reagents used with Darwin Toolbox, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Risk Assessment for use of the different modules within the toolbox can be found.
Technology Misuse
Our project raises concerns that our technology could be used by hostile groups, similar to the iGEM CU Boulder project . All the equipment our laboratory kit provides is already accessible via online retail outlets.

Alberta,2011,Team:Alberta#EsterificationExtraction_-_-_TEXT.html,") analysis using both mass spectrometry (MS) to determine which fatty acids are present, and Flame Ionization detector (FID) GC to quantify the fatty acids. The MS-GC data indicated that all three samples produced predominantly C17, and C19 methyl esters. From the FID-GC data the area under each peak was compared to the area under the standard, whose concentration is known. The following equation was used,
From that the concentration of each peak was calculated, the total amount of fatty acid was determined by adding the concentrations together and multiplying by the volume of hexane used. The Fatty acid flight times between the two GC readings differ, so they have to be matched using their relative position to the internal standard, so it is never certain what peak is actually the fatty acid you are looking for but there are some that are closer than others. This is way in the following table multiple peaks could be either C17 methyl esters, or C19 methyl esters. This figure shows the raw GC data for both MS (Left) and FID (right) of each sample, the table gives the concentration of each peak on the FID-GC plot, and possible identities based on the MS-GC data. It also shows the total amount of fuel produced per gram of wet weight cell mass.

RFC25:
=========================================
Table 1: The table above basically describes and designates     qualities of parts which identifies their compositions and demonstrates     the status of previously assigned standards. PartID refers to the unique     ID number for parts including atomic parts and assemblies. PartName     refers to the given unique names to parts. Bricks, refers to the shortcut     names which specifies atomic parts. ImageIDs, refers to individual or     combination of numbers that are assigned by us. RFCs refers to the states     of parts based on RFC standards.
iGEM both provides individual, atomic parts and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one     at a time will be very time consuming. These previously merged constructs,     serve as the repository for puzzle and they can be used for different     purposes. Up to date the largest and most trustworthy source, for synthetic     biology and its components, is iGEM’s parts registry. In 2010, iGEM     provided over 1000 parts that have initiated many projects. Having more     atomic parts available in the iGEM’s repository, will lead to the design     of more complex and robust constructs, and we would have a better chance     to design different constructs for unique purposes. Also, for the parts     that are already available, extra steps needs to be taken for the quality     control and surveillance of these products. The quality control of the     information for the parts is essential for the future of iGEM and synthetic     biology. Even though we have found pre-determined RFC standards useful     and included those to our standardized template, some individual parts     still requires re-organization of the information as RFC standards alone     for the functionality of parts, does not satisfy the needs for wet lab     biologists.
Without a question there is an urgent need to build a distinct and     specific database well organized with its own standards for synthetic     biology; however, development of such a database is not an easy task.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org.             After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.
for a PDF of more examples of learnsynbio exercises, click here.
Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"ature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all, synthetic biology is an emerging     research discipline and an industrial application area which is highly     promising. Secondly, redefinition of the terminology to build a standard     nomenclature is needed as some of the terms are prone to be used instead     of another causing problems related to misuse for the global communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which serves for the information exhibition and exchange globally.     For instance, there are obvious misunderstandings about the words which     are predominantly used for regulation process. We have noticed that,     the terms “inhibitor” and “repressor” are being used as equivocally     in the part information pages. Like the lactose inhibitor protein, a     widely used DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, that have been labeled     both as “inhibitor” and “repressor” at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory elements. To sum up, we investigated all input elements for     promoters and classify these elements in terms of their function, affect     and required input element for them. So, we suggest that terminology     used for regulation of transcription should be defined clearly on iGEM’s     website and correct use of terminology should be enforced.
The second group of parameters was collected under the title “Output”,     which refers to products of functional genes. In contradiction, the     term “reporter” has also been described within the same list. Reporters     are also genes whose products, can be used for screening as an output.     According to our group, the usage of the term “reporter” for genes is     unnecessary and cause extra complexity for information distribution     and gives rise to discrepancies. Instead of using the term “reporter”,     predefined “gene” description should be used for genes, which can function     as reporters. The special information which is related with the characteristic     of that gene should also be presented on part info web page.
Furthermore, the same terminology “reporter” was used for both atomic     parts and composite bio-bricks. Also the overall image descriptions     for these were defined as “reporters”. We want to point out that using     same nomenclature for both atomic genes and for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both"

Another important aspect of our business is how we will manufacture and distribute our product. It is important to consider factors such as cost, location and timeline. Through a partnership with a local manufacturing group, we have established an operational plan that we hope can achieve our production goals at low cost.
Manufacturing: Prototypes
Developing Prototypes and Manufacturing Models
With a technology implementation plan in place we have developed drawings and plans to be able to optimize our prototype system and prepare it as a product for delivery into the market. We have created detailed sketches of several potential designs for both the detector and cartridge components of our system. We have developed lower cost models using technologies such as microfluidics devices. Microfluidics offers a distinct advantage in terms of price per unit that must be produced.  Because it is on a micro scale, it uses less of each reagent and component making them more simple to handle and effective to use. Please note, that the numbers reported on this page however reflect a cuvette style cartridge.
In order to protect our intellectual property, we have not presented these sketches here. Please feel free to contact us for more details however!

Riley Broth: A novel growth media based on purified canine biowaste
Figure 7
Overview A fundamental objective of our project was to develop a methodology for reusing Martian colonial biomass as a feedstock for growing our recombinant Escherichia coli (E.coli). Our idea was to eliminate the need for astronauts to bring containers of LB with them on the space shuttle and allow for other essential materials, such as food, to be brought on board. The current standard for growing E.coli (along with a large number of other bacteria) is lysogeny broth. This broth is made up of a combination of yeast extract, salt, tryptone, and water. These four simple ingredients provide a nutritionally complete medium for E.coli to grow on, and can be supplemented with antibiotics for selection of recombinant plasmids. We hypothesized that utilizing a simple drying and sterilization procedure would allow us to generate an equivalent nutritionally complete medium. Our results indicate that our media (which we dubbed “Riley Broth” after the canine companion who produced it) is capable of sustaining levels of growth for standard DH5α E.coli cells that are comparable to those of growth on LB.
Riley Broth Production The first step of the production of Riley Broth (RB) was to freeze dry the original sample of feces to remove all the moisture from the sample. This was done by placing the sample under vacuum for 36 hours at 2660 mT of pressure.
After drying, the dry mass was crushed into a fine powder. The fine powder was then split into two separate samples for replication. Each of the samples were then dissolved in 500 mL of MilliQ water then autoclaved. The sample was then filtered through a standard Grade 1: 11 μm filter paper to remove the non-water soluble waste. It was then filtered again through a 0.22 μm filter. We hypothesized that our media might lack the appropriate levels of salts. In order to circumvent this issue, 15mL of 5 M NaCl was added to the purified media to establish a salt concentration of 0.15M.

Week 7 June 13- June 20
We started to construct our circuits by ourselves. At first, we designed four circuits that both had the same promoter, RBS, terminator and two fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry. In the first circuit, there were only proteins. In the second circuit, there was an endonuclease RNase cleavage site which would make the circuit into two fragments. Both in the third and fourth circuits, there was stem-loops but circuit 4 had an RNase site.
Figure4 The design of our first four circuits.
We divided our wet group into two parts to use enzyme cleavage and overlap respectively to construct our circuits.
Week 12 July 11- July 18
We met problem that the BFP couldn’t transform or emit fluorescence. We thought that the part we used couldn’t work well so we decided to use GFP rather than BFP.
We publicized iGEM and synthetic biology in our school by organizing a lecture for about 100 people. We started to recruit new iGEM team member for 2017.
We also carried out our other parts of human practice, like holding summer camp for students from other universities.
Week 15 July 19- July 26
We successfully used overlap to construct our circuit which included GFP and mCherry as two fluorescent reporter proteins.
Figure5 We constructed our circuit by overlapping
We also tried to insert stem loops in our circuit and we successfully annealed and extended the primer.
Week 16 July 27-August 3
We learned the protocol of how to extract mRNA and started to do experiment from circuit 1 to circuit 4. Then, we detect the mRNA by using RT-PCR.
We also started to measure the growth curve of E.coli by using UV spectrophotometer, which under the wave length of 600 to decide the time point of detecting the expression of protein.
Week 17 August 4- August 11
We got the results of the growth curve of E.coli and ensured that they would arrive logarithmic phase after 6-7 hours and arrive stationary phase after 21-22 hours.
We started to test the expression of GFP and mCherry in circuit 1 to 4 by using microplate reader.

With the cooperation of productivity model and curcumin transformation model, we could perfectly predict the crop productivity and maintained the balance of soil microbiota.
Background Introduction
Curcumin
     Curcumin is a natural lipid-soluble yellow compound from the plant turmeric. It is a potent antioxidant as well as anti-tumorigenic and anti-inflammatory molecule. Although curcumin has been proved its therapeutic efficacy against many human ailments, but the problem is it is hard to absorb by human cells. To solve this problem, a paper which indicated a curcumin carrier protein called αS1-casein showed high binding affinity with curcumin. We then utilized this property of αS1-casein to create a curcumin bio-sensor.
αS1-casein
     Caseins are proteins commonly found in mammalian milk and is a mixture of four phosphoprotein. One of the phosphoprotein is αS1-casein, which contains no disulfide bonds and relatively little tertiary structure. As their primary function is nutritional, binding large amounts of calcium, zinc and other biologically important metals, amino acid substitutions or deletions have little impact on function.
The Binding Between Curcumin and αS1-casein
     According to the reference, we found how curcumin bind with αS1-casein. Curcumin has a β-diketone moiety, flanked by two phenolic groups, that helps bind to proteins through hydrophobic interactions. The carboxyl-terminal of αS1-casein (100−199 residues) predominantly contains hydrophobic amino acids, which may be involved in the binding process. Residues 14−24 in αS1-casein are hydrophobic in nature and form a surface “patch” of hydrophobicity. Curcumin may probably be binding at these two sites, with two different ranges of affinity through hydrophobic interaction. One with high affinity [(2.01 ± 0.6) × 106 M−1] and the other with low affinity [(6.3 ± 0.4) × 104 M−1].
Establishment
Cloning of αS1-casein
     We got the amino acid sequence of αS1-casein from NCBI, and adjusted the DNA sequence to optimize its expression in E. coli. We also added a GS linker ahead to enhance the function of sensor and synthesized the gblock fragment from IDT.

Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#Scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," to identify hot spots. This would allow for better targeting of insecticide spraying and it could help address public and environmental health concerns.
Our Solution
With the assistance of synthetic biology, we successfully modified E. coli, within a contained fully functioning biosafety laboratory. With it, we produce the protein needed to create biosilica, and bind antibodies onto a cellulose support. We selected biosilica to increase rigidity of our patch and because it is completely biodegradable. The innovative design of the patch creates a multilayered matrix coated with antibodies capable of detecting a wide panel of vector-borne pathogens and insecticide resistant proteins from captured mosquitoes. This patch is customizable and can be easily adapted to simultaneously test for multiple vector-borne pathogens prevalent in specific locations. Additionally, the patch will have 2D barcoded readouts, generating an environmental surveillance database. A precise map of vector hot spots will provide a better assessment and response to vector-borne diseases, assisting local health authorities with anticipating and preparing for an epidemic. The development of our project’s concept and the design of our device (i.e. patch and trap) was an iteractive process that involved a multidimensional collaboration of people and ideas. We successfully achieved this through: 1) numerous team brainstorming activities; 2) oral and poster presentations to various audiences (i.e. scientists, young researchers, professionals, and students); 3) organizing meetings with scientific experts (i.e. ecologists, entomologists); 4) consulting local agencies (French Interdepartmental Mosquito Control Board (EID) and in the United States the New Orleans Mosquito Control Board) and a drone company to discuss our project and if applicable, potential collaboration. For more information go to the METHODOLOGY setion. Additionally, we incorporated surveys assessing the general public’s understanding and acceptance of synthetic biology. These steps were essential to ensuring we gathered knowledge, gained feedback, and considered as many options as possible; making necessary adjustments based on our findings. Our tool will be user-friendly, safe, and applicable.
User-friendly
The Mos(kit)o device is easy to use and it does not require scientific expertise so it is possible to train people locally. From the set up of the trap to the analysis of the patch, the steps are simple and designed to reduce user error. For example, the quick read function has a color change component to ensure quick and accurate interpretation of results; changing from no color to color for positive results.

iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Aalto-Helsinki wrote collaboratively the HumHub report and it has been edited by iGEM Alto-Helsinki and iGEM Pasteur.
→ Here is the report written by iGEM Pasteur:
How does iGEM Pasteur imagine the HumBub platform? The iGEM Pasteur team imagined the HumHub platform to be a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams. Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
WE IMAGINED A FEW RUBRICS ON THIS PLATFORM.
« First step in Igem competition » This tab is dedicated for every new iGEM team. In fact, our team is taking part in this competition for the first time and we admit that we had a lot of uncertainties about the proceedings of the competition, the organization, how to use different tools available… « Synbio tools » One of the major problem that we encountered was to determine a lab calendar of all the experiment we had to do. Also, we can imagine a rubric that will regroup all tools that are used by other teams and some video tutorials about how to use this tools.  This rubric would be a great help for new teams that are looking for some experiences and advertisements from experimented teams. « Collaborations » One of the philosophy of the iGEM is sharing. Communication and collaborations between teams is very important. However, it is difficult to start a conversation with a team without a real discussion platform! Sometimes, teams don’t answer our mails or it just takes a long time. Video conferences are possible by Skype, but we have to ask for a personal account from a team member to discuss. It would be easier to centralize all team and team members’ emails on a database that will be accessible in the HumHub platform. We could communicate faster. If possible, even develop a messaging app between teams and team members to facilitate the exchange. Here, teams would be able to talk about their project and to share with other teams that are working on a close field. Each team can use different tags in order to identify their projects and facilitate the  Private communication between two, three or as many teams will be possible. Public communication with every team will also be possible, for example to share the surveys. Moreover, any team would be allowed to share new ideas of project to create together. We imagine that someone will post an idea of project and interested teams would be able to be put in touch with them. « Forum"

Summary
The next step in the product development process would be to analyze the regulation our product is subjected to. Our product is a so-called “combinational product”, which is a product comprised of any combination of a drug and a device, a biological product and a device, a drug and a biological product, or a drug, device, and a biological product. The last example would be our product. Because of this, our product would be subjected to three different regulations, the nebulizer would be accounted as a medical device (Europe Class IIa and US Class II), the genetically engineered bacteria as a recombinant Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP) (evaluation of Human Safety, Environmental Safety, and Risk Assessment, visit our policy to know more) and the substance produced by the bacteria would be accounted for as a drug (proven safety and efficacy through clinical trials). In this case, our strategy to obtain regulatory approval would be to focus on the use of the drug for the treatment of one specific disease, cystic fibrosis.
Word list
Medical device: An instrument, apparatus, machine or other article intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
Device class: A classification for a device determines the strength of the regulatory standards the device will have to go through and depends on the level of risk that is associated with the device.
Standard: General controls and procedural regulations that medical devices are subjected to.
The nebulizer part of the device would be classified as a Class IIa medical device by the Medical Products Agency (MPA). This Class IIa consideration is due to the device being invasive with respect to a body orifice, the mouth. However, there would need to be more research done on the importance of the mode of action on the efficacy and safety of the administered bacteria, in which case, the nebulizer would be included in the class IIb.
As a medical device, the product would have to fulfill the requirements under the European Medical Device Regulation. A medical device needs to be safe and suitable for its intended use, in order to be able to receive a certification of conformity. This certification indicates that the product fulfills the requirements established by the MPA and allows the manufacturer to include the CE marking (European Conformity) symbol in the product. The intended use of the product is to release bacteria that will produce a drug that will degrade mucus for patients with excessive mucus production"

It contains 2 sets of wells which means that there is more than 24 wells for the samples to loaded into.

Ethanol Precipitation and Concentration of midi-prep DNA
Mathew carrying out an ethanol precipitation of the BBa_J33206 midi-prep sample
To work on the midi-preps of the BBa_J33206 and pSB1A2 DNA without the risk of any present ethanol disturbing the process, the ethanol was removed and the DNA concentrated according to GenElute's MidiPrep protocol. This is a summary of the steps taken:
0.1ml of 3.0 Sodium acetate was added to the midi-prep tube before 0.7ml of isopropanol was also added. The solution was mixed well by inverting the Eppendorf tube before centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 mins was carried out.
The supernatant was removed gently before 1.5ml of 70% ethanol was added. Centrifugation for 10 minutes then followed.
The supernatant was poured off the sample gently before the Eppendorf tube underwent drying in the Speed Vac machine (the protocol can be found here ). Once dried out the DNA was resuspended in 50ul of water.
With the midi-preps concentrated, the DNA was then transferred to the -20C freezer for storage. The Metal Sensing team wanted to get the digests carried out today but time ran out.
Unfortunately because of time restrictions the Metal Sensing team did not get to carry out the enzyme digests of the midi-prep DNA. Facing this scenario we decided to make the agarose gel today and then store it in the fridge. The restriction enzyme digests of the midi-prep along with analysis through DNA gel electrophoresis will be resumed tomorrow

Unfortunately, in later stages, the trp-lac promoter was unable to be synthesized and our rbc stock died. In part I, Dr. French and the team concluded that an empty vector would serve as a suitable control, and that we should also use WT untransformed bacteria, which should die and bear no results.
Dr. French also urged us to consider the feasibility of large scale applications of our project which is a consideration we made when talking to Dr. Mahajan. Theoretically, commercial companies could set up large vat photobioreactors. However, energy expenditure to maintain all of the cyanobacteria would be high, and the sheer population of the cyanobacteria would cause all sorts of light scattering issues.
He also recommended that we consider tagging our cscB protein to ensure proper expression, transport, and embedding in the cell membrane. Thus, we decided to perform more research on the types of tags that we could potentially use, such as  a poly(His) tag and FLAGtag. We attempted to FLAtag the sps gene, however, sps was too expensive to purchase with the incorporation of a tag. We also considered tagging the cscB gene but we concluded that we would not introduce because the 3D structure of cscB is not well characterized; should either the C or N terminus (or both) be tucked on the inside of cscB, producing a tag at the affected terminus may have drastic consequences on the function of cscB. Lastly, we researched corresponding measurement techniques such as dot blot that could be used with protein tagging.  Thus, meeting with Dr. French helped to fine tune some aspects of our project and provided us with more to consider regarding our experimental setups and development of our gene circuits.  
June 1: Meeting with Mirna Kheir (Laufer Center, Stony Brook University)
Mirna Kheir is a researcher in Gabor Balazsi’s lab and she helped us with designing our constructs for Gibson assembly. More specifically, she showed us how to design overlapping ends between adjacent sequences and recommended an overlap length of at least 30 base pairs. We then applied these principles to all of our genetic constructs. She also gave advice on what procedures to follow with Gibson assembly in the laboratory and recommended what products to order for Gibson assembly.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," on Synthetic biology: “Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical issues in various areas such as health, environment, basic science or new energies.” And also explained about the production of GMO’s:”Researchers modify an organism, like a bacteria’s DNA, to give it new properties such as the ability to produce a medicine (synthesis of insulin), depollute, emit fluorescence or the ability to detect viruses.”
Further, :”GMO: A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMOs are used to produce many medications, genetically modified foods, to produce other goods and are widely used in scientific research.”
We then asked the participant what he thinks about synthetic biology based on what he knows or what he learnt from the definition. 73% of participants had a positive opinion while 6% had a negative opinion. This change can be interpreted in two ways: - Our definition, not very objective, biased the opinion of the participants; - Our definition allowed to associate a meaning to the word ""synthetic biology"" and thus reduced the fear of the unknown experienced by a large proportion of participants.
In order to improve the understanding of synthetic biology of the participant we gave him two examples of synthetic biology applications (two past iGEM projects).
Example 1: An example for the use of synthetic biology is iGEM Paris Bettencourt's 2015 project. They improved an Indian dish by adding vitamins and nutriments produced by living bacteria (originally obtained from the fermented food itself), to help spread those nutriments among Indian people. The bacteria are killed before the meal is consumed.
Example 2: Another application for synthetic biology is the use of genetically modified bacteria to bait and eliminate bee killing parasites.
In conclusion, this large questionnaire, which has received more than 2300 responses worldwide, has allowed us to better understand our subject, air pollution, and how a solution using synthetic biology would be received by the society. While most participants are interested in the potential of synthetic biology, many ask for safety guarantees. We identified a problem of lack of information about indoor air pollution. This questionnaire also confirmed the need for our solution and influenced our application scenario (we chose to act on a local/global scale and to add in our device an application to sensitize and inform the user about his air quality depending on features of his housing).

Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Third choice
1. Cefoperazone
1. Cefquinome
Resistance to one of the first and two of the second choice antibiotics, namely benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin, is caused by the β-lactamase (blaZ) gene (see unfoldable) in SAU and coagulase-Negative Staphilococci (CNS) ( GD Diergezondheid, 2017 ). Therefore, detection of this gene in SAU can directly lead to a more responsible antibiotics treatment plan.
BlaZ
BlaZ produces small-spectrum penicillinases. This means that penicillin based antibiotics, the most common first choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments.
Design Requirements
Besides finding a relevant gene to detect, we developed a number of design requirements (also see our Design and Demonstrate pages) for our device that came out of stakeholder interactions (see our Integrated Human Practices page) and discussions with experts.
Values
Design Requirements
Fast
There is a demand for a detection to not take longer than 8 hours and preferably less than 3 hours, according to stakeholders and according to research less than 8 hours ( Griffioen et al. 2016 )
Simple and user-friendly
Reduce the amount of steps and make them simple. It should be clear for the farmer what the next steps are after finishing the experiment
On-site
Current detection is done in the lab, new detection is only relevant if it can be done in the field. Sample preparation should not be a limiting factor for the on-site detection
Sensitivity
The sample preparation should give a suitable amount of RNA with minimal contamination. For this we would like to refer to our Sample Preparation and Cas13a pages
Limiting costs
The detection method should be cheaper than current detection methods. A test in the lab (antibiogram and cultivation for sensitivity) is around 25 euros

Biotech Camp
Biotech camp is one of our efforts to introduce synthetic biology to the society, especially for high school students. Our team wants to introduce biotechnology which is a new field of knowledge in our region by giving the basic knowledge about biotechnology and what is synthetic biology to the future generation, especially the high school students.
We tried to increase the understanding of the students about synthetic biology by simulates simple experiments such as how to do fermentation and how to extract DNA using simple material like fruits.
To atract them to know more about synthetic biology, we present something fun in this event by playing a game about synthetic biology. The students look very enthusiast in this event, many students asked lots of questions. This event was a fun way for the students to learn more about synthetic biology.
At the end of the event, Sumbawagen team and high school students join in the photo session.

Computation
The sensitivity coefficients are defined by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation,
<math>\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial s(t,q)}{\partial q}=N[\frac{\partial v(t)}{s}\frac{\partial s(t)}{\partial q}+ \frac{\partial v(t)}{\partial q}]</math>

The equation above can be solved numerically for the concentration sensitivities. In performing such a calculation, we must note that the right-hand side depends on the time-varying value of the species concentration vector s(t), so a simple computational strategy is to determine <math>s_{i}(.)</math> and <math>\partial s_{i}(.)/\partial q</math> simultaneously.

It's all about communication! A project only becomes valuable if you are able to communicate your methods and discoveries and pass on your experience to your surroundings.  Thus, communication is an essential part of every great project.
Introduction - What Did We Do?
As we have explained in our outreach strategy , we have chosen to focus on inspiring talented high school students from the very beginning of our project. Our intention has not been to teach the students what to think and mean, but on exciting their curiosity and inspire them to seek information on synthetic biology themselves. Our mantra has been:
You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity he will continue the learning process as long as he lives
- Clay P. Bedford
There are many ways and platforms to reach Danish high school students, and we have constantly competed about their interest with the social media - we chose the following initiatives to reach the students:
We participated in an inspirational documentary on biomimetics targeted to high school students - especially the students already having an interest within biotechnology and ground-breaking research.
We took advantage of the great opportunity of Denmark hosting Euroscience Open Forum 2014. This event is attracting elite students with interest outside the ordinary high school program, and much of the focus is on inspiring these students to learn more about science. We went to ESOF 2014 to spread the word about synthetic biology and it's many exciting opportunities.
As our main product we developed an interactive workshop , targeted towards talented high school students. These youngsters are the scientists of tomorrow and it has been a great experience to work with them.

Competent cells - tested, and they're competent! Good job Gurpal and Sam!
Modeling: Jacob obtained the ARC program. Gurpal wants to create a wetlab flow chart to match the modeling.
Sent DspB (part from last year) to Grinnell College (a new iGEM team this year who requested our part) in the United States.
alpha-pinene synthase
SDM-PCR worked! (Used the QuikChange SDM Kit protocol).
3-carene synthase
Daisy needs to make custom primers for sequencing purposes because the mutagen site is in the middle of the coding sequence and her flanking primers will only sequence 700-800bp into the sequence.
beta-pinene synthase
Resuspended SDM forward and reverse primers
(-)-limonene synthase
Resuspended SDM forward and reverse primers
Tuesday
Training: went over PCR protocol (SDM specific)
beta-pinene & (-)-limonene synthase
Ran SDM-PCR
3-Carene
Daisy did a single digest with EcoRI-HF to test if the EcoRI site is in the synthase or not. Chris Keeling emailed Daisy the sequence he used for the truncation of the 3-Carene synthase. Daisy ordered primers to do the sequencing. However, Alina has not replied to her email to confirm that the primers are ordered.
Wednesday
Training: The plan was to make kanamycin plates, but this was at a stand-still as we had troubles locating the tube of kanamycin sulfate salt.
beta-pinene & (-)-limonene synthase
Verified yesterday's SDM-PCR products through gel electrophoresis. No bands were present in any of the lanes.
Troubleshooting: The dNTP could have been too old/contaminated (we had troubles with this particular tube of dNTP from last year); the concentrations for the reagents used were not optimized - Marianne researched protocols and optimized the SDM-PCR protocol. We (Vicki and Marianne) will test it tomorrow.

Sunday 20/7
As we were not successful in transforming the samples from Saturday 19/7 a new batch was initiated. So PCR1, 2, and 3 and furthermore B and BC were digested, ligated, and transformed.
In accordance with our decision to make the nutrient producing strain taste good transformations of parts; I742111 (RBS+limonene synthase), K118024 (dsx+LIMS1+appY), J23119 (constitutive promoter), and B0015 (double terminator) was commenced. These are going to constitute the construct for producing lemon taste and scent.
Week 30 (21/7 - 27/7)
Monday 21/7
Colony PCR was made on the transformations from yesterday. We concluded that the transformation not have been successful. Therefore we went back and made new digestions.
ON cultures containing J23119, I742111, K118024, Lac promoter and pSB1AT3 were made.
Tuesday 22/7
Minipreps were made on the ON cultures from yesterday.
The digested products from yesterday were ligated and transformed.
Wednesday 23/7
Today we ran colony PCR on the transformations from yesterday. A single colony plate streaking was made for each colony that was used for Colony PCR.
J23119 and K118024 were ligated and J23119 and I742111 were ligated.

Education and Public Engagement
This year our main goal has been to show the power of synthetic biology via the snake envenoming issue.
The Danish legislation is tough on synthetic biology, and it is not possible for high school students to make their own plasmid modifications (see regulations ). We have, together with the Danish organization Biotech Academy’s Biosensor project, made a free kit that will be distributed to high schools. This kit enables an average high school student to work with synthetic biology at his or her own school - while still taking the law into consideration.
Spreading the word of synthetic biology to the general public has also been at the core of our work. The importance and the solutions it offers, have been spread via presentations, fairs, articles, social media campaigns, but mainly through a documentary. A journalist is filming a documentary about our project, team, and the opportunities of synthetic biology.
Education
Whatever the challenge, it is important to spread passion to the researchers of tomorrow. Unfortunately synthetic biology is barely introduced in Denmark at the high school level. Nothing is quite like your first passion, and thus it is not a stretch to imagine that someone’s life can be completely changed by introducing students to synthetic biology at an earlier age. This is why we have decided to focus as much as we have on the Biosensor project, and education in general.
Biosensor
The Biosensor project is an effort to expose Danish high school students to the world of experimental synthetic biology. The Biosensor kit makes it possible for high school students to work with biobricks. As stated earlier, certain laws prohibit high school students to work with plasmid modifications.
The Biosensor project was created by DTU’s iGEM teams from 2015 and 2016 , Biotech Academy, and further developed by the BioBuilders’ 2017 team. We are preparing to ship out the kits to 200 high schools in Denmark by Spring 2018.
The Exercise
The Biosensor is structured to give students creative freedom in the field of synthetic biology, while being simple. The entire exercise can be completed in just two days of laboratory work and testing. The exercise involves the following:
1. Digestion of selected genes (2 hours)
2. Ligation of genes and linearized vector to make a Biobrick plasmid (1.5 hours)
3. Transformation of Biosensor (3 hours)
4. Test of Biosensors (1 hour)

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Conference_-_-_TEXT.html," The format is that every group should put forward their creative idea and primary plan. Afterwards, some best students will be selected according to their academic performance.
In the aspect of team training, we assume that the practical training should be very important for us to improve the practice of Molecular Biology. The detailed steps are listed below:
The best students will be re-arranged into a variety of groups. In the first round, every group will learn the theory of experiments about Molecular Biology. After the first round, every group will exchange the learning and training with any other group round by round.
In the second round, the students will be asked to practice a certain experiment and observe the results, which will enable them to fully know if they are good at the experiments.
In the third round, the official team members will choose the most creative final project which also embrace the strongest executive ability. After that, they will do the brainstorming for the package and fulfill the design of experiment. In the end, they will invite the professors to vote and decide whether the projects can be executed.
The more important is the Corporatization (team management idea) from the professor Chen Wenliang, which is of a great creativity. He considers iGEM team as a corporation. For example, the Experiment Group plays a role as the Research and Development Department and offer the technical backup for ideas, while the Human Practice Group work as the Marketing Department. They communicate with the stakeholders about our own project. During the promotion and communication, they can strengthen the cooperation with colleagues in the industry and social communities. Also, they can accumulate adequate and diversified feedbacks so that the Experiment Group can polish our products.
In a word, a well-developed system of talent education is the key to a great team and project. Firstly, the course will offer students the opportunity to learn. Secondly, the standard of performance evaluation will show the academic qualities of team members as objectively as possible. Additionally, the round-by-round experiment training will improve efficiency. What’s more, the team will improve the management by putting Corporatization into practice and lay a solid foundation for the project.
