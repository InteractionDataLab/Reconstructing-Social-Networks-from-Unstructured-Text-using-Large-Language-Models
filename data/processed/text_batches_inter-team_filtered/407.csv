Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," serine protease with not entirely clear specificity [10] . However, Esp is usually secreted by S.epidermidis colonising the skin and mucous membranes of many healthy humans and to our knowledge has not been documented as causing any kind of ill effect [11] . Thorough safety testing would of course be needed if SMITe was ever going to be used in the clinics and, similarly to Nuc, attachment only to limited parts of the wound dressing could be considered.
A futuristic imagining!
These concerns feed into a conceptual image for the future of SMITe, when chronic wounds could be mapped and their individual biofilms characterised through imaging, for example through confocal microscopy. If it were ever possible to achieve this we imagined SMITe as a product which could then be designed to reflect the structure of individual wounds themselves; targeting thicker and thinner areas of the biofilm with specifically distributed proteins, and areas where colonisation or infection was most dominated by certain microorganisms with appropriate dispersal agents. This would be a entirely new avenue in personalised medicine products and is one way this field could spread across disciplines and give a whole new meaning to getting a dressing which “fits"".
Release and Dispersal of Bacteria
If the presence of bacterial biofilm is a barrier to healing, then it follows that dispersal and degradation of the biofilm structure would facilitate wound healing. The two most important remaining questions in this case would be: what happens to the remnants of the biofilm once degraded (and the SMITe, if it breaks down) and also, whether the release of dormant bacteria residing within the biofilm generates bacteremia in the patient? Is the approach we have chosen worth the risks of further spreading the infection?
Considering the latter, there is a theoretical possibility that once released from the chronic wound via the biofilm being degraded, bacteria become susceptible to antibiotic treatments which were previously ineffective as the drugs were formerly unable to penetrate the biofilm structure.  Another possibility is that once the biofilm has been degraded and the human immune system encounters the ‘debris’ in the bloodstream, an immune response would be initiated which is able to eradicate the infected or colonised tissue altogether. This would avoid applying SMITe alongside ‘antibiotic cover’, which would be the ideal situation from the point of view of reducing antibiotic resistance. In any case, patients would need to be carefully monitored to detect indications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and consequent sepsis until progress in wound healing was apparent.
In accordance with many aspects of our project, meticulously monitored clinical trials would be essential in establishing the safety of SMITe"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," is that the BsaI overhangs are now in the inteins.
Software:
Setting up a chart for the coverage of each project.We discussed the modularity of the linkers, first ideas for the library were exchanged, we decided not to submit a library for all possible linkers to the iGEM community, because it wouldn't help the other teams and would make lots of work for us. But we wanted to submit a smaller library, that can be used in 80% of the cases. A refined linker for DNMT1 was given to the DNMT1 group.
Wet lab:
Our plan was to assemble our new circularization construct, 2Zv2Npu in one step by CPEC cloning. We planned to use three inserts, NpuC, mrfp selection marker and NpuN, which will be assembled into one of our pSBX vectors. Most of the necessary primers were already available from the assembly constucts. Only two new primers had to be designed and ordered. Additionally, we also created primers for a CPEC to get linear lambda-lysozyme and GFP into and expression vector as biobricks.
Software:
In this week some bugs in the function that sorts points out, if the linkers pass through the protein were eliminated. The weighting of different angles was also included in the weighting function.
Wet lab:
This week's aim was to get our circularization construct (2Zv2Npu) and linear lambda-lysozyme (LambdaLys(lin)) in an expression vector via CPEC. Inserts and backbones with overhangs were created via PCR. Since the assembly via CPEC failed, we repeated those PCRs and conducted a lot of CPECs again. The CPECs continued failing. An attempt to use PCA to assemble the 3 inserts of 2Zv2Npu followed by CPEC to clone the PCA product into the backbone failed. Using a new protocol and a different backbone, the CPEC of pSBX-LambdaLys(lin) finally worked. We designed new primers for a PCA that could be used to clone the PCA product into the backbone via biobrick-cloning.
Software:
This week was mainly literature work and discussion about the screening for the calibration of the software. We set up the plan to divide the screen ing into two parts: The in silico screening for the different linkerpatterns done on the iGEM@home system and the in vivo screening for the calibration of the weighting function. In this week we also elaborated the"

Overview
We put a lot of hard work into our project. Here is a weekly summary of what we accomplished in our research over summer. Our full team of 13 students, including one high school students and one undergraduate from another university, worked throughput the summer, while a smaller group of 6 students continued beyond August as UROPs.
Summary of Week 1: June 6 - June 11
In the first week we began constructing basic reporter DNA constructs that have various combinations of promoters and genes. The mix-and-matching of promoters and genes was done using the LR reaction following the Gateway protocol. Our promoters included TRE, minCMV, Hef1a, Hefl1a-LacO, and our genes included eYFP, mKate, and eBFP2. Transformed and inoculated colonies from the LR reactions and performed restriction digests. Approximately half of the LR reactions were successful and became DNA parts that we could use later on.

Question: 1,The function of our report system is largely limited by the instabilit y of biolog y organisms . The differences between each E.coli colonies lead to the totall y different appearance after the test. Can you provide us with some hints that can improve the robustness of our report system?
2,In the C’ sequence of our TALE protein , there is a Pst1 recognition site which makes it hard to assembl y with othe r iGEM stan dard pa rts. We hope we can change it with the degenerac y of the codons. Howe ver, it is a time-consuming wo rk if we do this by mutation PCR. So is there any better idea to change the endonuclease recognition site?
These two weeks, our work focused on the wet lab work. We assembled our wild TALE sequence with the Golden Gate assembly methods. Though the wild TALE protein coding sequence is more than 2000bp in length which is relative hard to assembly, we conquered this task. At"

NG, specific to thymine, and HD, specific to cytosine, are strong RVDs. NN binds both guanine and adenine, but it prefers guanine. NK also interacts with guanine, but with 103-fold lower affinity. NI is specific for adenine, but it has low affinity when compared to strong RVDs such as NG and HD (Meckler et al., 2013). Although less common, another naturally occurring RVD, NH, was described to bind strongly to guanine (Cong et al., 2013). NS binds to any of the four bases and it is present in naturally occurring TALEs such as AvrBs3 from Xanthomonas campestris (Boch et al., 2009).
In addition to RVDs, the DNA binding affinity is also subject to polarity effects. Point mutations at the 5’ end of the target sequence affect TALE-DNA recognition more than the ones at the 3’ end (Meckler et al., 2013). Taking this in consideration, recommendations for TALE design include incorporation of strong RVDs close to the N-terminus (Streubel et al., 2012).
Due to the modular and easy to engineer nature of TALEs they can be designed to bind virtually any DNA sequence, making them a powerful tool in synthetic biology. They have been extensively used for genome editing in the literature (Mussolino et al, 2011) by fusing DNA cleavage domains of endonucleases to serve as custom restriction enzymes (Beurdeley et al., 2013). These engineered proteins are termed TALENs or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases. TALENs are also used in gene knockout because they promote gene disruption (Bogdanove & Voytas, 2011). Slovenia 2012 iGEM team designed and created repressor TAL effectors by adding repressor and activator domains to TALEs to control gene expression.
Our team, however, proposes an innovative application for TAL effectors: Using TALE as a nucleotide biosensor. We engineered TALEs to detect entero-haemorrhagic bacteria in feces of BBa_K782004 in cattle populations. As sensors, TALEs can"

We redid the electroporation today so that hopefully by next wednesday all three strains should be ready and we should have plates. We'll be testing to see if TT9901, TT9907, and TT25281 with Lambda's CRO gene cloned into them can induce the integrated prophage out of lysogeny and into the lytic cycle.

Rediscovering iGEM in the Context of Runic Alphabets
Li Fuyao, College of Economics and Management, HZAU
1. Motivation
Symbols compose of our ideological world. Some are necessities of our daily life, such as characters---symbols of meaning, bills---symbols of money, musical notes---symbols of sound, [1]etc. Symbols are what we give them meaning to, but many things can also be given new meaning back if put into the context of a certain symbol system.
The Elder Futhark is the oldest form of runic language in the Nordic area, it is both a lost language and a mature symbol system with 24 characters. [2]Archaeologists of Scandinavia would be familiar with them, for ancient Norse wrote their tablets and stones under this symbol system. [3]After the second world war, few spoke of runes in the western world for their link to the Nazis' abusive use of them to design their infamous logo. [4]Nowadays, among the more serious study of this language is the Futhark journal, which is dedicated to the study of runic symbols, glyph, linguistic and archaeology;[5] however, with the ""New Age"" movement,[6] runes has been somewhat revived and become a pop culture among a certain group of westerners, its meanings are no longer a privilege, though much of what they preach still lack sufficient support from the scientific side, and only immeasurable empirical evidence exist. Sadly no one speaks of it in serious places today, so this part is attached to our"

Hi dudes,
I’m Gaël and I’m still a student at the INSA of Lyon while all my mates are going to be graduated in the last few month but without me because I had decided to take a gap year before my last year of studies, which allowed me to take fully part at the iGEM championship in 2010.
Then after 6 months in Australia and 3 in Spain, I’m back to the lab (again yo!!), giving my best to allow the team to go confident in Amsterdam where I hope I will meet again people I met last year. See yaaaaaaaaaaa!!

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"2007). As such, when dealing with single droplets of reagents, as is always the case in a digital microfluidic setting, digital microfluidic technologies are therefore able to achieve results faster than is otherwise possible. Alongside the innate benefits derived from the physics of using single droplets as described above, the much greater degree of automation conferred from use of a digital microfluidics system is also significant in speeding up laboratory processes. Even when introducing sensing systems and feedback control a very high degree of precision in the generation of droplet volumes (Liu, Banerjee and Papautsky, 2014) and also the control of mixing processes (Gong and Kim, 2008) is attainable. Combining this with the ability to then parallelise multiple versions of the same functions on the same chip all at one time, providing simultaneous output of multiple reactions, allows for a vast decrease in the time-scale required for comparatively larger amounts of reagents in reactions. This provides a very valid use case for the automation of modular variants in our project. When creating the programs both for the system to operate from and to simulate the system, an agent-based approach to modelling was used. An agent-based system is one in which each entity in the system is considered its own unique “agent”, where each agent of the same type holds the same properties but each with their own values. An agent-based system assesses the effects on the system as a whole by observing each individual agent and monitoring their own actions and their interactions with other agents (Macal and North, 2010). In a synthetic biology context, agent based models have been used to model the discrete elements of different systems and are able to capture even some of the most minor differences between agents inside the system. (Gorochowski, 2016).
Simulator Software
The goal of this section of the project is to create a piece of scalable real-time software capable of simulating the full functionality of our EWOD microfluidic device. It should additionally be able to schedule its own microfluidic operation sets to simulate. This program will then allow for a controller on the hardware device to enact the given schedule, whereby a set of operations can be carried out on the chip. These operations can be customised according to the individual capabilities of the version of hardware being used. This therefore has extended capabilities configurable to the breadth of operations of the device being simulated, including more complex operations in the field of digital microfluidics such as mixing and extensibility for zones capable of manipulating temperature. The software provides a separate but fundamentally similar interface alongside that which the"

My major is biochemical engineering and the field of my research is                                                 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology,                                                 so iGEM is a rare chance for me to use my major strength to solve practical problems.
After year-long preparation, I have been head over                                                 heels in love with our program and harvested a lot. I really appreciate iGEM.

My name is Beijia Han, I’m a master student in School of Life Science,                                                 Beijing Institute of Technology. My major is Biology and my research is                                                 focus on enzyme modification. Luckily, I join in the 2016 iGEM competition as                                                 an adviser in BIT-China, and there is a four-year history of our                                                 team (BIT-China) representing our school to attend this prestigious                                                 competition to show our research projects. This year our team project                                                 is mainly about population quality control. As an adviser, my mission                                                 is to help the undergraduate students to solve the problems in this                                                 research and give proper suggestions. It is a challenging task,                                                 but I love this feeling that we fight together.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescens, Pf-5 has genes that can cleave aliphatic rings, however, first we have to determine if Pf-5 can grow in the presence of butylcyclohexane.  To do so we carried out an assay, using LB, testing the toxicity of butylcyclohexane on Pf-5.   After 24 hours of incubation we took OD600 readings¬ which suggested that the presence of butylcyclohexane did not have effect on cell growth.  We also looked up Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 in the Pseudomonas Genome Database and found genes that code for proteins with similar functions to what we have found for aromatic and aliphatic ring cleavage.

UCAS for BIT-China:
Our project’s signal transition mainly based on the GPCR pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to tune the system more sensitivly, we decided to optimize the promoter Pfus which is the inducible promoter of detection circuit (Pfus-mRFP-CYC1t). Team UCAS helped us to test the expression of mRFP promoted by different Pfus mutation, through the host strain fluorescence test, they helped us obtain the corresponding data. here is the link to their wiki .
BIT-China for UCAS:
In the 19th session of National Congress of the CPC, because of the limitation of the methanol(AR) procurement，the students of UCAS are in desperate need of methanol(AR) to detect their production，we help them complete their experiment by supplying them methanol(AR).

Secretion Guide
Alternative strategies for protein secretion in E.coli:
N terminal secretion-signal peptides are recognised by the sec pathway. The pathway transports proteins to the periplasm and additional mechanisms are usually required to further export the protein to the extracellular space. An approach for using this pathway is the addition of an N terminal signal peptide to the target protein which can obtain as high as 90% efficiency in secretion to the extracellular space. Such signals are pelB and phoA tags which are available as biobricks. PelB can be cleaved off by pelB peptidase in the periplasm whereas phoA will anchor your protein to this localisation.
Fusion partners are endogenous proteins that are naturally secreted in E.coli and can be fused to the target protein. Some such proteins were demonstrated to be a powerful carriers of medically relevant human proteins in E.coli.  The yebF and ompF proteins exit the cell via the sec pathway and use additional mechanisms for leaving the periplasm, where they interact with outer-membrane porins for extracellular secretion. The osmY is available as a Biobrick and we have submitted ompF this year.
The porin proteins such as ompF and ompA, can be used as fusion partners too and anchor proteins to the outer surface of E.coli.
ABC transporters use ATP for transport of specific proteins across the bacterial membrane.  The ABC transporter of Erwinia chrysanthemi can be expressed in E.coli and export proteins that contain the LARD1 domain as a C terminal fusion. The system is biobricked in two separate plasmids (transporter"

We added header file functionality and integrated Eugene into Spectacles, which now has a code editor, as well. We brought the finished project, which is still a little buggy, to Stanford to show Drew, Cesar, and Akshay on Friday. Drew shared with us his vision of abstraction barriers between sequences, parts, and devices. He explained that tools simply do not exist that help refine sequences and particate them. Though Eugene and Spectacles provide the ability to move downward from the part level to the sequence level, until tools are developed to move upward, the problem is only half solved. We decided to adopt the rapid application development paradigm with our future efforts, and try to release working pieces as we finish them. Next week we will begin developing XML translators to move between our data model and Cesar's XML schema.

SAFETY
Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our                     previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the                     experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
PROJECT DESIGN SAFETY
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. The core                         of our project is to accumulate intracellular ROS by overexpressing the endogenous ndi1 gene of                         Saccharomyces cerevisiae. And in order to improve yeast survival, we use a feedback system to                         maintain intracellular ROS at an appropriate level. The entire project is harmless to the human body. During the implementation of the project, we selected the roGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein as a                         reporter gene, which can be directly detected without adding any harmful reagents.
LAB SAFETY
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli                         strain DH5α, BL21, Top 10 and S.c strain CEN.PK2-1C are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory                         we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pRS42K, pESC-Ura,                         pESC-Trp, pESC-His, pESC-Leu, pSB1C3) are not harmful for humans.
See more in Notebook                             /Equipment & Material .
Because of the nature of our project, contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to                         avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance                         with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the                         following examples:
(1) Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
(2) Don’t deal with the wastes at will.

Evry Paris-Saclay : Golden Gate Assembly for HMWP2
We had problems from the very beginning with restricting/ligating and transforming one of our main genes. Namely HMWP2, this gene encodes for a fairly big synthetase that catalyzes the first part of yersiniabactin, which is identical to N-Pch, therefore we wanted to utilize the catalytic functions of HMWP2 to synthesize our main target.
However, since it is a fairly big protein with 6.5 kb encoding for it, we could not order it as a single DNA part from IDT, instead we had to break it up in 3 parts, inexperienced as we were we thought well, let’s split it up in three parts, as the maximum size we could order was 3 kb. This approach implied, that we would need to include restriction sites for single cutting enzymes, which we did, XmaI and MaubI where the enzymes of choice and we tried to ligate and transform all three parts into psB1C3.
As it turned out it is quite hard to achieve a ligation that complicated, still we tried our approach for several weeks, fueled by some false positive results we thought well we might make it. In the end though we gave up and admitted that we would need some help to finish our most important BioBrick.
So, we reached out to our fellow iGEM teams first we had a discussion with Heidelberg, which proposed to use the Golden Gate method as well as Evry did later then. The collaboration with Evry sprung from a personal conversation between our team leader Shanti and Evry’s head of human practices Yanis, who established the contact with their head of science Jérémy.
Jérémy showed us how to design a golden gate assembly, while also providing us an entire protocol to ensure our ligation step, with the planned assembly a transformation is almost guaranteed to work, however the correct order of the fragments is not therefore a relatively extensive screening process is needed to find the colonies that carry the designed fragment.                  Additionally, we had ongoing support by Jérémy to fix"

Field investigation
(1) Visit organic farmers
We had two interviews with organic farmers . The first interviewees were the owner of three organic farms, and the crops include gourds, fruits, mushroom, cereal grain and leafy vegetables. We investigate the source of water and the used degree of fertilizer of their farms. The result shows that the farms locate on high terrain or higher altitude than the factories. Plus, the irrigating water won’t flow out to another area, and the fertilizer they use is farming residue. As a result, there is no doubt of pollution.
After changing the direction of our project, we had another interview which focuses on the management of organic agriculture. We tried to figure out what predicament the farmers face and whether the statistics reflect the fact or not. And the result seems favorable to our project for the reason that the certification of organic agriculture needs at least three years and cost ＄5000 per year. Such threshold is unfriendly to normal farmers and inefficient. Since there are many bottlenecks in the process of organic agriculture, nearly no profit can be earned from it. First of all, there are many uncontrolled plant diseases and insect pests and natural disasters. Moreover, these agricultural products are not improved Breeds. They not only have low yield but also have bad appearances. Furthermore, labor costs are really high, so they are much more expensive than normal agricultural products. There are too many drawbacks that violate the principle of market competition, and it’s difficult to apply. In consequence, it’s tough to attract farmers to join the ranks of organic agriculture. According to farmers’ dictation, the reason why they want to transform is that the idea, interest, and stable economic ability.

[ Figure. 3.1-2 ] Visit A-Hsiung and A-Pu organic mushroom stand. Mushroom cultivation is a quality agriculture that every single drop of water matters. They need an extraordinary fine water monitor system, which is where we can cooperate with!

As long as your product has no impact on health, she sees no inconvenience in advising the vine growers to use this solution on their vineyards. She also give us some advice on our product. If our solution are working on the vine it will be necessary to irrigate the vineyard in addition because the soil will be dry too and it will be not enough to have only our solution.
The 5th of September we were invited by Agrauxine the business unit of the group LESAFRE PLANT CARE. They are specialise in the development of products from microorganisms for crop protection. We had the opportunity to met with Mrs. PROFIZI CAMILLE (R&D director), Mr. RONAN KEMPF (Marketing and Development director) and Mrs.GARRIGUES CHRISTELLE (R&D representative from Lesaffre in Angers). We presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get pieces of advice to improve our presentation. They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project to others companies in the same field, what we should delve deeper such as the safety and applied design part about our project and what we should conceal or place in the middle of the presentation to avoid troubles especially in France such as the term GMO and direct contact with the environment. Unfortunately they weren’t able to finance the project due to the company image in France but in exchange they put us in contact with several experts in the French Agriculture regulation like the ANSES and the contact of someone in the United States GMO regulation. It was a very pleasant experience, to talk to professionals in the plant care, have their opinion about SofterShock and share scientific knowledge. We certainly developed our professional communication skills!

Stochastic model giving insight on parameters
Tuesday, October 4th
We modeled the XOR module with a stochastic model, as the sites are discrete and not continuous and thus binding events might be sensitive to stochasticity. In this process, we figured out that the concentration of GFP was rapidly increasing due to fast flipping rates. It is very unlikely in biological systems. Thus, this model helped us debug an estimated paramter
GFP and LuxI produced when the system is ON.
Both inputs are present. There is an immediate GFP response, followed by degradation.

Week 18 : Decisive meeting
Monday, September 22th
This meeting was a turning point of our iGEM adventure. We reviewed all the experiments that had been done so far. Most of them concerns quorum sensing and its non-orthogonality. We summed up the results in a three-layer graphs.
The dry lab part presented for the first time a whole-cell model. With the parameters estimated, the model actually implemented an XOR gate. However, leakiness of promoters and crosstalk seemed to be affecting the robustness of our design.
As all our experiments were done in our plasmids, we have to standardize them into the Biobrick format. This year, the deadline corresponds to the delivery in Boston of the biobricks. Thus, it is becoming slowly urgent...

Abstract
This is the first week that we started our team work. We hold a meeting to allocate everyone’s work. We are divided into 3 groups. The first group is focused on reading paper to learn what is terminator. The second group is responsible for software. The third group should build a web page for our software. None of us is specialist for computer language or biology, so our work is hard.
Week 1
7.15.2012-7.21.2012
7.15.2012
Paper Group：
1. We read some paper, focused on studying two of them.
2. We tried to find paper on terminator efficiency, but we didn’t make much progress.
Software Group:
We wrote a small program with C++. It can return LH and nt when input stem loop and T tail sequence. If delta G is known, it will give d score automatically.
Web Group:
1. We prepared the first draft wiki and decided to improve it later when we have more experience on web design.
2. We borrowed a couple of books about C# and web design from the library.
7.16.2012
Paper Group:
1. We created a table of terminator efficiency including fields of name, description, sequence, stem, loop, tail and efficiency.
2. We searched web of knowledge and google scholar for transcription terminator paper.
3. We emailed authors of those paper to clear out confution and ask questions about T.E.
Software Group:
We learned some basic knowledge of C#, wrote a program to calculate d score and nt. But users have to type in the free energy. Web group:
1. We learned how to build a simple web page.
2. We spent the whole night in solving a simple but strange problem. Fortunately we conquered it.
7.17.2012
Paper Group:
1. We found some information on terminator and some specific terminators, learned the progress of writing our RNA fold program"

Colony PCR
Back to protocols .
This step takes place after having transformed cells with Gibson-assembled plasmids and having grown them overnight on a plate. It is quicker to check the plasmids at this stage rather than waiting for a miniprep.
Recover the colonies:
Choose a few colonies that you want to analyze
Prepare PCR tubes with 50 ul water
For each colony, take it with a tip, then plate it on a new agar plate (just make a dot). You can use one plate for all the colonies tested.
Put the tip in a PCR tube and mix.
Boil the tubes at 95°C for 10min (use the ""BOIL"" file)
It is important to place the colonies on a new plate, because if the PCR gives good results we need the corresponding cells!
Prepare the PCR: protocol adapted for HiFi PLUS enzyme, for 50 ul final volume
reaction buffer 5x (with MgCl2): 10 ul
dNTPs 10mM: 1 ul
each primer (20 uM): 1 ul (nneds to be 0.4 uM in final volume)
template DNA (boiled samples): 1ul
HiFi PLUS (5 U/ul): 0.5 ul
ddH20: 35.5 ul (check to have 50ul total)
For J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid (control to see if colony PCR is working):
use J6-Ptet_RFP-f and J6-Ptet_RFP-r, use the ""VINCECOL"" file
For reporter plasmid:
use J6Ptet-LacI-RFPf and J6Ptet-LacI-RFPr
For lysis plasmid:
use J6Ptet-LacI-RFPf and J6Ptet-LacI-Lysr

    We extract part of this complete model and adapt it to our experiment results so that we can know how to design our experiment.
Concretely, we use our model to help us do things below:
(1)Design warriors that can be killed only by the warrior from the other group. See more at Improved gene circuit .
(2)Design an easy way to regulate killing ability of warriors. See more at Regulation of killing abilities .
    What is more, we use this model to design a game---Fluid E.coli War to help us consider effects of some factors (Like initial number of each populations) on population interactions and make the public more interested in synthetic biology. (See more at Fluid E.coli War )

Approach
Cellulose to Cellobiose
In the endeavour to engineer E. coli to utilise cellulose as its only carbon source, inspiration was drawn from the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team project, who developed two BioBricks containing the cenA and cex genes. In this project, the α-hemolysin transport system was utilised by creating HlyA-tagged endo- and exo-β-1,4-glucanases, using a peptide linker. To implement this system in E. coli, heterogeneous expression of hlyB, hlyD, cenA-hlyA and cex-hlyA was required.
To achieve  this, DNA synthesis of cenA and cex was ordered, each tagged with HlyA. The genes encoding HlyB and HlyD were retrieved from the part BBa_K1166002 by phusion PCR. Using the resulting PCR product, the following construct was composed for the degradation of cellulose into cellobiose, as illustrated in Figure 10.
Figure 10. BioBrick , containing the genes cenA, cex, hlyB, and hlyD controlled by PenI-regulated promoters.
Cellobiose to Glucose
The Edinburgh 2011 iGEM team created a BioBrick with the bglX gene, which is endogenous to E. coli, in the endeavour to increase the efficiency of the degradation of cellobiose to glucose. However, it seems that the enzymatic activity of the periplasmic β-glucosidase has faded as a result of evolution, rendering E. coli incapable of surviving solely on cellobiose. Thus, even though E. coli can absorp cellobiose, it is not able to survive with this as its only carbon source.
As a solution to this, a part containing the cep94A gene was synthesised, with the intend to enable E. coli to survive solely on cellobiose. Thus, a construct containing cep94A controlled by a LacI-regulated promoter was composed, as illustrated in Figure 11.
Figure 11. BioBrick comprising cep94A controlled by a LacI-regulated promoter. This part was cloned into both a high and low copy vector.

He said we should also think about what the government is trying to do. By and large the university is funded by government money. This is seen as an investment in the future. This investment demands some sort of return. This means making new products, and generating new income, though it doesn't matter whether it happens because academics spin out new companies, or because existing companies tap into academic research.
He said we should be careful before we think about ""commerce"" as a dirty word. He said there was a place for blue skies research, because it does end up being useful.
Attitudes among academics vary widely, and some are very keen to seek industrial collaboration. There is a strong push to do so from research councils and central government. The university gets more funding from the government on the basis of demonstrable interaction with commercial enterprises. This is called the Research Excellence Framework .

Patrick Harvie MSP; Scottish Green Party
The Scottish Green Party has 2 seats in the Scottish Parliament (out of 129 total). Its policies are focused on the environment and social justice.
Patrick Harvie is a Member of the Scottish Parliament (an MSP) for the Glasgow region, and co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party. He has been part of the parliament's Science and Technology Cross-Party Group. He was interviewed in person by team members Yassen Abbas and Allan Crossman.
Yassen asked Patrick about his role as co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party.
Patrick said the first part of his job, as MSP, is to represent the Glasgow people and argue for the manifesto commitments of the Green Party in the last election. As co-convenor of the Green Party he convenes the party's national council and helps develop the direction and policy of the party, though he stressed that this process involves many other people. He is also a member of the parliament's Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee.
Yassen asked about the Science and Technology Cross-Party Group.
The group was set up in the last parliamentary session. Cross-party groups have to be reestablished every session, so he didn't know yet whether the group would continue. But if enough members come together (on a cross-party basis) to set it up, Patrick said he would like to be part of it again.
Yassen asked what the term ""synthetic biology"" brings to mind"

According to the Dalton’s law and the Raoult’s law we can get: [4]

Fig.5 The dependence of the total vapor pressure of an ideal solution on the mole fraction of diacetyl in the entire system. pA* is the vapor pressure of the diacetyl which is 6.9kPa at 20℃ and the pB* is the vapor pressure of the water which is 2.3kPa at 20℃.
For diacetyl:
In Layer1, xA is the mole fraction of diacetyl in liquid mixture:  the concentration in liquid Cliquid =100uM is the mole fraction in liquid xA =1.8*10-5, so the mole fraction in gas yA =5.4*10-5 is theconcentration in gas Cgas = 300uM
In Layer2, the xA is the mole fraction of diacetyl in liquid mixture: the concentration in liquid  Cgas = 1uM (A suitable concentration of diacetyl which can be sensed by the worms [5] ) is the mole fraction in liquid xA =1.8*10-7, so the mole fraction in gas yA =5.4*10-7 is the concentration in gas Cgas = 3uM .
According to the equation we can get that the erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})=1-\frac{C_x}{C_s}=0.99
and then referred to the Table 1 we can get that the \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}=1.8

Conclusion
According to the two situations of the Delaying Time:
The time for complete diffusive mixing of diacetyl: tc = 3.3s.
The time for diacetyl diffusion through PDMS layer: td = 0.1s.
Compared to the time used to form the concentration gradient in Layer1, this time is negligible. Thus, about 3.4s after we add the chemicals, we can start to count the number of the worms about their response to chemicals.
For 2-nonanone, similarly, the total time cost is 3.1s.

SG IGEM MEETUP
On 11 June 2018, all three Singaporean iGEM teams met up at the National University of Singapore, for the first ever Singapore iGEM meet!
iGEM participants mingling over everyone’s favourite food - pizza!
The goal of our inaugural meet-up was to provide an opportunity for all Singaporean iGEM participants to get to know each other, network, and spark fruitful discussion on potential collaborations. This meeting was the first official platform for all three teams (NUS_Singapore-Sci, NUS_Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore) to share with each other our respective team projects, and discuss possible avenues for collaboration. Hearteningly, members from all three teams felt the meet-up was fruitful, and we made many exciting plans for collaborations!
Deep in thought during our meeting
No meeting is complete without food! All of us had a great time socialising and discussing our iGEM experience over a pizza party! The meetup was indeed a great opportunity to get to know members from other teams, and even our own team members better, and perhaps more importantly, many memories were made that night!

This would almost give the impression that there was a divide between the social scientists and the natural scientists, which is not entirely true. As social scientists however, you can only hover around the team and make observations while they have to focus on their own specific task. But in the end, most efforts were able to conjoin on the #UncolourMeCurious campaign that turned out to be successful.
In any case, the interdisciplinarity creates a platform for potential synergetic action. And it is this that makes possible a non-linear way of knowledge production or Mode 2 knowledge production in relation to the governance of an emerging technology, which corresponds to a form of environmental governance that finds a common ground on the importance of sustainable action (Balmer and Bulpin 2013). Mode 2 knowledge production is inherently transdisciplinary and differs from Mode 1 by the fact that it focusses on the social robustness of science, meaning that social needs and values are taken into account. The focal point here lies on problem-solving and hence addressing problems by incorporating a heterogeneous set of knowledge producers besides maintaining scientific quality. The values portrayed by Randy Rettberg are compatible with the qualities of this Mode 2 science in contrast to the linear Mode 1, as compared by Matthias Gross (2010).

Furthermore, what is often attributed to synthetic biology and iGEM is the importance of playfulness. This can be interpreted as an adaptation of the experimental nature of Mode 2 knowledge production as a way to explore whilst being in the midst of uncertainty. According to Gross (2010), reflexive modernisation in the risk society is very much related to this notion of experiment in Mode 2 science. The experimental approach, however, cannot be based solely on the way it is perceived by the natural sciences. Beck argues that it is now the turn of the social sciences to design experiments outside the laboratory. Therefore, the concept of the experimental knowledge society is used where the boundaries between science and society are increasingly"

Initial draft of the schematic was prepared and sent to Cesar and the rest of the team for review. It was concluded that the schematic is currently not effective at showing the repression/expression of the reporter protein and does not show the interaction between the repressor gene and the reporter.  Through exploration of different designs, arrangements and symbols we hope to be able to show our complicated system in a manner that can be understood by many different perspectives.  Additionally we have begun cost analysis of our device.  It is important to recognize that development costs will be much larger than the final cost of a device we are planning on producing.  We are hoping to receive a cost breakdown of the specific costs of each material within our device, however for the time being we have calculated the dimensions of the various parts.  Bulk prices of materials such as Teflon were searched with the goal of being able to estimate the cost of mass production.
Week 21: September 22nd  - September 26th
This week we brainstormed a way to show the interaction between the repressor gene and the reporter gene. A new version of the schematic was prepared and discussed with Cesar and the rest of the team. Overall, the schematic is improving and is very effective on communicating information, but there still are details that need to be changed to make the schematic as clear as possible.  Additionally we have been working to render new images of our device with three chambers (aligned at 120 degrees) radially and symmetrically.  This consists of both a positive and negative control and a disease test for proof of concept.  This design can be altered or changed for as many detection wells needed depending on the task of the device and the resources available to build it.  The amount of chambers can be adjusted as along as they are symmetrical with the PCR chamber as demonstrated by fluid flow analysis on Solid Works.
Week 22: September 29th  - October 3rd
This week we continued uploading our work to the wiki. We also set up a vote to choose a team member to do a voice over for our animation so that this visual process can be narrated with the necessary background information and description of the process occurring. This week we also continued working on the design of a schematic to show the basic process of our system and how it operates.  Additionally with our new design, we have continued cost analysis comparing the original device manufactured with our rendered picture of our new design and the changes we would make to the new design.

“Trophée de la santé” wrapped up. Research on phage/bacterium interaction; from the ultra-specific PA phages list, are they lytic or lysogenic? 1st look at the Random forest algorithm, but I did not understand a lot of things.
Research on fluorescence detection. We work with BFP and RFP (399/456 nm et 584/607 nm). The light source should have a spectrum that covers both excitation wavelengths, to be selected with a filter. A LASER is not a good idea as 2 fluo means 2 laser, which are not that small + a 400 nm LASER is expensive. Here is a schematic representation:
A dichroic mirror should be placed under the plate to let the incident wavelength to go through to not lose fluo. Conversely to what is schemed, the optical fiber cannot be fixed to the dichroic mirror since the excitation light must be reflected on the mirror. Having this mirror under the plate letting the 395 nm light go through allows to measure the OD if necessary, taking the reflexion on the mirror in consideration. The mirror should be at infinity to focus light on the photomultiplier.
This device should work, but I still need to think of the excitation light. We could use a mercury-vapour light but it seems its sell is illegal. I also have to think about its power. The geometry should also be considered, but it is hard to know what to do until I do the experiments. I should also have a closer look in the photomultiplier functioning.
To do: keep working on fluo. Check the crowdfunding file. Write a recored for the Fondation INP.

Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.
Phase 2 Results
With our parts of our project well characterized, we began experimenting with achieving a variety of consistent expression levels with our dCAS9-VPR activator. Our first strategy was to attempt multimerizing the target operators, placing two and then three operators up stream of the gene of interest using two of our operators. During this experiment, we also tested the effect of spacing the target operators with a different number of intervening base pairs. We tested with 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 intervening base pairs. The results of these experiments yielded a predictable, linear correlation between the number of operators and the expression level and the number of base pairs in the intervening sequences. The results can be found below:
There were some anomalies within this data set. The target operators with 0 and 12 base pair spacing had lower expression than expected. One explanation is that when the operators are at 0 and 12 base pairs apart, they are on the same side of the DNA helix and crowd each other out. Once we eliminated these results, were able to create a smooth progression in expression level across several levels of expression, as seen below.
Finally, we realized that while we could achieve a wide range of high expression levels, it is sometimes favorable to lower expression levels below the standard single operator expression level. In order to accomplish this, we mutated our operators, replacing a base pair at a time. We tested 20 versions of 2 of our operator plasmids. Each version had one of the twenty base pairs in the twenty base pair operator mutated, so that there was a single mismatch between the operator and the guide RNA attached to the dCAS9-VPR system. By changing the location of the single mismatch, we were able to create another smooth curve of changing expression levels, this time lowering expression levels. The expression levels can be found in the graph below.
Phase 3 Results
Now that we could achieve a variety of expression levels, we began integrating our system into recombination based circuitry. The circuit we used could release a different gRNA for every combination of drugs introduced. Before integrating our multimerized plasmids, we first tested the circuit by making each gRNA correspond to a different fluorescent reporter. The data for"

Week 8: June 17 - June 21
While attending the University of Calgary Veterinary Medicine Beef Cattle conference, we learned a lot more about the beef processing industry. Our project was well received by ranchers and members of the cattle industry who found it a practical and applicable option.
In the lab, we ran a colony PCR on the TALE target sequences and ran agar gels (Figures 5, 6 and 7).

Austin_LASA,2018,Team:Austin LASA#Kit_-_-_TEXT.html," 'Additionally, when conducting any project, cost estimates are important as well. Many rapid detection tests for HIV are fairly reasonable, most of them being under $100. In an effort to keep costs low, our proposed test utilizes protocols that can be done in very resource limiting environments. For instance, many HIV detection tests utilize PCR which requires a thermocycler or similar environment that can replicate varying temperatures. With our planned protocol, a thermocycler is unnecessary and in its stead, a fixed temperature water bath can be used. Similarly, all reagents and enzymes are aliquoted to prevent contamination or spoiling or large quantities of materials. In addition, if this was a real venture, proper funding would be established whether it be from the government or another organization to support the implementation of this test.'),   h('p', null, 'As with any detection protocol, sterility is crucial.

Since these individuals are the ones using the kit, it is important to provide adequate training and information to ensure proper use. In an attempt to address this issue, we have proposed to include safety and sterility protocols along with our kit. By providing additional information and a reference for standard aseptic technique, we hope to alleviate some of the discrepancies that may arise from different educational backgrounds. As previously mentioned, the design of our project encourages sterility. All reagents are lyophilized to increase resistance in harsh environments.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News_-_-_TEXT.html,"This was great opportunity for all of the team members to practice presentational skills, demonstrate a cohesive understanding of the four components of the project, learn about the other projects and of course, impress the judges! Our audiences were from various backgrounds and professions beginning from entrepreneurs to analysts, biologists, engineers, professors and students. The high level of energy and enthusiasm of the U of C students quickly engaged the audience and drew more and more people to our booth. As team members explained each of the four components of the project, handouts were given out as a supplementary document to those interested in learning more about the successes, goals and achievements of iGEM Calgary’s project.
Later that night, after wrapping up the poster session, the team went back to the hotel to practice for the next day’s PowerPoint presentation. This presentation delves deeper into each of the four components and explains the science behind the project.
On Saturday, by a random draw, the University of Calgary was chosen to lead the PowerPoint presentations. Following the presentation, the entire team went up on the stage to answer questions from the audience. After the three teams had the opportunity to showcase their projects and answer questions, the judges briefly provided general constructive criticisms to all three teams. After lunch, the audience reconvened in the theatre to honor Mr. Jon Lovink, the guest speaker of the event. After his motivational speech, the judges divided themselves among the three teams to individually comment on specific areas of improvement and achievements.
Following another brief break, the awards ceremony was held back at the theatre. Nervousness and anxiety filled the room as each person awaited to hear the results. After the judges reviewed the judging criteria, the University of Calgary was awarded first place for an excellent overall presentation and teamwork. The judges were highly impressed with the amount of effort that was put into making a creative and informative wiki, well-organized handouts and a powerful presentation. A picture session with the aGEM trophy and other aGEM participants immediately followed the ceremony.
After dinner, the teams rejoiced and celebrated their hard work and successes. Although the U of C iGEM team proudly made its mark in Alberta, the race doesn’t end here; the team is now working twice as hard to make U of C stand out at the iGEM Jamboree.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," B. subtilis cells resulted in no viable transformants. Last week we were able to successfully transform frozen B. subtilis cells with all three of our integration vectors, however each plate yielded only a handful of colonies and many of these colonies were transformed. After some discussion, we reached the conclusion that our B. subtilis cells either had a very high transformation efficiency, or a very low cell viability. We also assumed there was an issue with our antibiotic plates (spectinomycin) since untransformed colonies (white) were able to grow.
To test the viability of our B. subtilis, we will be manipulating the amount of glycerol added to our stocks before storing them at -80°C. We plan on completing this as soon as possible next week. We will also modify certain aspects of our current transformation protocol. First, we will use freshly streaked cells for our transformations, as we are under the impression that stale cells may be more fragile. Next, we will grow the cells for a shorter period of time in order to minimize any dilutions caused by adding the 1% LB-Xylose solution. Alternatively, we will use a 2% xylose (w/v) solution to ensure that all of the B. subtilis cells receive enough xylose to achieve supercompetency. Finally, we plan on including both a 10 minute ice and room temperature incubation step prior to the 90 minute shaker step. We believe that this will reduce the trauma experienced by the cells due to the rapid temperature fluctuations.
While scrutinizing our transformation protocol, we also tested whether our vectors integrated into the desired locus by using colony PCR. We did not see any bands for the sacA vectors, however we also saw abnormal  samples that were not even run on the gel. We believe that our initial lysis step was not long enough, thus the Taq enzyme could not get access to the DNA and the PCR failed.. We will attempt a second colony PCR with a longer lysis step early next week.. For the lacZ vector we saw a band that was approximately 2700 bp long; this was consistent among our three replicates. However, we were expecting to see a band that was actually ~6000 bp long and hypothesized that the B. subtilis may have forcefully ejected the lacZ genes.Dr. Wong had warned us earlier that B. subtilis has a tendency to eject genes when multiple copies are present. After taking into account the RFP generator we were still missing ~2000 bp. We decided to get this product sequenced in order"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Given the success of the spectrophotometric approach in our PAL assays, we attempted to proceed in a similar manner with FDC and UbiX. Unfortunately, there were several complicating factors.
In the case of UbiX, the main problem lay in the impossibility of distinguishing UbiX’s reactant from its product. UbiX catalyzes the prenylation of flavin mononucleotide. Unfortunately, this chemical transformation does not result in a change in the overall absorbance of the reaction solution that we are able to detect. The reactant and the product are simply too chemically similar [6]. We believe that this is one reason why no isozyme of UbiX has ever been kinetically characterized.
In the case of FDC, we initially set out to use tCA’s unique absorbance spectrum to our advantage: whereas we measured an increase in tCA to track the activity of PAL (which produces tCA), we endeavored to measure a decrease in tCA to probe the activity of FDC (which consumes tCA). Unfortunately, FDC cannot function in the absence of its prenylated FMN cofactor, which is supplied by UbiX. This presents a challenge, since FMN has a strong absorbance peak in precisely the same region as tCA’s peak. Consequently, we could not apply the same spectrophotometric method to verify or quantify FDC activity.
As an alternative, we adapted a purely computational approach to obtain at least some of the results that we would have gained from the same genre of experimental analysis that we performed in our PAL assay. Although we could not perform a multiplexed time course experiment on FDC or UbiX, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to determine FDC’s role in the overall synthetic pathway, as described below.
Step three:  Modeling pathway
We had hoped that our in vitro assays would help us not only verify that our enzymes were functioning, but also assist us in determining each enzyme’s kinetic significance to the overall reaction.  This knowledge would allow us to optimize in vivo styrene production by preferentially expressing the enzymes with the most significance. However, without complete in vitro data we could not determine which enzymes were most significant so turned to a mathematical model of our pathway.  Using literature values of our enzymatic constants, we were able to model our enzymatic pathway from a system of ordinary differential equations based on the Michaelis Menten equations. Numerically simulating the model in MATLAB gave us curves that represented the species concentration as a function of time over a specified period.

Strains
In order to get started, you’ll need some worms. The Caenorhabditis Genetics Center at the University of Minnesota is the primary repository for worm strains, both standard strains such as the N2 that most labs work from, and more specialized, mutant strains. They can also provide samples of E. coli OP50, the standard worm food (information about preparing these plates can be found in our section on the care and keeping of worms ).
The CGC’s site, as well as information on how to order these strains, can be found here . There is a small fee for nonprofit organizations. If your university has any worm researchers, chances are they’ll be able to set you up with N2 and OP50 for free. A full list of the strains (warning—huge text file!) can be found here .
Mutants
Cuticular Mutants
AT6: srf-2 mutant which responds to antibody staining.
AT10: srf-3 mutant which responds to antibody staining.
The BE family contains primarily roller and Dpy phenotypes obtained through mutations in rol, sqt, and dpy families. Some of these are temperature-sensitive. Includes some bli blistered worms.
MT1655, SP316: blistered cuticle in bli-6. Dominant (most BE blisters are recessive.)
Conditional Mutants
JH1288: Heat-sensitive, maintain at 15° C.
MT3454: Lethal above 20° C.
CB6208: Lethal below 18° C.
PH13: UV hypersensitive.
SP482: UV sensitive, not X-ray sensitive.
SP483: UV, X, gamma sensitive.
TK66: Life span shortened in high-oxygen environments (see paper ). Also methylviologen (paraquat) resistant.
TK93: Methyviologen (paraquat) hypersensitive.
SS104: Worms raised at 25° C do not develop gonads and can’t reproduce; worms raised at 16° C do and can.
Behavioral
CB611 (originally E611): WormBook describes this as a vab-10 mutant, but the CGC lists it as an unc-23 mutant. Worms with this phenotype display a bent head and consistently spiral towards food sources because they always keep their heads oriented upward on the food gradient.

We want to make our system to be easily observed. Using RFP under Lac promoter, the culture will turn red during rhamnolipid production. When the lactose is exhausted, the colour will fade, telling use that additional inducer (lactose) is needed to continue the production. We use RFP with LVA tag designed by Edinburgh 2014 to make the reporter has fast turnover. But because RFP measurement need fluorescence spectrophotometer, we try to use chromoprotein as reporter. Using the tag designed by Edinburgh 2014 , we designed tagged aeBlue protein and tested its turnover.

Antibiotic discovery may continue to wane in the coming decades because antibiotics aimed for the easiest bacterial targets have already been developed. Considering that bacteria are unlikely to similarly slow in the development of resistance, decreased discovery could be disastrous, resulting in significantly more deaths caused by infectious disease.
NU iGEM 2016 took a significant stride toward an alternative solution to this crisis; however, our experiences this summer testify to the time-consuming nature of genetic research. In order to provide scientists enough time to develop novel antibiotics, physicians and patients must use existing antibiotics appropriately. With that in mind, our Human Practices work focused on educating the public on the proper use of antibiotics and encouraging young students to cultivate an interest in synthetic biology.
Educating the Public
After compiling a wealth of information via research and interviews, we decided to use it to produce a pamphlet which could be distributed at events or placed in waiting rooms. The pamphlet illuminates the problem of antibiotic resistance, persuasively coercing the reader to use antibiotics correctly. Furthermore, one section dissuades the consumption of meat produced from animals raised with prophylactic antibiotics, while another explains why the prescription of antibiotics to prevent infections after wisdom tooth surgery is inappropriate. Future iGEM teams and other organizations are encouraged to use this pamphlet however they see fit. It can be downloaded here .
Instructions for printing and cutting:
Print in landscape orientation on both sides of standard 8.5” x 11” paper, flipping on the short end.
Use a paper trimmer to remove the edges. Align the blade with the trim marks, which are L-shapes placed at each corner.
Fold the front panel, which contains the title, to the left, stopping at the midpoint of the newly folded paper.
Fold the citations panel inward toward the crease created in step 3.
The final product should look like this:
Working with Students
At the summer’s start, our team was largely inexperienced with public outreach. We applied for a Building with Biology kit to help us develop the skills we were lacking.

When the samples are added into loading slot, they would flow into the first room (Incubation Room).The biomarker would compete the complementary sequences in the aptamer, which would flow to the second room (Detection Room) by increasing rotate speed. In the second room, the complementary sequence would activate the Cas12a (Cfp1) to cut DNase Alert. The short sequence between Quencher and Fluorophore is cut and then the quencher wouldn't restrain the fluorophore anymore. Above all, it would give out the green fluorescence we want in detecting room.

Fluorescence detection
Inspired by the principle of the ultraviolet gel tester and 2014 Aachen , we came up with the fluorescence detection design. Given that the fluorophore of the DNaseAlert (IDT) would be excited by green light with 535 nm and give out light of 565 nm, we selected the green LED lamp beads (which give out light around 535 nm) as light source. The camera with specific optical filter is in the same level with the light. It will get the Emission light from sample and then take a photo of the whole microfluidic chip.
Figure 4. The Flow Path of Fluorescence Detection.
As showed in the figure below (Figure 5), after combination of EpCam and Cas12a protein, the detection room gave out significant green fluorescence compared to other wells which didn’t coat corresponding sequence. This proves that our experimental method of converting protein signals into fluorescent signals is feasible.

Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi (RPi) plays an important role as server, which can receive the command from the APP and apply it to the peripherals (motor and camera). To achieve it, all you need is just clicking the button on the mobile phone. Besides, it's worth mentioning that it can execute the whole series detection processes automatically. We"

RNA Base-Editor
 Motivation for RNA Editing
From the results of our human practice, we have seen a great value in RNA editing. First, with the cautious attitude towards gene editing in all three countries we surveyed, many incline to the reversibility of RNA editing, considering it being safer. Also, professional views from doctors reveal that transcriptome analysis and the lack of better RNA modifying protein scaffold contributes to the high cost of RNA editing. All of our discussions with stakeholders indicate that greater effort should be put to develop RNA editing, while in reality, it is lagging behind its DNA editing counterpart. Hence, we are motivated to develop programmable mRNA-editing analogous to our DNA base-editors as well as realizing cheaper transcriptome analysis by developing better RNA sequencing techniques.
Our DNA base-editors perform two types of base changes. One is the C-to-T editing by the enhanced APOBEC1 protein (BE3) fused with Cas9 protein, while the other is the A-T to G-C base pair change by an evolved TadA*-dCas9 fusion protein. The former already has an obvious solution. The APOBEC1 cytidine deaminase in our DNA base-editor was endogenously used and engineered for cytosine-to-uracil editing on mRNA (Petersen-Mahrt, S. K.,2003). Hence, with an RNA-targeting partner, it should naturally induce an equivalent change on mRNA like a C-to-T base change on DNA. Actually, Team NUS-Singapore-Sci is working on such an RNA-targeting C-to-U editor. Hence, we decided to focus our effort on the latter, inducing an equivalent change on mRNA as if an A-to-G base change occurred on DNA.
Theoretical Background
 An Answer through Inosine
While direct A-to-G base change on mRNA is much more difficult, one way to bypass such difficulty is to convert adenosine to inosine, which can later be converted to guanosine or simply allows for pairing with a cytosine. Such an A-to-I editing can be achieved through the adenos"

March 15 - March 31
Beginning our journey in phage purification, we were excited to start running experiments immediately.  However,  our instructor Dr. Grose so wisely informed us that it is essential to begin any research by seeing what others have done first.  The first few weeks of lab we focused on researching in the library.  We reviewed the work done by others before us in order to understand where we should begin.  The research provide a variety of avenues that we could follow and even a few procedures of purification that were explained step by step.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#ImmobilizationTags_-_-_TEXT.html," a look at our page about synthetic peptides ). In order to immobilize our enzymes, they were C-terminally fused to the coding region of the SpyCatcher, which could then bind to the SpyTag, attached to the matrix.
SnapTag
The SnapTag is originally a labelling system, used to tag proteins with fluorescent molecules. It is a derivate of human O-6-alkylguaninalkyltransferase. In our system the same principle is used, but instead of attaching a fluorescent marker, we attach the SNAP-protein to a membrane coated in SNAP-substrate. The SNAP-protein itelf is a protein chain (182 amino acids), C-terminally fused to the target protein. The membrane is coated in the so called SNAP-substrate, a 1-benzylguanidine. The mechanism for covalent fusion of the two parts is a SN2-reaction where the guanine is substituted by a cystein residue near the N-terminus of the attached protein, which forms a thioester bond.
Split Intein (Ssp Gyrase B Intein)
Intein immobilisation (Figure 1) has a significant difference to the other two tag systems: While in the other cases two peptide chains are connected by the tag, the intein itself isn’t present in the immobilised state anymore, thereby forming a direct connection. Artificially created split inteins are modified parts of natural occuring inteins - protein regions which cut themselves out of a protein chain via self-catalytic activity- that are cut in two pieces. If C-terminal and N-terminal part find eachother in solution under specific conditions (in our case the optimal conditions are room temperature and a pH value around 7.5) the intein’s highly specific self-splicing activity is induced and the intein then cuts itself out of the protein chain, leaving the regions around the recombined intein covalently bound to each other. The cleavage mechanism occurs by conserved cystein and asparagine resiudes at the ends of the intein region. For our system we chose a split intein from gyrase b of Synechocystis spec. PCC6803. We chose it in particular because of it’s published high binding efficiency (89%) and it having a very small C-split-intein (modified the ensure a working fluorecin test) (GVPVHNGA[6-AHS]K(Fl)C) which could be aquired by peptide synthesis in the lab, thus allowing the same modifications we also used for Spy-Tag"

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," provides valuable information for the local structural entities along the chain, it is not enough on its own to produce the contact map. Therefore, we can interpret this step, in terms of machine learning terminology, as an internal representation of the input that is passed on deeper in the network to assist contact prediction. However, since secondary structure has a semantic meaning of its own in the eyes of biologists, we treat the two models separately as it is standard practice in the literature.
Our Secondary Structure Predictor consists of a wide bidirectional recurrent layer, followed by a number of fully connected layers and the output layer. The model trains on primary sequence samples and predicts the secondary structure class for every Amino acid.
In a nutshell, the sequence passes through the recurrent layer and the model “remembers” what has already happened in the sequence -in terms of secondary structures- to provide context for every subsequent residue that it sees. The bigger the size of the recurrent layer the greater the memory capacity of the network and, in turn, its predictive power.
The additional layers that follow progressively reduce the representation dimension until we are left with a 1-hot vector (1 x 8) that indicates the most prevalent class choice. In the end, the full predicted sequence corresponds to all secondary structure segments.
Top Row: primary structure sequence of one-letter Amino acid codes
Bottom Row: secondary structure sequence of one-letter class of the 8 classes
Inferring the contacts - CONTACT MAP PREDICTION MODEL
Our end goal is to predict contacts between residues in a pairwise fashion. For a sequence of N Amino acids we want to derive a N x N map, where each position shows the probability of the two residues being in contact.
At first, we need to build a N x N map, hereafter referred to as “tensor”, that will serve as the input layer to our network and will be updated after each epoch as the network learns to solve the regression task. The tensor captures the semantic relationship between residues and constantly changes as training progresses.
In the previous section, we mentioned how we use embeddings to map our single-letter Amino acid codes to high-dimensional vectors. That is, for a primary structure sequence of N residues, we end up with a N x m matrix, where m is the size of the embedding.
In order to exploit the additional information we have for every Amino acid about its secondary structure classification, we employ, once again, word embeddings of size k that we stack to our previous m-dimensional vector. Now, every Amino acid is encoded as a concatenation of the two embeddings with a resulting vector of size m + k"

What we did
For iGEM 2008, we spent the summer adapting heterochromatin/silencing as a novel controller for gene expression in synthetic biology. The idea to work in the area of heterochromatin arose in early 2008 as part of discussions between the Lim lab and George Cachianes (Lincoln High School biotech program director), who had introduced his students to epigenetics earlier in the year. Andrew and Nili (Lim Lab) met with the participating Lincoln High students several times in April and May to discuss epigenetics, brainstorm project ideas, and get the students started on an after-school “pre-project”, investigating whether over-expression of a panel of chromatin-related genes might enhance our ability to silence transgenic loci (it does, see our project page!).
In several group discussions at the beginning of the summer, we identified a range of synthetic biology goals that might benefit from the use of heterochromatin"

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#2 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Do not use a larger culture volume than recommended in the protocol, as this will result in inefficient lysis and reduce the quality of the preparation.
3. Grow the culture at 37°C with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm) for 12–16 hours (see next section).
4. Harvest the bacterial culture 12–16 hours after inoculation. This corresponds to the transition from logarithmic into stationary growth phase, when cell density is high (3–4 x 109 cells per ml) and RNA content of cells is low. Harvesting too early may result in lower than expected yields of plasmid DNA due to a lower cell density. Harvesting too late may result in low plasmid quality and yield due to DNA degradation from over-aging of the culture.
Tip: Growth of cultures is dependent on factors such as host strain, plasmid insert and copy number, and culture medium. To determine the optimal harvesting time for a particular system, monitor the cell density and the growth of the culture by measuring the OD600 (see next section).
5. Harvest the bacterial culture by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Remove all traces of supernatant by inverting the open centrifuge tube until all of the medium has been drained. The cells are now ready for the lysis procedure, as indicated in the appropriate plasmid purification protocol.  The procedure may be stopped at this point and continued later by freezing the cell pellets obtained by centrifugation. The frozen cell pellets may be stored at –20°C for several weeks.
For storing E.coli strains:

E. coli strains can be stored for many years at –70°C in 15% glycerol.

1. Add 0.15 ml glycerol (100%) to a 2 ml screw-cap vial and sterilize by autoclaving.  Tip: Vials of sterilized glycerol can be prepared in batches and stored at room temperature until required.
2. Add 0.85 ml of a logarithmic-phase E. coli culture to the vial of pre-sterilized glycerol.
3. Vortex the vial vigorously to ensure even mixing of the bacterial culture and the glycerol.
4. Freeze in ethanol–dry ice or liquid nitrogen and store at –70°C.
Tip: Avoid repeated thawing and re-freezing of glycerol stocks as this can reduce the viability of the bacteria.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html,"22-dienol (Waterham and Wan- ders, 2000). The next gene encodes for bovine side-chain cleavage cytochrome (P450scc), which converts ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol to pregnenolone. P450scc requires the assistance of bovine ferredoxin-1 (FDX1) as an electron carrier (Grinberg et al., 2000), and adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) to reduce FDX1. The final gene is type II human 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) that converts pregnenolone to progesterone (Koritz, 1964). See the complete pathway to progesterone biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica below in Figure 3.
We found the sequences for each gene from either KEGG or UniProt and codon optimized them for Y. lipolytica using the DNA works system from the High-Performance Computing at the NIH website.
PROMOTER & TERMINATOR
Once we had constructed the pathway we wanted to use, we needed to chose a promoter and terminator. A favorable promoter or terminator is short with high levels of expression. We designed the genes in the biosynthesis pathway to function monocistronically, where each gene possesses its own promoter and terminator.
Promoter
Initially, we considered a galactose-inducible promoter, GAL10, to control the expression of the progesterone gene cassette. However, the presence of glucose represses GAL10 via the MIG1 binding site, and we wanted our yeast strain to be able to produce progesterone when grown on a variety of substrates, including glucose. To use this promoter, we would have to modify the MIG1 binding site for the promoter to function on glucose-enriched media. According to Dr. Hans Ronne of the Department of Forest Mycology and Plant Pathology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, maintaining galactose inducibility would entail a risky manipulation of the CYC8-TUP1 co-repressor complex.
We researched other methods of eliminating glucose-mediated repression, but deemed it more practical to use a constitutive promoter like TEF1. Constitutive promoters enable constant gene expression, while inducible promoters turn gene expression on or off depending on a certain factor. Controlling the amount of product produced is a critical element in creating a specific dose of medicine. To control dosage the consumer could heat-shock the yeast after a time"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#pumi_-_-_TEXT.html," SDS-PAGE of purification from the 12 L fermentations from 10/11 ( BBa_K863000 ). Purification of the supernatant via microfiltration, diafiltration and Ni-NTA column (step gradient with 5 %, 50 % and 100 % elution buffer).
In Figure 8 the SDS-PAGE of the Ni-NTA purification of the lysed E.coli KRX culture containing BBa_K863000 is illustrated. It shows the permeate and retentate of microfiltration and diafiltration respectively, several fractions of flow-through, wash and the elutions with different buffer concentrations respectively. The selected samples were taken where peaks were seen in the chromatogram. The His-tagged BPUL has a molecular weight of 58.6 kDa. BPUL could not be attributed exactly to any band. There are some other non-specific bands, wich could not be identified because the MALDI was broken-down for the last two weeks.
MALDI-TOF Analysis of BPUL
The E. coli laccase was identified using the following software

Activity analysis of BPUL
Initial activity tests of purified fractions
Initial tests were done with elution fractions 1 to 4 to determine the activity of the purified BPUL laccase. The fractions were rebuffered into deionized H2O  using HiTrap Desalting Columns and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2. The reaction setup included 140 µL of a elution fraction, 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL and the absorption was measured at 420 nm to detect oxidization over a time period of 5 hours at 25°C. Each fraction did show contained active laccase able to oxidize ABTS (see Figure 11). After 15 minutes, saturation was observed with ~60 µM oxidized ABTS. After 5 hours ~5 µM ABTS"

Keratinocyte Experiments
We conducted more experiments to determine at what      concentration of gentamicin and time point successfully      kills the bacterial strains. However, they were      unsuccessful again. We spoke to our mentors and decided      that a biofilm may be forming that prevents the bacteria      from dying. We conducted OD experiments to determine at      what point the bacterial strains are in mid exponential      phase. The results were inconclusive for all of the      bacterial strains except for E.Coli. Thus, we tried to      conduct an experiment to assess which MOIs of E.Coli cause      cell death but there was an error with our cell culture      and the cells were dead in the morning. We now think that      the problem with our experiments is that we are using very      high bacteria concentrations. We made plans to repeat the experiments with lower concentrations.
Molecular Cloning
We successfully electroporated pC221_RhlAB into S. Aureus      RN4220. We intend to electroporate mini-prepped pGO1      helper plasmid into RN4220, and then filter conjugate from      here, since we were unable to electroporate pC221_RhlAB      directly into OS2 which already contained pGO1. After      Millipore filtering our Rhamnolipids solution, we repeated      the 96-well S. Epidermidis vs. Rhamnolipids survival      test. Our negative control was S. epidermidis with 2uL of      34 ng/uL Kanamycin, while our positive control was      S. epidermidis with just BHI. After adding a 1/1000th      dilution of overnight to a range of two-fold serial      dilutions from 2000mg/L to 15.6mg/L. The resultant OD600s      showed that growth of S. Epidermidis is staggered by      higher concentrations of Rhamnolipids up to125mg/L of      Rhamnolipids, although the OD600 Does eventually get to OD      1 by the 12th hour. So although production of      Rhamnolipids in the high concentrations we need might      stagger the growth of S. epidermidis, it will not      necessarily kill our cells.

In our project, we chose to work with Pantoea agglomerans as our chassis, and fortunately it has proven to be a very nice chassis! Not only that, we expressed for the first time a plasmid from the pSB1C3 series inside an insect, Aedes aegypti, the Dengue and Zika vector!
Pantoea agglomerans has been used before for paratransgenesis[1] with great success, and we decided to use it. We got a strain isolated from Eucalyptus in our state, which showed good growth and was genetically amenable.
Gram staining of our Pantoea agglomerans. Pretty!
Our first idea was to use Team EPFL 2010 chassis, Asaia sp, as our proof-of-concept chassis. We contacted their P.I. and searched for it in Brazilian laboratories. However, after studying the bureaucracy and thinking carefully about introducing this new species in Brazil, we rethought our approach.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins in solution. The protein-dye complex causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm. The absorption is proportional to the amount of protein present in the sample. The assay is suitable for a protein concentration in the range between 0.1 - 1.4 mg/ml of protein using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard protein. Protein solutions or crude extracts with protein concentrations above 1.4 mg/ml have to be diluted to be in the linear range of the assay. The Bradford assay is advantageous because it is fast, the staining does not depend on the protein and the reagent is commercially available.
The Material
Bradford solution, 5-fold concentrate
Buffer from protein elution
The Procedure
Prepare for each protein mixture 3 samples with different concentrations. If you have many samples to measure, we suggest to do a master mix and distribute 1 ml of the master mix to labeled Eppendorf reaction tubes. Using a master mix, you can measure more samples at the same time and it helps you to avoid errors.
Sample
Reference Sample
800 ml H2O
800 ml H2O
0.5, 1.0 & 2.0 ml crude extract
no protein but equal volume of buffer
200 ml Bradford solution
200 ml Bradford solution
After mixing the samples with the protein solutions, the mixtures have to be incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Transfer the mixtures and the reference sample to 1.5 ml cuvettes and measure the absorption at a wavelength of 595 nm.
Next you can calculate the amount of protein in your sample using the following formula:
The slope “a” of the calibration curve has been determined using the protein BSA. After several repetitions, this value turned out to be 0.0536 when 1 ml (with c = 1 µg/µl BSA) has been added to 1 ml of the five-fold diluted Bradford solution. Do not forget to subtract the absorption of your blank from the absorption of your sample!
For the ß-Gal assay, add 20 ml of your crude extract to the Bradford-water solution. Use 20 ml of the Z-buffer/LD-Mix as a reference for the measurement. The determined absorption can be directly used together with the formula for the calculation of the Miller units.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 14_-_-_TEXT.html," has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
