HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," Kong Baptist University, majoring in biophysics. I graduated from Beijing Normal University this summer. As a physics student, biology is totally new for me. Frankly speaking, it is the first time that I hear so many biology terminologies and deal with some simple manipulations. Fortunately, with the help of friendly and amusing team members, I have learnt a lot in the lab.
Thanks to all the pretty girls and handsome boys in our team. They bring so much fun during the little bit boring lab life. No matter what the final result of this competition is, I enjoy the course and cherish our friendship. I have to say that I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
Oh, by the way, although I’m interested in many things, songs of Westlife, movies of Leung Chiuwai, and also show of Lakers are my most favorite. If you are also their fans, please share your feelings and opinions with me. Thank you!
WONG Chi Kin Felix
I am an MBBS student with immense interest in research. By research I would like to find solutions for healthcare and make the world better. Seems my aspiration is a bit far away from the contents of our project? In fact, I am still trying to learn experimental technique. I believe doing any kinds of biological experiment can enrich my understanding in research routines and insights. Meanwhile, I am responsible for the Human Practices Project. By letting people know about synthetic biology, they understand how it can contribute to the advancement of quality of life.
I was a late comer in this team, since I joined in September. In these two months, I have become good friends with all my teammates. May I grasp this opportunity to say thank you to all of them.
WONG Ho Yin Bosco
Hi, my name is Bosco and i am a year 2 student at HKU reading biochemistry and chemistry. During these days working as a member in the HKU_HKBU team, i have learnt a lot about synthetic biology and yet made invaluable friendship from the other members.
I joined this competition not only for learning more about biochemistry, but also the essential lab skills that i need for my studies. Through these months conducting experiments in the lab and holding numerous meetings late, i am very surprised i have survived from all these.
Especially when some of the members went home and there were only few people here in hong kong, we have encountered a very great crisis in human resources. Yet, with all our keen devotion, we have resolved and learnt from problems to problems. I love the days being in the team and the days spent with my teammates,"

Perception of Synthetic Biology
Government
Synthetic biology is not a great interest for the government. The  5 major fields in science that the government announced to actively develop are logistics and supply chain management enabling technologies; nanotechnology and advanced materials; and textiles and clothing. Synthetic biology was not included in this category (""Hong Kong the,"" 2013).
Also, due to the conspicuous achievement of economy and business sector, science is not the major focus of the Hong Kong government. According to the 2013 Policy Address, there are only three plans slightly related to science field. One of them says that the government will provide software and hardware support for the industry, academia and research sectors to foster co-operation and examine the patent system of research and development results. Since development of innovation and technology is elevated to a very important strategic level in the National 12th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong, which has a close relationship with China, will also provide more platforms for scientific research collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong. This may help improve the people’s awareness to science and may focus more on the sophisticated field like synthetic biology (""HKSAR the 2013,"" 2013).
According to the speech during the Synthetic Biology 4.0 meeting by Mr. John C. Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong in 2008, the government aimed to make technology a key pillar for shaping Hong Kong as an advanced knowledge-based society. He also mentioned that since the connection between Hong Kong and Mainland China is very close and China is a potential market of new technologies, Hong Kong would like to play an important role in promoting scientific research in Asia. Moreover, Hong Kong has the advantages of free-flowing ideas, strong protection for intellectual property rights and solid law basis. These can provide a fertile environment for creativity and innovation. Therefore, Hong Kong has the potential to develop innovative science and technology (""Press release,"" 2008).
Public
The public awareness on synthetic biology of Hong Kong citizens was surveyed by the  HKUST iGEM 2011 team. The result showed that 44.48% of the respondents reported that they had heard about synthetic biology. The aspects of synthetic biology that the public was most concerned were the scientific processes and techniques (25%), the possible risks (20%) and the claimed benefits (17%). The moral and ethical issues received less attention (9%). The respondents’ overall impression about all the newly developed technologies and the focused biological technologies were both more likely to be positive, but close to"

Will Handley
Will is a physicist. He is our expert in oligo design, but can regularly be found juggling with all sorts of laboratory equipment.
Mission Statement
As a team of scientists and engineers from very diverse backgrounds we aim to create an environment in which every member is able to apply his or her unique talents and knowledge to the fullest. We will document our literature research as well as our experimental work on the wiki and the online labbook making new content available as soon as possible. To make our work more relevant and transparent we will clearly distinguish between theoretical designs, mathematical simulations and physically designed biological systems, and include measurements where appropriate.
Share and Enjoy
In the Open Source spirit of iGEM, we will try to make our ideas, the progress of our work and our results as open as possible. This requires honesty about which parts of our project succeeded, which ones yielded ambiguous results and which ideas had to be abandoned. We believe that such transparency will make our project more useful for future iGEM teams and researchers.
Although iGEM takes the form of a competition, all our work is ultimately a collaboration to create a registry that will act as a firm foundation supporting the scientists and engineers of the future.
Therefore, we would love to collaborate with other current iGEM teams working on related projects. If you think parts of our work could be useful to you, please get in contact and we will see how we can help. Conversely, if you have any resources or knowledge that you believe could help us, please let us know!

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

Introduction
Today we did restriction digests again with pMUTIN4 with the new enzymes. We concluded that the enzymes we used may have been contaminated. We ordered normal new enzymes and used them instead.
We also did PCR fragment digests (from the cleaned PCR product) with BamHI and HindIII
We run the digestions on the gel and cut PCR fragment and pmutin4 from the gel to clean up.
Our B.subtilis transformation worked well yesterday, so we can perform new transformation using our pGFP-rrnB:kinA vector.
Also we set up mini and midi culture yesterday, we need to do mini prep and midi prep today.

With these genes perchlorate reducing bacteria like Dechloromonas aromatica can reduce perchlorate into chlorite (ClO-2 ) utilizing perchlorate reductase2. Subsequently, the bacterium can convert chlorite into oxygen (O2 ) and chloride (Cl- ) utilizing chlorite dismutase. This process is visualized in figure 1:
Figure 1. The perchlorate reduction system in Dechloromonas aromatica . This illustrates the mode of action and proteins required to reduce perchlorate into chloride ions and oxygen. Adapted from Bender et al. 2005 and elaborated. 2
The genes encoding for perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase from Dechloromonas aromatica are part of a perchlorate reducing island shown in the figure 2:
Figure 2. The perchlorate reduction genomic island of Dechloromonas aromatica. This includes all the genes necessary for the reduction of perchlorate 1 . This figure was taken from Melnyk et al. 2014.
Upstream of pcrA a group of regulatory genes is present, these genes were not cloned into E. coli . We want to replace these regulatory genes by our own Martian gravity induced promoter, see RPM. Initially we chose to order the genes pcrA, B, C and D in such fashion, that they had to be cloned into one vector as a whole, with the use of Gibson assembly. Later we ordered new DNA from IDTDNA where the pcrA, pcrB, pcrC and pcrD genes can be cloned into a vector separately from each other. Also, the genes DHC and QDH, the membrane-associated proteins, were cloned together into a vector. Finally, cld and moaA were cloned separately in two vectors.
We choose from a variety of regular constitutive and inducible promoters to express the genes necessary for perchlorate reduction in E. coli from the iGEM database. Next to these promoters other BioBricks related to our project are tested. For example some BioBricks which can function as an O2 sensor, or a promoter which is regulated by the presence of oxygen and absence of oxygen.
The codon optimized pcr B, pcr C, pcr D, cld, QDH&DHC; and MoaA are successfully Gibson assembled into pBluescript and transformed into E. coli DH5a. These genes"

Developing a solution
To resolve this communication difficulty and to facilitate the understanding and collaboration between us (modelers and biologists), we have developed an interdisciplinary communication tool.
For this purpose we prepared two educational flyers:
Flyer "" Modelling for biologist "" which was realized by the biologists of our team under the supervision of the modelers, in order to explain the essentials of mathematical modelling approaches to other biologists.
Flyer "" Synthetic Biology for modellers "" performed by the members of our team involved in computer modelling, under the supervision of the biologists and aimed at explaining the basics of genetics to other fellow modelers.
Swapping the roles of the team members during the realization of the flyers allowed us to include the point of view of “non-experts” and to focus on essential points which often appear trivial and therefore unimportant to the experts.
1. Content of the flyers
2. Flyers evaluation
3. Conclusion
Interest for the iGEM community
Interest for iGEM community ?! Sure !! Since the strength of iGEM teams often reposes on bringing together a critical mass of expertise in different disciplines, we developed flyers that can foster the communication between experts and thus enhance their work efficiency. Especially during the initial phases of the project, the flyers could boost interdisciplinary work within mixed teams. It therefore makes sense to integrate them in the iGEM KIT so as to make them available to the iGem community right from the start.
As an educational tool, universities or high schools can also use the flyers. They help explaining the basics of synthetic biology and pinpoint the complementarity between experimental and theoretical approaches in engineering.
Content of the Flyers
-->
Flyers evaluation
To estimate the educational impact of our flyers, we organized a meeting with  46 students (mostly Undergraduate, Graduate and PhD) from various backgrounds (Life Sciences, Physics and Electronic Engineering and Computer Sciences).     None of them was involved in our project and synthetic biology was for most of them unheard"

At destination, our habitats will assemble with the help of robots (the mycelial growth is effectively rate-limited by access to feedstock) on the order of weeks, and is designed to provide a safe living environment for our astronauts or to enable human colonies on other planets.
III. Cyanobacteria Oxygen-Production Validation
Cyanobacteria play an important role in our structure: serving as feedstock for the mycelia, and producing oxygen for use by astronauts. We wanted to quantify the ability of cyanobacteria to provide sufficient oxygen to sustain a habitat. We chose the strain Anabaena 7120 mainly because it is diazotrophic and photosynthetic, in addition to other favorable qualities for use on other planets5.
Figure 3: Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy Image of Anabaena 7120. Credit: Lynn Rothschild.
Using 425 ml of Anabaena in liquid culture, we used wireless oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors (Vernier Go Direct Series) in an airtight environment to quantify the production of these gases on a short time-scale. We used BD Anaerobic Sachets to achieve a <0.5% oxygen environment, and a 1627 mL Nasco Whirl-Pak airtight bag to maintain a suitable environment.
Given the empirically observed rate of oxygen production from our liquid culture, we reason that it will take ~92 hours (4 days) to achieve 20% oxygen, almost mimicking Earth's atmosphere. This time-frame is certainly reasonable in the context of our mission architecture. (For more details, please refer to the Results page.)

Because we are PCRing something that is in the 4-5 Kb range, we are not going to use the PCR beads and we are going to use the Q5 master mix as the taq polymerase/buffer/dNTP combo for the PCR. I took 12.5 uL of the Q5 master mix and put in 2.5 uL of the forward primer, 2.5 uL of the reverse , 5 uL of a 1000X diluted plasmid (used a GFP+pBR322 and UV+pACYC184 both at ~100-150 ng/uL), and 2.5 uL of water to get it to a 25 uL total volume.   The settings for the PCR machine were edited a little. The settings were changed to:  init denat: 95  300  denaturation: 95  30  annealing: 55  30  extension: 72  200  final extension: 72  350  cycles: 30  Also re-streaked 2 plates of the 1 colony that was found on the HSP pACYC184 +GFP pBR322 co-transformed plates and put it in the incubator.   We got the sequences back from genewiz for colinies 1 and 3 of th eHSP+pACYC184. The HSP 1 forward was 98% accurate and the reverse was 99% accurate and for HSP colony 3 the forward was 97% accurate and the backward was 98% accurate. When looking at the sequences there seem to be a few point mutations in it so we are hoping that it will not affect the functionality of the system.      7/14/14: (Devora)  Shoshana looked at the sequences again and also checked the free repeats that we got. I think that all of the weird point mutations except for one were correct on the other. So we are hoping that everything in the HSP+pACYC184 colony 1 and 3 department are good.   We also ran a gel but then someone switched the leads or didn't check and everything ran off. So we ran another gel . It had the input and output backbones that we PCR'ed on friday on it to check it. The gel only showed a band for the output backbone (see the gel picture in the experiment). Therefore, there"

Cloning strategy
Our goal to clone a modified bacteriophage λ which can be transported by conjugation, allows the selection of infected cells through a chloamphenicol resistance and harbours GFP for visualization was designed in two strategies whereas strategy two builds on strategy one. A detailed description of the two strategies can be seen below (see figure 1.6 and 1.7). The used λ cI protein generator was synthesised by geneart and just transferred in a standard plasmid as it  can be seen in figure 1.8.

cloning
In our strategy, four fragments had to be ligated into the bacteriophage λ. We decided to first ligate the four fragments into a standard high-copy cloning vector (pBluescript SK II), to better control the ligation success and to amplify the insert to be ligated in the phage.  The four parts making up the insert were: the λ phage GAM fragment, a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CmR) for selection of successfully modified phages, a GFP cassette for visualization of the phage and an E. coli oriT (R), which allows the conjugation of the harboring plasmid, provided the cell contains also the so called helper plasmid (pUB307, a RP4 derivate).  The GAM fragment was obtained from the λ phage, the oriT from pMMB863, a plasmid bearing the RP4 oriT - kind gift of Prof. Bagdasarian (MSU). Both fragments were amplified by PCR, which allowed us to flank our insert with desired restriction sites simply by designing appropriate primers (see figure 2.1.1). The CmR was amplified by PCR from pDEST15; at this stage we introduced a Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) at the end of the coding region of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, since we wanted to express the cmr and the gfp genes from a bi-cistronic operon (see figure 2.1.1). For this purpose, we cut the registry"

This summer, we explored the heat-dependent nature of chromogenic proteins. Chromogenic proteins are popularly used in a variety of scientific applications, but are commonly used only as color indicators. No extensive research has been done to demonstrate how temperature alters the color profile of these proteins. Our research not only characterized how chromogenic proteins lose or change colors in response to heat, but also identified a large enough span of chromogenic proteins that differentially respond to temperature. By taking advantage of this differential response, we were able to construct a biological thermometer consisting of six unique chromogenic proteins. Each of the proteins in this set loses or changes color at a specific temperature. Lastly, we added a cellulose binding domain to these chromogenic proteins to allow them to bind to cellulose, allowing for the creation of a biologically-based"

They also had interview with a representative of “Arbejdsmiljogruppen” , the local bio-safety group associated with the University of Southern Denmark. During the interview, they explained the details of the project, asked several questions about the biosafety(ex: if there would be increased risk due to work performed by relatively inexperienced students, or if they perceived any danger should the bacteria get out of the lab……), and get the replies about the safety from the representative to ensure the biosafety of their project.
(3)Watermarks
Watermarks are special sequences that were like a license. They are easy to find, easy to read and easy to insert by the developing team. They must be persistent in the plasmid, in order to recognized by other researchers in case it contaminates the environment or are accidentally transmitted to other labs. In conclusion, they chose to divide the code into two separate parts, each is from 6 to 26 nucleotides. Two equally long parts at each end of the coding sequence ensures symmetry , which again should help make insertion of a watermark easy, as this will reduce the complexity of the primers we need to design to insert them.Moreover, this ensures that identification is done easily, since the combination of nucleotides of the sequence from E to X and from S to P is known.

Ideas of the project
This project “GenoTHREAT software” is a sequence screening tool that can be used to detect potential select agent and toxin. Based on the “Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA Providers""  in late 2009 by the U.S. government, which focuses on minimal DNA sequence screening protocol, this team developed their own general algorithm for each input sequence.
For the general algorithm, initial nucleotide strand and its reversed DNA sequence are kept, and six frame translation is done. These subsequences are then blasted. According to the blasting result, suspected toxic sequences are picked, where relevant information is acquired. The information includes some keywords, like the strain of the pathogenic bacteria that produce the toxin, the names of diseases associated with the entries……etc. It is then checked by their database derived from CDC Select Agent and Toxin List to see if it is consider to be dangerous. Finally, if one subsequence leads to a hit, then the initial Query Sequence is a hit.

Kill Switch
The kill switch idea is not really necessary for Click Coli as already stated in the Biosafety page .  If gene transfer occurs, it still misses the clickable DBCO functionalized molecules groups and would therefore miss the protective coating. However our idea is a fundamental tool and can thus be used in other future iGEM projects. Therefore it is important for other teams to think about a functional kill switch for their own project when using our tool, because in our case Click Coli does not necessarily need a kill switch system.
However we still thought about a kill switch system. This system will be active after the bacteria fulfilled their function. This will limit the time the bacteria is active, so there will be less time to adapt or mutate.
How does it work? First, the bacterium is induced with IPTG outside the human body. The plasmid in the bacteria has to be IPTG indu"
Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#project_-_-_TEXT.html," as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids learn more about synthetic biology in an enjoyable way. To our surprise, when they were playing these games, they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. ( Exhibition at National Museum ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
II Gene circuit
In our system, E.coli is divided into two groups, with each group having three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
Concretely, the gene circuit of each character is displayed below.
Principles of this circuit can be seen at Design of characters.
III Invertase assay
In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)
(Fig.2 The number of cells expressing mRFP)
More details can be seen at Invertase assay
IV Orthogonality test
Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
((Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test)
However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
(Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from results)
We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever"

To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 4000rpm for 10min at 7 Celsius. Supernatant was taken out using pipets and discarded. E coli was then resuspended in 10mL M9+ supplemented with uracil and adenine.
- To four centrifuge tubes, add 0, 100, 200, and 500 uL of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (add nothing to C). The volume of the mutagen should correspond to the label on the test tube. Because 5-bromodeoxyuridine stock is a 10mg/mL aqueous solution, the final mutagen concentration in the five test tubes will be 0, 100, 200, and 500 ug/mL.
- Let the bacterial suspension incubate with mutagen for approximately 1h 30min.
- 30uL of 5.3 phage stock was added to each centrifuge tube (add nothing to C). From 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock, we know that 5.3 phage stock has 7E8 particles/20uL. Thus, to each of the test tubes, we are adding approximately 1.2E9 particles.
- Incubate phage on shaker at 37C until clearage: 22hours.
- Liquid culture from the four test (excluding C) tubes is then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet cell debris. Supernatant containing phage particles is removed and 1mL of chloroform is added to destroy any remaining E coli cells.
- The stock solutions are now stored in 4 Celsius.
2) Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 1 (6.28)
- For each mutagenesis, specifically 0, 100, 200, and 500ug/mL, 1:100 dilution series were performed to generate 0, -2, -4, -6, and -8 dilutions.
- For each dilution, a test tube was assigned to it. To each test tube, 0.75mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was added and then transfected with 30uL of phage dilution. After 20 minutes of incubation, 7mL of x8 agar was added to each test tube and the content was then plated.

Figure 13. Average amount of E. coli spheroplasts (expressed in OD600) remained in the eluent after magnetic binding with DT in different DT concentrations and temperatures. OD600 is expressed within arbitrary unit. Standard error of estimates is shown in between 0.005-0.008.
Plotting of the OD600 in the graph (Figure 13) could be referred classically as ligand-receptor dynamics. The increasing of DT concentration would enable huge amount binding of spheroplasts in the incubation. Therefore, the logarithmic trend occurs in the beginning. Nevertheless, there would be an amount of DT concentration where the number of spheroplast binding would be reaching its maximum. Affinity constant of the receptor towards ligands could be determined as the amount of substrate causing saturation of 50% receptors. Reverse plotting of Lineweaver-Burke would be required to determine the values of HT-DT affinity constant and maximum saturation. Modified receptor-ligand formulae could be further transformed as shown in Figure 14. (Note: y represents 1/OD600, and x represents 1/substrate concentration in linear equation)
Figure 14. P-P plot regression analysis to determine its Lineweaver-Burke linear equation. R square values and linear equations are shown within regression in each temperature via SPSS Basic Statistics v.21. Therefore, standardized values of Kd and OD600 max could be determined in different temperature conditions.
Different temperatures exhibit different affinity constant and maximum binding (Table 3). It is natural that HT receptor possesses optimum tertiary structure facilitating binding of DT in certain environmental condition. Highest affinity of HT towards DT occurs in temperature of 250C. Additionally, maximum binding of HT towards DT happens highest in 40C and 370C. Low temperature might increase the possibility of HT-DT binding, since the molecular kinetical energy is low. Therefore, extrapolation of affinity and maximum binding from different temperatures into single human body temperatures (370C) would be required in future research.
Table 3. Effect of temperatures towards binding kinetics of DT and HT.
In conclusion, positive binding of HT and DT shows that the designed ligand-receptor could be further used as predicted models of diphtheria toxins interaction in human body.
Effect of Extracellular pH Towards Optimization of DT-HT Binding.
Profound understanding of the natural HT and DT binding could be analyzed by measuring the binding activities in different pH concentration."

The Light System
Light inducible systems allow spatial and temporal control over gene expression.     Our goal is the expression of the mCAT-1 receptor through a light inducible     system to allow spatiotemporal control of the virus entry into the target cells.     We used two different systems: expression is induced by light of the blue and     red wavelength range. To test the performance of the light systems, we used an     assay where the cells express secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP).     The amount of produced SEAP can be measured by its enzymatic activity. It     breaks down the substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate to the yellow para-nitrophenol,     which can be measured with a spectrophotometer.
Function of the Light System
Because the proper function of the light system is important for our project,       we tested two different light systems. The red light system is based on the protein       phytochrome B (PhyB) from Arabidopsis thaliana and is activated by light around 660 nm,       whereas the blue light system contains a protein from Avena sativa (AsLOV2) which       requires 465 nm light for activation.
To test the function of the red light system, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO)       that are known to work better for this purpose than other cell lines. For the blue       light system, we tested  CHO cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).       As reporter the gene seap was transfected together with the genes required for      the implementation of the blue and red light inducible systems.       A SEAP-assay was performed after illumination. Measuring SEAP concentrations in the       supernatant lead us two two important conclusions: First, the blue light system works       more efficient than the red light system; second, the blue light system works better       with HEK-293T cells than with CHO cells (Fig. 1).
The plasmids required for the implementation of the light inducible SEAP expression are:

About US
This year's iGEM team decided to continue the work started by last year's team with the Nickel Hunter project; a biological device to detect nickel ions in the environment. Two shortcomings of the previous design were a small measurement range, and low precision. This year we added the nickel ions channel protein NikABCDE gene to the original gene element allowing the ions to enter the cell more smoothly, which has improved both of these issues. We also replaced the RFP gene with the luciferase LuxCDABE gene. The reporter gene emits bioluminescence in response to nickel ions which further enhances our measurement precision. It also provided the opportunity to develop a biosensing instrument for real-time nickel ions detection. Our changes improved sensitivity and range, as well as provided an opportunity for a new method of nickel ions detection.

Yesterday, I have done an overnight digestion of Pqrr4+I13500 and Q04510 (inverter) part in pSB2K3 vector. Today, with this product, I have performed phophatase treatment on Q04510 and ligated them together. This product was then transformed into TOP10 cells, and is now growing in the incubator at 37˚C.
PATRICK
Worked on Biobricker, Wrote a blog post about it.
The blog post at Synthetic Blogology covers what I've done today fairly well, http://igemcalgary.blogspot.com/2009/08/second-life-belated-update.html
In short: I completed the second part of the Biobricker I talked about last Friday, the portion of the code that actually assembles Biobricks together into devices. Remaining to do on the Biobricker is in world testing, and to tie up a few loose ends in the code.
I keep a little to do list of elements I would like to have done for the end of this iGEM season, specifically with the biobrick simulator:
level_select
home
parts
interaction_check
biobricker
cofactors for dna binding proteins
The level select will be one of the last to be finished, since choosing a level and using the parts provided by it will require most of the other features to be finished. The same goes with the Home screen, which will display basic information about the current level and serve as a launching point to the other tools available in the simulator. The Parts screen will let you create objects from an inventory of prebuilt devices, plus regulatory proteins and cofactors; I've already implemented an inventory like system in the Biobricker though, so this will be a copy and paste job.
The Biobricker and Interaction Checker are easily the most complicated remaining parts, so I'm working on them first! The Biobricker, as explained, permits assembly of custom devices in world. The Interaction Checker will scan your nearby DNA, proteins, and cofactors, looking for possible binding interactions between them. Basically, if it could"
INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and microbial concentrations. Our model estimates we have to wait one hour before drinking a non-contaminated water ( see Model ).
Of course, a lot of development works are still required to build a fully functional and reliable device. However, with the results we got, we really think it could be a very good investment to pursue the development of our technology. And we are not alone, the Sunwaterlife company showed a high interest in the project and in the development of rapid diagnosis tools to detect cholera.
4 - How its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environment?
As our system contains synthetic microorganisms, containment has to be the priority during the life cycle to protect the human and the environmental integrity. Two main aspects can be studied: the waste treatment and the surveillance of the permeability of the prototype outer membrane. Those features are critical to ensure the safety of the user.
A systemic approach was achieved to investigate and evaluate the impact of our technology on the social, economical and environmental field at every step of the life cycle. Our disrupting system introduces new practices both for local people and NGOs with a more rigorous waste treatment strategy. Indeed, synthetic organisms are present in the device and has to be properly treated adding other steps at the end of the life cycle. The NGOs have to master the use of the system before deploying it on the field and then to engage in end-user training process.
The GMMs discharging risk is still present but is greatly limited by the use of a double protection. The impact on the daily life as to be as softer as possible. Nevertheless if the project shows convincible results, the acceptability will probably greatly increase. As a result, it will impact conception of the synthetic biology which will be assimilated to a robust technology.
To learn more see our human practice gold page .
Conclusion
In a nutshell, our project based on synthetic consortium explores another approach to expand the field of synthetic biology application and remove its limits. The resulting disrupting technology against cholera brings a lot of advantages: conditional activation when needed, good sensitivity, no GMMs dissemination, reduction of V. cholerae spreading, cheap usage, low risk of antibiotic resistant strains. The use of synthetic consortium worked well for the cholera thematic, but we feel that such strategies will be more and more common in the iGEM competition and synthetic biology.

Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan_-_-_TEXT.html," We all felt excited! Besides, we attended the meets up held by NCTU Formosa, we all learnt a lot in that meets up.
2014  July
We encountered great difficulties and problems -- The school of life sciences, where we were doing experiments before, made a move to a new place (Our new school region). During this chaotic time, our lab had been strongly destroyed into a mass. Many plasmids and DNA we made successfully before got lost, and we all felt very upset.
2014  June
We needed to take the final examinations , so we had a quite long rest for iGEM.
2014  May
We helped Tongji iGEM team with their project and wikis, and at the same time we started the wet experiments of the project. We constructed the first plasmid we need successfully!
2014  April
Our lab was constructed successfully, and our design of project was completed preliminarily. So we started the training for our wet team members.
2014  March
We formed our team. For we did not have any iGEM lab before (previous works were all be done in a professor’s lab, but this year it could not be permitted any more.), we began to build our own iGEM lab, and at the same time, we invited our advisors and instructors to join us. In late March, the brain storm was coming -- We started our design!
2014  February
We learnt of iGEM competition from the previous team members of Fudan iGEM team. We started to do some self-learning about synthetic biology, and we also held some salons for synthetic biology.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," :
I do not agree with it. The above referred preventing sugar as the clearest solution to avoiding obesity, so there are two ways to reach this goal--not to eat sugar or utilizing the transgenic bacteria. Why do we have to spend so much time on creating special bacteria when we already have a direct and easy way, which is to consume less sugar? Isn't this holding a candle to the sun and what we got eventually is the same outcome as the former?
   
 Next, if we no longer suffer from obesity due to consuming sugar, then everyone will consume sugar unrestrained. Think about this, we may be able to eat a lot of sugar without gaining weight, but what is the benefit for human beings on general? Isn't embracing our own desires without any negative effects going to facilitate more desires?  We all know that smoking may lead to lung cancer, and drinking too much can lead to Gastric Ulcer. So does it mean that we are going to fulfill all our desires blindly by creating more transgenic bacteria? 
             
  Furthermore, the ones who are now wealthy enough to eat sugar will as a matter of course consume huge amount of sugar without worry after the commercialization of this bacteria. It indeed will boost the dessert and food industry, becoming a great benefit for countries producing sugar. However, we should also be aware of the labors that might be exploited under the progression of sugar industry. I mean stories of child labors at Ivory Coast being exploited aren't uncommon. Plus that erecting laws and restrainments to stop these sad stories from happening takes long time. It will inevitably cause great impact on these labors.
                  
  To conclude, I reckon that the transgenic bacteria may be useful on medical perspective, but it may not act the same way when it comes to the cultural side, suffice to say that there are a few nomadic people who view being plump as beauty. I would like to share a story with you  related to what I've just said: When expertises from Taiwan come to aid of several african countries in order to improve their  agricultural condition, it doesn't really help much, because most meetings are for men only owing to their tradition, but the ones that do agricultural work are actually women. This prove that what we think are great for the world may not be that great in reality.

His pertinent replies to queries were immensely useful to everyone. The session then drifted towards discussing the potential of synthetic biology for the world.
We concluded this event after a short presentation showing the start of our team, our journey until then, and sharing funny stories about our team members.
Project Methnote
We were delighted by the presence of our Ex-Director Prof. Vinod Kumar Singh and our Professors, Ph.D. students and community members across all departments. We received constructive feedback from the attendees regarding lab and human practices. They also helped us troubleshoot certain persistent issues. Discussions were held wherein the community members suggested strategies for the possible commercialization of our project as a product.
Mini iGEM
The session of mini-iGEM was to give a flavor of iGEM to the young aspirants, we have given real-life biology problems to the students and brainstorms them first hand.
Bio-Tech Sessions
Several events were organized at our institute  for aspirants to gain in-depth knowledge of various scientific fields at IISER Bhopal. Extensive lectures on various Branches of Biology were presented to students which included topics such as principles of Synbio, Forensic Biology, Molecular Biology.  Discussion about Bioethics and Biosafety were also held. During the workshops, the team assisted students in learning various molecular biology techniques. Tasks that were conducted during the workshop included extraction of  DNA from saliva and Bacterial Samples collected from various environments, pipetting and microbiology techniques such as Pouring, Streaking etc.
Fundraising
We consider iGEM as a splendid opportunity to exhibit our project which aims to help curb global climate change. We believe that a successful project requires many things to come together, and funding is one of the key factors. We started our fundraising campaign in July. We promoted our fundraising campaign through our social media sites and personal interactions.  Through our efforts, we were fortunate to have received around 18% of our total goal through crowdfunding.
IISER Bhopal Biology Club
The first meeting regarding iGEM was conducted during our institute’s Biology Club meeting held in November 2017. Intense discussion about various project ideas was followed by the formation of our team. After the iGEM registration, we continued to promote iGEM through the club on a weekly basis to inspire our juniors and batchmates to pursue similar projects for future iGEM competitions.

The synthesis pathway of 3-hydroxybutyrate is shown below.
○ Shikimic acid[Expand]
Shikimic acid is a highly functionalised, six-carbon ring with three chiral carbons and a carboxylic acid functional group [24]. Shikimic acid pathway exists naturally in microorganisms and therefore they can be employed to overproduce this acid from carbon sources such as glucose. The Shikimic acid pathway is shown below(Fig.3).
Fig.3 Shikimic acid pathway
○ Results
There are many kinds of acid in our acid synthesis parts, we don’t have enough time to test them one by one. So we chose gene LdhA, a gene coding L-lactate dehydrogenase and product L-lactic acid, as our model gene to test in our whole system.
To verified the LdhA gene, we constructed our gene into pET28a (Fig.4,5), and induced its over-expression by IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside) under 16 ℃ in BL21(DE)3.

Fig.5 The constructed result of LdhA-pET28a
Meanwhile, we put glucose as the substrate of glycolysis (40% glucose solution, add 2ml to 48ml culture solution). After 12 hours fermentation, we measured the pH of the culture fluid. We use the pET28a(BL21(DE3)) as the control. We repeated this process three times and our result is shown in Table.1.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Outreach#TripleHelix_-_-_TEXT.html," the ratio of these outputs allows for calculations of production per cell. Through quantification experiments, plotting output per cell against known concentrations, it is possible to characterise biological parts – effectively, producing a data sheet.
Students must be in the intermediate years of their first degree to compete in the undergraduate division of iGEM and this year’s team features 6 biologists and 2 engineers. Many students choose to spend these summers on laboratory research placements or scientific internships and opportunities like these are intensely important to the students who take them, providing valuable laboratory experience and extremely interesting summers.
The great advantage of the iGEM competition however is that, while supervised (primarily by Dr Jim Haseloff); it is the students’ project from their interests. And though it can occasionally feel like being thrown in at the deep end – once you start climbing the rather steep learning curve, it’s more than worth it.

Freiburg,2008,Team:Freiburg Cloning Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," with the modification for fusion-proteins proposed by the iGEM Freiburg Team 2007 ( FreiGEM07_report_fusion_part ). Keeping the standard iGEM prefix and suffix, the restriction sites NgoMIV and AgeI were added to create functional fusions without stop-codons.
All possible variations of the receptor constructs were fused together in the pMA-vector and afterwards inserted into a transfection vector. The transfection vector is a BioBrick 2006 part from the Ljubljana, Slovenia team ( BBa_J52017 ) and includes a kanamycin and ampicillin resistance cassette. There is a pMB1 Ori and the multiple cloning site consist of the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix restriction enzymes (Prefix: EcoRI, NotI, XbaI/ Suffix: SpeI, NotI, PstI) followed by an eukaryotic terminator sequence. To achieve a strong expression, a constitutive promoter construct was needed. Because of this, the Cytomegalovirus [CMV] promotor was amplified by PCR using the BioBrick part BBa_J52038 from the 2006 Ljubljana, Slovenia team as well and primers mentioned below. The forward primer bound in the iGEM-prefix, while the reverse primer bound at the end of the CMV-coding region. The reverse primer also contained an overhang to get the iGEM-suffix directly to the end of the promoter sequence which later allowed the cloning into the transfection vector. The CMV promoter was cloned into the vector by using the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. To test the expression activity of the vector with the CMV promoter, the gene of the yellow fluorescent protein [YFP] was cloned downstream of the promoter region by using XbaI, PstI restriction enzymes for the YFP insert and SpeI, PstI for the vector to open the Biobrick suffix. The transfection of the resulting plasmid into 293T cells shows full functionality.
An overview about the cloning is given in table 1

The concentration of the ligation mixture was determined to be 600 ng/µl but this result is rather unlikely and most likely due to the ligation buffer and ligase components.
The restriction described above gave the following results.  The cloning of CsgEFG did not work for the 3 colonies chosen; 13.1 and 13.3 were self-ligated plasmids and 13.2 was an empty plasmid. 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.2 and 9.3 were not digested by the restriction enzymes; the only band observed on the gel was the one corresponding to the plasmids.
The restrictions of 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.2 and 12.1 were successful. Unfortunately, it was impossible to see the bands under the UV. Therefore, the experiment has to be repeated.

Material preparation for LB agar. Four new bottles of 400 mL were prepared. 14.24 grams of LB agar mix + 400 mL Milli-Q water were mixed while heating to boiling point. After preparation, the bottles were autoclaved.
Another material preparation was performed, 3 bottles of 200 mL LB and 1 bottle of 400 mL LB were prepared. For the 200 mL bottles, 2 grams of LB powder was weighed and added to 200 mL Milli-Q water and for the other one 4 grams of LB powder was weighted and added to 400 mL Milli-Q water.
Chloramphenicol preparation: 35 mg chloramphenicol was dissolved in 1 mL EtOH 100% to give 1000x concentrated stock.
Besides material preparation, we performed plasmid isolation and after that restriction.
The restricted fragments were put on a 1% Agarose gel. The fragment size of 7 to 9 is equal to 441 bp. However, due to the gel used, these fragments run off the gel. The empty cut plasmid was observed at 2070 bp, but previously analysis showed the insert was there. Both 10 and 12 were observed at the correct fragment size.
Clones for 13 still showed only plasmid self-ligation at 6000 bp. Therefore, the ligation/transformation will be repeated for this one.

An important issue is that dissatisfiers can encourage the customers (mostly                 surgeons) to opt for a competitor which reduces customer loyalty. (7) In the                 case of our medical device, it is crucial to conduct long-term experiments to                 test possible health effects. The process of bacteria removal could also evoke serious customer concerns which could lead customers to choose for a competitor. An effective method in combination with lots of customer information campaigns are two ways to deal with this dissatisfier. Additionally already in the prototyping phase, we                 need to start thinking about possible ways to automate and fasten the production                 process. This could reduce the price of the product and at the same time the wait-to-delivery time.                  On the other hand, a competitor’s action can turn a                 tolerable into a dissatisfier, e.g. the competitor eliminates a negative                 characteristic. To be one step ahead of competition, we need to monitor continuously our product quality.
We have to remark that the validation phase concerning the customer perceptions                 of attributes still needs to be performed. Keep also in mind that this analysis                 is a foresight for a medical device application, which implies that at this                 stage, not every attribute can be proved scientifically.
Barriers for the market introduction of orthopaedic materials based on                 micro-organisms
Introducing a brand new technology often comes with some major challenges to                 overcome. In this section, we are focusing on the different potential issues                 that need to be addressed in further stages of the project. We identify three of                 them, namely the financial gap, regulation gap and human capital gap.
Financial gap
Orthopaedic research is often time-consuming and requires a substantial                 investment during the development, production and distribution phase before it                 can be translated into a final product for patient care. (1) During the current                 proof-of-concept phase of the project, we already experienced a clear need for                 financials. Radical innovations typically need large investments in further                 technological development before a first working prototype can be constructed                 and tested. (4) From the perspective of potential investors, there is a lot of                 uncertainty about the outcome which will probably lead to a long payback time                 and thus few economic incentives to invest in this early stage of the project. (12) The phenomenon of investor reluctance is often described as ‘the financial                 barrier’ which plays a role on the level of private financiers, such as banks                 and venture capital firms. (6) The need for government stimulants through                 specialised funding programs is clearly present. (10"

Figure 2 (C) shows that in the culture mixtures also culture B grows, but not as fast. So it never reaches the same OD amount as the single culture B.
In this experiment we observed that the differently growing E. coli cultures compete with respect to space and nutrients. That is why we decided to use a modified logistical growth equation for the modelling of the competition.
While comparing all growth curves, we made an additional observation. There is always a little fluctuation in the growth behavior.  This leads to the assumption that even when one strain is cultivated more than once its growth behavior will vary from time to time.  So we incorporated a fluctuating r, following a normal distribution.

Safety Regulations in Germany
In Germany there are several important laws and regulations that provide all information                  about the handling with chemicals and biological samples. The so called Gentechnikgesetz , a law regarding                  regulations in genetical engineering, covers all regulations we mentioned in the ‘Lab Safety’                  part. Additionally, there is the Biostoffverordnung ,                  which covers personal protection when working with biological samples and several chemicals.                  A detailed list of all organisms and their risk assessments can be found in the Organismenliste .
Kill Switches and Database
We think safety, especially concerning biocontainment, is an issue all                 of us need to assess. Instead of designing our own kill switch, we took advantage of the numerous                 kill switches already implemented in the iGEM database. We were creating a model describing their escape probability in terms of evolutionary stability understanding them as a genetic network.                 We did so in collaboration with the iGEM team of Lethbridge ,                 who performed experimental work in order to verify our model. In addition to the modeling of                 several kill switches, we included all kill switches ever mentioned in iGEM since its beginning in                 2004 in a database. This                 collection is available for download here .                 Hopefully this can help many teams to gain insight in already existing kill switches, their stability                 and how to improve the already available kill switches.

Homing coli: Engineering E. coli to become tracking dogs
The model organism Escherichia coli is naturally capable of sensing substances in its environment and consequently moves directionally towards these, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. Here, we apply directed evolution to chemoreceptors by targeting five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site to enable E. coli to perceive novel substances. In order to investigate mobility and directed movement towards a substance, an effective mobility selection method using special ""swimming plates"" is designed. Additionally, we attempt to improve E. coli's swimming velocity by creating new parts derived from its own motility apparatus. Based on our selection system, we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to detect new molecules such as tumor cell markers. Once having established E. coli"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," flhDC also enhances motility in E. coli (Ling et al. 2010). We wanted to see how different levels of flhDC expression affect the speed of our E. coli lab-strains. In theory, the number of assembled flagellums should increase (Fig. 8) and thereby have a positive impact on motility.
Results
Our plan was to express flhDC constitutively with a selection of 8 different Anderson-promoters to achieve different levels of transcription. And indeed BL21 E. coli transformed with these constructs showed a higher motility than empty vector controls or WT cells. However, our results were very inconsistent, especially concerning the different promoter strengths when compared to each other. The troubleshooting revealed that we were missing a RBS between the promoters and the ATG within all our constructs. This probably explains the inconsistent results that did not allow us to quantify the effect of our constructs. We hope to finish these experiments with correct constructs soon because we are eager for presentable results!
Electron microscopy
Overexpression of flagellar genes like fliC or the flhDC operon should result in alterations of the flagellum structure or number, which can be visualized. In the case of fliC, which encodes flagellin, the building block of the flagellum, we expect the emergence of longer filaments. In contrast to this, flhDC as the master regulator is thought to increase the number of flagella when overexpressed, since all genes involved in flagellum assembly should be up-regulated.
In order to visualize these alterations we investigated the E. coli strain BL21, transformed with fliC or flhDC constructs, by using transmission electron microscopy. Both genes were under control of a strong constitutive promoter promoter (J23100). As reference strains we used BL21 cells carrying the same vector with an RFP insert. Furthermore the MG1655 strain, as a more motile strain with non-degenerated flagella, was used.
Fig. 9: Transmission electron microscopy pictures of WT E. coli strain MG1655 (A) and the BL21 strain transformed with K777101, a flhDC construct (B). The single flagella filaments of MG1655 are attached to the cell and visible very clearly. However, our cell densities in the BL21 cultures were not growing very well. Therefore we were not able to get good pictures and had to centrifuge the cells to obtain higher densities. This caused interweaving of the flagella and single filaments were not visible anymore (B).

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices#IP_-_-_TEXT.html," good amount of the way to their goal, and this reinforced our motivation to produce such a guide. It is interesting to note how many respondents want to be patent lawyers.
This check-box poll confirmed our suspicions that a FAQ-style guide was the way to go. We likely lead the respondents to that conclusion. We didn't claim to be perfect social scientists. What's a little push-polling between friends?
Reinforcing that we aren't perfect social scientists, this question should have forced the respondent to make a choice. ""Both"" is an easy no-thought choice that damages what we intended to learn from the question. Regardless, we still learned that respondents are generally enthusiastic to learn about both sides of patents.
Patent Knowledge
Our research for the FAQ turned up a ballpark figure $US30,000 for a biotech patent in the United States.  Accordingly, it seems like the median respondent is underestimating the cost of a patent by a decimal place or two.
We turned up a ballpark number for this too. Three to six years is a typical length of time for the patent process to go from initial application, through prosecution, to issuance.
We suspect you'll notice a theme when we tell you we found out about this too. The Patent Cooperation Treaty gives an applicant 18 months after their first application in a participating country to apply for patents in other participating countries. These applications in the other participating countries will have an effective filing date of the first application.
Intellectual Property & Current Projects
This check-box poll illustrates that iGEM participants are reasonably resourceful when they start thinking about applying for IP protection. The majority of people have chosen to use the internet to gather information.  This was what we had expected.  This may explain why learning about IP for iGEM is such a big concern.  The world of IP is vast, ever-changing, and often ambiguous.  The internet, as a result, contains a sea of information that tends to overwhelm people new to IP.  Like us, many might like for someone to pick and choose the relevant information instead of sifting through everything themselves.
As you can see, a large part of the survey-takers don't know if they want to apply for a patent.  This is interest because we can start to ask why.  Have they just never given IP much thought, or do they not know enough about it to even consider applying? Either way, it shows that iGEMers need to pay more attention to IP issues.  As for the other results, like expected, patents looks to be the most prevalent type of IP that i"

Toluene is definitely a volatile compound, left open under a chemical hood 419 mg of pure toluene have evaporate from the tube within 6 hours. Those results show that toluene evaporate with a rate of 72 mg per hours. However, we supposed that this rate could have been increased by the chemical hood suction.  Therefore care have to be taken when manipulating it. Each tube containing toluene have to be open under a chemical hood and any toluene tubes must be left open. Care have to be taken when adding toluene to bacteria culture medium.
The stock solution of toluene will be prepare again for each replicates. With these results, we can then test the lethality of E.Coli DH5α when exposed to several toluene concentrations.
Survival test to toluene
Protocol and tested concentrations
The protocol 12 (available here ) was used to asses cell survival in presence of toluene. We tested a large range of concentrations (from 5ng/L to 5mg/L) to evaluate the overall impact of toluene on the E.coli DH5α cell growth. 5ng/L is a concentration closed to environmental toluene concentration.
An overnight culture of bacteria transformed with our biosensor was realized. 300µL of this overnight culture was inoculated into 150mL of LB containing chloramphenicol at 25ng/mL. This culture was homogenized and separated into several falcon tubes. Toluene was then added to the culture medium to reach desired concentrations and the samples OD600 was checked every hours during 8 hours.
Three replicates of each concentration were done to ensure statistical results.
Results
The graph 1 shows the evolution of sample optic density (OD600) according to the time and the toluene concentration added in cell culture medium. The curve shows normal growth profile with a lag phase of three hours and then an exponential phase for all samples whether the toluene concentration added in the cell culture medium.
Toluene addition at a concentration of 5ng/L and 500ng/L did not significantly affect cell development. The growth curve shows the same profile than cells grew without toluene. At a concentration of 5mg/L of toluene in the medium, an effect on cells development can be noticed. Four hours after toluene addition, the OD600 of cell grown in 5mg/L of toluene increased more slowly than the OD600 of cell grown without toluene.

Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," levels relative to the rfp transcript levels of promoter 1 were calculated. The bars indicate the fold changes. Two independent replicates are shown. Replica 1 = Clone 1; Replica 2 = Clone 3.
Plate reader measurements served to determine the RFP fluorescence. The wells of a titer plate were inoculated with the clones and the RFP fluorescence and the OD600nm measured over the time (Fig 3). During the initial growth phase, all strains, including the non-fluorescent control strain, showed slightly elevated RFP/OD600nm. For all clones 1, fluctuation during the first hours was observed, as well. During logarithmic growth of the strains, the RFP fluorescence dropped (minimum at 4 – 5 h). While the fluorescence remained low for the control strain, it increased for all promoter clones as soon as the stationary phase was reached (>5 h). After that, the fluorescence and optical density remained largely constant. The RFP fluorescence in stationary phase was strongest for Promoter 3 clones, followed by those of Promoter 4 and, then, Promoter 2. Promoter 1 clones showed the weakest RFP fluorescence.
Discussion
Since we used two of the promoters from the Anderson collection for our reporter system, we characterized them further. In doing so we compared three different methods to monitor promoter strength: fluorescence microscopy, determination of relative transcript levels of the rfp reporter gene by qRT-PCR and measurement of the fluorescence of the RFP protein. The fluorescence microscopy provided only a very rough impression of the different strength of the promoters. However, we could conclude, that RFP was expressed indicating that the promoters were functional. The weaker fluorescence observed for Promoter 1 and Promoter 2 indicated that these promoters might be less active than the other two.
The plate reader experiments allowed deeper insights into the strength of the different promoters. In these measurements, the observed fluctuations and elevated RFP/OD600nm values during initial growth might result from the low cell number in LB medium and might therefore be not significant (compare: click here ). The RFP fluorescence remained low during exponential growth. After 5 h, there was a strong increase in RFP fluorescence. At the same time, cell growth slowed down suggesting that both, reduced cell growth and stronger fluorescence might be correlated. In order to fluoresce, fluorescent proteins like GFP and RFP need oxygen (Remington, 2006). The oxygen RFP needs for fluorophore maturation could not have been available during log phase, since the cells consume the oxygen for enhanced cell growth. This"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by implementing the biosensor created by the 2017 Evry Paris-Saclay iGEM team into the Sensynova platform as part of our collaboration requirement.
Background Information
This biosensor was designed, made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Evry Paris-Saclay 2017 team. We chose to use this system as a variant to the IPTG detector module present in the Sensynova platform in order to fulfil the requirement of collaborating with another iGEM team. The image below, provided to us by the Evry Paris-Saclay 2017 team, details the psicose biosensor design. It features the PLac derivative promoter PTAC (BBa_K180000), a RBS (BBa_B0034), the PsiR coding sequence, the terminator (BBa_B0015), the synthetic promoter pPsitac2, a RBS (BBa_B0034), a mCherry coding sequence and finally the terminator (BBa_B0015) flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix.
Figure 1: Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor Design
The inducible system works as detailed in the diagram below. When pTAC is induced due to the presence of IPTG, PsiR is transcribed and binds to the pPsitac2 promoter repressing the transcription of the mCherry protein. When psicose is present, the sugar binds to PsiR, freeing up the promoter and subsequently the colour output.

Design Stage
In order to implement the psicose biosensor variant to the Sensynova platform, a design was created by replacing the IPTG sensing system in the original detector module with the construct detailed above, creating part BBa_K2205023 . We chose to replace the PTAC promoter with the constitutive promoter present within the platform in order to eliminate the need for induction with IPTG. In place of the colour output present in the Evry Paris-Saclay design, we have added our part BBa_K2205008 , which produces our first connector in order to trigger a response from following modules of the Sensynova platform.

One end of the pipe (air out) must be under the water level, so that the air would expose into water of the destined flask. We pumped air to strip the isobutanol to the flask for product collection. If isobutanol could be transferred from the fermentation flask, we expected the production rate could extend tremendously and the following condensate collector will obtain higher concentration of isobutanol than the previous fermentation flask. By having this higher concentrated isobutanol, isobutanol purification will be much more favorable to be conducted.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding"

                                                                              ■ optimum pH value; ◇ pH value stability
      Fig. 1 shows the most suitable alkaline cellulase pH is around 9, as a typical alkaline cellulase. For study on the stability of alkaline cellulase pH, respectively save the pure enzyme solution under different predetermined pH for 30min, then according to the conventional method determine the enzyme activity under pH9. The results showed that, the enzyme in the pH 6-11 range, the enzyme activity can be maintained above 80%. Visible on the alkaline cellulase in weak acidic and alkaline conditions with strong stability.
1.2 Research on temperature stability of alkaline cellulase
      The pure enzyme liquid are respectively arranged in the containing 5mM CaCl2 and CaCl2 free system, were placed in different temperature conditions (3℃-80℃) insulation 10min, then determined the enzyme activity of 40℃ to the reaction of 20min (Figure 3). The results showed that, the enzyme 50℃ has better stability, temperature more than 50 ℃ is rapidly inactivated. While the addition of Ca2+ can significantly improve the thermal stability of alkaline cellulase at 50℃-80℃, which is at 55℃ still maintained a high stability and there are still a small number of enzyme activity at 70℃. This indicates that the enzyme protein, alkaline cellulase is excellent in heat resistance of alkaline cellulase, application in production show a good application prospect.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP is expressed in E. coli, an assay that has been previously used to measure the activity of DCM dehalongenase (Krausova, 2003) was utilised to access the activity of the protein product. Upon addition of DCM to the cell lysate, there was no change in the NAD+/NADH2 ratio. However, upon addition of the positive control formate, there was a change. This suggests the cell extract has no activity towards DCM. This may be due to a point mutation that was introduced during PCR. Further experiments will have to be performed to determine if this is the reason no activity is observed.

(B)A western blot showing the expression of a protein at 62 kDa (the calculated molecular weight of DCMA-sfGFP). The existence of some protein product at 0 mM IPTG suggests that the promoter is slightly ‘leaky’ and allows a basal expression level when no inducer is present.
(C) The image shows the expression of GFP under blue LED light in E. coli  at various concentrations of the inducer IPTG. The graph quantifies the observed fluorescence, correcting for differences in optical density at 600 nm. Expression significantly increases with IPTG concentration as expected well above the basal level at 0 mM IPTG.
(D)The reaction mechanism of the assay we used to measure DCM dehalogenase activity (Krausova, 2003). The enzyme that catalyses the first step is DCMA, the second step is catalysed by formate dehydrogenase. By adding formate it can be determined which step is not working if the assay does not initially work, thus it acts as a positive control.

Revision 2 of the Uno board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into DFU mode.
Revision 3 of the board has the following new features:
1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. In future, shields will be compatible both with the board that use the AVR, which operate with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operate with 3.3V. The second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes.
Stronger RESET circuit.
Atmega 16U2 replace the 8U2.
""Uno"" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for a comparison with previous versions, see the index of Arduino boards.
Fluorimeter
A fluorimeter is an electronic device that can read the light and transform it in an electrical signal. In our project, that light proceeds from a bacterial culture that has been excited.
Its principle of operation is as follows:
First, an electrical signal is sent from Arduino to a LED to activate it. This LED has a specific wavelength to excite the fluorescent protein present in the microbial culture.
When these bacteria are shining, we receive that light intensity with a photodiode, and transform it into electrical current. Now, we have an electrical current that is proportional with the light and therefor to the concentration of fluorescent protein present in the culture. We have to be careful with the orientation between the LED and the photodiode because interferences may occur in the measurement due to light received by photodiode but not emitted by the fluorescence in the culture but scattered light emitted by the LED.  Also, a proper band-pass filter has been placed between culture and photodiode to allow only the desired wavelengths to pass through.
File:Fluorimetro1.gif
The electric current coming from the photodiode has a very small amplitude, thereby we have to amplify it and translate it into a electric voltage with an electronic trans-impedance amplifier. We can choose the gain of this amplification changing the value of resistances of the circuit. The resistances must be properly"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," constructed utilizing PCR and synthesized using In vitro transcription and translation kit and their catalytic activity towards N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate were tested. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance. Figure 4 displays the relative hydrolysis speed of each mutant generated. As seen from these results, a variety of mutants, showing different catalysis speeds were produced. Some of the amino acids changes affected the activity drastically, for example Trp224 to Tyr, Lys227 to Arg or Glu509 to Lys. Other, in silico designed mutations only modulated the activity Asn107 to Asp or Glu194 to Ala. Additionally, large 8 amino acid deletion at position Pro348-Hy356 caused only a moderate decrease in enzymes activity. These results conclude, that a control library of various activity esterase mutants were generated which we can now use to test the viability of overall CAT-Seq system and can be employed for screening of various strength regulatory.
Regulatory sequence library
In order to prove the viability of CAT-Seq approach as a method for highthroutput regulatory sequence screening and orthogonality measurements a mock library, consisting of 4 ribosomes binding sites (BBa_B0030, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0034, BBa_K2621038) and 9 toehold riboswitch variants based on Green et al., 2014 were designed.
Ribosome binding sites
To investigate the potential of CAT-Seq regulatory sequence screening, 4 ribosome binding sites have been utilized upstream of the esterase gene.  The strength of each ribosome binding site was investigated by expressing the esterase enzyme using the In vitro transcription and translation kit and spectrophotometrically measuring the as a decrease of absorbance due to the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides.
Figure 5. Relative activity esterase enzyme expressed using different RBS sites.      CAT-Seq esterase mutant sequences were placed under 4 different RBS control. The enzyme was synthesised using cell free expression system and catalytic activity of each generated variant was measured spectrophotometrically as a decrease of substrate absorbance at 310 nm.

Modularity & Compact Size
It should be compatible with other instruments processing microtiter plates.
Therefore, the outer dimensions of the device shall not exceed those of commonly used microtiter plates.
Narrow Irradiation Spectrum
A narrow distribution in the irradiation spectrum around the desired wavelength is preferred to prevent the occurrence of unintended reactions. This is especially important concerning highly energized ultraviolet light that could lead to protein degradation.
Regarding this criterion, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are the best choice as the source of light. They are small, have a good energy conversion efficiency and emit light in a very narrow distribution around their irradiation maximum.
Illumination Uniformity
To ensure reproducibility of the experiments and comparability between different wells of the microtiter plate, a uniform illumination of all wells is essential.
Our approach is to provide an individual LED for every single well of the microtiter plate, providing equal conditions in all wells. In contrast, a single source of light creates a cone of light with decreasing intensities towards the outer regions. Additionally, individual LEDs allow for a more compact size and a higher operation flexibility.
Intuitive & Flexible Operation
The operation of the device should be intuitive while offering the possibility for advanced settings such as time and position dependent variations in illumination strength.
Therefore, we decided on two possible interfacing options: A convenient operation via a single turning knob and an LCD display which is suitable for simple applications. For more complex tasks, the device can be operated via Bluetooth by a self‑programmed application for android.
Accessibility
To enable other iGEM teams to use this hardware tool for their experiments, all schematics and designs of the device need to be accessible and its construction feasible. Additionally, the software used in this project needs to be available and easily comprehensible.
We proudly provide everything you need to build your own LED panel, including detailed instructions and commented software. This way, the whole LED Panel can be adjusted to perfectly fit the individual requirements of your experiments!
Safety
The device can be fitted with ultraviolet LEDs which are harmful but invisible to the human eyes. Therefore, the operator must be warned by an indication light showing that the LEDs are operational.
While the simplest option is a software controlled statues LED, we decided on a hardware solution which is failsafe even in case of a malfunctioning software.
LED panel: Development
Prototyping
As none of our team members is trained in electro mechanics or had any experience with designing circuit diagrams and circuit board layouts, we had to learn everything in the process. Beginning with basics in electronics over advanced circuit"

In the previous iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element. As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine. To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our target consumer and real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
We designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project. To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts. Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd (the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China) right after we finished our original plan. In later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice to improve our project. On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
After we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them are still fans of sweetness which makes people feel happy and warm. According to what we found，there is an excellent opportunity for us to research the sweeteners. Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that been observed already.
We mainly have two questions:
Which sweetener do you prefer?
What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew"
Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester#Description#mechanism2_-_-_TEXT.html," (T10-24) 10 hours after the transition phase at T10. There was no observable differences in growth curve patterns between KV(u) and KV(i), leading us to suspect that our inducer (aTc) could be degraded during the course of experiment.  After conducting research on this subject, we found evidence that the incubation temperature (37°C) might be the main factor which led to the degradation of aTc in our case.  The decay rate of aTc was reported to be 2-fold higher at 37°C than at 30°C without taking into account the other factors [5]. The major findings demonstrated that overall growth rate of CP3 was indeed higher than CP1, KV(u) and KV(i), which suggested that the following experiment on fluorescence intensity may not be comparable due to the difference in baseline cell activities.
Figure 9. Promoter activity of CP1 and CP3 fitted to the mRFP fluorescence intensity per cell (U/OD600) data, with pBbB2k-GFP Keasling vector (KV) as positive control and LB broth as negative control.  KV(u) = Uninduced KV; KV(i) = 1mM aTc-induced KV, at mid-log phase, OD600= ± 0.4.  The samples were measured every 30 minutes at λ= 544nm using the BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega plate reader, under constant temperature of 37°C.  All points are the mean of 3 technical and 2 biological replications for each plasmid, normalized to the blank with error bars = SD.
Both CP1 and CP3 have the same plasmid backbone BBa_J61002 , with RFP being placed downstream of the promoters.  Thus, the promoter strength and stability of CP1 and CP3 can be inferred from the measurement of mrfp1 gene expression dynamics, observable in the form of fluorescence intensity from the mRFP. Fig. 9 shows that promoter activities of CP1 and CP3 were similar during lag phase (T0-2).  Despite the lower CP3 promoter activity than CP1 at T2, CP3 promoter activity began to increase steadily from T6, which may correspond to the transition phase from lag to log.  The promoter activity of CP3 was constant during stationary phase (T8-24) as reported from the linear increase in fluorescence intensity.  The stable fluorescence intensity recorded in CP3 plasmid could be explained by the slow protein unfolding kinetics of mRFP1,"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Academy of Sciences Leopoldina recommendations on how to deal with DURC. These recommendations state that research institutions draft ethical rules for dealing with DURC and establish a commission for the ethics of DURC that has an advisory function. It was recommended that these commissions should be established at every research facility by 2017.
By 2019, it will be decided whether these commissions are sufficient to deal with DURC problems or whether more regulations are needed. One restrictive suggestion is that scientists must obtain a license in order to be allowed to publish something - and that would be an intervention in free science (National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and German Research Foundation, 2016).
Our University, our Commission – our Contribution
Consequently, there was a new committee for the ethics of DURC founded at our university (Bielefeld University Press, 2017).
Getting in contact with the head of the commission, we learned that they are in charge of this committee but did not take action to integrate the issues into the curricula yet. This is partly due to the fact that the commissions did only get the goals they need to achieve without any information on how to accomplish this. Further, they are members of the board who already have full time jobs and would provide advice if required.
We want to support this new committee and give some input how students and other members of universities could be educated about this topic. For this reason, we initialized the following steps:
Step by Step Integration of DURC issues and its communication into University Education
1.Step: Starting local: An established Researchers Perspective
At first, we wanted to receive information from experienced scientists of different fields of science like biology, informatics, physics and chemistry about the topics Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern. We assumed that they should definitely be aware of the whole topic. We evaluated the current situation at our university. The interviews demonstrated that most scientists have heard about the terms before but have never dealt with them in detail and certainly not integrated them into their lectures.
How should students be informed if these topics are not part of the university education?
During the interviews we presented our further procedure planning to the scientists in order to integrate the education on DURC issues into lectures: For the beginning we planned to provide open source presentation slides that can be easily integrated into lectures or safety instructions. Almost all researchers we contacted agreed to integrate our slides into their lectures.

In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should the need arise, retaining the ability to control both valves and dispensers.
Neptune's Specify Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptune’s “Specify” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through LFR. The “Specify” page was designed to encompass all parts of microfluidic design specification using LFR and UCF files, and this page is integrated with the uShroom mapper tool to convert designs to a MINT elaboration. In this IDE, users can define a microfluidic chip with specific inputs, outputs, and functionality. Designers can also define microfluidic chip parameters such as gradient generators, serpentine mixers and cell traps here. The Specify IDE provides a terminal for interfacing with uShroom mapper, and an editor for writing and editing files. This editor also provides syntax highlighting for LFR and UCF files, and error checking for improperly created files. Also, the Specify IDE has a user interface element for creating new microfluidic operators, making it very easy for designers to add new parts to their chip.
Neptune's Design Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptunes “Design” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through MINT. The “Design” page was created to encompass all the subtleties of elaborating a microfluidic chip using MINT files and configuration files. In this IDE, users can edit the fine aspects of their chip. A developer in this IDE has control over the sizing of each channel, port, valve and primitive in their design. Here users can also modify parameters related to how Fluigi compiles and outputs a design schematic. Parameters like chip dimensions are also defined in this section. The “Design” page also provides a visual preview the microfluidic design generated, allowing designers to see their chip layout as they modify their device. Design schematics generated on the “Design” page are immediately integrated with the build, assembly, and control sections of Neptune, allowing for clean navigation through the workflow.
Neptune's Workspaces | Kestas Subacius
Neptune was designed to be a easy-to-use desktop application. To this end, a file system had to be developed for Neptune that would allow for designers to store their designs locally on their computer, and to modify these designs through Neptune.

What can we learn in the future?
The remaining questions:
How can we search for new ways to couple reduced flavodoxin production to growth? Is it possible to do this?
Will require a reexamination of the reactions flavodoxin is involved in, their roles in metabolism, and the essentiality of parallel pathways.
How can we extend our analyses of supplemental metabolites, in order to optimize cell energy and growth?
A possible approach to this problem involves extending our analysis from simple metabolites to more complex cell media.  Given a database of available media, or a way to create our own media, we could provide a comprehensive formula for lab use that is optimized to provide the most energy to the cell.

Experiments and Results
The experiment to quantify GFP expression induced by Hg was made according to the protocol “Quantification of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) induced by different concentrations of mercury in Escherichia coli DH5α”.
DH5α transformed with BBa_K1355002 was inoculated in LM (LB with low concentration of NaCl) liquid medium with chloramphenicol and grew until the Optical Density was 0.4 to 0.6abs (measured on spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength). After cell growth, an aliquot of 500μl in 5 eppendorf tubes (2ml) was taken and then added mercury chloride in order to achieve the concentrations of: 0.01 µg/ml, 0.02 µg/ml, 0.1 µg/ml, 0.2 µg/ml, and 1 µg/ml. The samples were incubated at 37°C on shaker. We collected each eppendorf tube at time 1 (01:30 hours of incubation), time 2 (03:00 hours of incubation) and time 3 (04:30 hours of incubation). Every sample was centrifuged at 12000g for 3 minutes and the pellet washed with TN Buffer (Nacl 0.15M + Tris HCl 10mM) and then re-suspended with 500μl of the same buffer. The same process was made to the bacterium without construction as a control to GFP expression/intensity. GFP expression was measured using the Hidex Chameleon spectrofluorimeter with excitation filter 340 nm and emission filter 500 nm wavelength. The Optical Density was measured simultaneously. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM Competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research in general, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began when four UCSC team members Skyped with two members of the UM team. During the meeting, we exchanged information about our projects and our progress on them, and we noticed that the human practices portion of UM’s project was lacking; with our strong background in outreach and human practices, we helped UM develop their own. Four of our iGEM team members met the UM team at their lab in Minnesota. When talking with them, we realized that their project had much more potential value than they were aiming for; we advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project target (mercury ion pollution), and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option. We believe we significantly helped the UM team by mentoring them in these various aspects of their project.

We discovered an iGEM team in Montpellier, France through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. UCSC team members Skyped with the Montpellier members and discussed our projects and progress. We suggested that the Montpellier team spend more"

What kind of cells should we use in experiment?  The research interest of Prof. Ding is microbial molecular genetics and synthetic biology. In the early stage of our project design, we consulted Prof. Ding about the carriers built by the system. In terms of this direction,  he gave us suggestions that the system is more suitable to be built in eukaryotic cells and in this way it is likely to have a higher prospect of success in application. Therefore, we chose 293T and Hela cells to build STEP system.

Which track should STEP be applied to, therapy or diagnositics? In the brainstoming stage of our project design, we considered using our core receptor system to detect cancer or thrombotic diseases. Prof. Zhong believed that the current methods for the detection of common diseases were mostly based on colloidal gold test paper. However, for specific diseases such as cancer, blood is usually drawn for blood test. The relevant technology has matured with low detection cost. Such a receptor system may be overqualified if it only aim at detecting the occurrence of a disease. Therefore, he proposed that it would be more promising for us to apply our STEP system into a therapeutic project instead of a diagnostic one.

Which cancer would be our target? After we introduced our project's design and execution, Prof. Chen commended the originality of the idea of our STEP system, and pointed that the the the tools for researching the system can be enriched further. Moreover, he recommended that we could focus on a more specific and clinical situation, which may make it more attractive to those potential investors. Prof. Chen, who has an education background in biology, once worked in pharmaceutical company and now proceeds research for clinical medicine. From his perspective, figuring out a reliable solution to a single problem is more worthy than a hazy answer to a universal question. Thanks for his working experience in medicine industry, we turned our attention to a specific disease, named ""Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"", as the concentration of D-Dimer and VEGF in blood has a strong correlation with it.
