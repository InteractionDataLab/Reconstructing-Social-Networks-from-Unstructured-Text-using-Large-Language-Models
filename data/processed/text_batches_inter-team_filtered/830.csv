UCL,2016,Team:UCL#HP#Silver#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," (BBSRC) is a PhD programme with a particular focus on interdisciplinary research. It is currently attended by about a hundred students studying at UCL, King's College London, Royal Veterinary College, Birkbeck, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary.
During LIDo retreat, we run a synthetic biology workshop for both students and staff involved in the programme. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the programme, we prepared a wide range of activities for researchers from all backgrounds. For those unfamiliar with synthetic biology, we prepared mini-posters describing ways in which it can be used to solve some of the world's biggest problems. We talked about the Braunschweig 2014 team's E. cowli, which help to reduce the amount of methane produced by cows and thus prevent the global warming, about plastic-degrading bacteria designed by Imperial College 2013 team, biofuel-producing bacteria created by the University of Washington 2011 team and about University of Colorado Boulder 2014 team's idea on how to use phages to fight antibiotic resistance. The attendants were also encouraged to propose their own ideas and discuss related scientific and ethical issues, business viability of the idea and its impact on the society.
We also prepared a synthbio game composed of plasmid backbones with standard iGEM prefixes and suffixes surrounding elements such as (but not limited to) genes of interest. The players were asked to figure out the way of joining the biobricks into a new, longer biobrick using restriction enzymes and selection by antibiotic resistance. The players on their own initiative commented on the advantages of the biobrick format and a discussion on pros and cons of the standarised technique followed.
Finally, we presented our poster and received some feedback on our project.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread fish disease"

Overview
‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ is a system containing electronic components, mechanical components, biology components (several kinds of genetic engineered bacteria) and software working with them. Using this system, you can monitor the contaminants concentrations whenever and wherever in a cheap and easy way.
A typical ‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ at least include:
A Microbial Fuel Cell
 -- cathode chamber and anode chamber
 -- carbon fiber felt
 -- proton exchange membrane
A MCU -- such as pcDuino3 board
A voltage magnification circuit board
An Analogue-to-Digital Conversion chip
A set of input and output devices--C such as touch screen
One or several kinds of bacteria--C such as genetic engineered E.coli
Till now, we have made two versions of Micro Holmes concentration measurement system, the professional version and the portable version. Their main principles are totally same. The only difference is that the professional version has a set of complicated MFCs (6 cathode and anode chambers with thermostats and magnetic stirrers) and can automatically change sample. On the other hand, the portable version has its own incomparable merits. Portable ones are cheap, handiness and fit for complex working environment.
We will bring a portable version of our ‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ to the Giant Jamboree. So this Manual will concentrate on the portable version.
Quick Guide
1.  Power On: Press the power button more than 3 seconds till the power light sparkles.
2.  The touch screen will show the ‘Welcome screen’, please wait until the ‘MODE’ screen appears.
3.  Select the ‘Standard Cure (Initialization)’ mode to work out a formula showing the correlation between the concentration of contaminants and the output voltage of MFC (or load an existing one)
4.  If you want to load an existing formula, just click the ‘OPEN’ icon, and then select a save file (Then please go to step 7). If you want to work out a new formula please click ‘ADD’, and then input the current concentration of contaminants ended with the"

Biobrick design
Principle OF THE BIOBRICK DESIGN IN AN IGEM CONTEXT
Biobrick definition
In the context of iGEM, our genetic circuit, encoded as a plasmid, is defined as a BioBrick. The different elements of the genetic circuit contribute to the function of the BioBrick. In the iGEM registry, we can distinguish 2 components that compose a plasmid: the plasmid backbone and the BioBrick part (see Figure 2).
Figure 1: General structure of a BioBrick (source here )
For the assembly of our biobrick we use the BioBrick RFC[10] assembly standard because it is the standard of the IGEM competition and most of the parts available on the registry match this standard. The BioBrick RFC[10] assembly standard is based on the use of a prefix and a suffix placed at the extremities of each part to be assembled in order to obtain standard BioBricks that are compatible and thus can be easily assembled.
Biobrick RFC[10] assembly standard
Prefix and suffix
Prefix and suffix provide a method to obtain standard genetic construction. Their exact sequences are available in Figure 2. Each one includes two different restriction sites:
- EcoRI and XbaI in the prefix
- SpeI and PstI in the suffix
For protein coding regions (that starts with ATG), there"

Results basic parts & assembly of the mutators
Overview
We want to construct parts for in vivo mutagensis and assemble them to two mutators systems, which pose the main    driving force for our ongoing Evobody evolution system.
In this article we will sum up our design and construction of the mutator constructs used for in vivo characterization by reversion assays and high-throughput sequencing as well as the associated reporter systems.
Promoter
Error prone polymerase I
Genome wide mutator
Reporter
Promoter
We started by choosing the araC-PBAD regulatory unit from BBa_K808000 . This promoter is known for low basal expression and is therfore the     perfect regulatory unit for the expression of potentially toxic mutator genes. Furthermore we wanted to modify this promoter to     yield an even lower basal activity.    Therefore, we screened the synthetic PBAD library from iGEM DTU-Denmark 2013 and chose the promoter from Col.13. Advantages of this promoter    are the very low basal activity while still maintaining a high activity when induced.
We obtained our modified PBAD BBa_K2082112 through site-directed mutagenesis of BBa_K808000 .

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," our project. At the same time, other possible methods for project development had also been discussed to    get the best possible design in which will be easy for future researchers to use. Characteristics of our project such as    effectiveness, sensitivity, and consistency has been considered throughout the discussion and had been integrated into    the project afterwards.
When we asked Prof. Matthew Bennett on his personal view towards the GM crops, Prof. Bennett pointed out that
“There’re a lot of things that have been genetically modified for a long time ago:  The resistant Monsanto’s round-up corn that are highly resistant to bugs, dependent upon a certain chemical. It has been around for so long where people didn’t think of it as GMOs anymore.”
Although these crops were genetically modified, overtime, people assume that the characteristics of the organism are originated from nature. In communicating and delivering our project to the public, the team therefore has to think about whether this project will change people’s mindset towards GM crops - positively, they could be more cautious towards it, or negatively, they might have an increased negative perception towards GM crops and shun it. In this human practices activity, we strived to promote the former and avoid the latter.
3. InnoCarnival (21/10/2017 – 29/10/2017)
The InnoCarnival is a platform to showcase modern innovation which can benefit humans. During the week, we have met people ranging from young children to the elderlies. After some basic explanation on how the project works, we were able to step further into the possible application of our project. This shows the public that there are no limitations on what a project can do, but it depends on how much researchers and investors are willing to step out of the box and use whatever is available as a stepping stone to build even more advanced products.
4. Synthetic Biology Articles
For the public to believe in synthetic biology and our project, they need to know what synthetic biology is and how it relates to their daily life. Therefore, we have written articles in Chinese and posted onto a local scientific Facebook page to guide readers through the world of synthetic biology. We also tackled misconceptions regarding synthetic biology through the articles, teaching about how we can analyze the safety of those GM food instead of fully trusting the media.

Interview with Prof. George Armah
Professor George Armah (on the left) from the Noguchi memorial institute for medical research and Anne Katrine Kurtzhals (on the right) from our iGEM team. Professor George Armah (Prof. Armah) was head of the Electron Microscopy & Histopathology department  at the Nuguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon. Currently Prof. Armah  is the Master of Commonwealth Hall, University of Ghana, Legon. Prof. Armah has a lot of expert knowledge about the health profile of the Ghanaians as well as the condition  of life in Ghana. For this reason, Prof. Armah was an interesting scientist to interview in connection with  applications of Edible coli in malnourished countries.
Prof. Armah said that he believe that the Edible coli could have potential in Ghana. The main issue would be to introduce the product as a new source of nutrition. According to Prof. Armah it would be crucial to include the Edible coli in the Ghanaian gastronomy. He sees it as unlikely that people will change their way of life. Therefore, GMOs should be incorporated into food such as sweet potato, rice etc.
Prof. Armah spoke of two important aspects of malnutrition in Ghana:
The spoilage of food was mentioned as an issue. In Ghana the access to food is not a problem. However, malnourishment is a persistent dilemma throughout the county. Depending on the geographical location, the people eat  differently. In the southern part of Ghana, the population primarily eat fish and fufu. Fufu is a  staple food made from the cassava plant and this is rich on carbohydrates. The population in the  northern part of Ghana has lots of vegetables and chicken, and therefore they do not get the  recommended ratio of ω fatty acids.
The second issue Prof. Armah spoke of was the traditional and cultural practices of Ghana. As mentioned, there are regional differences of food supply. Furthermore, human beings do not necessarily prioritize out of common sense but rather act in accordance with tradition and delight.
Prof. Armah illustrated his points with the two aspects by giving examples from the northern part of Ghana. Traditionally children are forbidden to eat eggs, which is a contradiction to the fact that children particularly need good nutrition to encourage their growth.

Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

    Based on our idea “Science for all & Science is fun”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future. Hopefully, we’ve tickled all the boxes that “Best Education and Public Engagement” requires. As far as our activity’s scale and dimension are concerned, we are confident to say that we did well beyond the prize requirement in such interaction-oriented education and public engagement.
A “Deciphering Life” workshop in China Science and Technology Museum
    We held a fantastic workshop, whose theme was “deciphering life”, in the dinosaur square of China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM) for three days during our national days. The workshop attracted thousands of audience, including lots of children and their parents, who showed great interest in biology. iGEM as well as synthetic biology was also introduced in our exhibition. The workshop consisted of five sections, including the display board exhibition, DNA model building, E.coli DIY workshop, E.coli war and bacteria art exhibition. What’s more, we eventually formed long-standing cooperative relationship with CSTM, which will be a public educational base for later Tsinghua-A teams’ human practice.
I Display board explanation
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made 12 display boards in total, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents"

We helped 3 other iGEM teams:
1. Stony Brook iGEM Team
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook
The Stony Brook iGEM team undertook the task of investigating the survivability of yeast under desiccation, an experiment equivalent to the one our team has conducted on E. Coli. Given the many potential uses that desiccated yeast could offer to iGEM as well as the scientific community as a whole, we’ve agreed to replicate the desiccation experiments performed by Stony Brook in an effort to corroborate their data. Their protocol consisted of exposing yeast to 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours of dehydration in an incubator. 20 microliters of yeast were placed on separate segments of parafilm which were left in an incubator for the aforementioned amounts of time. Afterwards the yeast was rehydrated and plated. Approximately 2 days later the colonies on the plates were counted. The results of our study are shown below:
Note: Given that the amount of yeast that would grow after little or no desiccation would surpass the capacity of the plates or prove difficult to count, we performed a 1 to 10,000 dilution of the 0 hrs of desiccation and multiplied the colonies by 10,000 to account for the dilution. A 1 to 100 dilution was performed on the 2 hrs of desiccation and the colonies multiplied by 100. There were no other dilutions performed on the 4-8 hrs of desiccation.

We   performed a single restriction digest of limonene synthase plasmid   using the enzyme EcoR1, another single restriction digest using the   enzyme Pst1, and a double restriction digest using both enzymes. The   fragments obtained from these digests were then run on an agarose gel. However, these digests did not work. 
 
Day 26 (01/07/14): 
E.coli transformed with the promoter parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119 that had been grown up overnight were minipreped, and the plasmid obtained from each stored at -20°C.  
As   yesterday’s digest of limonene synthase had not gone correctly, this   was repeated today. Limonene synthase gene in the plasmid backbone   psb1C3 was digested singly with EcoR1 and Pst1, and doubly with both   enzymes. This was then run on the gel again and the correct parts had been obtained, although there had been a problem with the gel so this will be repeated on Monday.

We   than ran the digests on agarose gels to check the correct size parts   had been obtained. Due to running out of time the gels were not able to   be left running long enough and therefore when imaged the bands had not   separated. We will therefore repeat this work tomorrow.

Hallo
schön, dass Ihr es auf unsere Info Seite geschafft habt. Wir sind das iGEM Team der Goethe Uni Frankfurt und derzeit auf der Suche nach neuen Biologie-Begeisterten, die im kommenden Jahr (2013) mit uns am iGEM Wettbewerb teilnehmen möchten. Auf dieser Seite stellen wir kurz den Wettbewerb wie auch uns selbst vor. Wenn Ihr noch mehr wissen wollt, dann vergesst nicht zu unseren Treffen zu kommen :

Was ist dieses ""iGEM""?
iGEM ist ein Akronym für international genetically engineered maschine competition. Es handelt sich um einen internationalen Wettbewerb in welchem Teams aus hauptsächlich untergraduierten Studierenden verschiedener Universitäten innerhalb einiger Monate ein molekularbiologisches Projekt beginnen und umsetzen. iGEM wird jährlich ausgetragen, der offizielle Start des Wettbewerbs ist März, von da an ist Zeit bis Ende September. Ziel des Wettbewerbes ist mit Hilfe der synthetischen Biologie Lösungen für wissenschaftliche, ökologische oder ökonomische Probleme zu finden und diese im Labor umzusetzen. Dabei werden Organismen genetisch so verändert, dass sie neue Fähigkeiten besitzen und so z.B. Medikamente gezielt herstellen, PET abbauen können und vieles mehr. Die dabei verwendeten DNA Bausteine sollen über die sogenannte Parts-Registry der Allgemeinheit zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Auch die im Projekt gewonnenen Erkenntnisse sollen im Rahmen der open source Philosophie des Wettbewerbes jedem zur Verfügung stehen. Gefördert wird natürlich auch der internationale Austausch und die Vernetzung der Studierenden"
NAWI-Graz,2016,Team:NAWI-Graz#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," LB–Amp plates and incubated over night at 37 C°. Our further plan was to isolate the plasmid–DNA from the obtained transformants for sequencing. This was not possible because nothing was grown on our plates. After a few days we found out that the recommended incubation-time of 5 min at 22 °C for the ligation-mixture was too short. We extended the incubation time to 40 minutes. Furthermore we stopped the ligation at 70 °C for 5 minutes and also different to the protocol we de-salted the ligation-mixture (20 µl for 20 minutes), as well as, used 150-200 ng of DNA, instead of the recommended 100 ng. For transformation of our optimized ligation we used 2 µl of ligation-mixture and 80 µl of electrocompetent cells.
Week 3 (25.07 – 29.07)
Preparing gBlocks for sequencing
By using the optimized blunt-end cloning protocol we finally received first positive transformation results, more specifically colonies. After doing dilution plating (5 of each strand) (Fig. 13 and Fig. 14) we also prepared ONCs out of the colonies for plasmid isolation.
Another task of the week was to prepare glucose medium, by adding glucose to our LB medium, for repression of the promotors to keep the toxin down. Otherwise they would kill themselves already in the first step of cloning.
Furthermore, at the end of the week, new diluting plating was done because the first ones did not grow in a proper way.

Fig 14: on the left side you can see the blue and the red diluting plates,              which also were working, not all of the other diluting plating were working well, just mazE.
Week 4 (1.08 - 5.08)
Sequencing results and PCR
New ONCs of all 10 cloned gBlocks (in pJETs) were done from our diluting plating. To isolate the plasmid–DNA we used the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit. To get the concentration of the extracted DNA NanoDrop was used and showed results from 22 ng/µl up to 224 ng/µl.
We sent 60 – 80 ng of each gBlock–pJET DNA with the proper primers for sequencing to Microsynth Austria GmbH. The following day, we analyzed the sequencing results and saw that"
Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#Biobrick_-_-_TEXT.html," had been performed on another PCR/gel verification protocol in parallel with the above workflow.
We then performed PCR purification with the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System to prepare the samples for restriction digest.
Restriction digest - Because we had no information concerning the urease cassette, we had no idea if any of the four standard biobrick restriction sites were present in its sequence. Therefore, we attempted our restriction digest protocol in a random fashion, beginning with XbaI and PstI cuts: The gel above represents  XbaI, PstI digests of plasmid pSCB1C3 (lane 3) and of our urease construct/PCR product (lane 4). Lanes 1 and 5 display 1 kb ladders; the last two lanes are spurious data.
XbaI, PstI restriction digests fragmented the urease cassette into four distinct bands at ~2.25, ~2.75, ~3, and ~4kb. These data suggest that at least two XbaI or PstI cut sites are present in the urease cassette itself, though it is difficult to locate them exactly as the digested results do not total the expected 10.8 kb. Later it was determined that the Pstl was responsible for the fragmentation displayed in the above image.  We conducted the same restriction digest protocol with XbaI, SpeI enzymes. The resulting product was much more encouraging as a single band still remained, at the same relative length as our urease construct. To test our restriction protocol, we again ran the same digest of pSB1C3 in parallel.
The above gel depicts 1 kb ladder (lane 1), XbaI, SpeI digests of pSB1C3 + J04450 (lanes 2, 3) and of  the urease construct/PCR product (lanes 4, 5, 6).
The above gel depicts a 1 kb ladder (lane 1) and the successful ligation of the urease cassette to pSB1C3.
Because the urease construct does not seem to have diminished in size, and because there seems to only a single, strong band of a significant length, we assumed that both XbaI and SpeI were cutting only at their prescribed cut sites near the ends of the construct. It is possible that the restriction enzymes may cut inside the construct’s biobrick ends, theirin excising one half of the biobrick cut sites. Once sequencing is accomplished we will be able to determine if our dig"

Next, we investigated people's attitudes towards our innovative tool of curing methods with speeches at streets and got some positive feedbacks. Realizing most people were not so familiar with the degradation process, we educated them in different ways and the public engagement activities worked as expected. As for the transformation of scientific findings, we, together with five other teams, had research on how the laboratory work were converted into products. Our team mainly focused on theoretical analysis of the transformation procedure and got a deeper understanding of issues like evaluation assessment and intellectual property protection. In addition, we had an inquiry into laws and policies with CFDA and obtained guidelines in cell therapy products, which would help our further cell experiment.

Expert Interviews
Part 1  Design
As the project design is the core of our work, we interviewed Professor Nie (from College of Chemical Engineering, Hunan University) about some details n the experiment.
The origin function of Trim21
Trim21 binds to the fc domain of the antibody, and the proteasome degrades the antigen, but the trim is endogenously expressed (intracellular), while the antibody is in the circular (extracellular). They are in two different places so that the meaning of existence of Trim21 protein should not be the degradation of antigen, so what is the main function of Trim21? Is it that the escaped virus carries antibodies outside the cell and is recognized and degraded after entering the cell?
TRIM21 is an intracellular antibody effector in the intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis pathway. It recognizes Fc domain and binds to immunoglobulin G as well as immunoglobulin M on antibody marked non-enveloped virions which have infected the cell. Either by autoubiquitination or by ubiquitination of a cofactor, it is then responsible for directing the virions to the proteasome. TRIM21 itself is not degraded in the proteasome unlike both the viral capsid and the bound antibody.
TRIM21 is also part of the RoSSA ribonucleoprotein, which includes a single polypeptide and one of four small RNA molecules. The RoSSA particle localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
The delivery of Trim system
Method:
1) banding peptide
2) directly transfer proteins into cells
3) nanobody packaged

Overview
We thought safe application was a very important aspect of our project because we thought that in the future our project will probably be directly applied on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolism into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider safe application to eliminate possible complication that our project could cause. We have approached this aspect by meeting two prominent scientists in Hong Kong society who are currently actively participating in scientific and medical research. They helped us to realistically view our project in their point of view and to think about the possible concerns that can arise if we try to transform our project into a product. With the experts, we have discussed mainly three matters: application of our project, biosafety & bio-ethical issues concerning our project, synthetic biology in Hong Kong and in Asia in general.
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in the synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.   In this map, 5 entries are located in Hong Kong. Two of them are in the University of Hong Kong and two are in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, while the remaining one is a private company.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
The concept of synthetic biology is not prevalent in Hong Kong and in Asia. We thought it was imperative to provide information to the public. We tried to achieve this by making short informative yet interesting videos and an interactive blog that introduce synthetic biology and our project. We have included Cantonese to our work so that the public in Hong Kong can easily digest the information.  While we were gathering information about synthetic biology. We observed inadequacy in the amount of information of synthetic biology in Asia. To amend this problem, we have researched information about synthetic biology in different languages such as English, Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin"

LacI: amplified from Repressilator plasmid ""LacI sequence"" - The sequence lacks a stop codon, so we added one (TAA) with our primers.
This Inverter plasmid now contains a cascade reaction consisting of TetR constitutively expressed that represses LacI. It still contains p15A origin and a kanamycin resistance marker, making it compatible for cotransformations with the J61002 plasmids.
The Inverter plasmid is used in combination with the Reporter plasmid in our second reporter system. To see the experimental results of this system, please go on this page.
Sequence of the plasmid: This plasmid was sequence-verified. While Pconst, TetR and LacI were OK, Ptet has been mutated.

Issue 6
The sixth issue, a special issue about software, consists four parts: Project Update from DRY Teams; Open Questionnaire about Software; Project Update from WET Teams and Human Practices about Collaboration & Problems. We did an open-ended questionnaire with the following three questions: 1. What software are you using in iGEM this year? 2. What software have you used in previous competitions? (Maybe you can list some and that will help a lot. 3. What kind of software do you need most? Which features are you looking forward to?

However, every time we were, Team Gifu kindly helped us by offering troubleshooting tips for primer design, transformation...etc.
Team Kobe also helped them. As we were already successful in raising funds using crowdfunding at an early stage, we offered tips for successful crowdfunding to them.
On September 9th, we invited Ryo of Team Gifu to Kobe University. We talked over biosafety while looking at the ""iGEM Safety illustration by Alejandra De La Fuente Menathe"". We also discussed the possible biohazard risk that our chassis might cause and important safety rules we should follow in the lab.
At the end of the day, ""pamphlet of tea-making""(by iGEM Team Kobe) was sent to Team Gifu as a token of our friendship. They are going to spread our work!
In October, we also got ""pamphlet of Japanese Sake""(by iGEM Team Gifu). We are going to spread our work too!

Team Kyoto
Team Kyoto was the first iGEM team we contacted. When we decided to establish iGEM team in Kobe University in 2015, They kindly supported our startup by inviting us to Kyoto University and telling some basic knowledge and tips for iGEM competition.
This year, they also helped us by providing us with KELN(Kyoto-team Electronic Lab Note), which helps to write a lab note by converting documents into HTML codes. In fact, we didn’t apply this tool to our lab note directly. However, it gave us an insight to automate conversion of our documents and tables into HTML, and it actually saved time to create our wiki.
As a token of appreciation, we summarized what we had realized while using KELN and sent it as a “Feedback on KELN”. We would be glad if this comment helps to improve KELN more so that it will be more useful for many iGEM teams.

However, after 5 hours no exponential growth could be shown (s. plot below). Thus, it was decided to use a E. coli K12 derivate strain in TB medium instead, and 30 mL of TB medium in a 500 mL flask were inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells and incubated at 37°C at 300 rpm over night. According to the DSMZ E . coli K12 strain derivates, such as DH5α, are adequate for the kind of school experiment we are planning with the NEAnderLab.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

Eugene currently only has if-statements. We will be adding the needed control statements to provide a fully expressive control flow.
Spectacles
More advanced testing which is more integrated with the completion of entire design flows - December 2009
Spectacles currently exports device information to the algorithm manager and the sequence view . It would be nice to more closely couple this with other tools such as the parts manager . This would make complete design flows much more easy to create.
Expansion of visual cues - December 2009
The current Spectacles tool offers visual cues related to the status of abstract functional parts assigned to physical data as well as a part's adherence to rules. The visual cue system should be expanded and made more user flexible.
More advanced database support for the assignment of physical parts - December 2009
Now the user can specify what criteria they wish to use to search for parts in the database. For example one can search for all parts which say ""promoter"" as part of the ""short description"" or those which contain ""bba"" in the ""name"". However, this system can be expanded to offer more robust search capabilities as well as more insight into the repository where the parts are located.
Visual rule enforcement - Spring 2010
Support should be added which visually enforces the rules specified by Eugene in Spectacles. This can restrict the movement of icons, the editing or property information, or the visual cues present.
Clotho
Complete/Test flow for basic part creation - December 2009
We need to complete the flow from DNA sequence capture, to part packaging, and finally to database storage. The flow is currently present but requires some manual steps and some of the user interfaces need to be made more intuitive.
Complete/Test flow for full device creation - December 2009
We need to complete the flow currently outlined throughout this wiki for device creation. Again, this flow works as demonstrated. However, we are sure due to the complex nature of this process bugs exist. Again ideally we also should do a complete evaluation of the user interface issues associated with this design flow to make sure that it is maximally effective and usable for bench biologists in a wide variety of settings.
Integrate Clotho with JBEI's registry - December 2009
JBEI's parts registry is now available as web service. We should work with this registry as it is a major source of data and users. It is also a way for us to work with the larger standards community.

We are now all settled into our new work bench with all of the space, equipment, and motivation to get a good project going. We've rehydrated and transformed all of the parts that we will need and have began testing out many different conditions for mutagenic PCR on the LacI promoter (R0010). On top of all of that, our wiki is starting to look good. This week definitely got our summer started off on a positive note!
--Monday 6/13/11--
Today we had our first real day of lab work.  We settled ourselves into the lab bench that we will work at for the summer and set up our area.  Along with familiarizing the new members with lab protocols, we had a productive day of hydrating and transforming .  We really liked the linearized vectors that the Registry sent along with the plates, very nice addition. Today we designed what our wiki will look like and talked about some finer of the details of our project such as the exact construction method and a work plan.  We are considering using Gibson assembly for all of our construction although in our lab it is still being debugged in a different side project.  Results are promising though as biobricking has its drawbacks.  Among other things, planning of an all-you-can eat sushi lunch is in the works.  We will plan our work schedule around that.

Aim of the synthetic biology
It convinces first to interest in finality of this science. What are we trying to do? Are we looking to reach a perfection state? When we are working for the improvement of a living organism, in addition to technical difficulties, we have to ask if what are we doing is desirable. Without the egocentric drifts we can easily imagine, we could try to correct our weaknesses, handicap, diseases. Dorothée Benoit Browaeys put in advance that the context can change a « tare » in asset: « there are diseases which give you certain advantages. So to take up the titer of Alain Gras’ book on the fragility of the power, we could speak of the power of fragility ».
However, potentials advantages seem sometimes negligible compared to the handicap: it is for example the case when we are affected by the HIV. And the engendered disease will not be controled, in Willy Rozenbaum opinion, « if we are not using synthetic biology ». More generally, this last one does not imagine « how we could do without it if we want to go towards an improvement of the human condition». The perfection myth seems not to worry him, because he affirms that we are still very vulnerable and far to be perfect.

Modification of the living representation
Searching to synthesize and modify fundamentally organisms push to wonder about the definition itself of the living. Craig Venter affirms that « we pass from the capacity to read our genetic code to the capacity to write it». But understanding and generating life mechanism can demistify it; and the fact to create living machines, in a precise goal, risk to give us a determinist vision of the living. Thierry Magnin wonders « in a context where life is assemble with bricks, what is doing the real difference between vegetal machinery, animal machinery and human machinery? ». After all, we can consider the difference between the three does not come from interactions between « bricks » which compose them.  « How can I recognize a certain dignity of Living if all is built by blocs » ?
Synthetic biology can reveal a game aspect, which can alter the respect that we carry to living organism : to quote one more time Thierry Magnin, « The things with I am used to play, I often have difficulties to respect it». We can create « pieces » of living organisms without of their context, stock, reproduce, transmit and assemble"

Everything that I am and construct in my life day after day are my dreams, the happiness and hope with which I see what I do; this makes science and biology an integral part of who I am, eventhough I study with numbers, the passion to learn, the moments I share with my fellow teammates and my counselors make working in the lab a much more pleasurable and exciting experience. None of these experiences would be this wonderful if they hadn’t been with the International Park of Creativity.

Part 1. Making King's B broth
This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.
Obtain 2 clean 1L Erlenmeyer flask.
Obtain a graduated cylinder with around 500ml of dH20 (distilled water) and add it to one bottle. Record the amount added.
Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of proteose peptone, 0.75 g anhydrous K2HPO4 7.5 g glycerol on a scale and add them to the bottle with 500mL dH20. Swirl the beaker in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
In a separate flask, add 12g of MgSO4 and 100mL of dH20. This will be the stock solution of 1M
If you are making agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar to the 500mL solution, and swirl to mix. Record the amount added. Note that the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before autoclaving.
Part 2. Autoclaving *ONLY DONE BY EXECS*
Lightly seal the top of the flask with aluminium foil, and label it with autoclave tape. Include King's B (agar) – your name – date - iGEM 2015. Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps 2 - 5.
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the flask into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20mins.

a) Diagnostic restriction digests
A double digest with XbaI and KpnI was performed in order to screen for clones lacking β-hairpin sequences. KpnI is a unique cutter, which recognizes G_GTAC^C sequence. It cuts uniquely within the β-hairpin 2 sequence.
Fig.4    KpnI cut site within Ag43 coding sequence.
Fig.5    XbaI+KpnI digest of Bba_K1352001 (A) and Bba_K1352002 (B).
Bba_K1352001 was used as a control. Since it contains β-hairpin sequences, two prominent bands corresponding to 2.5 kb and 4.1 kb are present confirming presence of one XbaI and one KpnI cut sites. Clone with removed β-hairpins yield a single band, which corresponds to plasmid linearization by XbaI (6.5 kb); KpnI did not cut the plasmid, which suggests that β-hairpin 2 was removed.
In addition, a range of single and double restriction digests was carried out in order to ensure that no major indels occurred in the process of In-Fusion and created BioBrick behaves as expected and yields desired band pattern.
Fig.6    Diagnostic restriction digest panel.
Single digests with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI, BglII and HindIII cause a single cut within the vector and therefore result in plasmid linearization. As expected, in all cases a single band at 6.5 kB position is visible, which corresponds to the full size of a vector.
EcoRI+PstI and XbaI+SpeI result in the release of a BioBrick construct from a vector yielding two fragments of 4.5kb+2kb and 4.4kb+2.1 kb respectively.
Double digests with BglII+SpeI and HindIII+XbaI were carried out in order to confirm the presence of FLAG+MCS.

Deacetylation describes hydrolysis of the acetamido group in the GlcNAc-units, thus generating acetic acid und D-glucosamine (GlcN)  [1] .
Acetic acid was indirectly detected via an acetic acid assay kit (Acetate Kinase Manual Format, Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). NADH consumption is measured at 340 nm wavelength. Thus, the amount of acetic acid is stoichiometric with the amount of NAD+ of the last reaction step.

Expression and Purification
The nodB gene was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expression temperature was reduced to 30 °C.  Analysis utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed single bands for the NodB enzyme (approximately 24,4 kDa). Results are shown in figure 6.
After tagging the protein with an His-tag, we performed purification and refolding through an ÄKTA pure system and verified the success through another SDS-Page.

Cadmium Sensing
The metal sensing proteins we intend to use are yozA (czrA) and arsR which both bind cadmium as well as zinc cobalt and nickle, and arsenic, silver and copper respectively.These proteins are repressor proteins which also bind DNA preventing transcription of downstream CDS. The repressor proteins however release the DNA to preferentially bind cadmium allowing transcription to occur. These proteins therefore allow selective sensing of cadmium in the form of an AND gate, a model for which can be seen in our modelling section.

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," that two products can release in a flash because of the extreme instability of the ternary complex. The allosteric process is not obvious.
Ping-pong bi-bi reaction is a double-displacement reaction. Substrate A bind first to the enzyme followed by product P release. Typically, product P is a fragment of the original substrate A. The rest of the substrate is covalently attached to the enzyme E, which we now designate as F. The second Substrate, B, binds and reacts with enzyme F. Substrate B form a covalent adduct with the covalent fragment of A in the enzyme F to form product Q. The enzyme is finally restored to its initial form, E.
In Ping-pong bi-bi reactions, the mechanism is often written as:
And the equation is:
2.Reactions
Although each domain has its independent function, some reactions are catalyzed by several domains together in the process of polyketide’s synthesis, such as activation of propionyl groups, combination of the extended unit and polyketide chain and so on. Therefore, in analysis of reactions of their mechanism, the introduction will be started from the perspective of the equations of chemical reactions.
(1)Acyl carrier protein, ACP
ACP domain is a carrier. Its function is anchoring the polyketide chains needed to extend. The synthesis of polyketides is engaged on these carriers. The polyketide chains are activated by AT domain, and then are anchored on ACP domains. Until the catalysis of TE domain, polyketide chains are released from ACP domain and become ripe polyketides.
(2)Loading Part
The leading role of the loading part is Acyltransfer-ase, AT domain. In this part, we will introduce the function of AT domain by analyzing the chemical reactions between AT domain, ACP domain and polyketide chains.
The function of AT domain is activating the extended units, propionyl groups which will be combined with the polyketide chains.
In Loading, Proplonyl-CoA reacts with the oxhydryl on the specific binding sites of AT domains and binds to AT domain, and then CoA-SHs are displaced. At this time, proplonyl groups have been activated. They are transferred onto the ACP domains in Loading and anchored there.
In Module 1 or Module 2, AT domains anchor the proplonyl groups of (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA to the ACP domains in Module 1 or Module 2 by the same mechanism. The propl"

CONFERENCE OF CHINA IGEMER'S COMMITTEE
The CCiC of 2016 was held in Sun Yat-sen University from September 2nd to 4th, hosted by SYSU School of Life Science. It was a wonderful jamboree in which 36 participating iGEM teams, including our team SCUT-China_A, from all over the country got together giving great presentations and sharing many different ideas.
After hearing our presentation, HaoQian Zhang，other professors from SYSU and iGEMers from other universities  gave us some valuable advices on our program. Every team showed great passion on the presentation and strong commitment to their project. We also gave advices to other iGEM teams in the meantime as many as possible.
COLLABORATION WITH Team SCU-China
After the CCIC, the project of team SCU-China appealed to us, consequently we start a collaboration with this team. We found they were also facing the problems of heterologous protein expression so we’ve reached an agreement that we provide them with three strains, which are Eco.li RIPL, Eco.li Rosetta and Eco.li pGr07, to help them with their heterologous protein expression. As return, they will send us a special strain of E.coli that has the odour gene knocked out to help with our bacterium stinking problem, which is considered to be a big obstacle to the industrial applications of our engineered bacteria.
COLLABORATION WITH iGEM Team FAFU-China
This year, the project of FAFU iGEM team is aimed at killing the mosquitoes by restructuring Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a species of algae)and growing them in the waters.
Therefore, the temperature of the mosquito-breeding waters area will be a key to their project. In order to offer them certain help, we chose several mosquito-breeding waters areas in guangdong—one of the most mosquito-breeding regions in China—to"

From inception, our project aimed to produce a cheap, portable and effective screening tool for diseases. A large barrier to this is the quantification of fluorescence from our genetic circuit. We therefore set out to build a cheap and portable fluorometer.
Our combined fluorometer and densitometer allows our paper based test to be used in the field, in remote areas or less developed countries. It also provides a way for high schools and community labs that cannot afford a plate reader to quantify fluorescence and optical density.

Previous designs
Initially, we built a fluorometer using the previous design by the Aachen 2014 and Denver Biolabs 2016 teams. Their fluorometer uses an Arduino board, 2 LEDs, 2 light sensors, 2 breadboards and an LCD screen.
The light sensors output a square wave with frequency proportional to light intensity. The Arduino uses this to calculate either optical density or fluorescence. These readings are displayed on the LCD screen.
Alleyn’s School kindly allowed us use of their laser cutter to produce the casing and their 3D printer to produce the cuvette holder (as mentioned on our attributions page ). Denver Biolabs' box design was fiddly to put together and was overcomplicated, so in the end we opted to not use it as we didn’t think the extra time, money and resources spent to make it were worth it.
The circuits in the previous designs were unnecessarily complicated. We simplified the circuit by removing excess wiring and components. This made the fluorometer far easier to build, troubleshoot and modify further.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," if they are not necessary. Again, the means, the tools, do not justify the end. Even though I truly believe in that, we also have to be aware of the fact that even not considering the synthetic biology field, we kill thousand of bacteria everyday. When we wash our hands, we kill millions of bacteria for exemple. In our daily life we kill bacteria, so the definition of respecting bacteria has a special meaning. What’s really relevant here, I think is, like it was said, that bacteria are dangerous. So we have to be careful with them and “respect” them.
What is the point of speaking about inanimate objects when synthetic biology deals with living organisms? Precisely because, as a technique, synthetic biology treats living systems as objects (living beings are “chassis 5 ” in synthetic biology words). Synthetic biology should thus be very much concerned about the status given to the beings that are used. First they are living beings and as such should be considered properly (even if bacteria are no frogs 5 ), and then they are engineered beings. Thus, according to Simondon, they have two ethical attributes. Actually, as the objects of synthetic biology are living beings, they could quite adequately initiate the development of the technical culture: it is easier to grant living beings (even bacteria) respect than to grant machines respect.
Respect for technical beings (objects or engineered organisms) can be divided in 3 dimensions: the historical dimension, the existential dimension and the potentiality dimension.
The historical dimension is linked to general technological knowledge but adds to it the history and sociology of technique and science; in this dimension a technical being is perceived according to the innovation, the breakthrough, the optimisation it represents; in this dimension the particular being is relevant only as an example of the general engineered being.
On the contrary, the existential dimension is strongly linked to particular and subjective experience of a concrete technical being; in this dimension a technical being is perceived according to its use, its worn state, the human subjectivity (attachment, kindness, both habit and practice, but also hate, weariness, anger) attached to it, the modifications done on it, etc.; this dimension rarely refers to the general engineered being in the abstract but to the particular being we used.
Team discussion
The goal of iGEM is to add more BioBricks each year to the registry and to re-use previous BioBricks in many differents ways. Probably that next year, or the year after, some team will use our promoter Fur for environmental uses for example. The potentialty dimension seems very important in iGEM.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," fact that quorum sensing also plays a role in expressing virulence, and interferes with the quorum sensing that produces virulence. There are many ways of utilizing quorum sensing for medicinal use, and one of the most intuitive and most well-known methods is quorum quenching.
Quorum quenching takes advantage of the fact that quorum sensing also plays a role in expressing virulence, and interferes with the quorum sensing that produces virulence. However, for our project this year, we decided to focus on engineering a detection method for antibiotic resistance. For the project, we created a test plasmid and a reporter plasmid. We then transformed competent E. coli with the plasmids to produce a test cell and a reporter cell. As shown in the picture below, the test cell produces lactonase, which breaks down AHL, a common auto-inducer in gram-negative bacteria. And the reporter cell produces GFP (or luciferase) which creates a visible difference that we can detect. Both plasmids were engineered using the BioBrick DNA recombination process. With such a set up, it will be possible to detect the presence of the test cell, or lactonase.
For the confirmation of our hypothesis, we conducted some experiments. Ideally, mixing AHL with the test cell will break down the AHL. And, adding the reporter after that will not result in any fluorescence. But, if we do the same process with the control bacteria instead of the test cell, there will be fluorescence. As theorized, the control experiments produced fluorescence, but the experiments with the test cell produced no fluorescence.
Expected Benefits
Thanks to bacteria’s ability to make quick and profound changes in gene transcription, quorum sensing can be used to detect a low amount of signaling molecules and report their presence quickly. With further research and thorough engineering applications, it may be possible to detect other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are unknown until now.
If proven as valid and effective through sufficient tests, this technique could be disseminated to hospitals and clinics to test the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We hope that this technique, once if properly adjusted for functional advancement, can detect antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a relatively short time with only a small amount of sample secured from the patient. This would provide an advantage over the traditional detection methods, culture-based approaches which require one or several days of incubation period.
Because the chemicals involved in species-specific quorum sensing are very specific, it might be possible to dramatically resolve the problem of overnight incubation. Because an initial sample from a patient is usually contaminated and has only a small concentration of the wanted"

The Problem
Biofuels
Biofuels are fuels derived from organic matter making them an available and reliable renewable energy source. Biofuel production is important in terms of energy security and greenhouse gas mitigation. Biofuels are made in a variety of ways using different sources of biomass and yield different fuel sources including ethanol, methane and biodiesel. The different sources for biofuels are used to categorize biofuels into 4 rough categories (""What are Biofuels"").
The first category, first generation biofuels includes biodiesel, bioalcohols, ethanol, and biogasses made from simple sugars, starches, oils, and fats. These biofuel production methods have a high yield in a relatively short amount of time (""Biofuels Basics""). The biggest problem with first generation biofuels, however, is their use of food commodities and the chemicals and energy used in the production. First generation biofuels are subject to the ""Food versus Fuel"" debate, are limited in their impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and have the potential to negatively impact biodiversity by incentivising farmers to monoculture their farmland. First generation biofuels are largely unsustainable for these reasons (Sims).
Second generation biofuels solve many of the environmental and social issues involved with first generation biofuel production. Second generation biofuels are produced using lignocellulosic biomasss which includes non-feedstock plant material (such as switch grass, corn stover, and oilseeds) and agricultural waste (""Biofuel Basics""). However, second generation biofuels have economic and logistical problems. The logistic network for second generation biofuel production is largely non-existent creating large barriers to entry in the field (Sims). A large reason for the lack of a logistics network is the difficulty in breaching the lignin barrier, lack of demand for non-feedstock plant material, and the expense involved in doing so either chemically or with high heat and pressure treatment coupled with the relative ease and efficiency of first-generation biofuel production (Naik).
Third and fourth generation production are still in early development (Sims). Third generation production of biofuels involves using quickly growing cellulosic biomass such as algae. Fourth generation involves plants specifically engineered to have less"

Overview
In order to lower down the repeatability rate of codons, we use intelligent optimization algorithm.  We exploit amino acid degeneracy and alternate nucleotides to reduce the repetition rate of bases of TALE DNA sequence. (See Figure 1) Then the optimized TALE sequence will be tested in wet lab to verify our conjecture whether TALE DNA sequence of lower repeatability rate works at higher efficiency.
Figure 1. RNA codon Table
For instance, we may change UUC into UUU to make one of the repeats different from others while the amino acid(PhenylalaninePhe) is identical.
By this way, we use two types of intelligent optimization algorithm to optimize TALE DNA sequence.
Genetic Algorithm(GA)
-Introduction of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. The heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.[1]
GA has lots of applications in many fields, such as in bioinformatics, using GA to optimize DNA successfully made the sequences have better physic-chemical properties for PCR.
-Our strategy
Initialization
Create a population of hundreds of TALE sequences.
Mutation
Each sequence changes a base randomly under the premise that 1. Amino acids sequence remain unchanged 2. To prevent TALE sequence from being cut, no restriction enzyme site we exploit in experiment is allowed to be created 3. Mutation should not take place on the overhang of each repeat.
Crossover
In GA, crossover is a simulation of the process of synapsis. We randomly choose a point of amino acid, and two sequences exchange their parts from the point we choose to one of the ends.
Figure 2.The process of crossover is a simulation of natural synapsis of chromosome.
Fitness Scoring
We take two main factors into consideration:
1.Repeatability rate of the sequence
To judge the repeatability, we compare the changed sequence with the original one and count the Hamming distance between them. When a restriction enzyme site sequence occurs on the mutated TALE sequence, there"

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343004_-_-_TEXT.html," important part of the flagella synthesis but is also coupled to cell metabolism [ 3 ], it might be possible to see difference in morphology caused by an alterations in the cell cycle G2-phase.
Figure 3: Phase contrast pictures of wild type MG1655, MG1655/pSB1C3-K343004 and MG1655/pSB3K3-K343004. The bacterias was incubated ON at 37 degress and LB-media
The pictures clearly show a difference in morphology of the wild type (picture 1) and the two transformants (picture 2-pSB1C3 and 3-pSB3K3). The wild type cells are small cells, while the transformants are obviously larger, which indicates a lower metabolism of the transformants. Cells with impaired metabolism divide slower and are larger than cells with normal metabolism (wild type), since it takes the impaired cells longer to reach the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.
Flagella staining
When the E. coli strain MG1655 is transformed with pSB1C3-K343004 an increased flagella production is expected. The idea was to get a quantitative measurement of the increased flagella production by comparing the observed number flagella on the wild type MG1655 and the transformant. We tried to stain the flagella using silver staining and afterwards examined the bacteria under the microscope. The staining procedure was started before the composite part, K343004, was finished so that we could optimize the staining protocol and become really good at staining the flagella. We started with staining of DH5α, an E. coli strain that does not express flagella (negative control) and H10407, a hyperflagellated E. coli (positive control). The bacteria were grown on agar plates overnight and stained with this protocol FS1.2 .
Unfortunately it was not possible to see a clear and significant difference between the positive and negative control. Though at some places it could look like flagella on the positive control but it was never enough to determine a difference. After repeating the protocol four times, each time with multiple samples, we decided to reject this method, and another approach for characterizing our biobrick was employed.

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of different colors in bacterial cells, to achieve mixing color in bacterial cells, and stain our roses with more bright colors.
We built hardware to generate lights with smooth distribution on the plates and controlled intensity, to activate our system to produce predictable colors. Our final hardware is designed and built to illuminate our bacteria on the plates, with the help of a projector, to achieve the interaction between users and our E.coli. More information see HARDWARE .
.
LIGHT TO ODOR
Our roses are colorful now, but only with added fragrance can the rose bloom  more vivid, appealing and with a soul as a real rose. So this is our second part, light to odor, making our roses more soulful and real. We first tried to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system[5] to knock out the original gene of E. coli producing smell to prevent E. coli from giving off a nasty and unpleasant smell. Then based on the light-control system, we changed the actuators with genes which could produce various kinds of odors.
The inherent unpleasant odor of E. coli comes from indole produced naturally in the cells’ metabolic process. In the L-tryptophan degradation pathway, Tryptophanase, encoded by tnaA gene[6], degraded L-tryptophan of indole, which produces the odor in high concentration.
L-tryptophan + H2O = indole + pyruvate + NH3. (The enzyme needs Co-factor: pyridoxal 5'-phosphate)
We first tried to knock out the tnaA gene in the genome of E. coli, then we replaced the actuators in the RGB system with genes which could produce various kinds of fragrance. We devoted ourselves to introducing diversified odor to make our roses not only vivid ones with traditional flower fragrance, but unique ones with more kinds of odor like lemon and rain[7]. Thus we can use light to control the fragrance of E.coli, and the function of our system was tested by HPLC. (See LIGHT TO ODOR ).
SOUND TO LIGHT
We could paint a colorful and fragrant rose with light , but it was sound that brought a unique soul to the rose.  To create his/her rose with a unique soul, we developed an online software—Orpheus—to convert music into unique colorful pictures. The users could choose their music or their own voice, and the pictures that they want to ensoul, to color the pictures with random colorful dots. When the music is input, after a specified time, the sound waves will"

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"pie (see [13]). In short, SSA simulates by iteration which processes occur at any time using a random number generator.
First of all, we used the algorithm to develop a code assuming growth of the plasmids and cell division as independent processes. The steps in the algorithm are:
Compute the propensity function of each reaction and the overall propensity function: $$ \alpha_{P_i \rightarrow P_i+1} = r_i \cdot P_i \cdot R(P_i), $$ $$ \alpha_{0} = \sum \limits_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{P_i \rightarrow P_{i+1}}. $$
Compute when the next chemical reaction takes place : $$ t = \frac{1}{\alpha_{0}} \cdot \log(\frac{1}{\theta_1}),$$ where $\theta_1$ is a random number from a uniform distribution U(0,1) we make use of the random distribution for exponential reactions.
Compute which reaction happens: $$ \frac{1}{\alpha_{0}} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{j-1}{\alpha_{P_i \rightarrow P_i+1}} < \theta_2 \leq \frac{1}{\alpha_{0}} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{j}{\alpha_{P_i \rightarrow P_i+1}},$$ where $\theta_2$ is a random number given by the uniform distribution U(0,1).
Plasmid partition after cell division at t = $\tau$
We show below the evolution of a two plasmids system for two different initial conditions: $P_1=P_2=10$ and $P_1 = 10$ and $P_2 = 50$.
Figure 2. Stochastic simulation (solid lines) versus deterministic solution (solid + dots lines) for different initial conditions (left $P_1=P_2=10$, right $P_1 = 10$ and $P_2 = 50$) This figure depicts the differences between these two modeling approaches. When several cells are taken into account, the dynamics are similar to the deterministic solution. However, the intracellular levels of plasmids can vary from the deterministic solution as shown here. Each plasmid is represented by a color and the total level of plasmids of the deterministic solution is in black.
As expected, the deterministic model gives a mean version of the dynamics. Single cell dynamics shows oscillatory behaviour. The levels of each plasmid can vary but their sum remains"

Safety improvements
Finally, a couple of possible improvements can be made to enhance the safety of our project.
We envision a dual toxin/antitoxin system. This is made possible because of our system design, which has two separate plasmids. The basic idea is to have each plasmid produce a toxin, while the corresponding antitoxin is produced by the other plasmid. In this manner, a bacteria can only survive if both plasmids are present. The risk of horizontal gene transfer (if the bacteria were to escape their physical confines) is drastically reduced with the introduction of a dual toxin/antitoxin system.

Grade 11
Hello! I am a grade 11, 16 year old student at Winston Churchill High School, Lethbridge. I joined iGEM because of my interest in synthetic biology and the idea of creating a biological system to a solve a problem. After high school I plan to go to university and work on a degree toward biochem. In my spare time, I love volunteering for a good cause, because I believe I have the ability to. I also enjoy going on long walks around the lake and interacting with people.

Heylo, it’s Alice here and I am sixteen years young, attending grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. This is my very first year of iGEM and it’s been a BLAST so far. I joined because I thought it would be interesting to get some experience in the lab and in coding. And so far, I like what I’ve been doing. My future after iGEM is undecided but I’d really love to take a year off before post-secondary to travel around Russia. In my normal life, I enjoy drinking chocolate milk, being edgy with my mains and reading. Toodles, bye.
Michelle Wu
Grade 11
Hello! My name is Michelle and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School this year. I joined iGEM because I really enjoyed biology and wanted the opportunity to experience synthetic biology as well. So far it has been amazing! Though it took me a solid 6 months to understand a majority of synthetic biology, it has been an amazing learning experience. I like to spend time in the wet lab and work on human practices mainly, though modeling interests me as well. I look forward to a future that hopefully involves more iGEM! Outside of iGEM I spend time playing badminton, eating watermelon, and procrastinating (working hard on fixing that, iGEM is proving that this is NOT effective). In addition to that, I like to run (as I have to have an abundance of energy in the worst times), and spend time with family and friends.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html,", Writing a modeling pipeline
Wednesday, June 4th
This week, we have talked with people from the microfluidics group and it came out that we should be able to use beads to encapsulate our cells and use a microfluidic chip. Therefore we will try to develop this possibility in parallel with the 3D-printed agar chip.
We have set up a modeling pipeline. We divided the modeling project into 3 parts :
diffusion,
parameter fitting,
modeling of the genetic circuit itself, which comprises
a deterministic model
a stochastic model.
We know that the modeling challenges will be to model how integrases work, and to model the delay between reception of a quorum sensing signal and production of a quorum sensing signal by the receiver cell. Indeed, a colony could switch itself OFF when it should be ON, if it receives QS1 and produces QS2, for example. If a delay is present between reception of QS1 and production of QS2, the colony will produce GFP before it is switched OFF, and as GFP is stable enough, it will stay visible during a long time and the self-switching OFF won't be observed. This delay should be modeled.

Week 1 : Project selected
Wednesday, May 28th
After more than one month of endless meetings and passionate debates, we finally chose the project that will keep us occupied in the next five months. From the beautiful pattern made by the Sierpinski triangles, we will focus on cellular automata and try to implement one.
Sierpinski triangles appear when the rule 90 is followed by every cell on the grid :
Pattern given by rule 90 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
Ideally we will use a microfluidic chip. We could also use a 3D printed agar plate like this one to load the colonies. On this grid we can implement the rule 6, which is the simplification of rule 90 considered as a rule with 2 inputs : each cell computes a simple XOR gate of its two parents.
Arrangement of p and q cells on the chip
Pattern given by rule 6 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
The logic part will be built with integrases and the colony-to-colony communication will use quorum sensing.
Every colony will receive two quorum sensing signals (QSp and QSq) from the two cells above it. These two signals trigger the production of two"

Week 1: 04.07.2011 - 10.07.2011
First week! Time was spent on designing the Plug 'n' Play assembly system, figuring out what 48 biobricks to construct, and searching for appropriate DNA templates.
Week 2: 11.07.2011 - 17.07.2011
Wednesday
The first batch of primers have been ordered, so we are waiting in excitement for them to arrive, so we can start our work in the lab.
Week 3: 18.07.2011 - 24.07.2011
Tuesday
First day in the lab and 48 biobricks to go. This is exciting!
We plan to construct 48 new BioBricks. We have now established 17 of them and ordered primers for them with USER tails. We started the day with 11 PCR reactions. 6 of them were correct, and they were purified with a purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Only 42 biobricks to go!
Biobricks in the bag:
pAlc ( BBa_K678001 )
TtrpC ( BBa_K678036 )
Terminator 1  ( BBa_K678037 )
Terminator 2  ( BBa_K678038 )
Terminator 3  ( BBa_K678039 )
argB ( BBa_K678043 )
Thursday
The failed PCR reactions from tuesday were repeated. This time we used a different annealing temperature, and....IT WORKED!

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed."

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Matthieu Fritz (Pasteur Institute of Paris). This jury had the purpose of giving advices on iGEM standards, oratory skills, presentation of scientific content and popularization of science.
The presentations were followed by two seminars on Intellectual Property and the permanent exhibition of a drone model provided by the Civic Drone startup company.
The event also included several social gatherings between the teams such as breakfast, a picnic and a gathering after the Meet Up. We believe, as one of the organizing team, that these moments were also of great importance since they allowed the teams to know each other professionally and individually, an essential step towards a full engagement with the iGEM ideal of partnership.
Participation to the European Experience 2016
The team was present at the great European Experience 2016 in Paris, a European meet-up organized by iGEM IONIS and iGEM EVRY teams. This event was a big gathering of European iGEM teams where everyone could meet and talk about their projects. We had the opportunity to present the first scratch of our final poster. Also this meet-up helped the iGEM teams to start new collaborations. The event was followed by conferences of researchers and experts of Synthetic Biology. The conferences ended with the inspiring speech of Randy Rettberg.
Interteams collaborations
iGEM Cardiff team
We first met the iGEM Cardiff team at the European Meet Up held in Paris “The European Experience 2016”. We realized our projects had some similarities, and decided to collaborate. We had a Skype conference call in July (we had started experimenting a couple of weeks earlier) to discuss about the different dCas9 both teams were using. This opportunity allowed us to share with another team some of the conclusions and problems we had. It was a great insight into the outcomes of another team dealing with a similar challenge as ours.
iGEM EPFL
We were first contacted via Facebook by Marie Matos to set a date for a Skype conference call with the whole team. We had the opportunity to discuss about our projects and to give them an interview for their website igem.today . They have gathered information about several teams and their projects and displayed a few interviews per week: our interview was in the home page during the second week. We were really glad to be invited for such a great initiative. We had a lot of fun while helping to spread more information about Synthetic Biology and at the end we received this amazing badge!
iGEM TEC CEM
Our team was approached via Facebook by Enrique Salas to participate on a survey related to Self-medication and Public Health. Later"

Abstract
There are many applications of the game theory in certain aspects of our life. Each individual has two kinds of choices--to betray or stay silent, and the choice you make would determine your fate. To betray the other side, you may risk being revenged. While staying silent, companion's betrayal may hurt you deeply. As for our project, we work out a new way to imitate the game theory by constructing a community of two E. Coli bacteria. Here we use the growth rate of each species to represent its fate. The effect of one's silent or betrayal on the other species' fate is acted through intercellular signal molecules of two quorum sensing systems. Each signal molecule regulates the expression of toxic genes in the other species and reduces its growth rate. We characterize the consequence of each strategy by quantitatively measure the growth rates of each species in the community.
Background
Why do we want to do this project?
We find that most of the researches in synthetic biology aim to study the interaction between parts of a single system. But few focus on the interaction between systems with multi-elements. However, in the real world, there are complex competition and cooperation among the various creatures. And they can work together to achieve a certain function, for example, different kinds of yeast in brewing beer. There is no lack of the ideas of game theory in these processes. So we chose a classical method—prisoner's dilemma as a model to design our project[1].
The importance of our project
Our project can simulate the interaction among multiple systems in reality and their final states. Through a well-known problem of game theory, we can give synthetic biology and iGem greater publicity from many perspectives. Furthermore, after a slight modification, the project can"

added 330 uL of water to the concentrated sample to dilute it down to 15% w/v
a small note: after refrigeration (4 C), the concentrated sample will look like it has gelled. However, if you let it ""thaw"" for  a while, it will become liquid again.
Spinning
we used an 18 gauge needle to draw 0.8mL of the silk into a 1 mL syringe
then replaced the needle with 10cm of the PEEK tubing
interestingly, no air bubbles formed when drawing up the plunger. (drawn up very slowly)
extruded the dope at 6 uL/min, into 3 different solvent
Ammonium Sulfate
the dope just coagulated into a blob. Similar to cellulose acetate spinning into water
Ethanol (70%)
the dope came out as a fiber
however, sometimes it seemed like multiple fibers were extruding from the tube at once
upon using tweezers to pull away the mass at the tip of the fiber, it sometimes started extruding as a single strand
Isopropanol (70%)
it was very similar to the ethanol spin
sometimes, multiple strands came out of the PEEK tubing at once
sometimes, a single strand comes out
the fibers that came out settled on the bottom of the beaker in a tangled mass
all fibers were left to soak in the coagulation bath overnight"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," we have continued cost analysis comparing the original device manufactured with our rendered picture of our new design and the changes we would make to the new design.  Although collectively as a team we chose not to produce another prototype, we are still planning on doing a full analysis and justification of the chances were made and how this is more economically feasible and positively impacts the end-user.  We began by looking up the bulk cost of many of the materials that were used, such as Teflon and calculating the dimensions of the new device.  Although we have not received a full cost-breakdown of the device, we are trying to calculate the impact of mass production versus development cost would have on the device.  We plan on analyzing all materials that were used in the creation of this device and making a plan with new dimensions to compliment the new design
Week 23: October 6th  - October 10th
This week we worked on the schematic. After receiving feedback from the rest of the team, we decided to make the schematic flow horizontally from left to right rather than vertically. We also worked on writing a script for the narration for our 3D animation of the device. A sample narration was recorded to show the team and receive their feedback to ensure that everything is clear and correct. Minor changes to the script were suggested to ensure that the description accurately and concisely describes the illustrated process. Next week we will be making a final recording in collaboration with the narration and upload this final version to the wiki.
Week 24: October 13th  - October 17th
This week we worked on adding our final information to the wiki and finalizing the website content and design.  Additionally we recorded the narration for 3D Maya animation to explain how our system works with our visual modelling. The animation was finalized and added to the wiki.  Our sub-team wanted to ensure that all information regarding engineering and modelling is clear and shows our iterations of design.

Since none of the proteins in our system begins with any of the aminoacids listed above, and because the term Ln(2)/600 has a value very close to zero, the actual degradation rate for the protein will not be taken into consideration, except when the half-life is available in the literature. Thus, the protein degradation rates will be equal to the dilution rate (Ln(2)/cell duplication time, 30 minutes).

The Northeastern iGEM Team is grateful to the following people and organizations who have supported and assisted us with our research project throughout the course of this season.
Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons
Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry/Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.
Professor Veronica Godoy-Carter
Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
The Northeastern iGEM Team would like to thank IDT for the free synthesis of 20kB of gBlocks® Gene Fragments. Without this generous gift much of our work would not have been possible.
Northeastern University Department of Biology
Thank you to the Northeastern Department of Biology, in particular Adrian Gilbert, Frauke Argyros, and Corissa Mantooth for helping to provide a lab space to work in and materials to work with. This project couldn’t have moved forward without the patience and effort that was put in to make this happen.
Waters Corporation
Waters Corporation generously allowed us to run our samples through their LC/MS systems on site. We learned a great deals of the pitfalls of trying to analyze small quantities of peptides, and also how to use proteomics software, such as Skyline, to analyze our data.
Our Generous Sponsors"
