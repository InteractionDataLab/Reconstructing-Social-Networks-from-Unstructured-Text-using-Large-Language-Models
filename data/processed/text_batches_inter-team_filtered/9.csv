Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," of these cultures. This makes it almost impossible to improve the system by directed genetic engineering. Applying such a black box system outside of a laboratory might also pose safety risks, since it may contain pathogenic cultures. Another disadvantage is that some of the species might be quite sensitive to different kinds of stress. Geobacter sulfurreducens for example is often found in such cultures and very susceptible to oxidative stress.
For these reasons, Bielefelds 2013 iGEM Team decided to develop a system which only relies on Escherichia coli for power generation. The main benefit being that these bacteria grow fast and are quite robust regarding cultivation conditions. Another advantage over a mixed culture is that the potential risks of using such a single-strain culture are much more easily assessed and can be reduced by systematic manipulation of the bacterial genome.
Theory
General design
Figure 2: Schematical illustration of a basic fuel cell design.
The basic design of a microbial fuel cell is mainly influenced by the shape of the electrode chambers. A very simple design is called the “H” shape, which usually consists of two bottles or other vessels, connected by a tube containing a material suitable for proton exchange. Further investigations underlined the usefulness of such systems  for testing materials or parameters, but the power gain is rather low. This is most likely the case because of the slow proton exchange through the tubes and because of a high internal resistance  ( Oh et al., 2004; Oh and Logan, 2006 ).
There are many other possible shapes, like a cylindrical reactor with a concentric inner tube that acts as the cathode to enable a continuous flow. One specific design, proposed by H. P. Bennetto ( Bennetto, 1990 ), is often used for research purposes. The system consists of plastic elements in form of two solid plates and two frames, as shown in Figure 2. The frames are placed between the plates and form two reaction compartments, separated by a cation exchange membrane. Furthermore, every compartment is equipped with electrodes to enable a flow of electrons. To create a system with the option for anaerobic cultivation with simultaneous aeration and the possibility to add or remove liquid, the elements are fitted with ports. To ensure the system is air-tight, rubber gaskets are fitted between the plastic parts. The endplates are held together by four threaded rods.
Requirements:
formation of a closed system
possibility for axenic cultivation
possibility for anaerobic conditions
large internal surface
Anode
In order to be used for an anode, a material has to be highly conductive"

University of Nebraska-Lincoln Safety Case
We collaborated with the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team to build a Safety Case for our project. This is a method of building rigorous logical arguments about the safety of a project that the UNebraska-Lincoln team has pioneered in iGEM. Given the competition’s focus on biosecurity and safety, building this safety case helped us thoroughly evaluate the current and projected risks of our project.

Questionnaire Answers
Why would ¼ of the population with university education not very comfortable (scoring 3/5 or below) to interpret scientific news publications? In Canada, under 20% of the university graduates have a degree in STEM as per Statistics Canada. As such, if the information is not provided in an accessible manner due to unfamiliarity with statistics, inexperience with critical thinking with respect to scientific reports, lack of foundational or content-specific knowledge (poor scientific literacy), the audience is unlikely to be able to confidently interpret the report. Why would most people with a university education trust scientific reports with dramatic and opinionated language to some extent?
Ingrained belief or self-reassurance that scientific reports are based on credible research.
Inability to distinguish primary vs. secondary sources (lack of scientific literacy).
Greater exposure to sensationalized reports in mainstream media (popular science).
More than half of the people with a university education would not verify new scientific claims with credible source half of the time. Why is that?
Assumption that scientific claims are inherently credible, regardless of source.
Inability to determine if source is primary vs. secondary.
Lack of understanding of the inherent biases and assumptions made in different studies.
Although insignificant, why would people with a university education share scientific news articles on social media solely based on the title? What risks do you associate this behaviour with?
Titles have been designed to attract interest (clickbait), perhaps sharing scientific news makes the individual appear intelligent.
If an article is shared by a credible agency or people, the news has ‘acquired credibility’. Topics that are heavily politicized like climate change suffer from this misrepresentation since politicians tend to share misleading articles.
Risks – propagation of false information, misinformation of the public, propagation of false scientific concepts that can prove to be counterproductive to progress. (e.g. the anti-vaccination movement)
The most popular resources that people reference to understand a concept are: Google (scholar), Wikipedia, NCIB, PubMed. What are your views on the credibility of these resources? Do you have any other suggestions? From least to most, Wikipedia, Google scholar, with NCIB and PubMed being around equal. Web"
METU_Turkey,2015,Team:METU Turkey#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a lot more expensive than normal food. That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting it in a vector of yeast that has alpha secretion factor then putting the plasmid in yeast. The yeast will produce and secrete kumamolisin enzyme to its external environment and will destroys gluten while the bread continues to be fermented. We also prepared a gluten detection kit using green fluroscent protein in PQLP aminoacid sequence. If kumamolisin cuts the gluten it will have cut GFP as well so there will be no colour but if it does not cut the gluten than it also has not cut GFP so green color will be observed.
Project Circuit
We modernized m-cherry (BBa_J06504) part to report the absence of the gluten protein in a solution or in a dough that our updated Kumamax enzyme is inactive in the environment. When the absence of the protein of the gluten our repoter gene is expressed and give red light to environment. Besides LacI promoter works under acidic environment in the dough formation.
Kill Switch Circuit
Strong promoter without thickener of LuxR and antiholin sequence: For our kill switch model first we design a circuit that secrete antiholin LuxR gene to supress the activity of holin and endolysin enzymes for working under normal conditions by digesting gluten into its small particles. After this composite part we design a new circuit that our composite gene part secrete a thickener(Xanthan Gum) that dough doesn't lose its stability and viscose structure type for consumers' choice.
Lux promoter activated by thickener(Xanthan Gum) gene part of LuxR and it start to lyse the cell with holin and endolysin activity.
Why did we choose this project?
Having noticed how expensive gluten detection kits and gluten free food are, we decides to do something about it. We are aiming to provide gluten detection much cheaper than the kits that are already sold, so that gluten detection will be easier for celiac patients and they will have an easier time choosing unknown food to eat. Also, with our yeast, it will be much cheaper to prepare gluten free bread and it will be posssible to do this with normal wheat flour.
We also got inspired from Washington and Colorado State Teams. Our aspect was to improve the perspective towards celiac disease, gluten degredation and gluten detection.

Lambert_GA,2017,Team:Lambert GA#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ating with incremental concentrations of IPTG, was analyzed using the Chrome-Q system. Methodology for the Chrome-Q system can be found on the Model page. The data obtained was only calculated for tsPpurple induced cells:
Concentration is measured in microliters (uL). Hue is measure from 0 to 360 degrees , and saturation and value are measured from a scale, 0-100. Saturation values were not calculated because the mobile app’s purpose was to accurately calculate color percentage. Because saturation measures opacity/transparency, and the colors visualized from the cells ranged from a yellow hue (0M IPTG) to dark purple (1mM IPTG) then measurements of opacity/ transparency are ineffectual. Luminance is calculated using the HSV color space.
Analysis of tsPurple Data
As predicted, hue values decreased as IPTG concentrations increased with only slight variation. This variation is found in the 500 uM IPTG samples, which had a value of 100% purple, and is greater than the recorded 99.5% purple value in the 1000 uM IPTG tube. This variation may be an error originating from when pictures were taken using the Chrome-Q. Despite this miscalculation, the 500 uM IPTG was recorded as 100.0% purple because this data point represents the relative percentage of purple against the total set of data. Data representing 100% purple indicates the minimum hue value and data representing 0.0% purple indicates the maximum hue value. (Note: the values where hue equals 400.2 correlates with 40.2 degrees, since values over 360 degrees indicates lighter coloration, such as the “yellow” found in non-expressive E.coli). As for results, the calculated mean was 316.1 uM IPTG, which indicates at what IPTG level the highest percentage of purple will occur. The other values measured were luminance values, which indicated the amount of light emitted or reflected.  These results reveal that as IPTG concentrations increase, luminance values decrease. This portion of the data confirmed the expected results since the lighter cell color found in non-expressive “yellow” cells emits a greater light intensity than the purple found in IPTG induced cells. An important point to note is that the values shown in the table and graphs are averages from rows of triplicates to reduce the effects of variability. Overall, the results from tsPurple and the Chrome-Q app indicated a negative correlation between hue and IPTG concentration, however more trials should be completed to further standardize the tsPurple"

PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and"

About Us
We started to prepare for 2018 iGEM a few weeks after the 2017 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short training lasting for almost one week at the beginning of winter holiday with the help of our instructors and the college. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the training. Two parts of our project, CRISPR system and indigo synthesis namely, were presented at this time. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
Details of our winter training will also be introduced to you here.
Winter training was held a few days after Fall semester. In a training lasting for one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related to molecular biology and synthetic biology. It was our great honor to invite professor Yang Zhang to address several talks related to plant synthetic biology. Laboratory safety was also be emphasized. Considering the short time of winter training, we didn’t prepare experiments as before this year. Timetable of this year’s winter training is"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to extend the time span of the following measurements up to 8,000 sec and to characterize E. cowli in more detail.
E. coli solely transformed with chaperone plasmid C2 served as a negative control. The results obtained here show that E. cowli is capable of degrading methane even for a time span of 8,000 sec, although a slight flattening of the curve becomes visible from about 5,000 to 6,000 sec on.
Figure 3: Methane degradation rates for E. coli JM109 transformed with chaperone plasmid C2 (red dots) and E. cowli additionally transformed with the final construct (black dots). Plotted is the methane concentration as calculated with the calibration curve as a function of time
To further approach the possible application of E. cowli we subsequently tested the methane degradation rates of bacteria encapsulated in alginate beads with an OD600 of 4. Cultivation was carried out either in NMS medium or in rumen fluid to determine the influence of the medium on methane degradation. In both cases the methane concentration decreased, although the slope is not as steep as in the aforementioned experiments. There was only a slight difference between the decrease of methane concentrations in NMS medium and the decrease in rumen fluid (Figure 4), indicating that no inhibition is caused by cultivation in rumen fluid compared to cultivation in NMS-medium.
Figure 4: Methane degradation rates for E. cowli cultivated in NMS medium (red dots) and rumen fluid (black dots). Plotted is the methane concentration as calculated with the calibration curve as a function of time
Finally, we standardized our previously obtained data in reference to the bio wet mass of M. capsulatus to compare all the different strains and conditions used. This includes the loss of enzyme activity due to the pH and the survival rate of bacteria inside the alginate beads. As expected, no methane degradation was observed in the negative control. E. cowli degrades a similar amount of methane as M. capsulatus (about 30 µM/s), whereas the degradation rate of encapsulated bacteria is decreased by about one third. The reason for this might be that the cultivation of the beads does not allow for proper mixing and thus leads to less diffusion of methane into the beads. Nevertheless, an activity independent from the surrounding medium could be shown.

L'UCL
Université Catholique de Louvain was founded in 1425 and saw numerous important persons within its halls.
For example, George Lemaître was one of the first and finest experts in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (1915). He connected the theory to experimental data proliferating in the field of astronomy and presented two hypotheses: the universe is both expanding and the result of an initial explosion of incredibly concentrated energy.
Christian de Duve (1917-2013) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1974 for identifying two organelles, the lysosome (1955) and the peroxisome (1965), which help cells absorb beneficial substances and reject others.

Our biology team also prepared transformed bacteria for us to test with the colour sensor. The set up was similar to what the device is going to look like: in a square 1 by 1 cm, we grew three stripes of bacteria each different colour. For the testing purposes, there were 4 squares. One with all three stripes of bacteria with no colour change (blank), one with one red stripe and 2 blank, another one with one blue stripe and 2 black, and the last one with red and blue stripes and one black. We also had two meetings with the Schulich School of Engineering Machine  Shop at Schulich School of Engineering regarding  our device design. William Gill, an intern student, made a 3D sketch of our device while we communicated necessary volumes for our chambers. We also found out that the range in which the sensor can detect colour is 1 cm wide, so the three chambers with bacteria (three chambers where the colour can potentially change) have to be 1 cm wide all together. Fluid flow stimulation will have to be done to make sure all three chambers get equal amounts of fluid. This week we also got back the results from the plate reader experiment so we can start on quantitative modelling.
Figure 5: The set up for the colour sensor testing
Week 14: August 5th - August 8th
The Colour Sensor Testing Plate was left to grow over the long weekend, so it was ready for testing on Tuesday this week. However, the colourrs look rather faint. When measurements were taken, there was hardly any difference between the blank square and all the other squares. The measurements seem to be better, but are still inconclusive as it is hard to tell the difference between just blue colour present and blue and red colours present. More plates need to be grown to see if the measurements would be consistent. The plate was also contaminated with fungus. This week we set up a meeting with Cesar Rodriguez, Senior Research Scientist with Autodesk Research, to discuss our project and to consult him about Maya modelling. Our existing device animation is at a presentable level and we can polish it later on. At this time, we have to start on the animation for the biological process taking place in our device. We contacted a member of last year’s team to get get help with getting started with ePMV plug in for Maya. We will also set up a meeting with the team members working on the biology part of the project to go over every detail in the biological processes in the system. From"

Honghai Tang PhD student in Department od Biostatistics & Computational Biology School of life sciences, Fudan University
How to gain more protein? In the process of the KDR purification, we still could not obtain a higher concentration of protein after several attempts. Tang has devoted herself to the study of protein structure for many years and gathered rich experience. He proposed it was inappropriate to simply follow the old protocol, and suggested us to screen out the best conditions for protein expressions by changing the formula of the medium, such as adding glycerin or NaHPO4. His input was integrated in our practice. We successfully obtained more target proteins after changing the temperature of culture, the formulation of culture medium and the concentration of induction.

How to make our model promising enough? During the process of considering reengineering vegf-scfv to obtain better protein binding capacity, Prof. Huang offered us great help. Based on his knowledge of medical genetics and structural bioinformatics, he guided us in the molecular design of cancer drugs and used computers to carry out theoretical and simulation of biological molecular structure and interaction. At first, we intended to simulate the receptor movement on the cell membrane to directly study the output level of the STEP system. Afterwards, Prof. Huang pointed that the movement of the receptor on the cell membrane was not completely random, and the differences in different regions on the membrane were not convincing enough. So we turned to the probabilistic model and study the relationship between the parameters of the wet experiment and the model by simulating the motion of the membrane receptor.

Expert in Computational Biology and Tumor Genetics ，Shi was strongly interested in our platform. After listening our program introduction, he emphasized the importance of the math modeling in the whole system. “Only the framework with rich logic will possess a better sense of instruction to the wet lab”. Taking Shi’s suggestions, we justified the rationality of simulation by using Rosetta， and, at the same time"

Introduction
Our project relies on a three way conversation between the team, the public and experts. It touches every aspect of the project, from our choice of application to the details of our delivery system. We promoted Synthetic Biology and iGEM through outreach programs to inspire the next generation.
Urinary tract infections are a huge problem globally with millions of cases reported each year. We’re producing a guide for everything you need to know about urinary tract infections, as well as a treatment to beat antibiotics, which are rapidly becoming ineffective.
We want to make our website as accessible as possible to all readers, regardless of their level of expertise. Words with a dotted blue underline will show a definition when you hover over them.
Project Choice
Approaching the Public
To decide on our project idea, we sent out an initial questionnaire to the public to hear about what they thought about synthetic biology. We asked what big problems they wanted solving. We took the questionnaire to schools, to the streets and to our friends.
Examples of their suggestions for the applications of synthetic biology include bacteria which:
Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Target and kill cancerous cells
Help treat Alzheimer's disease
Produce energy
Sew up holes in clothes
Produce teeth glue
Indicate how long someone has been dead for
Combat antibiotic resistance
Of our responses, around 40 were related to Medicine and Health [ 1 ]. This led us to choose that track for our project. However, it was our team member George Driscoll’s work at the UTI clinic in London which helped us to select UTIs as a specific cause. Due to the un-aesthetic nature of the infection, it often receives less attention with regard to research.
A large proportion of our responses expressed concern for how Synthetic Biology would be used in society, with several references to the issues of contamination and exploitation for profit. With this in mind, we constructed a second questionnaire about our project, to test whether the public would get behind it.
Initial Feedback
We sent a second questionnaire to find out more about whether the public would use a"

Product Design
What is it?
Based only on information about the need, innovators are able to develop promising solution concepts, trying to create something technically feasible, viable, efficient… The final concept will continue to be refined, tested, iterated, and improved during development and implementation.
Summary
The solution iGEM Stockholm has developed for the need “a treatment for diseases with excessive mucus production” is a smart genetically modified bacteria that secretes mucus degrading enzymes. The solution we have developed combines a nebulizer for the administration of the genetically modified bacteria, the genetically modified bacteria and the enzyme that will degrade the mucus in the lungs.
Word list
Microaspiration: Used when patients have an asymptomatic aspiration of small volumes of oropharyngeal secretions or gastric fluid into their lungs.
Vector: DNA molecule used as a vehicle to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell.
Microbiota: Microbes colonizing the human body, includes bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and viruses
Glycosidic linkages: Covalent chemical bond joining a carbohydrate molecule to the group to which it is attached (which may be in another sugar, as in polysaccharides, or in non-sugar molecules)
The nebulizer
A nebulizer is a device that converts a liquid into aerosol droplets suitable for patient inhalation using pressurized air. A nebulizer is comprised of, a compressor, a container holding the medication to be administered, a tube connecting both parts and a mouthpiece or mask for the administration of the medication.
Particle size is of great importance at the site of deposition in the respiratory tract of humans and animals. A Collison nebulizer has been previously used to generate small-particle aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1 to 3 μm for animal exposure studies, this correlates with the small particles around the size of a bacterium (1 to 5 μm) that would deposit in the alveoli.16
The advantage of using a nebulizer instead of a pocket inhaler is due to its normal breathing medicine intake rate. By this, we mean that for the inhalation of medicine through a pocket inhaler the patient needs to take deeps breaths for the medicine to reach the lungs, however, for patients with a respiratory disease, this may not be a possibility due to the narrowing of the airways in these diseases"

Conclusions
As TOP10 strains contains an expressed lacI in its genome, we wanted to know if it was enough to repress Plac activity in a high copy number plasmid in order to use it as a lactose/IPTG sensor. It is evident from induction curve that the behaviour of this part is almost independent from IPTG concentration, probably because lacI production by genomic DNA is too low. So our characterization has shown that  can be used as a strong constitutive promoter, with mean RPU higher than 1.5.  Future work should be dedicated to the characterization of this BioBrick in low copy number plasmids and in strains containing lacIq mutation in order to buil-up new IPTG/lactose sensors.

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Test#Index_-_-_TEXT.html," riboswitch to reprogram the chemotactic behavior of E.coli. The project includes engineering the attraction of the bacteria to theophylline[1]. CheZ is an important protein controlling the chemotaxis of bacteria. They used a theophylline riboswitch to control the expression of CheZ in CheZ deletion mutants in order to engineer the bacteria's movement towards theophylline[1]. We're using a riboswitch sensitive to theophylline to control the expression of CheZ. In the absence of theophylline, the start codon is covered so the translation of the strand cannot occur. In the presence of theophylline, the conformation of the riboswitch changes and the ribosome binding site is exposed[1]. Thus, the higher the concentration of the theophylline, the more will enter the cell resulting in the up regulation of CheZ expression. This will increase the frequency of directed movement[1].
The theophylline riboswitch can be modeled in three differential equations [2].
M ?= a?(T)-?M
(CheZ) ?= ßMT(P)-?CheZ
T ?= ?(P_ext )CheZ-dT
M, CheZ and T respectively stands for the concentration of CheZ mRNA, the concentration of protein CheZ and the concentration of theophylline. The constants a,ß,?,? and d are all positive, and respectively denote the CheZ-promoter transcription rate, the CheZ-mRNA translation rate and the mRNA, CheZ and theophylline degradation-plus-dilution-rates. ?(Text) is the theophylline transport rate per unit CheZ concentration. It is a function of number of theophylline receptors and external theophylline concentration. The function ?(T) and T(T) denote the theophylline-governed regulation ay the transcriptional and translation levels respectively (equation below [2]). KF is the equilibrium constant at transcriptional level and KT is the equilibrium constant at translation level.
F(T)= K_F/(K_F+T)
T(T)= K_T/(K_T+T)
Varying the parameter ?(Text) of above model could help us to understand how the number of receptors and external theophylline concentration effect the intracellular concentration of theothyline and hence the expression level of CheZ. The results are shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 below.  In addition, the response curve of CheZ against theophylline concentration with"

Abstract
The idea that a basic biological system could be used in the production of a related group of molecules suggests that this kind of manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize specific products from a wide range at a given time. The proper strategies for the modular design and execution of such projects are hereby addressed, making it possible to manipulate such modules in a project’s genetic construct with ease and resource frugality. A software tool is implemented for the appropriate design of a master DNA sequence with modular restriction sites placed in such a way that further cloning is facilitated. As proof of concept, a biological platform in the yeast Pichia pastoris is proposed for the production of terpenoids, useful hydrocarbons linked by the mevalonate pathway as their common source, focusing on the synthesis of lycopene. The restoration of an RNAi mechanism in the yeast by insertion of Saccharomyces castellii genes is also proposed for its use in silencing the ERG9 gene, responsible for the synthesis of the terpenoid squalene, further optimizing the platform. Additionally, the insertion of an N-terminus truncated enzyme from the mevalonate pathway to limit reported metabolic regulation is set forth, together with the use of the peroxisome targeting signal type 1 in the enzymes used. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing three inducible promoters with GFP as a reporter.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Rathenau_-_-_TEXT.html," scientists would have to perform a risk analysis; this could be checked by other scientists and would be less time consuming than awaiting procedures from the government.
The last topic to be handled was ‘Ownership’. The first speakers from the Jonge Democraten (Liberal Democrats) said: ‘A cell is nothing more than a machine, which we are allowed to create and modify’. Our iGEM team learned at our debate that we should make a distinction between machines and cells because cells can reproduce themselves. This however, could be useful for scientists as an argument because this means the natural form of the cell can reproduce a lot and we can use only a few of them in synthetic biology without harming the main population or threatening to extinguish them. The second speaker was from PINK! (Animal Welfare Party). His statement was: ‘Nature does not need improvement through SynBio’.  Before anybody could give their comment on this statement, the moderator asked some simple yes or no questions to the speakers. One of them was: ‘Do you think synthetic biologists should resurrect the dodo?’ This question really got everybody to think if we can make up for our past mistakes to mother nature… and provoked many different reactions. The speakers from PINK! were completely against it, while the speaker from the Jonge Democraten thought it could be very tasteful (as our ancestors ate away the whole dodo population).  The K.U.Leuven iGEM participants think people have caused a lot of problems like global change and overpopulation etc. Now it’s our turn to help nature and we can do so with new developments like Synthetic Biology. For example, E.D.Frosti can freeze ice and prevent ice formation. By freezing ice, we could help to stop the degrading of the North Pole and the anti freeze function could help to clear icy roads.

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," their survey on the public awareness of and opinion on synthetic biology, which they had planned to conduct in Lausanne. Together we then went out to the people in Basel to find out about their attitude towards this scientific discipline. In our survey, we found that most of the people we asked had either not heard about synthetic biology before or in case they had, they did not feel informed enough. It seems that the idea of genetically modified organisms is something that causes a lot of discomfort in many people. You can find out more about the results of our survey on our Awareness page .  Despite Switzerland being a small country, there is a big diversity amongst different parts of the population. Therefore it was very interesting for us to compare the opinions we got from people in Lausanne, one of the bigger cities in the French-speaking and generally more liberal part of Switzerland, to the answers we received in Basel, located in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.

SAFETY
As engineers and scientists, we have the responsibility to ensure that our technical work is conducted in a safe environment and that the final product is safe for real life applications.
Northwestern iGEM 2016 took the matter of safety very seriously throughout our project, considering ethics, social justice, public safety, security, and potential accidents at each step in the design and execution.
Safe Project Design
During the iterative process of developing our project, we received feedback from professors in the chemical engineering department, experts in the field of antibiotic resistance, and a current medical student with a background in research.
Many issues arise when considering downstream applications of packaging genome editing proteins in bacterial vesicles for a therapeutic device.
OMV Pathogenicity
One of the first considerations is the significant risk of an adverse immune response to a therapeutic formed from bacterial membranes. Fortunately, research has shown that the surface of OMVs can be modified with a wide range of proteins, including a membrane protein that cloaks vesicles from mammalian immune systems 1 . Along with modified OMV membranes, specified use of OMV packaged Cas9 for topical applications would minimize the risk of complicating immune response.
The unintentional delivery of other naturally occurring and potentially toxic periplasmic proteins offers another safety consideration. Previous OMV experiments have not shown this to be a problem yet, but it is a consideration for downstream applications.
Cas9 Complications
Off target effects are always an issue when working with genome editing proteins. The implications of off target effects in this setting is a concern as unintended DNA cleavage could lead to killing healthy bacteria; however, using OMVs offers safety in the fact that Cas9 will not be delivered to mammalian cells and the possibility for specific targeting using modified membrane proteins. The delivery of whole protein is also safer than viral delivery because it is more transient and is not incorporated in the host cell genome, minimizing off target risks 2 . Effective design of RNA guides will also minimize off-target issues.
Real World Applications
Our product is designed to be used by professionals with medical training in a hospital setting. It focuses on addressing antibacterial resistance in developed countries, with the potential to expand to applications in developing countries with proper production, storage, and transportation conditions.

Visual Simulation
We applied to programing visualization in this complex process based on certain laws of Microtubule dynamic instability.
Tubulin is made up of two tubulin monomers which are nearly the same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments polymerized by tubulin dimers end to end. And microtubule can be the hollow tube with 13 protofilaments coiled into helix with each other, water in hollow part. The tube wall is 4～5nm thick.
Tubulin dimers are incorporated into the growing lattice in the GTP-bound form and stochastically hydrolyze to GDP-tubulin, thus forming a GTP-cap. It is thought that the switching from growth to shrinkage occurs due to the loss of the GTP-cap.

Composite Part
LuxR-I-Plux-GFP
This composite part is based on the Lux quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischerii. It consists of a Lux receiver device and a GFP reporter that is activated in the presence of a 3O-C6 AHL signal.
Quorum sensing is a naturally occurring mechanism that certain strains of bacteria use to regulate gene expression in response to their population density. These bacteria secrete autoinducer signalling molecules, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), that bind to transcription factors to alter gene expression.
In this case, the constitutively expressed LuxR transcriptional regulator (C0062) is activated by the binding of 3O-C6 AHL, an AHL quorum signal. The activated LuxR regulator binds to a LuxR-inducible promoter, pLux, upstream of a GFP reporter. As a result, GFP is expressed when the receiver device is induced with 3O-C6 AHL. We designed this part to characterize the activation range of the Lux receiver device.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

TESTING THE RESPONSE OF OUR RHLR BIOSENSOR
The initial testing of the 2011 Northwestern construct. 50uM of C4-HSL was added along with a negative control and GFP fluorescence was tracked over a period of seven hours. The A and B refer to two separate colonies that were picked off the plate. Everything worked as expected during log phase. However, once the negative control began approaching saturation, it began expressing GFP indicating that it may actually be a leaky promoter. This is useful to know so that once our system is complete, we know that we need to have the cells in log or lag phase to avoid false positives.
The data here is showing that GFP is being expressed after approximately 120 to 140 minutes in our initial test when no amount of C4-HSL was added
This growth curve is showing that fluorescence is being detected in the presence of C4-HSL when the cells are in log phase. However, it is also showing that the cells which did not receive the C4-HSL treatment are expressing GFP when they reach saturation.
This graph is showing that our cells are responding to the C4-HSL treatment. These cells were cotransfected with two plasmids. One plasmid has the Rhl promoter with mCherry acting as a reporter. The otherplasmid has our RhlR protein generator constitutively expressed.
The Northwestern was tested once again and we still saw the same results: GFP was expressed once cells reached saturation. Despite the low level of expression, it can still lead to false positives in the future.
To test to see if the Rhl promoter is in fact a leaky promoter, cells were transfected with plasmids containing just the Rhl promoter and mCherry. The results show that once cells reach saturation, fluorescence is detected, suggesting that Rhl is in fact a leaky promoter.

Although we will be judged only for the software we developed, an important aspect of our work is the combination of experiments and simulations. For detailed comparisons please look at the Notebook in the end of July.
We are submitting our constructs to the Registry.
We also characterized a handful of older BioBricks. Here are the details we are entering in the Registry.
Parts Characterization
Introduction
After an exhaustive search of the Registry of Standard Parts , we found five promoters that were included in the 2009 iGEM Kit as potential parts characterize. Using part BBa_F2620 , which was characterized by a group from MIT in 2004, as a template, we examined the following parts:

We chose these parts because they had the same regulators as the promoters we examined in our project. Part K091101 was particularly interesting because it was one of the constructs of the Tet and Lac operators that we examined for our research.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html," description of the assembled fragments. With this version the Gibthon construct can be exported in SBOL, which is also used internally in the NRPSDesigner when C++ communicates with the Python code.
Beyond providing a user-friendly way of designing new NRPs, the NRPSDesigner also incorporates our novel experimental findings showing that NRPs can be tagged by Indigoidine. The results of the Gibson assembly can be easily screened using a very simple blue-colored readout. This indeed fits very well with the general goal of the NRPSDesigner, which tries to make NRPS cloning accessible to a wider scientific audience: In fact, the Indigoidine tag is a great and cheaper alternative to expensive screening procedures such as mass-spectrometry.
Outlook
With the NRPSDesigner, we have managed to provide a powerful tool that introduces NRPS to the synthetic biology community, making it easier to create novel NRPs or improve existing antibiotics, pigments, etc. As the community gets involved, the NRPSDesigner will also continuously improve, as more domains will be entered into the database and thus more exotic amino acids will become available for inclusion into the final NRP. Also, as more teams follow our paradigm of submitting NRPS domains to the Parts Registry, it will become possible to clone NRPS constructs for diverse peptides by just using parts available in the Registry, rather than trying to access the original strains. For this foreseeable future we have several important changes planned; some of which will be implemented within the next month, while others are long term goals:
NRPSDesigner 1.1:
Database access: Currently the wealth of information available in the NRPSDesigner database can only be accessed by loading the provided MySQL dump. We intend to make access a lot easier for everyone, by introducing a user-friendly interface for database exploration.
Improved Multiple Sequence Alignment view: The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is supposed to simplify the setting of domain boundaries following the automated boundary predictions, giving extra information for the improvement of the HMMs. This view will get more user-friendly, as the predicted boundaries will be visualized on the MSA and the selection of new boundaries will become the matter of a few clicks.
Modifications: You will be able to add N-methylation modifications to a wide-range of amino acids.
User Interface based on Bootstrap 3: To simplify the coding architecture for the GUI and stay up to date at the same time we plan to change the coding environment from Boostrap2/jQuery UI into a Bootstrap 3 based application.
NRPSDesigner 2.0:
REST API: Programatically access the wealth of knowledge"

Aachen (2014)
For controlling the efficiency of the newly developed methane biosensor, it was necessary to have an equipment as reference. Therefore, we looked for former iGEM teams who dealt with methane and might have a basic gadget which is able to determine the concentration of methane. The iGEM Braunschweig ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Braunschweig ) modified  E. coli in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. They intended to place these bacteria in cow’s rumen, which is a serious source of methane emission, where the bacteria would have transformed methane into non-greenhouse gases. They wanted to know how much their bacteria can reduce the methane emission, therefore, they created collaboration with iGEM Aachen ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen) , and thanks to this collaboration, they was given a low-cost DIY methane sensor ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Collaborations/Braunschweig ).
We liked the construct very much, so we asked Team Aachen for the plans and the program of the sensor and we received valuable help, which we appreciated very much. Thank you!
UNebraska-Lincoln 2017
Since all scientific work should be carried out at the highest level human and environmental safety, we found it important to spread the priority of biosafety. Team UNL 2017 (https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln ) aimed to teach other teams to form their Safety cases. They asked us to help creating their Safety case, and we advised them some further aspects how they could  develop their well-written work ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Collaborations#hungary ). We also received useful help from UNebraska-Lincoln team so we could accomplish the Safety part of our project.
To be able to finalize our construct, it was needed to have an effective promoter, which can be used in the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. We inquired whether they know a possible promoter, and hopefully it was not an unknown question to the UNL 2017 Team. Thank you very much!

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test3_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Exploration Results :
Simbiology assumes that all reactions are elementary reactions. For stochastic simulation only the Chemical kinetic and Hill kinetic equations work. Simbiology also produces a diagram of all the reactions input . The diagram view is helpful in establishing the connections between species when they react or form.
The Simbiology simulation graphs produced have a generic y-axis value of state which signifies concentration .
Started to look at other Toolboxes given with the Matlab package.

OUC-China,2013,Team:OUC-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM direction members. The camp members were divided into groups of three and assigned tasks every week. At the same time, the 2012 OUC-China iGEMers delivered lectures, resources, lab courses, sharing everything that they know about iGEM and scientific research. We tried out a new lab management system, which not only made a positive impact on our lab, but also on other neighbouring labs. The Scientific research camp told us about all the basics of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Brainstorming Winter camp
The 2013 iGEMers arrived on campus on February 22, ten days before the start of the spring semester. We were there because we needed time to get together in the winter holidays and discuss what we learned during the holidays.
In those ten days, we got up early every morning and went for a run around the field, then signing our team song, Life in Full Bloom. We read papers and news, discussed ideas and studied past projects. On the last day, we invited professors to give advice on the ideas that we showed them.
Meeting with Dr.Wu
We met Dr.Wu Longfei by chance when he came to OUC to give a lecture. We did not know about him before. How excited we were when he started talking about MMB! After the lecture, we had a long chat, resulting in agreement for further cooperation. We arranged to meet in Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.   At Chinese Academy of Sciences, we thoroughly explained our project to Dr.Wu Longfei and Dr.Xiao Tian. They were willing to provide us with the strain that we need, Magnetospirillum Magneticum AMB-1.
Visit from SCAU
At the beginning of April this year, seven team members from team SCAU-China paid us a visit. It’s their first year in iGEM, so we invited last year’s iGEMers to give them lectures and answer their questions. Members of the two teams went hiking together, discussing their projects and exchanging their experiences. The visit established the basis for further cooperation.
Visit to Beijing and Tianjin
We visited Tianjin and Peking iGEM teams in order to learn from their experiences. The iGEMers from Beijing and Tianjin welcomed us and showed us around their labs. We talked about our projects and had conferences about lab management and advances in synthetic biology. OUC-China is a relatively “young” team, so we learnt a lot from these “old” teams.

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," scientific advancements have also altered the manner in which the News is reported, by decreasing the popularity of historical forms of media such as newspapers, radio, and television (2).  The accessibility to a wide variety of information on the Internet and World Wide Web has led to a decline in privacy, and has increased the ability of individuals to misrepresent themselves, their goods or products, and sometimes even sources of knowledge such as Wikipedia (2).
Initially, the scientists that developed this remarkable method of communication, did not even consider how openly and enthusiastically, people would reveal private information on the Internet or World Wide Web.  Their primary focus was to discover and optimize another communication system, and it seems there was an unintentional lack of regard to the direction and liberties the public would take with this new innovation.
Take Home Message
In the world of synthetic biology, OpenWetWare, an online platform, was designed and developed for the sharing of scientific information between researchers and labs.  If groups are not careful with the important content they share on World Wide Web sites, there is a significant chance that their rights to project ideas, protocols and even results may not be respected. Open access to information on the Internet or World Wide Web, gives individuals and companies knowledge that may be used inappropriately for personal gain and profit.  This is particularly important to our iGEM team’s project, which focuses on cleaning tailings pond's water that are a result of oil sands extraction.  As this project is of significance to both the environment and economy of Alberta, many interested individuals or groups could use the information available online to their advantage.  We believe the main lesson that can be taken from the development of the Internet and World Wide Web, has to be the degree to which information should be shared for the benefit of all.  Unfinished or unsubstantiated experimental data should not be shared with the masses, and scientific excellence and achievement should only be credited where it is rightfully due.

Brilliance Agar
Brilliance Agar is a chromogenic screening plate used for the diagnosis of Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus. It uses a novel chromogen to show a blue colour when Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus phosphatase activity. For sensitivity, it contains antibacterial compounds which inhibit growth of various competitor bacteria. This product has high sensitivity and specificity, which minimizes healthcare costs. However, results are presumptive and would need to be confirmed. Organisms with atypical resistance can give false negative results.
Method
Patient is inoculated using a screening swab or an isolated colony or liquid suspension is used. Sample is plated on Brilliance Agar. Plates are incubated at 37 ºC. Results are obtained in 18 hours. Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus grows as denim blue colonies.

Competitive Analysis Matrix
Rating Scale
Methodology for Rating Scale
The Competitive Analysis Matrix uses a format that divides the product’s market profile into several categories, providing a framework that ensures all issues are considered.  Each category is scored in the course of the ratings process (using a numerical scoring system). Products are scored 1 through 27; those facing greater competitive threats would wind up with an overall low market profile score. Please note that ratings represent, in the end, an opinion. Please note, thorough assessment of each product’s market profile requires a broader framework, involving a comprehensive review of the product’s competitive position.
Conclusions
Based on a comparison and competitive analysis of the Staphiscope and the three major detection products on the market, the Staphiscope was found to have the highest market profile score. It uniquely scored highest in reliability and ease of use. Although all products on the market signify great innovation in the field, Staphiscope has great potential to"

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.
A2: Nowadays, treating Inflammatory intestinal diseases is still a difficult problem over the whole world, mainly in terms of poor response to drug therapy for some patients, recurrence after treatment and serious adverse reactions after a long-term drug therapy. Of course, some patients still have to undergo an operation because of the bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal fistula, hemorrhoea, etc. And some patients die from various complications.
Q: We hope to understand the common methods of treating intestinal diseases, especially the inflammatory intestinal diseases
A: Now the methods of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases mainly include drug therapy (5-aminosalicylic acid, hormone, immunization drug, antibiotics, biologics), operative treatment, stool transplantation, stem cell transplantation and leukocyte elution adsorption treatment.
Q: Now the cure rate of inflammatory intestinal diseases, especially chronic diseases and severe diseases, is still low. We hope to know the disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases, from the perspective of a clinical doctor.
A1: Treatment is mainly based on the drug therapy, because 5-ASA preparation has poor tolerance and glucocorticoid has several side effects (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc.). Chinese people have a case of a certain proportion of metabolic enzyme deficiency that may cause the bone marrow depression. And biologics has a high risk of infection and may exists the probability of drug resistance.
A2: Disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases is mainly about: 1. lack of effective drugs for all patients, even if the biological agents which is researched and developed in recent years and whose efficacy is only about 50%. 2. There are concerns about the drug for long term use existing serious adverse reactions. 3. Some drugs have problems with secondary failure. 4. Expenses.
Q: The leading edge of biological sciences is about the direction of the intestinal ecosystem. However, there is a big gap between the theoretical research and practice. So what’s your opinion about this current situation?
A1: Intestinal micro ecosystem (intestinal flora) is a hot topic in recent years. Actually, inflammatory intestinal disease is a pathogenesis with genetic background, which involves environment, immunity and infection.
Maybe it is not because of a certain bacteria, instead, because of the change of the proportion of some bacteria or the change of metabolites. These factors can initiate or accelerate diseases, but they are not the determinants.

Reaction From Specific Prospective Customers
Our product is at an early stage of development and therefore, demonstration of a full prototype is not yet a possibility. However, we have had the opportunity to talk to numerous potential end-users about our technology, its application, and the potential market value. We spoke to HydroQual Laboratories, one of the major service providers of testing for a myriad of oil sands companies. They are a cornerstone for monitoring samples from oil and gas industries as well as other applications. Our talks with HydroQual have led to a validation that there is a use for our product in industry. HydroQual is owned by the large service/consulting based company Golder Associates. Golder also has identified value in our product and are interested in gaining further information about how FREDsense Technologies and Golder could be working together.
Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) and the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI), two oil sands consortia that analyze prospective oil sands technologies, have also provided a large amount of input about our technology, and have been interested in seeing its development. This suggests oil sands producers have identified our technology as having promise within the industry.
Selling Activities
Penetrating this market requires that we sell our product to as many commercially accredited laboratories as well as service companies as possible. To gain a foothold in this market, three major targets have been identified as the leading laboratories who handle oil and gas related toxicological samples:
ALS Environmental - Most water and sedimentary analyses
AXYS Laboratories - Sediment analysis of toxins such as PAHs
HydroQual Laboratories - Water and sediment toxicology data
It will be critical that we partner with industry in order to demonstrate our product has a usable track record to correctly predict the toxicology of samples. This, along with government approved regulations and the clear advantages provided by our system, will allow us to achieve success in selling our product.
Clients will receive quotes for requests above 100-cartridge orders.  Pricing will contain cost of unit, shipping, and appropriate taxes. This strategy will allow us to competitively price bulk orders, saving both time and money for our company and our customers (see operations section for more information).  Clients will be billed for purchases and given a 1 month window for accounts receivable.  For some companies in the oil and gas sector, payment often times is made at 4 month intervals, which may make it so that we change our practices to allow for 120 days account receivable.

Precipitator
BBa_K608404 IPTG-inducible Promoter with plastic binding domain-tagged GFP
BBa_K608406 Precipitator
The Precipitator is a new artificially designed LRR protein. It is meant as protein that binds Nickel ions with Histidines grouped on its surface. The bound Nickel can then precipitate His-tagged proteins. In our Lab in a Cell it should function as an adaptor between the plastic surface of pipettes and the His-tagged protein. Please look at our detailed description of the design layout in our modeling section. The sequence was synthesised and cloned into the iGEm vector. The submitted sequence was fully confirmed by sequencing.
BBa_K608407 Precipitator fused with GST tag
The Precipitator was fused with the C-terminus of our GST tag in order to extract and further test the construct for its Nickel binding affinity. We successfully cloned it together using the Gibson Assembly and then subsequently pasted it into the iGEM vector. The submitted sequence was partially confirmed by sequencing.
BBa_K608408 GST-tag
The GST-tag was PCR amplified from a pGEX vector with overhang primers including the iGEM restriction sites and then pasted into the iGEM vector. To verify the functionality of the construct we cloned it before a GFP sequence and expressed it with an IPTG inducible vector. Results see partsregistry page. The submitted sequence was partially confirmed by sequencing.

Protein Trafficking
Overview
In nature, eukaryotic cell mitochondria usually have their protein encoded by gene in nucleus and produced from cytosol. In this process, MLS will act as signal peptide to target the protein into mitochondria.
In our module, we will construct the MLS BioBrick K1119001 , and characterize it quantitatively[link].
Mechanism of MLS
MLS is attached to the N-terminal of the protein in interest, and be recognized by receptor in the outer mitochondria membrane. The complex of receptor and attached protein diffuse to a contact site, where protein is translocated across both the outer and inner membrane by a protein translocator. The MLS will be cleaved off by signal peptidase inside the mitochondria afterward. Chaperone proteins will help to pull the protein across the membrane and help the refolding of protein.
Linkage to project
In our project, we introduced bacterial enzymes to mammalian cell to modify metabolic pathway. However, unlike bacteria, citric acid cycle in mammalian cells is compartmentalized in mitochondria. The ACE proteins should be targeted to mitochondria for their functionality. To do so, we fused ACE enzymes with Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS).

where i ∈ [0 = 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xmi is the mRNA concentration level, xpi is the protein transcription level, βm0 is the leaky expression, βmi is the production rate of mRNA, βpi is the production rate of protein, γmi is the degradation/dilution of mRNA and γpi is the degradation/dilution of protein for ith protein. The simulation results of the model presented in Fig. below. It is evident the such system can exhibit a oscillation resembling a squarewave.
As the dynamical model comprises of two time-scale, one can use the singular perturbation analysis to reduce the model in to smaller one, i.e. 5th order, as discussed earlier.  The simpler version of the model, where multiple constants product are clubbed into one, can be reproduced as follows,
where αi can be considered as the protein production rate constant and γ as the degradation constant. The simulation of 5th order model presented in figure is almost identical to the simulation for full order model. Both of the model can exhibit sustained square wave like response of arbitrary initial conditions.

iGEM could produce support resources, for the existing[Biology] A level, which introduce ideas of synthetic biology and which could be used as ‘stretch and challenge’ materials by teachers.
-Edexcel
We have attended a number of schools and science fairs to educate school students, and teachers, on the benefits and applications of synthetic biology. This has been made possible largely through the creation of our board game ( BioMech ) which introduces students to the fundamental principles of synthetic biology as well as some key biological concepts like mutation, in a fun and engaging manner. We have made presentations to these students to emphasise the importance of synthetic biology and how it already impacts their day to day lives.
Through a unique series of fun but professional interviews and podcasts, we hope to have presented the work of academics and other researchers in an engaging but relatable way. It is our hope that this angle gives us the ability to both make synthetic biology a more attractive field of science to the public but also help the public understand how the scientific community is trying to combat the potential risks.
For equality and diversity, we feel we can make a significant impact locally, at the university in highlighting the disparity of gender distribution but also make the wider community aware of a lack of diversity within science. We also want to further illuminate the work of Paris Bettencourt in 2013, with their Gender Study on synthetic biology and iGEM.
We have used different forms of media to engage both students at the University of Exeter and the wider public, with the problem of sexism and lack of diversity in science. We have made two different videos: the first highlighting students’ initial reactions to sexism in science and the second probing the work of academics at the university into equality, diversity and inclusivity. We will also be hosting a radio show on Xpression FM, (University of Exeter’s campus radio), in which diversity in science will be discussed. We have worked closely with the Equality and Diversity office at the university as well as the Athena Swan Group at the university to support our findings with statistics and data in both the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and the College of Engineering Maths and Physical Sciences. We are also working hard to arrange a debate through the university debating society on whether science discriminates against women.
We are hoping to further conduct a follow up study of Paris Bettencourt’s 2013 Gender Study. We want to look at whether gender distribution has improved in iGEM since their study, to begin to understand whether they made"
Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Loop_-_-_TEXT.html," to solve this, we created a penalty vector which adds a penalty to the match binding energy for                         each mismatch:
The term dk in the equation above, refers to a                         weight that decreases as k is increased, with k =                         1,2,3…length gRNA (typically 20-23). We have estimated                         values of those weights using criteria from our Scoring                         System, as it had been validated comparing to other                         target searchers available online.
Those coefficients, collected in a vector which is represented on the right,                         are multiplied by the single mismatch average penalty of 0.78 kcal/mol, extracted from bibliography (2). The                         implementation of the penalties is in the Matlab                         function weights_exchange.m.
Using this strategy, we studied how would could vary                         the ΔΔGexchange gRNA:target estimated for a                         target with different number and positions of                         mismatches. We implemented the obtention of                         ΔΔGexchange gRNA:target in the Matlab                         function energy_exchange.m.

Bioprinting, one step closer
Bioprinting is an sector of 3D printing that has many potential applications in the health research field. Among them, testing and experimentation for medical studies is a particular field where tissue engineering is crucial, for example as reported by 3DPI the latest advancements from a team at Harvard. This particular application for tissue engineering allows a faster understanding of human diseases, improving the rate at which scientists develop potential cures.
Perhaps a key to the potential success of this project is their openness to the bioprinter community through their website, in which they have documented publicly their project and share instructions to turn your normal 3D printer into a bioprinter. This invitation to collaborate celebrate the internet’s main purpose of being an open communication space, as explored at MozFest last weekend.

File:Muc 3dprint 001.pdf ""3D printed, transplantable, functional human organs are getting closer and closer to becoming a reality, as unbelievable as that seems. While bioprinting technology hasn’t quite gotten to the point of being able to actually 3D print a kidney or liver and implant it into a living human being, it’s only a matter of time as multiple universities, biotechnology companies, and research institutions race to be the first to do so. It’s a fascinating race to watch, not just for the obvious reasons, but because everyone’s technology is a little bit different. Most 3D printed tissue is created by depositing cells onto a scaffold, where they ideally grow into layers of living tissue to be used for research, pharmacological testing, or, ultimately, regenerative medicine. It’s an incredibly tricky process that often fails due to a variety of reasons: the scaffold is too soft and collapses, it degrades too quickly, or it damages or kills the delicate cells. The scaffold also needs to be removed somehow once the tissue has matured, or else to biodegrade safely on its own. Scaffold-free bioprinting is a goal that many researchers have their eyes on, but most bioprinting materials, or bio-inks, aren’t strong enough to hold their structures without support.

Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of peptides that play roles in the innate immune system to protect the host from invading pathogens [1]. AMPs have minimal toxicity and low sensitivity effects to the host [2], which means antimicrobial peptides have the potential to be used to replace antibiotics in the future. Thus, the detrimental effects of antibiotics overuse will be released.
Cecropins, a group of small AMPs mainly found in the hemolymph of insects, consist of 31‑39 amino acid residues and have a broad spectrum, high heat stability and potent bacteriostatic activity [3-5]. CecropinXJ (Part BBa_K1919000) is a member of the Cecropin family, which was first cloned from the larvae of the Xinjiang silkworm (Bombyx mori). Previous researches have determined the complete amino acid sequence of this molecule [6]. It has been demonstrated that CecropinXJ could be expressed in eukaryotic expression"

SYNBIO PROFILE
Peru has a structure being developed with laboratories, research institutions and a Biotechnology major at National Agraria La Molina University.
PARTICIPATION IN THE iGEM COMPETITION
Peru like many of the Latin American countries, did not take part in the competition, even though there are research institutes and a Biotechnology course.
BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
In Peru, there’s no record found  of a survey discussing about companies in the country. However, our Team found around 5 biotechnology industry working well in the past years. As part of the industrial strategy, the Biotechnology Development of Peru Association believes that this number will increase from now on.
REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Peru has no significant production of synthetic biology to be one specific regulation. But there is the General Law of Development of Modern Biotechnology approved by the Peruvian Congress. The name of the law already says clearly what its goal is: boost the ""modern biotechnology"", a euphemism used to the technique established 30 years ago and whose results to date are far from that. For this, his fifth article gives the state the role of promoting ""modern biotechnology"" through policies, plan and financing. The law also creates CONEBIO - Executive National Biotechnology Committee, composed of representatives from government, academic and corporate entities ""in order to promote coordination between the public and private sectors."" Biosafety issues appear marginally by law. His last article establishes a Biosafety Advisory Committee. The composition and functioning depend on regulation by the executive (Biodiversidad en America Latina).
RESEARCH, PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION
The versatility of biotechnology has been observed in wide range of applications in industries as diverse as human and animal health, agriculture and environment. Apparently, only the use of biotechnology in crop area causes a lot of controversy. Many cannot imagine that the use of biotechnology goes beyond the cultivation of transgenic crops, but used as tools in modern plant breeding, due to its ability to identify agr"

Application orientated work
Could You please tell us something about the previous work of the iGEM teams in Aachen?
The success of the iGEM team 2014 was very unexpected and a great experience for all involved. This success motivated many and raised the attention for the iGEM team Aachen. The iGEM team 2015 repeated the success in a very similar way, showing how ambitious the members of the iGEM team Aachen are.
How do You feel to be a part of the iGEM team Aachen 2016?
Great! When the chance evolved to start an iGEM team in Aachen I was directly very positive. The interests of students and the idea of teaching are combined in the iGEM competition. Also I am very happy to see how the iGEM competition developed in the past few years, and I am excited how it will continue. I think it is also good that many students participate with fun and passion. In total iGEM is a great experience for me.
Can You tell us something about the atmosphere in Boston and at the Giant Jamboree?
The atmosphere is unique. All the teams live in the same hotel and when you enter into the convention centre, you can feel the iGEM spirit immediately. You will be very focused before you present your project in front of people, but afterwards you will just feel relieved and can enjoy the atmosphere. Besides it is great to represent the RWTH Aachen University and spend time with your team members. It is important to be recognized as iGEM team Aachen till the competition is over. Moreover, it is great to feel the international spirit. You can learn about so many projects and you have the chance to talk to many other teams about their iGEM experiences. Do not only look at the well-known teams, but talk also to teams with very difficult working conditions. Their enthusiasm is truly inspiring. In summary, enjoy Boston!
