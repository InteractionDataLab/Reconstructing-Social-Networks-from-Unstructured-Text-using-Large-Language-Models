We can conclude with experiment 1 that the antibodies bind specifically to CsgA_His proteins. The CsgA_His proteins are only present when induced with 0.5% rhamnose.
Experiment 2: Quantitative analysis of the internal CsgA_His protein.
With experiment 1 we proved that the antibodies bind to CsgA_His proteins. The CsgA_His strains produced CsgA_His after induction with 0.5% rhamnose. We executed experiment 2 to determine the internal concentration of CsgA_His proteins, by comparing the bands with the bands of known concentrations of CsgA_His proteins.
Figure 12: Membrane after western blotting; samples of experiment 1 (Right to left).
As seen in figure 12, the bands of the calibration curve were visible. The bands of the ΔcsgA_csgA_His were not visible. We still wanted to know the correlation between the thickness of the band, and the concentration of internal CsgA_His. We solved this by comparing the band in lane 8 from figure 11B with the bands seen in figure 11A, to acquire an approximation of the total concentration. The bands in lane 4, and 5 (right to left) were too saturated to measure with the Typhoon. The band in figure 2 was thinner than the two highest concentrations, therefore we removed the last two points from the calibration line.
The trend line of the concentration (in µM) versus intensity has a formula of:
Intensity = 509067 · [concentration] + 792496
We calculated from figure 11B that the average intensity of our samples 2.3*10^6 was. We used the calibration curve (figure 13) we made with the dilution series to determine the average CsgA-His amount per well to be 2.75 μM. The amount of sample we loaded on the gel was 10 µl, therefore the amount of CsgA_His protein in the lane 2.7510-5µmol.
Figure 13: Calibration curve of csgA concentration (µM) versus intensity.
The cell concentration was set to an OD600 of 10 at the beginning of the experiment, which corresponds to 8109 cells/ml. 10 µl of this"

Conclusion
Research
Since our target was to reduce air pollution, we targeted genes that act on NOx and SOx gases. Research was done extensively and the following genes were found to be best fitting for our project-
I - NrfA (Nitrite reductase)-
Since Nitric oxide NO is a major greenhouse gas, the reduction of NO from the air is an important task to address global warming concerns. NO is found primarily in motor exhausts, and Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) are key oxidants that have a role in the photochemical production of ozone, whilst also being linked with an increase in the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere.
The nitrite reductase NrfA is encoded within the nrfA operon that is found in enteric bacteria such as E. coli. The primary function of NrfA is to enable the use of nitrite as a respiratory electron acceptor, forming ammonia as a final product. Nitric oxide (NO) is a proposed intermediate in the six-electron reduction of nitrite and NrfA can use exogenous NO as a substrate. This enzyme is a periplasmic protein and therefore contains a signal sequence to redirect it to the periplasmic space after the protein is formed. While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO"

MIT
In the beginning of the summer, we collaborated with MIT, specifically their Recombinase team. Several members of our team worked previously with recombinases and used this time to discuss several topics surrounding this body of work. These topics included structures of recombinase circuits, the phylogenetic tree of recombinases, as well as the orthogonality of various heterospecific site-recombinase pairs. In addition, we worked with the entire MIT team to prepare for the NEGEM #1 conference, practicing both presentations and responding to audience questions.
WPI
During NEGEM #1, we mingled with the other teams in attendance to potentially collaborate to improve experimental projects or human practices projects.  During NEGEM #1 we discussed with WPI how they were using fluorescent microscopy for their assaying technique, while we were using flow cytometry. In the spirit of iGEM and further characterization, we proposed a swap: we would run several WPI samples on our flow cytometer and aid in analysis, while WPI would view and image our circuits under their microscopes. In both cases, we were able to validate that our parts functioned as expected. Specifically, we found that our results were replicable under both assaying techniques.
BostonU Hardware
We collaborated with our fellow home team, BostonU HW (Hardware) to develop one of our Human Practices projects, a blog about intellectual property in synthetic biology and software. Uniformly, we agreed that intellectual property was an important topic to iGEMmers and synthetic biologists at large, and thus the disbursement of this information was critical. The first post was a team effort to introduce our readers to intellectual property, patents, copyrights, etc. and to establish the tone for our blogs.  Each subsequent post was then switched off so the wet lab team wrote one week and the hardware team wrote the following week.  Of course our bloggers, Castor and Pollux, always edited each other's work before it was uploaded. You can read our blog, ""Who Own"

Lysis: An alternative to cellulase secretion page updated.
Paris '07designed what they call ""synthetic multicellular bacteria"" (SMB). This involved reproductively capable ""germline"" cells which were dependent on diaminopimelate (DAP), a metabolite produced by reproductively incapable ""somatic"" cells. Low concentrations of DAP triggered the transcription of Cre-recombinase (under the influence of DAP-sensitivepromoter), which caused the removal of a gene required for bacterial reproduction by site-specific recombination (SSR), and resulted in the activation of a gene for the production of DAP by them.
We could adapt this system to cause some cells to produce cellulases and then lyse to release them into the medium. However, a simpler method could by-pass the need for SSR and could be as follows:
Our cellulase genes could be under the influence of a promoter sensitive to glucose concentration (activated by low [glucose], inhibited by high [glucose]). Low glucose would, therefore, cause the production of cellulases in some cells.  We could engineer a reporter gene just downstream of a cellulase gene (under the influence of the same promoter), which could act as a transcriptional activator for lysis genes.  So low glucose concentration would cause some cells to produce cellulases and the lysis gene transcription factor. Thus the cells would lyse, releasing the cellulases into the cellulose growth medium. The cellulases would work ex vivo to break down cellulose into glucose, which could then be taken up by other cells and converted into starch until the glucose is depleted to insufficient levels.  This seems to be one of those ideas that, if it works, would be very ""elegant"", an abstract term that biologists seem to love! It might also provide some more interesting modelling opportunities than the very linear metabolic pathways, and we shouldn't need so much data to model this idea. (I still think that secretion of cellulases would be better though - it would be more straightforward, if possible.)
Next step along this train of thought: Find a promoter that is repressed by glucose!
Glucose-sensitive cellulase synthesis
E. coli has loads of glucose-senstive genes, most of which are positively regulated by cAMP:
The action of adenylate cyclase is repressed by glucose. Low [glucose] results in an increase in the activity of adenylate cyclase, which converts AMP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP associates with the"

Long Night of Sciences
16 June 2017
As part of giving back to the community, we hosted a booth at the Long Night of Sciences, an annually event taking place in many cities throughout Germany. We focused on introducing iGEM and synthetic biology to the public in Dresden. We tried to increase awareness of the beauty and ethics behind the things we do. To keep all ages entertained, we had Legos and gave instructions to kids on how to build BioBricks. Different colors of big bricks corresponded to different genes, like fluorescent proteins, smaller bricks corresponded to different promoters and so on.
We also offered strawberry DNA extraction, where kids could extract DNA by mashing them with their hands in bag of soap and then extracting the DNA in cold ethanol. As the children were entertained with their Legos and strawberry pounding, we presented our project in synthetic biology to their parents and all the visitors of the Long Night of Sciences. People were introduced to the latest research in biotechnology and expressed their deep interest in BioBricks and synthetic biology in general. At the end of the day, successful young scientists were able to take home a tube of strawberry DNA and parents were left in awe of newly acquired kids' skills.
Some impressions:
Public Engagement
To spread the word about synthetic biology and our project EncaBcillus, one of our team members went to her former school, the Rudolf-Hildebrand-Schule in Markkleeberg (a town close to Leipzig). Here she presented the concept of synthetic biology and introduced our project idea to senior year students participating in the course of Biotechnology. After the presentation, there was time for an additional question and answer session to enable an exchange of ideas and further discussion about the topic.
Press Coverage

Hardware - Warship
“Simplicity involves digging through the depth of the complexity” (by Steve Jobs). We aimed to build a simple device (we termed ‘warship’) to protect and confine our engineered bacteria, so as to increase the surviving power of introduced bacteria against native microbiota and biosafety levels of using engineered bacteria. This was inspired by the feedback from our presentation in a workshop (HUST_Cheering) in July. Other iGEMers were curious about the 'fate' of our engineered bacteria in human's gut. Our Gutrio has to compete with other living microorganisms in a such complicated gut environment. Intestinal environment differs from individuals to individuals and the agents cannot survive if they are not well-prepared. Moreover, it is quite dangerous for armed Gutrios to expand their territory without limitation.
We achieved this by sandwiching alien bacteria with pieces of semi-permeable membrane, thereby detaining concentrated aliens and yet still allowing exchange of chemicals between aliens and gut. We extensively elucidated that aliens would not leak out and surrounding bacteria could not invade aliens. Importantly, we revealed small molecules can freely diffuse across the semi-membrane. Therefore, in principle, therapeutic agents produced by aliens can diffuse into gut environment. Thus, our simple device allowed us to target two birds (alien competitive power and biosafety) with one stone.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#project_-_-_TEXT.html," the immune response, chronic inflammation (also known as prolonged inflammation) is associated with a multitude of different diseases, such as diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, prolonged wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and even various cancers (Russell, 2014; Cullen et al., 2010). In fact, due to its role in various diseases, chronic inflammation become known as the Secret Killer (Gibbons, 2012; Figure 1).
Chronic inflammation begins when the normal immune response is stimulated, but the immune cells do not shut down on cue. These immune cells become hyperactive and interfere with healthy cells and tissues, which ultimately results in tissue damage.
Figure 1. Inflammation is a ""Secret Killer"" – TIME Magazine, Feb. 2004.
GzmB, a serine protease, is an essential part of the immune system that is overexpressed during inflammation, (Granville et al., 2010). GzmB is normally produced by T cells and natural killer cells during inflammation, and can recognize and enter tumor cells to induce apoptosis. We refer to this important immune role as GzmB's intracellular function. Outside of cells, GzmB is also capable of cleaving proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Ida et al., 2005). The ECM is a collection of proteins that exists outside of cells and functions to provide both structure and support for cells and tissues. GzmB activity outside of the cells is to cleave around tumor cells, thereby jeopardizing tissue integrity and causing the death of tumor cells (Buzza et al., 2005). We refer to this as GzmB’s extracellular function.
GzmB levels are elevated during chronic inflammation, which leads to excess cleavage of important proteins in the ECM, and ultimately results in tissue damage (Figure 2) and various diseases (Hiebert & Granville, 2012) (Figure 3). For example, increased GzmB cleavage of cartilage proteoglycan leads to and worsens rheumatoid arthritis; and excess cleavage of ECM fibronectin, vitronectin, or decorin prolongs wound healing and contributes to photoaging (Hiebert et al., 2013).
Too much GzmB cleavage of ECM proteins results is tissue damage. GzmB is depicted here (and in the rest of our project) as a yellow Pac-Man. GzmB cleavage of decorin (yellow) leads to collagen (blue) disorganization. Individual cells are shown in red.

Then we converted it into a contour line where same value would show in the same curve, which is shown below (Image 3)
In this picture, different color indicates different brightness value. Then we reverse the contour figure to make it coincide with the original figure. (Image 4)
Then we only select the bright part of the figure, and omit other parts
Finally, we calculate the average brightness value of the illuminating area so that the value can represent the quantitative and precise fluorescence intensity of the original photo
All of analysis above is processed with Matlab. You can find the original code by clicking this hyperlink .

Many teams came to our poster and gave us a lot of useful suggestions Conference of China iGEMer Community, CCiC We attended 5th CCiC which was held by ShanghaiTech University in August this summer. During this meeting, we introduced our project to others through presentation and poster exhibition and gained lots of valuable feedbacks.
Here are suggestions from others. More details about how we improved our project based on these advices can be found on our Integrated HP & Gold page. “In our simulation of metabolism with and without phase separation, we inevitably need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in our pathway to produce β-carotene. So if your software could offer the accurate enzyme kinetic data, it will help us a lot make tenable predictions based on our models.”——Peking “The illustration of algorithm can be further improved to make it more appealing; the items and parameters of the software can be explained more clearly for the audience to follow; a specific application scenario can be added to the presentation to make the whole story more complete and clear.”——Some advices on presentation from judges Enterprises visiting To improve our project and make it serve the industrial community better, we visit three biotechnology and drug companies, Cathay Industrial Biotech, WuXi AppTech and MEIHUA Group. During these visits, our aims are as follows. 1. Studying the needs of industrial community 2. Seeking suggestions for improvement from the company's professional R&D staff 3. Promoting our web application to company staffs We had gained lots of valued suggestions from professional R&D staffs and improved our software based on the advice afterwards. More detailed information can be found on the Integrated HP & Gold page. Moreover, we generalize our tool and some of the R&D staffs planned to use it in industrial small molecular compound production design, which encouraged us a lot. No matter how it works well, it will be futile if no one use it. So promotion is important. Integrated HP & Gold An excellent project is inseparable from careful and creative thinking about whether your work is responsible and good for the world. To achieve this goal, we actively engaged with stakeholders and professionals to get the best out of our project. We integrated the extensive feedback we received into the design and evolution of our project. This page describes how the investigation"

Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A is to design a biological system to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose the human probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917, as our chassis for constructing engineered probiotic. On the one hand, when the engineered bacteria senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it would release an anti-inflammatory compound (interleukin-10, IL-10) to reduce the intestinal inflammatory responses. On the other hand, engineered E. coli could secrete myrosinase to convert the cruciferous vegetables contained glucosinolate into sulforaphane that act as similar as IL-10 and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic inflammation.
For details about our project background and introduction, please click to Description
For details of whole project design, please click to Design
As a therapeutic project, we knew the difficulties for verifying the entire system in less than one year. We split the entire system into three core parts and verify them separately: the nitric oxide sensor (nitric oxide, NO, is a biomarker of intestinal inflammation), protein transport and production and the “kill switch”. In addition, we tested them in DH5α and BL21 E.coli competent cells. We believed that the success of these core parts will ultimately ensure the entire system functioning in IBD patients.

Gibson two fragments together (DAHP + blitzen blue). Transform into 5alpha cells. PLATES SHOULD BE LB-AMP.
If successful, pick 2 colonies/grow culture
Induce with IPTG, measure production.
Project 2: Knock out dihydropteroate synthase/DHP (gene that controls enzyme changing pABA to dihydropteroate) using CRISPRCas9
DAY 1 Make LB +chlor/+folate plates
Recipe for making LB chlor/folate plates can be googled. It should be ~1.6mg/L.
Basically follow https://www.addgene.org/static/data/07/52/50a35908-85d2-11e2-92ba-003048dd6500.pdf for your protocol. It's multiple steps so you don't have to feel pressured to complete them all??
DAY 1 Digest pCas9 with BSA1 site, run gel, there should be a big band, do gel purification (run all 50 uL of it onto the gel! USE QIAGEN GEL EX KIT). The undigest pcas9 plasmid tube should be labeled ""pcas9 478"" in the box, use it for ur digestion!!
Anneal oligos - done already. Tube labeled ""pcas9 anneal oligos"". Use 2 uL for the ligation step.
DAY whatever - Transform into NEB5alpha in (regular) LB-chlor plates
If successful, perform replicates (LB-chlor and folate) - choose ones that die, because it means these cells are folate independent/the cells we want.
After cells have grown, make liquid cultures from these colonies and then run the assay the liquid cultures (accounting for opitcal density and stuff/aka they should be very similar)
We can perform thin layer chromatography using cell lysate/media.

Additional Notes
ok so there are 3 (and 1/2) different subsubprojects on the aramid project right now
1- so we are trying to see if extra copies of pabA,B,C will increase the amount of paba we make
2-also if the knocking out the gene that controls enzyme changing pABA to dihydropteroate
3- overproducing dahp (precursor to chorismate)

Cryostock, plasmid isolation and preparation of samples for sequencing of the overnight cultures prepared yesterday by Lycka. Only INP_Sil_Sdom in pSB4A5 was sequenced confirmed with a mutation to be fixed by PCR. The other sequences aligned to a fragment of GFP unknown to us, we assumed it either came from a contamination of the old restriction enzymes we were using or from the pSB1C3 backbone that was taken from last year's team plasmid stock and probably was poorly labeled. Thus, we decided to use another backbone and the new enzymes sponsored to all iGEM teams by New England Biolabs.

Plasmids were transformed into either XL1-blue or DH5a cells and DNA was harvested after overnight growth using a miniprep kit from Qiagen.  Genes of interest were amplified using oligonucleotides with a BioBrick prefix and suffix added on to the ends, plus 3-6 extra basepairs recommended by NEB for efficient cutting. Operons from pPLPCB, pJT119b and pEO100c were amplified and made compatible with insertion into the pSB1C3 backbone between its prefix and suffix; pJT106b was also put into pSB4A5. Light Experiments
This year our team optimized a protocol our specific system. Overnight cultures were grown of E. coli containing plasmids with genes for all of the parts of the light system. The next morning, these cultures were used to inoculate either M9 media or M9 agar. The app was set up for the appropriate container and light conditions, and the “dark” plate was covered in aluminum foil. These plates were placed on the tablet and grown in a 37°C incubator. Cell density (absorbance) and GFP output (fluorescence) were then measured using a plate reader. We ran multiple experiments using this general protocol, including a timecourse, intensity test, blinking test, and plate image test.

Collaborations
From exchanging lab protocols to making an instructional video, and even hosting our very own Instagram challenge, the Stony Brook iGEM team has collaborated with over fifteen teams across the world, sharing deep bonds and bringing everyone together. We knew from the start that an iGEM project is not just about pumping out results on our own, but is rather about a global community coming together, and mutually enjoying the ride. The Stony Brook iGEM team wanted to give every team the same enthusiasm and passion we gave to our project, for the goal of furthering the advancement of synthetic biology research. The collaborations have been extremely helpful towards our experiment, and we cannot be where we are today without them.
Directed Evolution Education with Queens University iGEM
We initially wanted to use directed evolution (DE) to select for cyanobacteria that produced large quantities of sugar. However, we had limited knowledge of DE techniques. Luckily for us, the QGem iGEM team also wanted to use DE in their project and reached out to us. We soon set up a video call and discussed ways we could collaborate.
We learned about how QGem wanted to use error-prone PCR to generate copies of their cortisol-detection circuit and produce a more sensitive detector. We told QGem about how we wanted to use in-vivo UV mutagenesis in combination with Megazyme’s Sucrose D-glucose assay to create mutations and screen variants with the greatest yields of sugar. As we were discussing our projects, we soon realized the breadth of DE techniques and the lack of simple, organized information on the topic.
We decided that working on a simple, organized Directed Evolution resource would be the best use of our time and a great resource for future iGEM teams. Both teams worked together on gathering information, script writing, and recording audio. QGEM filmed the video, and iGEM Stony Brook edited the video and added additional graphics. We hope that future iGEM teams can use these resources as a starting point and an encouragement for implementing DE into their projects!

Finalising ideas
Bacteria detecting or emitting sound:
Gonna be a breakthrough if we succeed.
However, we cannot find any information about a particular bacterial gene, or at least a particular bacterium that can respond to sound.
Nguyen Xuan Hung: Simulation of fundamental biological interactions of ecosystem using bacteria.
We can start off with simple interactions between 2 species (predation,mutualism,competition...). From that, we can extend our system by building more complex tri-species interactions (sth like: the enemy of my enemy is my friend).
The constructs and modeling tasks seem doable.
Difficulty: hard to maintain sufficient environment for such system (as faced by Imperial College 06 team)
Bacteriocin:
Choon Kit: E-coli O157:H7 is among the most dangerous strains of E-coli. Remarkably, the use of antibiotic may provoke its virulence. Some types of bacteriocin can kill them.
Colicin E7 is the bacteriocin that can kill most of O157:H7 substrains.
We decide to choose this as our main project.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive"

4/10/13
- KK Results from our overnight cholera preps: The first three tubes from the left are controls, one with pure LB, one with cholera + LB (which was grown at 30 degrees by the other subgroup), and one with E.Coli + LB, respectively. The fourth and fifth tubes have cholera, E.Coli, and LB. The fourth has a slightly greater number of cholera (500 microL of cholera-saturated broth) compared to the fifth (100 microL of cholera-saturated broth). These are the results after two days of shaker-incubation at 30 degrees C, when the cultures are viewed under UV light. We went over the quorum-sensing circuit with Dr. Grose. The Cqss membrane receptor phosphorylates Lux U, which cascades phosphorylation to LuxO. LuxO, when phosphorylated, binds to the Qrr4 promoter, activating transcription of Qrr4 mRNA. Qrr4 mRNA interferes with HapR, so there is no protein HapR. HapR is a repressor whose binding site is at the promoter for GFP. When Qrr4 eliminates HapR, there is no repression of the expression of GFP. Thus, GFP should be ON when Cholera is NOT present. The reverse is also true. In the presence of Cholera autoinducer, CQSS acts as a phophatase on LuxU, which does the same to LuxO, which does NOT activate Qrr4 mRNA which does NOT degrade HapR which represses transcription of GFP. Thus GFP should NOT glow in the presence of cholera. Our results in these test tubes aren’t exactly in agreement with what we want.
- KP Today we worked on our presentation for Friday and we also went over the quorum sensing with Dr. Grose.
4/12/13
- KP We had our presentation today. It was good practice and I learned some things to improve on in the future. There was some confusion on the quorum sensing, because we thought that HapR was a repressor and that it shouldn’t glow green in the presence of cholera. It turn out that it is the other way around and that it should glow green in the presence of cholera and red in the absence of cholera. That still doesnt explain why"

Tongji-China & SSTi-SZGD
To make our engineered bacteria safer, we want them to kill themselves after being expelled from the human body. The SSTi-SZGD team helped us solve this problem. They provided us with a light-activated plasmid expressing a protein which, when stimulated by blue light, promotes oxidative stress and apoptosis of the bacteria. Thank the SSTi-SZGD team for their help.
Tongji-China & SKLMT-China
We also hope to help other teams with their projects. During the fifth Conference of China iGEMer Communication, we found that team SKLMT-China needed other teams to help them evaluate the strength of their promoter. So we took over the job. We believe that our work can be of great help to their project.
Tongji-China & SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
In the course of the project, we wanted to find a suitable capsule for orally intake of our bacterial by visiting and learning from local pharmaceutical factories. We found that the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team had the same needs. Therefore, after contacting Shanghai Roche Ltd., we invited SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team to visit together. During this visit, we also shared some project experience. After the visit, we completed the capsules we wanted with the help of Shanghai Roche Ltd.. Besides, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team helped us to complete the production of bacterial freeze-dried powder.
The 5th CCiC
We hope to make our project more complete through extensive communication. So we participated in the fifth Conference of China iGEMer Communication held by ShanghaiTech University at the end of August. This exchange activity benefit us a lot. We learned some experimental ideas from other teams, sought advice from instructors on how to solve our problems, and found many opportunities for cooperation.

By prodividng the reagents for the cloning, the high schools only have to provide sterile media/agar plates. Incubation of transformants can be done at room temperature and the short duration of the heat shock can be achieved easily. For detection of BioBricks, we included chromodomain proteins which can be seen directly on the plates. Aspirin can be bought at drug stores or even synthesized by the high school students as a part of their chemistry lab. If the high schools have more advanced equipment, they can use other detection options such as enzymes or fluorescence proteins.
We submitted our blue biosensor to the registry and included on the parts page a detailed protocol for the experiment, so that other teams and high school students can make their own BioBricks. Find it here . 
Information about the project and timeline:
This project is designed in part with Biotech Academy with Pernille Myers as project developer. Biotech Academy have so fair raised 70,000 DKK (more than $10,000 to fund the project) from the Lundbeck Foundation. The project will be sent to the Ministry of Education for pre-approval and is predicted to be launched and distributed to the approx. 200 high schools in the first half of 2016.
 
Public relations  - Outreach to the general public by social media and paper magazines. 
Elements of communication to the general public has been used to educate and inspire in Synthetic Biology. Several channels of communication was set up including social media and public science papers. A key purpose by the use of social media is to demystify the team as “scary scientists” and elaborate details about the project. Postings of science and team updates attracted the attention of over 150 followers on both media outlets indicating strong interest in our progress and synthetic biology in general. Links to our Facebook and twitter page can be found on the ""home"" page as well as here and here respectively. In addition, the team got contacted by the Technologist and the DTU paper for a piece about the iGEM participation. The DTU paper is printed to the Technical University of Denmark and reaches out to employees, university students and high school students.

Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up,"

Protocol for Yeast Genome extraction is based on the introduction of TIANamp Yeast DNA                                 Kit.
Special protocol
1. fluorescence measurement
Protocol for fluorescence measurement is based on the introduction of Reactive oxygen                                 species (ROS) testing Kit.
a. Yeast induced culture
1) add the yeast into 2 to 5 mL of liquid medium and incubated overnight in a shaker.
2) The cultured cells are seeded in fresh medium at a volume of 10% by volume.
b. ROS detection by DCFH-DA staining
For the detection of accumulated ROS, incubate DCFH-DA with yeast cells for 30 min                                 (37℃), then wash the cells with PBS twice and analyzed by flow cytometry and                                 Fluorescent microplate reader.
2. Yeast Survival Rate Test
Spotting assays and viability tests
For spotting assays, yeast strains recovered from −80°C vials were shaken in SGR-URA                                 liquid medium overnight for revitalization. Then they were adjusted to the identical                                 OD600 of ∼0.5 and serially diluted to 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3. A 3-μl amount of each                                 diluted yeast culture was spotted on SD-URA or other plates. SGR-URA plates served as                                 the spotting control. Generally, pictures were taken after 2 or 3 d, depending on the                                 growth.
For survival tests, yeast cells were shaken in test tubes and grown until they reached                                 the exponential phase, and then different apoptotic inducers were added to induce                                 apoptosis. After the cells were treated by Mn for 12 h or H2O2 for 100 min, the number                                 of surviving colonies was determined by plating a small aliquot of the treated cultures                                 on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates or selective plates (SD or SGR dropout                                 plates).
3. Yeast Growth Measurement
1) The cells are added into 2 to 5 ml of liquid YPD medium and incubate overnight at                                 30°C with a shaker.
2) The cultured cells are seeded in fresh YPD medium at a volume of 10% by volume.
3) When it grow to the right time, take some of it to do the test through                                 Fluorescent microplate reader.
4. dCas9
1) PCR of a plasmid containing dCas9 to obtain a gene fragment of dCas9 protein.
2) Synthesis of g RNA by chemical synthesis.

Activity
The probably most important aspect of our project was to proof the functionality of the sMMO complex in E. cowli. Therefore, activity tests based on the degradation of methane by our modified bacterium were performed.  With this measuring setup, we could gather experimental data on the time-dependent methane degradation. Calibration with defined concentrations of methane revealed linear dependency as shown in figure 1.
Figure 1: Calibration curve for the methane sensor MQ-4. Plotted are the relative units displayed by the processor as a function of the methane concentration in %
The measurements were performed with bacteria cultures of an OD600nm value of 4 in NMS medium [1,2] and a wet biomass of 0.5 g for E. cowli or with cultures of an OD600 value of 1 in NMS medium and a wet biomass of 0.2 g for M. capsulatus.
First, we performed an experiment to compare our engineered E. cowli to the strain JM109 and M. capsulatus and to determine the time span necessary for the following experiment (Figure 2). From this measurement, it becomes clear that our negative control (E. coli transformed with chaperone plasmid C2) showed a stable methane concentration in the first 6,000 seconds of the measurement. Both E. cowli and M. capsulatus showed a decrease of methane concentration during the same time span.
Figure 2: Methane degradation rates for E. coli JM109 transformed with chaperone plasmid C2 (negative control) (pink dots), E. cowli (red dots) and M. capsulatus (black dots). Plotted is the methane concentration as calculated with the calibration curve as a function of time
These results suggest that E. cowli is indeed able to degrade methane.
The difference in degradation rates of E. cowli and M. capsulatus is not indicative because of dissimilar wet biomass. Furthermore, it is obvious that degradation of methane does not stop after 6,000 sec. For that reason, we decided to extend the time span of the following measurements up to 8,000 sec and to characterize E. cowli in more detail.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," an exogenous ligand (in the second case), and then it is either cleaved by protease (State 3, the inactive state) or separated from the PC chain without being cut (returns to State 1). Once it reaches State 3, it loses the transcription factor, so whether it is combined with the PC chain, it will no longer increase the output of the system. In other words, it cannot transition from state 3 to state 1 or 2.    Based on the above content, we establish a birth-death process model, whose state transition diagram is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. State transition diagram of the birth-death process. The TC chain can transition its states along the arrows with the corresponding exponential distribution parameters p,c and d. Since the mean of a exponentially distributed variable is the reciprocal of its exponential distribution parameter, the longer the mean value is, the smaller the corresponding probability parameter is. Therefore, in the case of stable external environment (temperature, pH, etc.), p is positively correlated with the concentration of PC chain, d is negatively correlated with the binding ability of the two chains, and c is positively correlated with protease cleavage ability.
Conclusion
The mean of the total time E(Me) that a TC chain has undergone from being placed on the cell membrane to being cleaved by the protease reflects the activity of the system (i.e., the greater the output of the system is, the bigger the reciprocal of it is). Hence, dynamic range is positively correlated with the expression shown in Figure 6. We also display the graph of it with protease cleavage ability as the independent variable.
Figure 6. The relationship between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability. In order to show the relationship between protease cleavage ability and dynamic range better, we assume DR=kE(Me1)/E(Me2) without loss of generality, where k is a scale factor.
It is clear from the figure that the negative correlation between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability is caused by different growth rates of background noise and saturated output when protease cleavage ability rises, which gives a explicit guidance on further experiment.
Binding abilities
Introduction
After losing its transcription factor, a TC chain may still be combined with a PC chain, which makes the latter occupied but does not contribute to system output. We use the indicator called system efficiency (SE) to measure the extent, to which TC chains out of transcription factor occupy system resources. By promoting SE, we can achieve the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates)."
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept2_-_-_TEXT.html," the cell vector is synthesized and released, the cell vectors lyse the tissue vector . This is an advantage, because it allows the destruction of the potentially pathogen agent of the DVS .
Moreover, no sooner, the cell vector is released in the target tissue, the cell vector targets the interest cells in order to deliver the therapeutic plasmid .
Back to top
The system of cell targeting [1,2,9]
The cell vector is used in order to target the interest cells. The adding of cell targeting proteins, inside the lambda phage genome, is necessary.
The deliverance of the therapeutic plasmid is achieved in two steps: the cell targeting and the cytoplasmic release.
The interest cell targeting
The lambda phage naturally interacts with its target cell, Escherichia coli, via its tail fiber protein J. Only the protein J mediates the specific recognition of its bacterial host. It is, consequently, the ideal candidate to a modification which allows a change in the natural tropism of the phage.
In order to do this, the protein J is fused to a protein, which is able to bind specifically to a targeted cell receptor. The protein J interacts with the Escherichia coli membrane receptor by the Cter end that is why, we decided to bind a fusion protein to this side.
The protein J gene is fused at the 5’ end to the targeting protein gene. The protein which results of this construction, naturally transcribed during the cell vector synthesis, is expressed with the same frequency as the native protein. So, during the self-assembly, the cell vector has a targeting protein on his tail.
According to the targeted cell type, the ligand can change, but the location, next the protein J, stays the same. The DVS is consequently adaptable to several pathologies.
Back to top
The internalization of the cell vector and the release of the therapeutic plasmid
The protein fused to the J protein mediates the targeting of the cell vector, but, for the internalization and the endosomal escape, the fixation of a membrane ligand is not sufficient. That is why, the cell vector have a second recombinant protein. This one is fused to another protein, not on the tail but on the head of the phage, the protein D.
The lambda phage wild type has on the capsid, the protein D, which is in charge of the stabilization of the entire capsid, as we saw previously. The protein D is exposed on the entire outer surface of the capsid, that is why, it is an ideal candidate"

Fig. 2 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics without reverse reaction
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre is around 95% after around 5000 seconds (around         83 minutes). Without the reverse reaction, this would eventually approach 100% over time. However, it should be noted         that our model deliberately ignores the reverse reaction with may occur in reality even with lox66 and lox71.
5 Model Simpliﬁcation
In this simulation, due to the high values of reaction constants, we needed to use a very small time step in the simulation         which led to a long simulation time. In order to make it feasible to simulate further models, we will attempt to         ﬁt the progress of the module with a simple system of diﬀerential equations.
Particularly, because the rate of the forward reaction is only dependent on the amount of unrecombined plasmid in the         system, and the reverse reaction is only dependent on the amount of recombined plasmid, we will simplify the system         to have only S and P where S is now the proportion of unrecombined plasmid and P is the recombined fraction. We thus         attempted to ﬁt it into a diﬀerential equation of the form
which would correspond to having the reaction system
We ﬁtted the values of r+ and r− using MATLAB, which resulted in the following graph for S and P.
Fig. 3 Comparison of fitted and simulated kinetics
As can be seen, the ﬁtted values of r+ and r− result in a curve that follows the results from the simulation of the         actual kinetic system quite closely.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," visit to the Judd School, think that synthetic biology involves
designer life
. If more public figures can comment on the positive aspects of synthetic biology, then it is our hope that the public can begin to see what synthetic biology can do for each of the individual, core subjects that make up it.
On the subject of equality and diversity within science he said:
we still have a long way to go... If 1 in 5 undergraduate physics students are female then 1 in 5 physics professors should be female - that's where the problem is and it just gets worse and worse as you go up the career ladder
This was a view that was highlighted with many of the physics students interviewed in the equality and diversity work, as well as many of the academics. The Institute of Physics recognizes gender distribution in physics as a major problem from base to senior level and if more public figures, like Prof. Al-Khalili, and more students publicise the problem, then it could encourage more time and money to be spent on fixing the issue.
By posting the podcasts on both YouTube and Soundcloud , we opened a two-way dialogue with the public, allowing them to ask questions and learn more. As well as this, we wanted to help ‘humanize’ academics and researchers by helping members of the public to gain a deeper understanding of the scientific research being done today. By reaching out to prominent researchers of academia, prominent researchers of industry and prominent public figures, we hoped to engage the public with synthetic biology and science in general at all the key areas.
We hope that by framing these important questions in modern science in a relaxed and informal manner, the general public will be much more likely to engage with these issues and learn more about research in the field of synthetic biology and other scientific disciplines.
Meet-Ups
Westminister iGEM UK meet-up 2016
In August we travelled to Westminster for the    iGEM UK annual meet-up, an opportunity to meet other UK teams,    discuss our ideas and projects and have a chance to practise our    presentation in front of students and academics. Although our    presentation was well received we were also given very important    feedback, such as why we hadn’t incorporated biosafety into our    game and our module. Since then we have rectified these issues.
Furthermore, we were given talks about   the fundamentals of synthetic biology and also about    conducting reliable surveys for our outreach.    We also had the chance to set up collaborations with Glasgow and Edinburgh in addition to   helping Warwick by directing them to schools and teams that    they could collaborate with or mentor.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#17 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Annealing: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The NEB Tm Calculator should be used to determine the annealing temperature when using this enzyme. Typically, use a 10–30 second annealing step at 3°C above the Tm of the lower Tm primer. A temperature gradient can also be used to optimize the annealing temperature for each primer pair.
For high Tm primer pairs, two-step cycling without a separate annealing step can be used (see note 12).  12. Extension: The recommended extension temperature is 72°C. Extension times are generally 20–30 seconds per kb for complex, genomic samples, but can be reduced to 10 seconds per kb for simple templates (plasmid,E. coli, etc.) or complex templates < 1 kb. Extension time can be increased to 40 seconds per kb for cDNA or long, complex templates, if necessary.
A final extension of 2 minutes at 72°C is recommended.
13. Cycle number: Generally, 25–35 cycles yield sufficient product.  For genomic amplicons, 30-35 cycles are recommended.
14. 2-step PCR: When primers with annealing temperatures ≥ 72°C are used, a 2-step thermocycling protocol (combining annealing and extension into one step) is possible.
15. Amplification of long products: When amplifying products > 6 kb, it is often helpful to increase the extension time to 40–50 seconds/kb.
16. PCR product: The PCR products generated using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase have blunt ends. If cloning is the next step, then blunt-end cloning is recommended. If T/A-cloning is preferred, the DNA should be purified prior to A-addition, as Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase will degrade any overhangs generated.

Lanes 1, 2, and 3 are our construct + primers at 62C, 66C, and 70C, respectively.
It appears as though the desired band at ~1.4kb is still rather weak.
Conclusions:  Further attempts at optimizing the desired band should be done before moving on from this step.  On monday, if reagents come in, protein expression will be continued, so Tyler and Nithin will take over the cloning."

Due to the low yield of the DNA purification fro Attempt 1, the entire PCR was repeated. Upon gel separation we realised the PCRs were nearly identical (see Gel Picture), which is what we were expecting. However, the DNA was euted into 10ul of EB buffer instead of 50ul during the gel purification step, which increased the concentrations of CpII 4-10 significantly. However, CpII 1-3 concentrations were still below the 10 ng DNA/ul range.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343004_-_-_TEXT.html," negative control after 24 hours and after 48 hours the difference from center to edge of the wild type is 2.5cm. The positive control moved about as far in 24 hours as the wild type did in 48 which and after 48 hours it had moved to the edges of the petridish (4.25cm). This was as expected because of their hyper flagellation.
The E. Coli strain MG1655 transformed with pSB1C3-K343004 shows that after 24 hours these bacteria have moved farther than the wild type and the negative control. The E. coli strain MG1655/pSB3K3-K343004 has moved the farthest of all 5 cultures after 24 hours. This motility pattern is observed in all three assays. The cells containing the pSB3K3 plasmid shows a uniform circle whereas the cells transformed with the pSB1C3 plasmid shows a budding-pattern spreading from the center. After 48 hours the pSB1C3 cells are still not covering the entire plate.
Pictures of plates after 24 hours
Experiment 1.
Experiment 2.
Conclusion
From the pictures above we can see that the bacteria containing our part is much more motile than the wild type and the negative control. We assume this is caused by overexpression of the FlhDC master flagella operon which leads to hyperflagellation of the cells.
The pictures taken after 24 hours show that bacteria with pSB1C3-K343004 have not moved as far as the bacteria containing pSB3K3-K343004. pSB1C3 is a high copy plasmid while pSB3K3 is a low-medium copy plasmid. The promoter in K343004 is a constitutive promoter (tetR repressed promoter). Bacteria containing a high copy plasmid with a constitutive promoter are more metabolically challenged than bacteria containing a low- or medium-copy plasmid with a constitutive promoter because of the higher number of plasmids per cell. Therefore the high copy plasmid bacteria move slower than low- or medium-copy plasmid bacteria. However, after 48 hours there was only a small different in the bacterial migration.
Phase contrast of overnight cultures
The purpose of the phase contrast microscopy is to see if the transformants are visibly different from the wild type. Since the FlhDC operon is not only an important part of the flagella synthesis but is also coupled to cell metabolism [ 3 ], it might be possible to see difference in morphology caused by an"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal. [9] [10]
There are several manipulandums in the box, which can automatically detect the occurrence of a behavioral response or action. Typical operands for primates and rats are response levers; if the animal presses the lever, the opposite end moves and closes a switch that is monitored by a computer or other programmed devices. When the lever is pressed, food, water, or some other type of reinforcements (a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus.) might be dispensed. In some instances, the floor of the chamber may be electrified. The rats learn to press the lever through several training periods because of awards or punishments. [11]
In our project, we train the transgenic C. elegans and control their behaviors by lights. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference or aversion to specific wavelengths, and the corresponding lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. Those reflects or behaviors are all operant behaviors and operant reflects which can be helpful for a more deep studies concerning nerves and behaviors.
What is Optogenetics?
Optogenetics is a method which uses lights to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, which have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin. Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows us to attain a quick shift between positive and negative reinforcement(a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior). Employing lights as the input signals instead of chemical signals, optogenetics is leading a methods revolution across all fields of science and engineering(""Method of the year"",2010, Nature Methods) [12]
Optogenetics can stimulate and monitor the activities of individual neurons within freely-moving animals and precisely measure their response in real-time. In our project, it makes it possible to train worms, observe their behaviors and quantify the neuronal signals. In traditional training experiments, the simulation (input) is always has an inevitable residue, from hours to days. Besides, the readouts(output) are not in the same pace with the optical control. However, by using our optical device(see hardware-link), these issues can be solved greatly.

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the"

Our Story
Comprised of 20 students in the Edmonton area, UrbanTundra Edmonton is the first high school iGEM team in the Edmonton area. We first discovered iGEM at the annual Science Expo youth conference where a member of FREDsense, the 2012 University of Calgary iGEM team, gave a keynote speech on iGEM and Synthetic Biology. When we first started our team we had no mentors, no guidance, and no support. Our schools had refused to help fund the initial $6000 registration fee, so we took it upon ourselves to allocate the money. We did some fundraising, however, we eventually needed to pay out of pocket to cover the registration.
We registered the team two minutes prior to the deadline and spent a month without a Principal Investigator. After a long search, we talked to Dr. Mike Ellison, a professor at the University of Alberta Department of Biochemistry, who had worked with previous collegiate iGEM teams. It took some pestering, but we were very fortunate for Dr. Ellison  agreed to be our mentor. He helped us obtain the research advisors, materials, training, and lab space necessary to pursue our project and we could not have done any of it without him.

3. Colony forming units (CFU) per 0.1 OD600
The        second approach is to calibrate OD600 to CFU which reflects the cell count in the sample. For this approach        only negative and positive controls were used.
The        overnight cultures of two colonies per control were diluted to        OD600=0.1        (three replications) and serial dilutions were made which then were        spreaded on agar plates. The next morning the colonies were counted        to find out the number of cells in the samples.
NC        1.1 and PC 1.2 samples  has shown relatively high and low values        respectively comparing to other samples which could indicate a        systematic error in a serial dilution step.
Conclusions
In this study cell fluorescence depends on the strength of the promotor under which GFP was expressed. However, all the cells with different devices demonstrated a reduced fluorescence per cell after 6 hours indicating a slowed down GFP production."

Meeting with experts and stakeholders is important in shaping our                                     project to fulfill the needs of our target user.                                     China Steel Corporation is the largest integrated steel Manufacturer in Taiwan.                                     Also, they had been adopting the algal bio-sequestration by                                     cooperating with the research group at our university.
Process
We were given the opportunity to meet with the senior executive of                                     China Steel Corporation                                     to gain invaluable insight for our research. The meeting commenced with our                                     presentation.                                     During the presentation, we introduced our project, including the bioreactor design                                     and the industrial model.                                     By listing out all the aspects we had considered, we would like to obtain advice                                     on the practical and social considerations involved in the application of our                                     project in industry.
Suggestion and Question
Will the high concentration of CO2 retard growth of                                     engineered bacteria?
Microalgae is reported resistant to SOx and NOx. Does E. coli survive under such conditions?
The two questions above were the main concern of CSC. Basically,the                                     best condition for engineered E. coli to capture CO2 is a lower                                     CO2 concentration without too much SOx and NOx particles.                                     However, we won’t be able to provide an ideal culture condition in Industrial                                     application.                                     After testing the tolerance of E. coli, we conclude that E. coli is                                     possible to survive under that                                     kind of condition in factory and the only effects its expression.                                     It may not capture as much CO2 as culture in the lab.
It is important to define a specific commercial product that can be                                     truly produced                                     since your user may consider its economic viability.                                     They stated that a product that can be widely used is better.                                     At the same time, we should consider current GMO legislation if we want to                                     commercialize those products.                                     The actual condition is not as ideal as in the laboratory, we should optimize the condition to maximize the carbon fixation ability of the                                     microbes.

Business Model
The business model describes how an organization creates,                                     delivers, and captures value in an economic, social, cultural, or other                                     environment.                                     Therefore, we introduce this business model as the basis for assessing the                                     integrity and                                     effectiveness of our ideas to work with our industry and even national research"

DNA Recovery
Introduction
We wanted to find out if cells release their plasmid DNA into the culture supernatant when they lyse and if we can recover this DNA for further analyses.
Experimental Setup
We grow two large cultures of cells. One contains cells that will lyse and release plasmids into the supernatant while the other has non-lysing cells containing a control (empty) plasmid. Adding IPTG to both flasks induces lysis in one set of cells but not in the others. If you would like to find out more about how IPTG induction experiments work, please click here .
Once lysis has been induced, we harvest the supernatant every hour, centrifuge it, and sterile filter it in order to remove cell debris. With this purified supernatant, we proceed to two different methods for calculating the amount of DNA that was collected. One method uses the qPCR to amplify a particular sequence of DNA in the desired plasmid (in our case an RFP-containing plasmid). Depending on the cycle in which the qPCR first detects a PCR product, we can determine the plasmid concentration in the supernatant. The other method involves transforming the supernatant into competent cells and counting the number of resulting colonies. The colony count alongside the qPCR data gives a good understanding of how much DNA could be recovered from the supernatant.
Results
Optical density measurements were made every hour for 12 hours. The non-lysing cell culture grew as expected into a cloudy mix of cells, while the lysing cell culture showed ever-decreasing optical density. This graph confirms that lysis was indeed taking place.

As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labeling your final products in a prescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and much more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of an examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialize GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
• Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
• Identify the level of risk.
• Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
• Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
• Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
• Good hygiene of workers.
• Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
• Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan, and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislation of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and"

 Pigment Extraction
Our final product from the cells will be the pigments we require to make ink, but before we can use them we must extract them from the cells. We will be producing the pigments in the cells using a method called large batch overexpression. We will have large amounts of liquid LB media in which we will have our cells with the constructs in them. We will let the cells replicate and mature before we induce the pigment production with IPTG. The way we will be extracting the pigment is via organic extraction. We will first centrifuge the cells and the liquid LB broth media in order to get the cells and pigment in the pellet. This will allow us to pour off the supernatant which will be the media to get the cells to work with. We will then add the solvent for the organic extraction and depending on the pigment it will be either acetone or methanol. This will lyse the cells as well as have our pigment dissolved in it. We will then homogenize the mixture in order to destroy all of the rest of the cell membranes and any living cells. This homogenized solution will then be put through a series of filters in order to get out the larger proteins and all of the parts of the cells, this will leave us with pigment and the solvent and all that is left is the evaporation of the solvent.
Figure 1: This image shows the process of our pigment extraction from the cells starting with live cells with pigment inside of them and ending with our pigment.
Ink Production
Now that we have our pigment isolated from the cells that produced it, we need to add it to the other components of ink to allow us to use it. The Three main components of ink are the Resin the Solvent and our portion, the colorant and in our case pigment. For our resin and solvent, we have selected gum arabic and acetone as our research revealed that these are some common materials that will perform as necessary for a proof of concept. The resin must evenly spread the colorant throughout the ink and across the substrate. The solvent contains the other parts and allows for the ink to be stored in liquid"

Do you have enough nitrogen?
In order to characterize our nitrogen-sensitive construction, we carried out an experiment as follows: our E.coli strain carrying the ZsYellow1 gene under the control of the glnA promoter was grown on LBA medium (until an OD of 1.5) in order the bacteria to have sufficient amounts of proteins and nitrogen compounds. Then, cells were pelleted and resuspended in a medium lacking nitrogen. After that, values of OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different times. As a control, we resuspended one of the aliquots in medium containing 10 g/L of ammonium sulphate.
As expected according to the underlying molecular mechanism , nitrogen starvation induces the expression of the fluorescent protein:
Figure 4. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of the culture. Measures were taken 60 min after the resuspension in a medium containing no nitrogen (pink) or 10 g/L ammonium sulphate (grey).
Figure 5. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of the culture. Measures
were taken 150 min after the resuspension in a medium containing no nitrogen (pink) or 10 g/L ammonium sulphate (grey).
Can you breathe?
In this experiment, our E.coli strain carrying the ZsGreen1 protein under the control of the nirB promoter was grown on LBA under two different conditions: aerobic and anaerobic. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by adding a small volume of sterile oil over the liquid culture (Figure 6), so no oxygen can be taken from the environment. After 2 days of growth, samples were taken from each culture and diluted to an OD of 0.1. After that, fluorescence intensity was measured.
Our results show that ZsGreen1 expression increases (a 20% approx.) under anaerobic conditions, according to the effect of oxygen on the FNR proteins (see the molecular mechanism description ).

École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
We collaborated with École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland whose project focuses heavily on using cell-free systems. During the course of our collaboration, we discussed how cell-free systems could be beneficial to both our projects, enabling our systems to be used more widely and with more ease than if they were implemented in live bacterial chassis’. We also discussed cell-free protocols and reporter systems that could be used.
Specifically, the EPFL iGEM team asked us to review their cell-free protocol and compare it to what we would use with our cell-free collaborator Dr. Thomas Meaney, who aims to bring cell-free technology to a wider market. This comparison of cell-free protocols will help them to optimise their cell-free extraction and build out their project.
Through the course of our discussions, we learned that the EPFL team had tried to use chromoproteins in their cell free system with limited success. This has informed the future design of our biosensor strategy and has made us aware that we need to be careful in using amilCP as a reporter system and has made us aware that optimisation of the cell-free chassis may be required.
Overall, our discussions and sharing of ideas were mutually beneficial in the future design and implementation of both our projects and we are very thankful to EPFL for their time."

Function overview
After the effective Toxin was coated by CNC, we need a convenient device to place our poison in. One of our goals is to kill all termites in a house. In order to be easier for the users to clean it up for a second use the device is designed to be removable. Meanwhile, all units of the device must be standardized so that we can change the alluring part into the killing part directly. Here is our device and it works in three aspects.
Monitor
In fact, we made a big improvement about our device on the monitor unit recently. In the last version, we used a compressed spring which is connected to a thin wooden block. Once termites eat the block, the string will elongate and another wooden block will get out of the device to alert the users. Further more, we decided to design a digital circuit for customers so that they may discover the situation in a shorter time with less attention paid to the device.
However, when we talked about our device with Prof. Mo, an expert on termite control, he told us that when termites eat wood, their secretion flows out and sticks on the wood nearby. Termites will even plug the hole when they go through it. This makes it difficult for our monitor unit to"

We succeeded in tissue culture learning and we want to promote our technique, therefore we recruited students in NCTU who wanted to experience how to raise tissue culture with our team. First, we introduced them our E.colightuner, a new system that we could easily get what we want by controlling light and temperature. Second, we talked more about synthetic biology in order to stimulate their interest in iGEM. We hoped that they can join us to be the new iGEMers next year. Eventually, they brought back their fruitful results as souvenirs and left them a great experience.
Besides that, we are also working hard on completing our device, by modeling our project. We are able to successfully utilize computers to analyze the data and build up a model so that we can predict the result of our whole system. By using this modeling, our E.colightuner can maximum exert its function and  secrete a suitable concentration of hormones we want.
Conference
This summer, we have an important breakthrough. We held an iGEM conference from August 5th through 8th. We invited teams from Taiwan and China. The conference serves as a warm-up Asia Jamboree, so each team presented their projects and posters. During the conference, all of the iGEMers discussed the projects and the difficulties we have all met in experiments. Q&A sections helped all of us exchange opinions and understand the defects of individual projects. We also prepared a barbecue night and a welcome party, so the conference not only helped us share experienced in our project, but also promoted our friendship.
Through the conference, all the iGEMers were inspired and motivated to try new approach and combine synthetic biology into other aspects. Furthermore, we also promote synthetic biology to public through the media, and strengthen the connections between different iGEM teams. Overall, we believed that this conference is a hugely success. Since during the last discussion in conference, all the participants agreed to gather together again in the next year.
Process
DAY 1
Our iGEMers picked up the Chinese iGEM teams at the airport and introduced Taiwan to the participants, leading them back to NCTU for check-in.
After unloading the luggage, participants gathered at the CPT building, having dinner together. Everyone was very excited about the upcoming welcome party.

1)Sample Preparation
Before starting measurements, we first transferred plasmids BBa_I20270, Well 2B, to E.coli DH5-alpha as positive control, and the same as plasmids BBa_R0040, Well 2D, as negative control. The two colonies of each device were incubated overnight in LB medium with Cam, at the speed of 220rpm. After 16-hour growth, 25μL was taken from each two colonies and mixed with 175μL blank media into a 96-well plate to measure the OD600. The arrangement is as follows.
Fig.11 CFU Measurement
2)Dilution
Cell cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.1 according to the data above with the formula that (C1)(V1)=(C2)(V2), V2 of which is our final volume of 1000μL.
After dilution, we used another 96-well plate to verify the concentration. 3 replicates 200μL of each sample was pipetted with the arrangement as below. Comparing the absorbance of samples and controls, we could count the accurate cell density.
Now that we managed to measure the accurate density, the colonies were taken a series of graded dilution with the same media above at the following arrangement.
3)CFU Calculation
Then, we separately diluted dilution3, 4 and 5 at the proportion of 1:10 with LB media. As a consequence, the final dilution factor is 8*10-4, 8*10-5 and 8*10-6. The final dilution of 3 devices, 2 colonies of each, were taken 100μL to LB plate, incubated at 37℃ for 18hrs.
After growth, we counted the colonies of each plate and filled the following sheets.

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the normally contradicting qualities of tremendous strength and low weight. It could be woven into thick cables for heavy industrial use or into fabrics for ballistic protection.    Silk not only has amazing properties in its strength and elasticity, it is a highly versatile material that can exist in many different forms. For example, its ability to exist as a hydrogel combined with its natural biocompatibility and controlled rate of biodegradation make it a good material for use as an in vivo tissue scaffold. Silk scaffolds could also exist as mesh woven from fibers and used for skin grafts and bandages.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
With spider silk as our basis, we started to experiment with the genetic structure of silk. We rearranged portions of the repetitive DNA code to see how it affected the strength, elasticity, and spinning capabilities using Golden Gate Cloning and Iterative Capped Assembly. Click this text to learn about this portion of our project in-depth.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this text.
Processing Silk
Engineering our silk is only half the work, creating a tangible product is the rest.
After some stumbles in the beginning of summer when our makeshift rotary jet spinner failed to work, we decided to look into different methods of spinning synthetic fibers. We tested extrusion with a syringe pump, which gave us very thin, fragile fibers. Click this text to jump into the action and watch fibers take shape from solution.

Lethbridge_CCS,2008,Team:Lethbridge CCS#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM are advertised with Lego® blocks, implying a very easy-to-use set of tools.  Our team of high school students discovered that synthetic biology is not (yet, at least) at the stage of quick and easy implementation in just anyone's kitchen or garage.
Therefore, we chose to investigate ligase-independent cloning (LIC), a technique we believe can serve as a standard for BioBrick construction, in a way that is relatively easy to implement and that also lends itself to automation in the future.  Our approach was based on a method described by Aslanidis & de Jong (1990) .
Method
The intent is to be able to create a standard BioBrick from any DNA sequence of interest.
1.) Select Gene
Identify a gene (DNA sequence) of interest
2.) Amplify Gene
Amplify, using PCR primers that contain the BioBrick prefix (brown) & suffix (purple) as well as a LIC overhang sequence (pink).
↓
3.) LIC plasmid
Obtain LIC plasmid (pSB_LIC; part K155000 ).
4.) EcoRV digestion
Digest pSB_LIC with EcoRV.
↓
↓
5.) T4 Polymerase digestion
Digest linearized pSB_LIC, along with desired insert sequence, with T4 DNA polymerase.  This digestion is done in the presence of only one dNTP, complementary to a base absent from the LIC overhang.  Therefore, polymerase activity is impossible, and the 3' - 5' exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase predominates.  The 3' end of each DNA strand is chewed away, until an appropriate base is reached at the end of the LIC overhang.  The dNTP required to base-pair with this base is the one added to the digestion buffer, and so the polymerase activity now balances the exonuclease activity, ending net digestion.
and
6.) Mix Plasmid & Insert
Mix T4 polymerase-treated pSB_LIC and insert, allowing complementary LIC overhangs to base-pair.  The long base-paired regions are sufficient to hold them together through transformation, after which E. coli 's own ligase will repair the DNA backbone nicks.
7.) Transform & Use BioBrick
The DNA sequence of interest, with standard BioBrick prefix and suffix, is now ready for further use.
Preparative Work
We obtained pSB_LIC (part K155000 ) by round-the-world PCR amplification from pSB1"
UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#CTCD#Content#Humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html,". The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information
Human Genome and its Domestic Ethical Guideline
We may assay whole human genome in iGEM projects. It needs to be justified ethically. At least in Japan, a chief of the research facility which conducts gene recombination is obligated to establish an ethical committee and the member of concerned research facility must follow the regulations. Principal Investor (PI) must submit a research proposal taking risks into consideration to the chief. Therefore, it is important for members to conduct risk appraisal and to draw up a plan in advance. It is also significant for us to recognize the concept and importance of informed consent.
Domestic Law Related to Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety
Living Modified Organisms must be restricted to the laboratory and under control. We consider their potential adverse effects on biological diversity, taking also into account risks not only to human health but also to the environment.
In Japan, after the results of Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Diet enacted “Act on the Conservation and sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms.” This domestic law aims to implement Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety properly.
In this Act, “use” means use for provision as food, feed, and other purposes, and use for other acts including cultivation, other growing, processing, storage, transportation and disposal. There are two types of “use” in the Act. “Type 2 Use” means use which is conducted with the intention of preventing the dispersal of living modified organisms into the environment. “Type 1 Use” means use which is not subject to taking measures similar to “Type 2 Use"

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content3_-_-_TEXT.html," progress of artificial synthetic biological oscillations have made.
In the first generation of oscillation, three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock are used to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1-5). The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. However, plasmids can hardly pass from generation to generation and this artificial clock is not robust enough and always displays noisy behavior.
Fig. 1-5 The first generation oscillator, known as repressor
Scientists constructed the second generation oscillator rapidly. This improved oscillator is fast, robust and persistent; with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min (Fig.1-6). The oscillator is designed using a previously modeled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. But this circuit could only monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles, which means the song is still limited to single individual.
Fig. 1-6 2nd generation of oscillation consists of positive and negative feedback loops
Thinking that singing alone is lonely, scientists introduce quorum sensing to connect isolated cells and let them sing together, and technically it's called synchronized oscillation. The synchronization effect of quorum sensing, however, is limited to over tens of micrometer (Fig.1-7). If the synchronized colony could be enlarged, then the oscillation signal will be much stronger and steadier. Longer ranged synchronized oscillation is realized by a gas-phase redox signal H2O2 to the third generation circuit, which could achieve the communication among colonies at over millimeter scales and became the fourth generation. Oh yeah, finally our bacteria can sing the same oscillation at the same time, so they decided to form their own glee!
Fig.1-7 3rd generation involved in quorum sensing
That's how our little E. coli friend formed their glee, a long but cheerful story. Thanks to hardworking synthetic biologists. Let's go and see how this fourth generation oscillation glee functions inside in THREE PLASMIDS!
