Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#HP#Gold part A_-_-_TEXT.html," a photosynthetic system with CdS, but they are using a special species called Moorella Thermoacetica. There are current seven kinds of bacteria that can transmit electrons. Secondly, a team from Taiwan last year has focused on the protein OmpA, but with low efficiency. We don’t meet this difficulty this year fortunately. Third, a teacher from Taiwan was curious about how to transform such a long gene HyaABCDEF into E.coli. Last, A teacher from Taiwan suggested that the experiments should be done under well-controlled conditions. There are possibilities of false positive and false negative results because of the low concentration of hydrogen. The teacher also suggested that we can either change the contents of the media to reduce loss of hydrogen or add a negative pressure to suck out all the hydrogen.
 
 
3. Conferences with five iGEM teams in Zhejiang University
 
In summer, we got the chance to communicate our projects with other five iGEM teams from Zhejiang University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yet-Sen University and Fudan University. Students from other universities are very interested about our project and come up with many doubts and suggestions. One student from ZJU is interested about the formation of CdS precipitation. He also had his explanations about why red fluorescence intensity becomes darker upon silicon encapsulation. Another student from ZJU suggested that if electrons can’t be conducted across the cell membrane of E.coli, we can try to culture shewanella spp. with E.coli to increase electron transduction efficiency because the flagella of shewanella spp. can help to aggregate E.coli.
 
This conference indeed helped us familiarize with our project as well as deepen the friendship between different teams in China.
Brochures
To propagate iGEM and make our human practice easier, we also made a beautiful brochure which contains detailed explanations of the iGEM competition. ( Click here to get the PDF file. )
Collaborations
Apart from collecting information of our own project during the process this year, we also helped many iGEM teams this year. The iGEMers are a group of young people who have passion about synthetic biology and are representatives of the synthetic biology community. Our close collaborations with each other not only helps us know many friends, but assists in propagating our ideas and projects to the science community all over China."

kinA
The following diagram shows the concentration of the kinA midi-prep sample as well as the DNA to Protein ratios; at 20.8 ng/ul the DNA concentration is not as good as expected but still enough for further processing. When analysed through DNA gel electrophoresis (see 'Results' section below) it can be seen that the the kinA + pMK-RQ plasmid (uncut) band lies between the 2027bp and 2322bp fragment of the HindIII ladder.
Whilst the plasmid + BioBrick is 4,327bp the plasmid was uncut so it appears as a shorter fragment in the gel. Likewise, to prove that the midi-prepped DNA is 4,327bp, we should carry out restriction enzyme digests on another day.
pGFP-rrnB
The following diagram shows the concentration of the pGFP-rrnB midi-prep sample as well as the DNA to Protein ratios; at 66.8 ng/ul the DNA concentration is at a suitable level for further processing. When analysed through DNA gel electrophoresis (see 'Results' section below) it can be seen that the band produced by the pGFP-rrnB plasmid lies near the 4361bp fragment of the HindIII ladder.
The true length of the plasmid is 8399bp but seen as the plasmid is uncut the gel again doesn't reveal its true length. Like said before, we will need to linearise the fragment with appropriate enzymes to prove it's length.
pMUTIN4
The following diagram shows the concentration of the pMUTIN4 plasmid midi-prep sample as well as the DNA to Protein ratios; at 7.2 ng/ul the DNA concentration is very low - so low it would serve little use in further processing. When analysed through DNA gel electrophoresis (see 'Results' section below) it can be seen that the band present in the lane in which pMUTIN4 was added is very faint. This is explained by the low concentration of DNA.
To deal with this problem, a second midi-prep should be attempted of the pMUTIN4 plasmid.

The above enzymes all come from Pantoea ananatis (GenBank: D90087.2).
However, we have encountered certain issues during our preliminary research.
In part K152005, the “CrtE” sequence (which originated from part K152001) contains 3 nucleotides different from the NCBI data base.
Originally, the registry annotation for K152005 indicated that there was no ribosome binding site before gene CrtI (i.e. “…rbs+CrtB+CrtI+rbs+CrtY…”). After clarification with Team Guelph 08, we were told that it was solely an error in annotation. The registry entry for K152005 has been updated to the sequence in the table above.

Week6 20180429-20180505
We tested the CRISPRi plasmids but they had no effect on sfGFP expression. They were definitely not right because enzyme cutting revealed inconsistent bands. Retested the recovered PCR products. Shen Yunhao built the first lux QS plasmids. Huang Tianze and Wang Tingxuan decided to order new primers for CRISPRi construction.
Week7 20180506-20180512
Retried CRISPRi InFusion. Huang Tianze and Wang Tingxuan spent loads of time on PCR. Some primers were just too long. Zhou Manxuan and Zhou Liqun finished the light sensing reporter plasmid.
Week8 20180513-20180519
Retried InFusion, still no CRISPRi plasmids…Zhou Manxuan, Zhou Liqun and Wu Yan used restriction enzymes to test the light sensing reporter plasmid OG, the results were inconsistent. Redid PCR and InFusion for OG and the sensor plasmid HPTC. Shen Yunhao transformed the lux reporter plasmid, on LB plates the colonies seemed quite green. Lux pR reporter must be leaky.
Week9 20180520-20180526
Still trying… CRISPRi and light sensing system colony PCRs generated no proper ligated plasmid. Shen Yunhao started building the positive feedback circuit. Dr. Li Peng suggested we use overlapping extension PCR to ligate smaller parts together before InFusion.
Week10 20180527-20180602
Overlapping PCR worked! Huang Tianze and Wang Tingxuan built the strong expressed CRISPRi plasmids that successfully repressed the production of sfGFP. Even though some colonies still leaked. Started to build medium and weak dCas9 generators. Zhou Manxuan and Zhou Liqun also began to use overlapping extension to build HPTC plasmid.

This study having captured our attention, we decided to use mutant HNS to increase flagellar speed and torque power.
PotB59/PomA
The flagella of bacteria is made up of 30 different proteins and at least three different parts. These parts are the basal body, hook and filament. . The basal body is made up of the rotor and stator and is the region responsible for the rotation of the flagella. The stator is the part made up of channel proteins that generate the necessary proton motive force. The rotor is a stable region of the basal body which controls things such as the speed and direction of the flagella and is found in the inner region of the stator. The interaction between the rotor and stator, found in the basal body, result in the movement of the flagella. The filament is the long string-like structure that reaches outwards. . The role of the hook is to connect the filament and the basal body together.
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the bacterial flagellum. The flagellum is a locomotive organelle for bacterial propulsion. The flagellum consists of the basal body, which acts as a reversible rotary motor, the hook, which functions as a universal joint and the filament, which works as a helical screw. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
The driving force of the bacterial flagellar rotation is an ion concentration gradient between the two sides of the membrane. The energy needed to rotate the flagella is generated by the majority of bacteria as a H or Na ion concentration gradient. In proton(H)-driven motors, the rotation of the flagella is carried out by the MotA and MotB membrane proteins. These proteins are actually H+ channels and when H+ moves through these channels depending on the concentration gradient, the necessary energy for flagellal rotation is created. This system that uses H+ is used by E. Coli and many other bacterial strains to generate energy for flagellar rotation. Other bacterial strains rely on Na+ to power their flagellar motor.  These include Vibrio spp. (V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus ve V. cholerae) and alkaphilic Bacillus species.  These bacteria, in place of MotA and MotB proteins, use hom"

Abstract
This summer, our team has been aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural and artificial environment. We have mainly designed two cell machines. AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecule while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behavior of bacteria in group level.
What's more, biosafety is further taken into consideration in our project. By applying gene circuits to control essential gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can block essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
AI-2 Concept
Success in nature depends on an ability to perceive and adapt to the surrounding environment. Bacteria are not an exception: they recognize and constantly adjust to changing situations by sensing environmental and self-produced signals, altering gene expression accordingly. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a signal molecule produced by LuxS, an enzyme found in many bacteria species and thus is proposed to enable interspecies communication. Two classes of AI-2 receptors and many layers and interactions involved in downstream signaling have been identified up till now. So far, AI-2 has been implicated in the regulation of numerous niche-specific behaviors across the bacteria kingdom.
In Escherichia coli, LuxS generates AI-2 from metabolic precursors. AI-2 molecules are then exported out of the cell by TqsA. AI-2 is primarily taken up through the ABC-type transporter Lsr, and then phosphorylated by LsrK to AI-2-P. AI-2-P depresses the response regulator LsrR, thereby activating transcription of the lsr operon. AI-2-P is degraded by LsrF and LsrG.

Motivation
Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing 'controller cells' to modulate metabolic"

Objectives
Test the protein display model and find to what kind of values it's sensitive to.
Define the control volume around the bacterial cell.
Start on testing the model.
We realised that it would be worth adding the last step (colour production by dioxygenase) into our amplfication models.
We need to finalise testing and formulation of certain assumptions regarding the amplfication (cell death in particular).
Consider helping RMIT- Australia in modelling.
Keep exploring the prospective solutions to our system going unstable.
Try to implement the last bit of amplification in TinkerCell. Maybe it will deal with it well.
Completion
We couldn't reach the testing as the first model ""Display 1"" was simulating reactions as if the were taking place inside the bacterial cell while in reality the take place outside. Then we hit an issue of defining the size of volume around the cell. We didn't manage to resolve that problem today.
Control volume defined.
Testing of model done.
Protein model pretty much finalised.
The colour production almost complete, however complications were encountered regarding the cell death (colour compound slowly kills cells).
Basically we're stuck: scaling didn't help neither did trying idfferent solvers.
Meeting with Matthieu gave us some prospective solutions that we can explore.
Alternatively we can have a look at SimBiology or MatCont.
Helping RMIT: their request is for protein engineering simulation - we cannot do that
We know how to use the ''splinetool'' in Matlab.
Specifying the time span helps to reduce the simulation time.
Model was implemented in TinkerCell.
Increasing relative or absolute tolerance in Matlab prevents some solutions from going negative. The key point is that we are only interested in the first few minutes of the experiment as the reaction to catechol is really quick.

We ran transformation tests to determine whether or not the method we were using to dry our plates prior to transformation plating was unnecessarily exposing them to contamination.  The results did not show any relation between the method of drying and the contamination.  What was suggested instead was that the stock chloramphenicol we had used in the previous batch of plates may be too weak to be entirely effective.  New chloramphenicol stock was made at 30mg/mL and new antibiotic plates were made using that.
Over the weekend, we gel extracted esp and rsaA in preparation for new ligation and transformation attempts.  The first round of tested transformants did not contain the desired ligation product, as shown by agarose gels .  A second round of tests on new colonies was started while we prepared new plasmid DNA for digests and gel extraction of both insert and target plasmid to reduce the likelihood of re-ligation.  The second round of tested colonies, however, showed one colony with the desired ligation product ( gel or gel ).
Overnights were made of the new esp + rsaA containing strain.  The DNA that was obtained from both PCR and gel extraction was later digested for ligation with promoter/RBS pieces.  Miniprep DNA was also prepared for sequencing to verify the sample.
We had optimized esp and dspB gene synthesized (G/C rich for Caulobacter) and transformed these two genes into E. coli Top10.
The BioBrick promotor was successfully added in front of the new esp+rsaA gene.
Wild Type dspB:
DspB gene arrived from the University of British Columbia 2010 iGEM Team in the form of a plasmid.  We will call this gene ""WT dspB"" This gene was transformed into E. coli Top10.  Transformation was successful with a lot of growth, more than usual.  But this is expected because this was a transformation of a purified plasmid rather than a ligation product which we are used to which makes  more growth understandable.
Overnights of 6 colonies of the transformed WT dspB were Miniprepped  and three colonies were digested with EcoRI and PstI to confirm size ( DspB Figure 1 ).  Once the size was confirmed, colony 3 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated and transformed into previously digested pSB1C3 plasmids containing the three promotors.
The transformations had a lot of small colonies, too many to count.  4"
UFlorida,2018,Team:UFlorida#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," stays, astronauts can suffer a great deficit in gut butyrate production. There is potential to develop a butyrate probiotic specific for space exploration that will keep astronauts’ gut microbiomes balanced and healthy.
Beyond its probiotic benefits, the industrial capabilities of butyrate also come into play in space. In terms of cargo space, it is far easier to bring a supply of bacteria on a spacecraft than it is to bring medical treatments or large amounts of biofuel. Our model has potential to be applied here, and development of methods for synthesizing these in space could revolutionize the space industry.
Theme
The theme of our project came about through a collective manner of word play. By combining a common procedure of our day-to-day lab work (fermentation), our university's mascot (the Gators), and an award-winning film series starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Terminator""), we called our project ""The Ferminator.""  The simple idea of “The Ferminator” is a genetically modified bacterium that produces butyrate. Butyrate, a well known treatment for most diabolical ploys, will be used to stop biological villains from overthrowing the gut microbiome. Pictured below is our main character in this superhero theme.

Team Substrate Analysis:
Creating  and measuring of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation samples for the laccases TVEL0 and BPUL. The experimental setup changed. The laccase amount was adjusted to the highest possible amount of the lowest concentrated laccase. TTHL has a concentration of 4,03 µg mL-1 and sets the maximal laccase amount to 0.6 µg per 200 µL reaction volume. To compensate these worse conditions, the substrate amount was lowered to 1 µg and the temperature was changed to 30°C.
Test of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation done by TVEL0 and BPUL  without ABTS. Experimental setup: 1 µg substrate, 0.1 mM ABTS, 110 µL BR-buffer and 0.6 µg laccase in 200 µL reaction volume. Measured at t0 and after 3 hours.
Saturday October 20th
Team Activity Tests:
Negativ control for substrate saturation analysis to investigate in the effect of CuCl2 oxidizing ABTS. Instead of laccase in H2O, only H2O mixed with 0.4 mM CuCl2 was applied.
During the Jamboree in Amsterdam we had the oppurtunity to discuss our activity results with a lot of people. One remark was about the calculation of the enzyme specific units. As you all remember, we measured the activty with 0.1 mM ABTS, but to get comparable results with the literature, we had to measure each protein with other concentrations of ABTS. The concentration of ABTS should be saturated for each laccase. So we started with ECOL and BPUL and applied different ABTS concentrations starting from 0.1 mM as usual: 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM and 5 mM. We applied 616 ng Laccase in each sample. Our results showed, that especially ECOL does not reach its substrate saturation with 5 mM ABTS. Our plans are now to check these concentrations of ABTS for BPUL and TTHL and also higher concentrations of ABTS for all laccases. For that we should reduce the enzyme amount to be able to detect the change in OD 420 properly.

Bacterial BRIDGEs
Communication capability is a key component of the modern information-driven world. From internet to instant messenger, SMS to telephone, society has developed a large number of technological means for people to keep in constant contact with one another and to exchange information ranging from the trivial to the complex. Even simple speech, and communication of ideas via concepts and words, is a key differentiating factor between human beings and other higher mammals.
What if bacteria such as E. coli were able to communicate via a means more efficient than simple chemical signalling? The creation and sensing of light is not a novel idea in synthetic biology, as evidenced by the firefly luciferase reporter developed by Ljubljana 2007 and the photoreceptor submitted by Lausanne 2009 . Until now, however, there has not been a concentrated effort to match light production with light reception. The 2010 University of Edinburgh iGEM team has worked to create a standardised set of light producing and light sensing BioBricks with which light-based communication can take place.
FORTH stands for Fabricated Organism Reception and Transmission of Heterogeneous light. It establishes a core set of BioBricks that allow synthetic organisms to create light of a determined wavelength upon a specified stimulus, and to activate a specified response when they sense said light.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," also really fascinated about iGEM and our major supporters. We were in contact with different Faculties and Departments in the University of Helsinki. All were very supportive, and Faculty of Science , Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences and the Department of Food and Environmental Sciences also helped us with covering our registration fees and travel costs. We were not only glad about receiving help, but it was also great to see how the two universities really came together for a common cause.
Presenting our project to philosophy researcher Tarja Knuuttila and her research group.
In addition to contacting the different universities and faculties, we had lots of contacts to research groups and individual researchers across different disciplines, from philosophy to biotechnology and biochemistry to physics. Many of the researchers we contacted we also met personally, including Olli Ikkala, Merja Penttilä, Pauli Kallio, Tarja Knuuttila and others. We discussed our ideas, often heard about their research, sometimes collaborated or got practical help from them. Each contact we had also helped us raise awareness of synthetic biology and iGEM in the Finnish scientific community.
Companies, organizations and foundations
Meeting with Jussi Jäntti from VTT, the Technical Research Centre of Finland.
To contact companies, organizations and foundations, we formed a partnership squad within our team. In this work our goal was not just to raise money to cover our costs, but also to raise awareness of synthetic biology within companies and NGOs. Countless applications were written, and we indeed managed to get support from outside our universities as well. Besides this, the contacts we had gave us opportunities to reach out to a wider audience outside academia. For instance, the contacts we had led to our team members taking part in a workshop organized by the Chemical Industries Finland and writing a blog post about synthetic biology and our project on the website of Bioeconomy, a Finnish government program promoting usage of renewable resources to achieve sustainable development. We also contacted the Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) , conveniently located across the street. They helped us a lot with their technical expertise by giving us access to their special equipment."

Our Units can easily utilize and exhibits improved flexibility as a tool to detect Cd2+ which belongs to the toxical heavy metal ions.

We’ve documented the characterization of all our four parts in the Main Page section of those Parts’ Registry entry. See Parts to find all our four parts
We’ve submitted our four functional parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Concerning the coverage of knowledge about cadmium poisoning resulted from heavy metal contamination and the acceptability of our project, we designed several increasingly deepened questions for an online survey regarding the ethical issues of the biological resolution of the cadmium contamination, which was finalised under the direction of Daizong Cui, whose research area is environmental microbiology. We spread this e-questionnaire among families, friends, teachers, secondary school pupils and our fellow students. And the results and conclusions are listed in Human Practice/Survey . Besides, concerning the future application of our work, we paid a visit to Harbin Taiping sewage treatment plant. There we saw the real procedure of sewage treatment. We do hope that we did propose some ideas from the perspective of biological resolution, all concerning conceptions has been presented in our wiki\⊙v⊙/.
And For a Gold Medal
And for a gold medal as described above, we chose the form of online questionnaire to find out how people in China were conscious of the seriousness of the cadmium pollution and if they had a general understanding of the recycling of them or not. In order to obtain the opinion from public on the ethical issues of the biological resolution on the cadmium contamination, we made sure the distribution of our e-questionnaire is among people of different ages. This survey do have a  great influence on us,this is because not only the feedback gave us faith to continue our project, but also informed us that most respondents are worried most about the issue of biosafety,concerning the secondary pollution caused by the application of our reconstructed bacteria .According to this information, we optimize our project by designing the flocculating module, to some extent,which is a consideration of avoiding this problem in addition to easily collecting the nanocrystal. We do hope that our considerations in the ethics and application can inspire fellow teams with similar purposes in the future. Learn more in Project/Future application and Human Practice/Survey .

We found that discoveries within ageing had been a recently developed research (new discoveries). We also sent out a survey which was about public perception of synthetic biology, genetically engineered organisms and our project via twitter, facebook etc. As ageing has a lot of ethical issues associated with it, we wanted to make sure we start to interact with the public and the local community about how synthetic biology can be used for people to live healthier lives for longer.
Tuesday 21st June - Team meeting
We met with the team members to start to finalise some of the biobricks we have found and to start to narrow down exactly what pathways we want to tackle and how we can get some data.  We also organised what human practices activities we can run and started to email and talk to some lecturers at UCL who can help with organising workshops for younger children.

Tuesday 24th July
Wet Lab - Early today we checked the results from the transformation of the Tetr promoter (BBa_C0040) for Expt 7.1, which demonstrated colony formation. The aim is therefore to pick colonies for BBa_C0040 in the evening. We also checked the results from the colony picking for Expt 6.3, which demonstrated growth for only two of the picked BioBricks - the Constitutive Promoter (BBa_J23119) and the Double Terminator (BBa_B0015). These two underwent miniprep, restriction digest, gel electrophoresis and nanodrop - but demonstrated no product. This is likely because of the very low plasmid concentration found under nanodrop. As a result we set up another experiment (Expt 7.3) that re-attempted the colony picking from all four BioBricks form Expt 6.3, as well as the TetR repressor from Expt 7.1, which demonstrated colonies this morning.
Meeting - Primers - Leonard and James met with our supervisor Darren to discuss our primer design before an order is set through. This proved very useful, and they have taken the necessary steps to redesign the primers before they are sent off.
Meeting - Skype to the rest of team at Munich Conference - we caught up with the rest of the team this afternoon, and were pleased to find our project had been received very positively at the poster presentation. We also caught up on the key targets for the next few weeks, to ensure members of the Lab Team continue progress with Human Practice, while the rest of the team is away.
Meeting - Darmstadt. Aurelija discussed modelling strategies with Darmstadt.

Wetlab: The results from Expt 7.3 demonstrated that there have been growth for only the Ribosome Binding Site (BBa_B0034), the Double Terminator (BBa_B0015) and the Constitutive Promoter (BBa_J23119). The reasons for the failure of the TetR promoter (BBa_C0040) and the Gas Vesicle Gene (BBa_I750016) is not clear. For those that were successful we continued with the miniprep, digest, gel electrophoresis and nanodrop. This demonstrated that the Double"

Previous Parts
For the correct mechanism of E-coding in sensing contaminants of the environment and integrating an analog message in the bacteria genome, previous parts found in the iGEM registry were used and optimized. This includes the SCRIBE system, previously characterized by iGEM Team UIUC 2015 (BBa_K1681001) based on the work of Lu and Farzadfard and the Pyear-GFP composite which express fluorescence in presence of nitrate ions (BBa_K381001).
SCRIBE(BsaI): BBa_K1681001
This part holds a single SCRIBE cassette induced by a lac operon. The cassette holds an editable retron sequence,the expression of a reverse transcriptase and a beta recombinase for DNA recombination into the bacteria's genomic DNA. iGEM Team UIUC did not include results regarding its specific parts, however, they did obtain successful recombination of a target DNA into the genome with a variant of this part with the same principle.

Integration plasmid
In parallel to the transformation with the replicative plasmid (pHM3), we tried to use a Bacillus subtilis integration plasmid. For that, we used the construction of the B.subtilis integration vector pSBINT1 built by the 2008 Cambridge iGEM team.
Bacillus subtilis integration vector
At first, we managed to clone each of our parts in the 5' integration sequence for the AmyE locus of B.subtilis (<partinfo>K143001</partinfo>).
After, we want to clone them into the integrative plasmid (<partinfo>K090403</partinfo>).

Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," µm height, 1-2 mm width), C(X) tends to a constant of 0.0833.
By rearranging the equation, we find that the width of the channel does not affect the total flow rate. The total flow rate is defined as the total volume of the channel over the time taken for fluid to flow through the entire channel. The time taken is proportional to the square of the total channel length.
To test how length and width affect the total time taken for the dye to reach the end chamber, we carried out two sets of experiments; one where we kept width constant at 1 mm and 2 mm respectively and varied the length and two, where we kept length and width constant at 28 mm and 2 mm respectively, and measured the time taken to travel an incremental distance of 2 mm from 10 mm onwards. The latter allowed us to create a time lapse and see how fluid velocity changed with increasing distance. The reason behind this experiment was to determine the maximum length we could push for our final design.
The Results
At a constant width of 1 mm, the length was varied from 5 to 28 mm to determine the optimum channel length at this width. It was observed that the time taken for the dye to reach the end chamber increased as length of channel was increased. Dye travelled fastest at a channel length of 7 mm, reaching the end chamber in 2 seconds. For channel lengths under 7 mm, the chip had to be tapped against the bench surface to initiate flow.
At a constant width of 2 mm, the length was varied from 8 to 28 mm. The aim of doing this was to determine the optimum channel length at this width. It was observed that the time taken for the dye to reach the end chamber increased with increasing channel length. Here, the main challenge we face with lengths under 8 mm was the requirement of an external force to start flow. With channel lengths over and including 16 mm, flow started slowing down and eventually, stopping before reaching the end chamber. Another challenge was the collapsing of channels at lengths over 20 mm. This happened due to the weight of the PDMS causing the channel to bow into the space encapsulated by it and the glass slide. Figure 1 below demonstrates how flow rate changes with increasing channel length at 1 mm and 2 mm width respectively.

Urea assay
Motivation
The motivation of this assay is to improve the Biobrick parts associated with ArgBox, used in the project Urea cooler by iGEM2011 tokyo tech. ArgBox is an arginine operator sequence(Arg boxes), which bind to the arginine repressor. It has been reported by iGEM2011tokyo tech that ArgBox can suppress the transcriptional repression of ArgR by introducing this into E. coli, and increase the amount of urea synthesis. We used the ArgR biding site as a 8 tandem repeat (ArgR BDS rep 8) or 16 repeats(ArgR BDS rep 8). We expected the amount of urea would rise compared to using the Arg Box as a single copy

Cytochrome_Engineering
1. Cloning of AP Cytochrome PACE: After the purification showed extremely low DNA concentrations, the transformation of the AP was repeated using the previously purified AP product. Afterwards the performed colony PCRs did not show the expected results. So a test digest was conducted which also did not show the desired results. The next day the colony PCR was performed again using a different polymerase. After this did not lead to the expected result, the CPEC was conducted one more time. Loading the CPEC product on an agarose gel sadly showed that this repeated CPEC also did not work.
Starting right from the beginning, new PCRs have been performed in order to generate all needed parts to repeat the CPEC once again. After those PCRs finally worked, the products were extracted from the agarose gel to avoid the impact of primer dimers in the following CPEC.
The CPEC was conducted under a different strategy this time as it did not work several times before. Instead of using all fragments/parts in one CPEC reaction, the procedure was split in 3 CPECs as a whole. In the first 2 CPECs half of the parts were assembled together respectively. Then the AP parts were assembled toghether in the third CPEC to form the full length AP. This product was then again transformed into chemically competent cells.
After the transformation did not work, the 3 separate CPECs have been repeated once again. This time the third CPEC from the previous attempt and from the new attempt have been transformed into two different strains of chemically competent cell respectively to make sure that the cells used for the latest transformation are ok.
This time the transformations with the second strain of chemically competent cells worked in both cases, the new and the previous CPEC. Test PCRs followed of several clones of both transformations. Some of those clones showed bands at the correct height. Subsequently, the corresponding growhts containing the AP plasmids were preparated in order to isolate the APs and one of them was sent in to GATC to be sequenced.
2. Cloning of SP Cytochrome PACE: On the next day, one Plaque was picked to be tested by PCR using the new Primers. The result was not what we were hoping for. So 10 more Plaques were picked and tested by PCR. Three of these Plaques showed the correct bands and a PCR purification was performed with those three PCRs. Two of the purifications had suitable concentrations and were sent to GATC for"

We would like to thank Randy Rettberg from iGEM, David Douglas from School of History, Philosophy, Religion and Classics at the University of Queensland , Tim Kastelle of the UQ Business School at University of Queensland and Anne Fitzgerald from Creative Commons for their insightful discussion and thought provoking questions about the sharing patenting system.
Outreach
As part of the Human practices work, UQ-Australia has promoted synthetic biology and iGEM to others. Major outreach ventures had included a presentation and activity at Biofutures : a national biotechnology student forum and is intended to also include a presentation at a local high school and PAIN Physics Society . The presentations had varying aims to suit the varying audience.
Biofutures
Biofutures is a biotechnology forum for Year 11 and 12 students from Australia and New Zealand. UQ-Australia ran a workshop on 3 July 2011. This workshop included a presentation and a group activity. There are pictures and notes from this.
The aim of the contribution to Biofutures was to introduce iGEM as a possible option for them when they pursue their tertiary studies.
From this activity, students and mentors
went through some of the thinking process followed by the iGEM students when formulating a project
gained an idea of what has been happening for synthetic biology/ iGEM
were able to put synthetic biology into perspective with science and society
Notes for the Biofutures and PAIN activities can be downloaded HERE and are in CommunityBricks !
PAIN Physics Society
PAIN Physics Society is a student society for students with an interest in physics at the University of Queensland. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology and the generality of physics, a brief introduction to a new field of science seemed fitting.
The aim of hosting a PAIN event is to promote synthetic biology as an emerging research field and to promote interdisciplinary on both the biology and physics sides. From this activity, students and mentors

Safety
Proper Risk Management
Biosafety and proper risk assessment are important aspects to consider before any handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are several concerns that must be addressed properly. The safety of the public as well as of the environment is of the utmost importance, but the safety of the person in direct contact with the GMOs should not be compromised either. The risk associated with laboratorial work can be evaluated using the statement “Risk = Hazard ✕ Probability”. To responsibly address this inquiry, the entire team was given a mandatory lab safety course held by Lab Technician Simon Rose. In addition, we received a detailed handbook regarding lab safety. This ensured that all our team members were well equipped to work safely in the lab. Throughout the project we have continuously been evaluating the safety of our work. These assessments can be found in the safety form . Furthermore, our team participated in the 5th annual BioBrick workshop hosted by DTU BioBuilders. Here we participated in a lab safety course before entering their laboratories. Both of these lab safety courses gave us the necessary knowledge to work safely with GMO and handle waste appropriate, as well as the according procedures in case of an emergency.
In the lab, we worked with several potentially harmful chemical agents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethidium bromide, chloroform, phenol, Congo red, antibiotics, and autoclaved glycerol. These chemical agents were handled using gloves at all times, and whenever deemed necessary, handled in a fume hood. Gloves were worn when necessary, and clean lab coats were worn restrictedly in the laboratorial areas. To visualise bands in agarose gels, we used an UV board. UV rays are carcinogenic when exposure is frequent and prolonged. To reduce the amount of exposure, several precautions were made. Gloves, long sleeves and a facial screen were worn at all times, and the time spend at the UV board was kept at a minimum.
Public and Environmental Risk Assessment
The chassis organisms containing the system is meant to be contained in a device, which is incorporated into an urban environment. While this device would be a safely enclosed container, it still possess the risk of physical breakage from violent acts or environmental disturbances. For this reason, we consulted a plastics expert, who advised us to use the plastic known as Polycarbonate. This plastic is remarkably durable, with the ability to ward off most physical traumas. The plastics expert has estimated that such a container would last in an urban environment for at least 20 years, and most likely"

Other than IISc-Bangalore, the following teams participated in the meetup: IISER-Bhopal-India , VIT_Vellore , IIT-Madras, ICT-Mumbai, REC-Chennai and IISER-Kolkata .
Problems ranging from getting VISAs to the intricacies of overlap extension were discussed over a cup of tea. As such, the meetup proved to be an important learning experience for both us, as hosts, as well as for the other teams.
Working with phages: A primer
During the course of our project, we felt that the use of phages as a target for genetic engineering is sparsely documented compared to more frequently used model organisms like E. coli. As such, the amount of literature review that we had to undertake for successful execution of even simple protocols was enormous.
To make sure no other teams face similar problems in the future, we decided to draft this document as a guideline for working with phages in a laboratory equipped with basic molecular biology machinery.

In this circuit leaf’s color changes are triggered by the designed genetic toggle switch comprised by an invertible stress-inducible promoter. This promoter up-regulates the expression of tobacco pathogenesis-related protein 1a ( Pr-1a ) in presence of salicylic acid (pathogenesis signaling phytohormone).
Pr-1a promoter feasibility inside our circuit for flagging pathogen presence was assesed following the experimental design .
Figure 11. a) Transcriptional unit for the expression of the Firefly luciferase under the control of a stress promoter. b) Transcriptional unit for the expression of the Firefly luciferase under the control of the stress promoter when Salicylic acid is being synthesized c) Transcriptional unit for the expression of the Firefly luciferase under the control of a weak promoter. d) Graphic representation of ratios luciferase/renilla of all treatments explained previously.
As can be seen in Figure 11, a significative differential expression were obtained between the salicylic acid treatment and the mock one (just water). That means, those plants infiltrated with the inducible construct and treated with salicylic acid presented higher levels of luciferase expression over those treated only with water.
Conclusion: Results show the suitability of using Pr1-a promoter for up-regulating expression levels. Therefore, Pr1-a and potentially other types of inducible promoters, postulate as candidates to"

Bioreactors as a safe measurement device and educational tool
MSU-iGEM 2017 drew inspiration for our project from the Flint Michigan water crisis. Fresh water contamination continues to impact wildlife and humans throughout the globe with contaminants ranging from oil to heavy metals and pesticides/pharmaceuticals. Contaminants such as lead are regulated by the EPA but pesticides, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals go unregulated. We wanted to emphasize detecting contaminants that are not regulated in hopes of developing a system that can even be incorporated into water treatment facilities.

Cloning the improved flip-flop into the miniTn7 module. Having not results electroporating ligation products, I used heat-shock transformation to try to clone the improved flip-flop into pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm and pUC18Sfi-miniTn7-Gm. I got red colonies, mainly when ligating with the second vector, which were checked by analytic digestions. I got one positive candidate for each construction.
Characterizing attTn7. I tried to electroporate a DH5α strain carrying pSB1C3-attTn7 plasmid with pTNS2 and pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm twice without achieving transformants in plate. Then I tried to do it by mating.
Characterizing pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm. Mating assays with E. coli MC4100 and S. typhimurium LT2 as receptor strains was performed, obtaining frequencies of 4x10-5 transposition/viable cell and 3x10-6 transposition/viable cell respectively. Then the site-specific insertion at the chromosomal attTn7 was checked by PCR, resulting in 12/12 positive results in each strain.
Constructing new plasmid with specialize functions based on pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm. A EcoRI/PstI digested pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm plasmid was ligated with the follow BioBricks: BBa_K093005, BBa_I732094, BBa_I732083, BBa_I13521, BBa_K325909. After chemically transformation, there were colonies in most of the plates, some of them even red because of the presence of a cloned RFP protein. Colony PCR was performed using the standard prefix and suffix primers, obtaining positive results for BBa_I732094 and BBa_K093005. BBa_I13521 (constitutive RFP) was not confirmed by PCR, by due to the presence of red colonies its verification must be achieved soon.

We're the 2016 Stanford-Brown iGEM Team.
This summer we were based at NASA Ames Research Center, and we worked toward building a bioballoon.
NASA is in the midst of several exciting long-term projects, exploring other planets and investigating the origins of life.  However, it is very costly to send research materials into space.  On the most recent Dragon cargo spacecraft sent to the International Space Station (ISS), the cost of cargo was about $9,100 per pound (i.e. over $9,100 to carry your typical 16-ounce water bottle1).  If NASA wants to continue to perform critical long-term studies like the search for life on Mars, the agency needs research tools that are less expensive to send and more reliable over extended periods of time.
This is where synthetic biology could prove a transformative technology. Instead of sending bulky materials, we could send microbes engineered to grow the components required to build various tools and structures.  This technology could help make sustained space research feasible.
This summer, our team has been working towards building a sensing balloon made of biomaterials .  Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: they can track weather patterns and monitor atmospheric composition.  Our bioballoon could be used to traverse long distances and collect data in hard-to-reach places on other planets, complementing a rover's capabilities. The bioballoon could be “grown” and re-grown with the same bacteria, dramatically reducing the cost of transport and production.
We have been engineering bacteria to produce balloon membrane polymers with different properties of strength and elasticity. We have used algae to produce biological hydrogen that could inflate the"

In the absence of blue light, YF1 phosphorylates FixJ that activates FixK2 promoter, allowing the transcription of lambda C1, thus repressing the amilCP output (Blue Chromophore Protein).
In light, however, YF1/FixJ has no effect on FixK2 promoter, which in turn has near-zero activity. The lambda C1 repressor concentration drops, eventually amilCP will be produced.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

BW25113 ΔfimA
FimA is the major subunit of E. coli type 1 (mannose  sensitive) fimbriae, also known as pili. Pili are made of ~1000 units of FimA. Its  deletion would remove the ability of a cell to produce fimbriae.[6]
BW25113 ΔompA
The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by  repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is  overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to  visible light.[4]
BW25113 ΔdosC
A heme-containing, oxygen-sensitive diguanylate cyclase.  Its overexpression drives the cell towards stationary phase physiology,  leading to more biofilm and less motility. DosC expression is dependent on σS .[7]
BW25113 ΔompX
Adhesion of the cell on a surface represses ompX. Its  deletion leads to increase in cell-surface contact in fimbriated E. coli, the  opposite occurs in non-fimbriated E. coli.[8]
BW25113 ΔpgaB
PgaB is involved in the transport of PGA – an  extramembrane polysaccharide – across the outer membrane. PGA is involved in the formation of biofilm: pgaB mutants form less biofilm. Its expression is increased in environments with 1% ethanol or NaCl. [9]
BW25113 ΔrcsA
+ Regulator of capsular polysaccharide synthesis. RcsA  and RcsB form a DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator. Deletion of this  gene should in principle cause some repression of extracellular  polysaccharides.[10]

MOTIVATION
Our survey showed that the majority of the general public either wished that they had learnt about synthetic biology or they would would want it to be a part of the school curriculum. Therefore, we aimed to design activities and interactive workshops for students of all ages. Have a look below on the different ways we educated and reached out to the young generation.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The main effects screening design was then used to generate the experimental design (Table 4).
Table 4: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE full supplement solution screening design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each supplement according to the table above.
Experimental Procedure 3
CFPS reactions were prepared and performed as usual, except the supplement solution had components at concentrations according to the main effects screening design. The experiment was repeated using two separate batches of cell extract; one which was initially moderately active (extract one) and one which initially had low activity (extract two). The results for each are shown below. It can be seen that for extract 1, the CFPS reaction with the highest CFPS activity was that with the original premix composition (R21), suggesting that the supplement solution was already near optimal. This is not surprising as the extract was already showing moderately high activity. Conversely, for extract 2, the reaction using the original premix was not the one with the highest CFPS activity. Similar to the first main effects screening design analysis performed, endpoint data was used with JMP to build a model predicting the important factors for each extract (bar charts below). This analysis shows that the most important factors vary greatly between each extract.

Contrast values are used as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response. a) From CFPS system data utilising the moderately active extract (extract 1). b) From the CFPS system data utilising the low activity extract (extract 2).
Conclusions and Future Work
This study has begun multifactorial analysis on the components of the supplemental solution for cell free protein synthesis systems. It has provided evidence that some supplements have a greater effect on a systems protein synthesis activity than others, and that the important factors may differ between cell extract batches. The ability to use a Design of Experiments approach towards the optimisation of CFPS systems has also been demonstrated. While this study has provided evidence towards"

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

The principle of necessity: Ensure the technical regulations and standard including packaging, labeling and contents declaration. Comply with technical regulations’ procedures and standard to open up international trade
The principle of avoiding unnecessary detention: Determine if it complies with the procedure, including sampling, testing and examination. And also making assessment, certification, promise-complaint, registration, approval and legalization should avoid unnecessary detention.
Possible controversies caused by labeling regulations
On industrial aspects
The new law lowered the permissible amount of unintentionally mingled genetic modified ingredients from five to three percent. Importers must purchase devices and improve the process to reduce unintentionally mingled genetic modified ingredients. In Taiwan, the amount of imported non-genetic modified agricultural raw materials is 100-fold less than other Asian countries. If we lower the permissible amount of genetic modified ingredients, it will also lower the amount of non-genetic modified raw materials. As a result, it will impact our current used food supply. Non-genetic modified materials are more expensive than genetic modified materials, so the price may incline due to the regulations.
On legal aspects
The purpose of labeling regulation is not only for food safety but to provide consumers with the chance to choose GMO products. According to the Food Sanitation and Safety Regulation, authorities should satisfy the human right of pursuing food safety and sanitation and also the right to know about the product they’re purchasing. It must comply with EU standards to label the genetic modified food. Furthermore, labeling problem is involved in TBT agreement. Consumers’ right is established in Treaties of European Union. Consumers are not the passive beneficiaries of food safety policies but the subjective participants. Consumers’ right includes health protection, safety, economic interests, information power, educational right and option agreement. Labeling regulation is a sort of food identity. The purpose is to improve option agreement for consumers.
The disputing point
The discrimination between intentional and unintentional
Everyone who adds genetic modified materials intentionally into a product, within any amount (even though it is lower than three percent), should label the product with “genetic modified” sign. To consumers, intentionally or unintentionally generally won’t make a difference if the genetic modified materials are fewer than three percent. Therefore, is it really necessary to differentiate intentional and unintentional? Besides, there are no sufficient evidences indicating lower percentage (three percent) of unintentional genetic modified addition achieves a different effect.
The labeling object changes from the result to the producing procedure.
For high-level processed products, even though they do not include genetic modified sequence, they still need to label “The product is processed by genetic modified materials, yet"

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Rathenau_-_-_TEXT.html," in overestimating our capabilities to reform life’.  He was very clear in his point of view by saying synthetic biologists have no governmental power, we are not politicians. We, as synthetic biologists, need to convince those people that we are concerned too. We are not just monsters creating even bigger monsters, no, we want to execute case-by-case studies and perform risk analysis before releasing something into the environment. Therefore the iGEM K.U.Leuven team thinks human practices are a very important part of scientific research. We want to inform people and talk with them about their anxieties and explain them what we are doing and why it could be beneficial for other people. One of the brilliant things of iGEM is the transparency; people can see what we are doing step by step and if they don’t agree with something or don’t feel save, they can always intervene and talk to us.
The second theme of the evening was ‘Regulation’. Question was how many risks we could take and how to justify those possible risks. The first speaker was from the CDJA (Christian Democrats), his statement was: ‘Synthetic biology should be prohibited, unless it offers a solution to a serious problem that affects society as a whole and the problem is not likely to be solved by other means in the future’. He thinks politicians should analyze every study case by case and decide whether to use it or not. He’s convinced synthetic biology is something dangerous and we can’t be too optimistic about it. The second speaker (Jonge Socialisten, Young Socialists) did not agree with this statement, he said: ‘SynBio and genetic modification should be regulated as if they were one (this means that all regulations should be equal for SynBio and GM for example concerning safety/ hygiene)’. The major issue with the first statement is the fact it’s time consuming. What if you have no government (and even win a world record for it, like Belgium) or if there are more important things to discuss in the politicians’ agenda? What if synthetic biology has created a cure for cancer and scientists need to wait until it’s approved by politicians? A lot of people could die or suffer while there is a cure. The politicians really think it is necessary to investigate every case, taking the risk to lose a lot of time? The representative from Imperial College London suggested an independent committee of scientists and non-scientists who investigate these cases and give their opinion on each study. Also the scientists would have to perform a risk analysis; this could be checked by other scientists and would be less time consuming than awaiting procedures from the government.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," factor A may have no effect, and removing only factor B may also have no effect, but removing both may cause an adverse effect. Therefore, it is important to take a multifactorial approach when investigating the importance of conditions or components of a system, or when trying to optimise a system. An issue with this approach is that a large number of experiments may be required to fully investigate all factors. By using statistical methods, a Design of Experiments (DoE) can be determined which has the minimum number of experiments required to explore questions such as the importance of factors in a system. This approach also allows for robustness testing or determining batch-batch variation (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As discussed here , CFPS systems can be plagued with issues rising from variation, so this approach offers a method to investigate the causes. It could also be used to determine less important components of the supplement solution premix which is added to CFPS systems, and hence a minimal supplement premix could be determined. There are several different types of DoE designs. One of these is the screening design (SD), which is used to create experimental designs to determine the factors with the highest effect on a system. Another design is the surface response design (SRD), which makes experimental designs to collect data for generating models which can predict optimal settings for many factors (SAS Institute Inc., 2016). Software tools, such as JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2016), can assist in creating these experimental designs.
Screening Design for Salt Supplements
Previous research has shown that the concentration of certain salts in the CFPS supplement premix are crucial for maximal protein synthesis activity [REF]. A Design of Experiments approach was used to determine which of the four salts (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate) are the most important using the JMP software. A classical screening design was created with all four salts as continuous factors and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit (Figure 1). The screening design generated is shown in table 1.
Figure 1: Response and Factors for CFPS Salt Supplement Screening Design: Screenshot of JMP software program. CFPS activity was set as the response, and the response was set to be maximised. All four salts were input as continuous factors. The “Construct a main effects screening design” radio button was selected.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," (such as with particular fusion proteins). Furthermore, the basis of our project is to establish a self-excising sequence (ribozymes), which should limit the expression of any intervening sequences to the RNA level. If the intervening sequence were something of environmental or public relevance (such as antibiotic resistance), the experimental design indicates that the sequence will be removed and, thus, not expressed. This is a relevant contribution of the design in limiting expression to the RNA level, which eases environmental hazard concern upon the accidental release of a GMO containing this biobrick. Therefore, the new biobrick parts submitted should not raise any safety issues.
The necessary facility, equipment and handling procedures associated with Level 2 Biosafety concerns were met:
1.Pipetting aids
2.Biosafety cabinets where applicable
3.Laboratory separated from other activities
4.Biohazard sign
5.Proper safety and disposal equipment, including autoclave
6.Personal protective equipment, worn only in the laboratory
7.Screw-capped tubes and bottles
8.Plastic disposable pasteur pipettes, when necessary
All precautions with respect to recombinant DNA were observed:
1.All waste was autoclaved before being thrown away.
2.Researchers practiced aseptic technique and personal hygiene and safety precautions
3.Procedures likely to generate aerosols are performed in a biosafety cabinet
4.Bench surfaces were disinfected with ethanol.
4.Potentially contaminated waste is separated from general waste
Safety Questions
1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose: The materials used in the lab are non toxic to health of individuals as well as to the environment. One of the major reagents that is used is GelRed which is used as a substitute for Ethidium Bromide. Gel Red is unable to penetrate into cells and so is a non-mutagenic agent. As well it has the same spectral characteristics as Ethidium Bromide and so has the same effectiveness of use. The project itself is safe even if released into the environment by design or accident since the part being expressed is the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Unless the sequences are mutated, the project poses no risk.
Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to these questions.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity? No
- threats to environmental quality? No
- security concerns? No
The parts that are associated with the project this year are at the same level of risk as the"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,". Consequently, we brainstormed ideas about binding PHB granules to beads after autolysis of engineered E.coli.
Week 2: May 8 - May 12
We continued practicing common lab procedures and reviewed similar projects from the past to explore avenues for improvement and innovation. As a result, we decided on a secretion based system as opposed to a lysis system. Concerns were also raised this week about the use of pure cultures with sludge in the wastewater treatment process. Genetically engineered bacteria can be out-competed if added directly to sludge while sterilizing sludge before introducing engineered bacteria would result in additional costs. Since PHB production occurs in nutrient-limited conditions, we also began to research ways to remove nutrients before inoculating sludge with the engineered bacteria. Our team started a draft outline of a proposed process from VFA production to PHB extraction and purification.
Week 3: May 15 - May 19
During this week, we discussed our sub-group’s role in the project and divided the work into subcategories: extraction and purification of PHB, quantification and characterization of PHB, process development/scale up. Objectives and milestones were then developed for each subcategory. Since extraction and purification of PHB step is one of the major contributors to high costs of PHB production (Jiang, Mikova, Kleerebezem, van der Wielen & Cuellar, 2015), we will research some novel, feasible extraction and purification methods for the large-scale process and will test proposed methods in the lab. The process development group will also support the synthesis group by quantifying and characterizing the PHB that they produce in the lab. This week, we looked into potential protocols and the availability of resources for lab-scale quantification and characterization of PHB. When designing a PHB production process, we will also consider scalability and feasibility at large by conducting a cost analysis for the proposed large-scale PHB production process.
We also met with Dr. Christine Sharp, a postdoctoral fellow from the Energy Bioengineering Group supervised by Dr. Marc Strous. Their group is working on PHB production using alkaline soda lake biomass and designing their own bioreactors.
Week 4: May 22 - May 26

Mer R construction (containing constitutive promoter) with regulated promoters and Mer TPBA in pSB1C3
The previous samples were linearized downstream and the RFP sequence was replaced by Mer TPBA. The samples containing Mer R were digested to released the constitutive promoter sequence + Mer R + regulated promoter. The Mer TPBA sample was linearized upstream with insertion of all previous sequences.
The samples were digested, purified, linked and transformed, the clones were selected, extracted and digested to confirm the linked insert and end the construction.
Mercury tests
Fluorescent promoters test, to analyze Mer R repression
For this test, we made a growth curve with fluorescence analysis, in spectrofluorometer. The chosen sample was the more repressed one along the curve, considering that Mer R was regulating RFP expression. The sample which the repression stood out was the sample with J23100 promoter. This sample prevailed in Mer Operon construction.
Fluorescent promoters test, inducting promoters with low-level of Mercury
In this test, the Mer R sample with RFP, at different concentrations of mercury (0 µg/mL; 0,5 µg/mL and 1µg/mL; in triplicate) were analyzed for 30 hours. The concentration level which better inducted RFP expression was 1µg/mL at last analysis
Test with mercury under concentration of 5µg/mL, 7,5µg/mL, 10µg/mL and 20µg/mL with former RTPA construction
The samples alongside BBa_K1355004 construction (made by the team in 2014) were evaluated on bacterial resistance, considering the growing of each sample under 5ug/mL of mercury. In the beginning, the construction with regulated promoter PJK26 stood out but at the end it fell over.
The tests were repeated under the following concentrations: 20 ug/mL, 10 ug/mL and 7,5 ug/mL, where the PJK26 regulated promoter stood out again."

Breadmaking
Our bread product does not have the characteristic color of beta-Carotene.
To test the feasibility of using our VitaYeast for bread, our team baked bread with it. Our bread is not for human consumption at the moment, as more extensive testing must be done to ensure that it is not harmful to humans. We will, however, use the bread to gauge the reactions of other people to the idea of VitaBread.
Genetically Modified Food Survey
The Northeast Market is located a few blocks away from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Source .   Fun Fact: This market was featured in HBO's The Wire
The human practices team decided to develop a survey to determine how favorably or unfavorably our VitaYeast is received. We want to see whether the public views our VitaYeast products differently from other GM products.
Having gained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, we have begun surveying Baltimore's Northeast Market and Lexington Market.
Results
Through surveying of Baltimore Residents in the Northeast and Lexington Markets, it was found that the most important factor taken into account when buying bread is the nutritional content of the bread while the least important factor is the genetic modification of the bread.  Question 9 of this survey (linked below) asks people to rank 6 factors (1 being the most important) in order of importance.  On average, ""Nutritional Content"" was ranked the most important with a mean rank of 2.73 while ""Genetic Modification"" was ranked the lowest with a mean rank of 4.65.  In order to validate these results, an F-test test between the genetic modification ranking and the nutritional value ranking was run.  This test yielded a P-value of less than 0.000118, suggesting that people favor nutritional content over genetic modification of food.
To view our latest draft of the survey, please click here .
Future Plans
After the iGEM conferences, we will collaborate with other Baltimore Universities to publish a paper on our results.  During our research on the survey, we noticed that opinions on GM foods differed across various developing nations.  For example, the residents of the Shanxi province of China seemed receptive to the idea of GM rice . For this reason, we see great potential in a future multinational survey.  We hope to later add to the growing body of work on the public acceptance GM foods and see how our VitaYeast fits into the debate, both in Baltimore"

increasing sensitivity.
Comments: not exactly a true application of last year’s decoder, maybe have it detect something beneficial vs something dangerous like ars. Or make a degrader instead for endocrine disrupters or estrogen. Pathogen contamination, parasites.
Didn’t get anything for synthetic RNA project b/c I was presenting
Post-presentation comments:
Synthetic RNA—easy to manipulate but not necessarily an effective regulator. No real definite application. Continuing the decoder:  we’d have to find a direct application, something that needs to be decoded. Or maybe even just get it to work since we have the parts. New inputs/outputs. Degrade contaminants.
We chose the decoder!
Think of what we can add to it, what we can decode, degradation of estrogen and endocrine disrupters. Still gonna use small RNA, 2 to 4 decoder

(The version of GFP used in the devices, GFP mut3b, has an excitation maximum at 501 nm and an emission maximum at 511 nm; fluorescein has an excitation maximum at 494 nm and an                       emission maximum at 525nm).
We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. By measuring these in our plate reader, we will generate a standard curve of fluorescence                       for                       fluorescein concentration. We will be able to use this to convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.
Protocol:
Prepare the fluorescein stock solution from dried fluorescein:
Spin down fluorescein kit tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
Prepare fluorescein stock solution (100 μM - 10x) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of PBS (1x). Note: it is important that the fluorescein is properly dissolved. To check this, after the                           resuspension                           you                           should pipette up and down and examine the solution in the pipette tip - if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to mix the solution until they disappear.
Dilute the fluorescein stock solution (10x) with PBS (1x) to make a fluorescein solution (1x) with concentration 10 μM: 100 μL of fluorescein stock (10x) into 900 μL PBS (1x).
Prepare the serial dilutions of fluorescein:
Accurate pipetting is essential. Serial dilutions will be performed across columns 1-11. COLUMN 12 must contain PBS buffer only.
Initially we will setup the plate with the fluorescein stock in column 1 and an equal volume of PBS (1x) in columns 2 to 12. We will perform a serial dilution by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column with good                       mixing.
Add 100 μl of PBS into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
Add 200 μl of fluorescein 1x stock solution into A1, B1, C1, D1
Transfer 100 μl of fluorescein stock solution from A1 into A2
Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A3"
SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Example_-_-_TEXT.html," between Numerical Simulation and Experiment Results
Based on the differential equations, we use the modeling function of CORE to make graphs of the dynamic performance of certain parts chosen by users. In the system we mainly observe the performance of YFP Protein and GFP Protein, as they are signaled by the light density they produced. The flexibility of toggle switch as regulators in circuits can be shown in its behavior pattern that the YFP or GFP protein dominates while the other one is close to 0, and they have the completely opposite varying trends. The boundary conditions and parameter values can be reset if different performance needed, with different slopes and initial values. In the example, we set the initial values of all variables as zero, which accords with the initial state of the experiment. (Users can also rewrite those values.)
In the graphing field of CORE we can easily get the graph of simulating dynamic performance of YFP, GFP and CI, as shown below:
So based on the model we can see in the graph that YFP is produced, while the production of GFP is inhibited. The result echoes the simulation result run from MATLAB, shown in the graph below:
We run our model (left curve) and experiment data (right curve) at the same time on MATLAB platform (the time interval is set as 10 hours according to the experiment time) and find the curves are close. Further, we make the fitted curve of the experiment data and find that it has the approaching trend with the simulation curve of the model, as shown below:
Error Explanation
But there is still some inevitable errors. We can see fluctuation in the data of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hour. This may be caused by random error of the plate reader. The data curve went more steadily from 5th to 8th hour than the simulate one. That's because we only used one tube of culture for measurement. Every time we took out 200μ culture for measurement, some of the bacteria were lost, and the growth were also paused for a moment due to the low temperature. This influence is especially obvious in the first few hours, but the two curves would finally be closer to each other. From 8th to 10th hour, the data curve rose much more rapidly because in this period, the loss of bacteria caused by measurement can be neglected. As there were less bacteria in the earlier period, the resources and space made it possible for bacteria to grow more rapidly.
Device Sources
We pick two devices from our database, sourcing from the former iGEM teams: Bologna, (https://2008.ig"

The energy of the same membrane area in E.coli is:
The relations can provide a basic vision of the statistical repartition of vesicles in case of absence of integrity control system in the outer membrane.
Ee is the potential energy of the lipid area in E.coli outer membrane before construction of a vesicle and Ev is the energy of the same lipid area but in the conformation after budding including a vesicle shape. So the energy which must be given to the whole system to create a vesicle is:
Mettre une courbe expliquant ceci
We can suppose that the most easily created vesicles will be the ones which require a minimum energy. By derivation we find that the minimum is obtain for:
Hence as we know that the range of created vesicles radii is 25 nm to 175nm we can suppose that the r’ is somehow about 100 nm. This leads us to an estimation of the outer membrane intrinsic curvature:
Which is realistic in the order of magnitude
In fact we know that the E.coli lipid bilayer is built of distinct types of lipids: Lippopolysacharides (LPS) and simple phospholipids. LPS are located in the exterior lipid layer of the outer membrane. The others are located in the interior lipid bilayer. Moreover, those LPS present a sugar extension toward the medium. Those sugars can bind to each other. So we can assume that they are going to create clusters and to curve the membrane toward the exterior of E.coli.
This part was dedicated to a first approach of the membrane shape and its characteristics introducing some concept of lipid membrane physics. It enable us to find a range value for one important parameter.
Tol-Pal proteins diffusion
Tol and Pal are membrane proteins which are located respectively in the outer and the inner membrane. The diffusion of proteins in those lipid bilayers can be modelled by a probabilistic Brownian movement. This diffusion model gives us the law of probability for the location of Tol and Pal on the membranes. It has been observed that the Tol and Pal proteins interact with each other, which is linked to the membrane stability: indeed the Tol and Pal will bind inner and outer membrane and furthermore stabilize the outer membrane using the peptidoglycan rigidity.

• Pond water
• Protein gels to see how much MT/MB is at cell surface and to check the size of the protein.
8. Modeling
• Floating of cell
• Amount of metal binding surface relative to entering cell
9. Steal Francis’ stuff
10. Cure cancer, maybe AIDS

Meeting with Dr. Rao
try metal sensitive promoter to regulate efflux pump c ollection system under a stationary phase promoter instead of a low affinity promoter. Takes longer to turn on. Or heat shock, temperature sensitive promoters. Look into those used for control of capsule formation for stationary phase promoters.
No to chemotaxis and thermotaxis as collection system
How can we expect efflux system to affect binding metal to TF—shouldn’t be a big deal, reach steady state. Affinity of TF higher than affinity of pump.
Try a bunch of membrane proteins
send Dr. Rao a copy of the paper
use the designs described in the papers for fusing metallothioneine to membrane protein, not RFC25.
using pore protein shouldn’t matter.
Protein half life—depends on the protein. TF tend to be more like minutes. GFP tends to be about 24 hours.
Agglutination—fimbrae and add powdered yeast and they’ll clump together
Flocculation—division mutants.
Site directed mutagenesis with DNA fragment instead of on a plasmid—needs to be on a plasmid.
mega primer PCR might work.
take berkeley’s biobricks for membrane proteins.
clone out all the membrane proteins, try them out.  Put them in high copy number plasmid.
with initial cloning, put into something without a promoter??
compare cells with MT to cells without.
Assays/diagnostic tools—outer membrane gel. -- boil cells, outer membrane prep, run on gel to visualize protein.
GFP isn’t functional in the periplasm. mCherry might be functional in the periplasm, don’t know about outside the cell.
How much can we fit on one plasmid—up to maybe 10-12 Kb, not including the backbone. Clone operon"

Press Coverage
At Newcastle University we like to be prepared - so we have arranged to have one or more rehearsals of our presentations with audiences.
The first scheduled presentation is to be held on Friday 23 October 2009 in Newcastle University, and is for the University's Bioinformatics group. Our instructors and advisors are members of this research group.
We are currently negotiating a time and date to hold a second rehearsal of our presentation. This second practice will be at Sunderland University, for the students of Noel Carter; one of our advisors. The city of Sunderland is just a short trip away from Newcastle, by Metro, Rail or Road.
All of this will lead up to the presentation that we hope that you will come to see at the Jamboree in Boston. We hope you enjoy learning about what we have been up to this Summer.

From table 8, the relative magnitude among parameters is:
\frac{{d\mu }}{{d{\rm{s}}}} < \mu  \approx {\gamma _P} < {k_{\rm{m}}} < {\gamma _M}\quad(19)
Therefore, only the third fraction is reserved. The solution for parameter   is complicated, but it is very close to an exponential decay. Then the quantity of protein can be expressed as:
P(t) = E\exp \int_0^t {\left( {\mu (s) - \frac{1}{{{\gamma _P} + \mu (s)}}\frac{{d\mu }}{{ds}}} \right)} ds + D\exp  - {\gamma _P}t\quad(20)

Stony_Brook,2015,Team:Stony Brook#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," first and only Synthetic Biology Club. This past semester, we presented at the annual Fall Involvement Fair. We were able to speak to hundreds of Stony Brook students about synthetic biology and our iGEM team. We also had people signup to join the club and stay informed.Our first general body meeting was a huge success! We had tons of interested students come down and spend a few hours learning! We think that the students had a great time and learned a lot. We plan on having meetings monthly, having different activities at each.
BIO202 & SSO101 Lecture
During one of the final days of class for BIO202: Molecular and Cellular Biology, we were able to present the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM to a class of about 500 students. These students were given a presentation on the meaning and applications of synthetic biology, the brief history and goal of iGEM, and the ways students can get involved in this emerging field. We were also able to present iGEM and synthetic biology for an SSO 101 event. Incoming freshmen are placed in themed residential colleges with one of them being SSO: Science and Society. Students must attend events which unite the residential college. At this event, our team presented our project, taught about the emergence of synthetic biology, and brought awareness to the rich research opportunities offered by iGEM.
Off Campus Outreach and Education
Cold Spring Harbor
During the months of July and August the Stony Brook iGEM team presented to hundreds of middle and high school students at the DNA learning Center in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. At each presentation, the students were introduced to an age-appropriate lesson on synthetic biology concepts and an overview of our project design. Many students were interested in learning about how to start an iGEM team at their high school; we provided them with the information needed to learn about how to start a high school team.
Maker Festival
The Stony Brook iGEM team was proud to participate in Long Island’s first Maker Festival, an event aiming to inspire young people’s interest in science and technology. The team worked with young fair attendees to build synthetic circuits using pre-cut foam pieces representing promoters, a gene of interest, and a terminator. The Maker Festival was also used as an opportunity to spread synthetic biology awareness in the community.

On June 3rd, members of the Stony Brook iGEM team visited Wantagh High School to educate high school students in biology and research methods classes about synthetic biology. Our presentation introduced the students to basic synthetic biology terminology, BioBricks, the iG"
Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales#mkeima_-_-_TEXT.html," demonstrates that the LUXoperon-mKeima gave a bioluminescent blue-light output, indicating that the LUXoperon is working correctly. However figure 6 shows that there is no inducible fluorescence generated by these bacteria. This indicates that further work is necessary to stimulate effective expression of both the LUX components and mKeima from the same operon.
Future plans
We had clear difficulties expressing mKeima in bacteria containing either biobricks BB_K2060001 or BB_K2060002 . Sadly we ran out of time to conduct further analysis but might would recommend the following experiments for future iGEM team interested in this area of research:
1. Induce expression at lower temperatures (18C or 22C) at varying concentrations of Arabinose (nM-mM range)
2. Addition of arabinose at different times in the bacterial growth cycle.
3. Vary timings post growth to allow for protein maturation
We hope that future iGEM teams will take advantage of the availability of these biobricks as potentially very useful tool for the analysis of gene expression. With increased time the development of these tools will be of benefit for the entire iGEM community.

Our project is Flavorator. We show its system working  under real-world conditions  in India . Because India has a problem about storage of foods.   We want to spread Flavorator  to the world , and we thought that our Flavorator can solve such as its problem. This is why we choose India.
According to Assocham that is Joint Chamber in India ,  30 percent of the total harvest of agricultural crops in India have been discarded by lack of refrigerated storage facility .  Refrigerated storage facility is insufficient in the retail market in rural areas and suburbs.In 2011, Refrigerator penetration  in the cities is 43.8% , and the villages is 9.4%(Fig. 1). The penetration  in rural areas is much smaller than the city . Its cause is considered that  supply of electricity are not yet ready. To solve this problem, there is a need for method of preserving  food products that do not require electricity in rural and suburban markets. Our Flavorator does not require electricity. So, we considered that it is used in situations such as the India, and designed Flavorator.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". We optimized our sequences for an E. coli expression, and adapted them to its secretion system by adding export signals. This way, our construction could be broadened and used in a different type of bacterium. To replicate our plasmids, we used E. coli DH5 alpha and to secrete our proteins, E. coli BL21De3 pLys S.
Conceptualizing our Proof of Concept
When conceptualizing our proof of concept device, we decided to design a microfluidic chip to simulate the actions that would occur inside the patient’s body. The chip would be capable of measuring the neuronal signal as well as the conductivity of the biofilm, letting us know whether our system would work correctly inside a prosthetic. After talking with many professionals such as Dr. Heng Lu (ESPCI) and Dr. Ayako Yamada (ENS, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris), we first designed a PDMS microfluidic chip with a vitreous carbon electrode to measure the signals. After talking with Dr. Catherine Villard (Institut Curie, Paris) and Dr. Frederic Khanoufi (University Paris Diderot—ITODYS), an electrochemist, we realized this type of electrode was highly sensitive, perhaps too sensitive for our type of device, and not adaptable to the size of our microfluidic chip. Guided by their advice, we switched to gold electrodes and started the fabrication process of the different type of chips at the Pierre Gilles de Gennes Institute. After attending the iCOE 2018, we learned about PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate ), and its conductive properties. As we also wanted to confine our bacteria so they would not harm our neuronal cells, we partnered with Sterlitech , and tested nanoporous polycarbonate membranes coated in gold as well as nanoporous alumina oxide membrane coated in PEDOT: PSS, PEDOT: CL and PEDOT: TS. This way, we could still measure the neuronal signal and the conductivity of the biofilm while protecting the cells from getting eaten by the bacteria.
Designing the interface between the tissues and the prosthetis
When we started to think about the scientific aspect of our project, we also started to design and think about how our biofilm would integrate into a physical medical device. First, we wanted to design a full prosthesis. We realized that it wasn’t the core of the problem. Indeed, the technology missing in this field was the actual interface between the"
