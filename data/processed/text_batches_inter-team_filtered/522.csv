Marcin Ziemniak
I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics , UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Andrzej Prokop
I was born in Sanok and I'm studying Molecular Biology at the University of Warsaw. I have just defended my bachelor's thesis in the topic of RNA-directed DNA methylation. I am fascinated with the RNA WORLD and my plan is to continue that passion in practical way. I also share some passions with this guy with the millipede avatar, which are spiders, snakes, scorpions and other cute and fluffy animals. Moreover, I like good black metal, ambient, classical music and garlic.
Justyna Lesiak
I am a student of Master Degree in Molecular Biology at the Univeristy of Warsaw, but I spent last semester at Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. Now I am working in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology and in the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. I am not focused on one topic, and I always wanted to do lots of new and challenging things in the science area, however I must admit cancer researches are one of my very favourites, as well as human mitochondrial diseases. In my spare time I like to listen to classical and chamber music, read books, do irish dancing (I admire reels and hornpipes) and horseback riding.
Sebastian Jeleń
I come from small town in the south-east Poland. I always wanted to study chemistry but 4 years ago I suddenly decided to study biotechnology. After these 4 years of study I see that it wasn't bad decision. Except doing some research in my lab (hSUV3 rules!) I love taking pictures and playing computer games.
Anna Saffray
I am a high school student and I have lived in Warsaw since 2003. Before that  I lived in France near Paris . I  always loved to do some experiments in my school , so when I started to work in the laboratory it was a great pleasure spending days with pipettes.

Examinationof V. natriegens as chassis for protein interaction studies
Before we started to establish our strain, we had to verify if the wildtype strain of V. natriegens is suited to work in an interaction study assay based on the B2H system. For this purpose, we tested if our strain possesses a functional mal or lac operon by plating wildtype on diverse media which were:
LBv2 agar plates supplemented with IPTG and Xgal used for Blue-White Screening if the lac operon is functional.
M63 minimal medium agar plates supplemented with maltose to test if the mal operon is functional.
MacConkey agar plates to test if the mal operon is functional.
Characterization of VibriInteract
After obtaining our final strain we have to characterize it, because why would anyone use a new strain? With our characterization we want to show you how easy it is to use VibriInteract. Therefore, we designed experiments to demonstrate the benefits of V. natriegens and how little changes you have to undergo to use VibriInteract instead of the commonly used E. coli strain BTH101. First, we did growth curves, to verify that VibriInteract is faster than BTH101. Second, we did microscopic studies to verify that the cells of our strain still look healthy. Last and most important, we did a Protein Interaction study to verify that the pUT18 and pKT25 plasmids of the commercially sold B2H kit are working in our strain.
Outlook
For the future, we would like modify genes also modified in our cloning strain, which are recA, katG, dns and exeM. Those modification would help the foreign plasmids used for the B2H Assay to be retained in the cell. Read more about in the VibriClone part of our Strain Engineering subgroup. It could also be beneficial to eliminate the restriction endonuclease homologous to HsdR in E. coli. By this, foreign DNA is less likely to be degraded. Additionally, we would like to replace the non-functional lacZ gene with the lac operon of a wildtype E. coli strain like K12 MG1655. Hereby, we could use blue-white screening for our assays. This screening method is much faster than the selection on maltose minimal medium"

Transformation of 29/06 ligation products (containing C, D, E, H, L, N gBlocks)
Protocol 1.5
*only 9 tubes of competent DH5alpha E. coli left in the freezer after this round of transformation, as such more will need to be made by the end of the week
Conduct plating under the filter hood. Add antibiotic to molten agar whilst in bottle, such that the antibiotic (Chl or Amp) is diluted by 1000 times. Then gently mix. Pour just enough agar to cover the surface of the petri dishes. Plates should take ~30mins to set.
Then add volume of E. coli according to protocol, using beads to spread across petri dish.
Day 9
Plasmid restriction digest - pSB1C3, pBAD33, and pBAD/HisB
Restriciton digest of SB1C3, pBAD33, and pBAD/HisB completely, using the 1.2 protocol and consulting the master table for the correct buffer and restiction enzymes.
Resultant Gel
100mL 1% agarose made up, small plate loaded and remainder left in bottle on shelf.
Total volume per tube is 35uL. Each tube’s contents split into two wells (17.5µL per well), and gel was run on 80V p.d. for 45 minutes.
* Gel can help tell if any digestion occurred at all - if no digestion occurred plasmid would still remain circular, and circular plasmid would encounter more resistance migrating through the gel matrix than linear plasmid of the same size and hence appear to be bigger than expected when compared against the ladder.
Bands were excised and the heaviest chunk was 0.66g. 670uL of XP2
Binding Buffer was added to each excised chunk to initiate E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction protocol.
Enzymatic Reaction Clean-up - 30/06 PCR Products
Protocol is 1.13
Retrieve products (on labelled yellow rack) from -20°C and perform clean-up.
The volume of the restriction digest reaction done on 01/07 was 50µL per tube hence according to protocol 50µL of XP2 Binding Buffer added to each tube.
Upon completion of protocol, tubes placed back into -20°C until plasmids ready for ligation.

There were also some doctors who believed that this was a new therapeutic strategy that was worth trying. It may be a ray of dawn for those patients in serious condition who currently had no treatment methods, but the problems of the safety and effectiveness must be paid attention to. In response to the doctor's feedback, we did a careful job of sorting out and absorbed the valuable suggestions.
Furthermore, some other advice also benefited us greatly. Dr. Hua Zhao told us that the clinical blood uric acid concentration lowering methods were very limited. At present, there are only three kinds of drugs allowed to be listed in China: allopurinol, benzyl bromide, and Malone. Therefore, it is very valuable to have other treatment methods, which can make the means of clinical uric acid lowering therapy more diverse. Dr. Yi Zhao advised us to pay attention to the coordination between the scientific significance and feasibility of the project, and suggested that we should focus on our intestinal part. In addition, as for the part of our animal experiments, he reminded us that the animal model of gout was different from that of hyperuricemia, and we must clearly consider to choose the correct model, besides the positive control group should be set up in animal experiments. We will integrate Dr. Zhao’s advice into the part of animal experiments, making the design more scientific and reasonable.
The interviews with the six doctors made us learn a lot. They let us realize that our subject was really meet the clinical needs, rather than indulged in empty talk, which brought the rich clinical background to the subject. We also got a lot of improvements on our project, we humbly absorbed and integrated them into the subject. Thank a lot to the doctors!

Questionnaire for Patients with Hyperuricemia
As a therapeutic project, we believe that the patient's situation and their opinions on us are very important. Because our project ultimately serves the patients. Their needs are met and their pain is relieved even eliminated, which is the gold standard to evaluate our project. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire for patients with hyperuricemia, to investigate the patient's true situation and their views on the treatment of hyperuricemia.
This questionnaire included three parts, which were “basic information”, “basic living and treatment condition” and “views and opinions on new drugs or therapies”. “Basic information” included participants' age, sex, and blood uric acid concentration; “The basic living and treatment condition” included the degree of"

Once they were exposed to a certain stimuli, they would lengthen as a function of time. So the longer the e.coli were in length, the longer they had been exposed to the chemical stimuli. o Helpful in a biological context, also a nanorecorder for toxins or pollutants. o Possible project idea: rewire e.coli to detect any type of toxins for a specific environment.  Another idea, not only does the e.coli change color when a toxin is detected, but it starts to break the toxin down. Research if past iGEM teams have done this. - First place: University of Washington o Used e.coli to produce alkanes, a major part of diesel fuel o Used a protease that digested gluten and made it able to digest more gluten (idea of taking pills with the protease in it so gluten intolerant people can take the pill) o Biobricks: magnetic e.coli, magnetism toolkit for future iGEM teams, submitted 65 biobricks! - Will talk about Imperial College London and JZU – China next week Project Ideas! - The above e.coli that detects and cleans up toxins - A harmless e.coli that goes in your body and detects trace amount of carcinogens or other toxins - Bioskins: gloves with e.coli on them that would change color letting you know what different types of chemicals are on your gloves or that there is too much dangerous chemical on your hands - Getting rid of carbon monoxide. Either in your home through a bacterial system, or putting it in factories to purify the exhaust air before it is released - Bacteria that make biofuels. Lets repurpose these to make them even more useful. Can we harness photosynthesis or put them in the smokestacks to purify the air? - Create a bacteria to keep invasive populations in check. (light sensitive so they undergo apoptosis during the day) - BUT – we need to research these ideas to make sure that we can actually execute these. - The iGEM categories: Best food or energy project, best environment project, best health or medicine project, best manufacturing project, best new application area, best foundational advance, best software tool, best information processing project, best human practices advance, best poster, best entrepreneurship - We REALLY want to register for both iGEM and the new entrepreneurial competition.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Measurement
Using Current for Protein Expression
MSU-iGEM 2017 developed a measurement tool that researchers throughout synthetic biology can utilize. Green fluorescent proteins (GFP) are used under aerobic conditions to signal protein expression (2,5,8). Unfortunately, for researchers working under anaerobic conditions, GFP does not mature and thus fluoresce under anaerobic conditions (3). Therefore, we showed that current induced via IPTG produces a reproducible signal for protein expression under anaerobic conditions. Current induction occurs 18 min after IPTG is added displaying a more rapid response than GFP expression. This measurement tool even proves to be more efficient than GFP expression under aerobic conditions due to the rapid current increased after induction. Also, current can be measured using simpler measuring tools than other anaerobic protein expression tools. Some examples of these other tools include: measuring hydrogen production and sampling for several metabolic fluxes (4,7,9). MSU-iGEM’s simplistic bioreactors utilizing Arduino boards (1,6,10) are a model example of a system that can quantitatively measure protein expression via current increase in a more versatile way than using tools for measuring GFP fluorescence.
GFP Fluorescence Measurement Study
MSU iGEM character demo
Discussion
Current was measured anaerobically and samples were taken before and after IPTG was added to allow the GFP to mature with exposure to oxygen for one hour. These measurements were then correlated to the current data along the same time scale. When comparing the graphs, current shows a response approximately in 18 min. and a peak about 13 hours post IPTG. On the contrary, 13 hours was needed to just allow for enough GFP protein to be made to then see a response once aerobically matured. This displays the advantage of current as a reporter for protein expression.

The model can help authorities decide what actions to take when high levels of lead are found in water. The model also helped us identify an ideal detection limit for our system. Read more about our model on our Model page .
Product Design
From our discussion with Dr. Bain, we decided to focus more on lead detection than thallium detection. In the circuit, it was a simple matter of switching the DNAzyme. However, the general population would benefit more from a lead sensor than a thallium sensor. Lead is a much more widespread problem because many houses still use lead pipes, which can corrode in acidic water. The risk lead contamination poses, especially to young children, means that lead detection is more pressing than thallium detection. Although thallium is also very poisonous, the risk of thallium poisoning from water is not as great. We also decided to use a reporter that could be detected with the naked eye. Since LacZ is an enzyme, it is limited by the amount of substrate, not by the amount of protein that is produced in the cell-free reaction. Also, the color change from yellow to purple is obvious, which would decrease the uncertainty in reading the results of the test.

La Vision Générale
L'Idée
La Biologie Synthétique ouvre des nouvelles possibilités dans les domaines biologiques, telle la communication cellulaire. Dés son commencement et jusqu'à nous jours, celle-ci reposait sur le principe de la communication avec des messagers exclusivement chimiques. Ces messagers chimiques ont alors une portée limitée: même des messagers de portée assez longue comme les hormones, sont limités dans le système chimique qu'est le corps humain. Mais ce paradigme sera bientôt renversé.
Notre objectif dans ce projet s'agit de rendre la barrière chimique obsolète avec l'utilisation d'un messager non-chimique, c'est-à-dire des photons. Ceux-ci vont transporter l'information à communiquer entre des cellules spécialement modifiées équipées de deux habilitées: la perception et l'émission de la lumière. On va donc créer un nouvel système de photo-communication inter-cellulaire.
Nos messagers seront crées par des réactions de Bioluminescence, et ils seront assez capables de traverses des divers milieux. Logiquement, cela permet la propagation de l'information au-delà des restrictions chimiques, biologiques, et même spatiales. Du fait d'av"

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Transcriptomics#cDNA Conversion_-_-_TEXT.html,"DNA product as it is not digested properly. The RNase Cocktail contains RNAse A and T1, which are only supposed to introduce nicks into the RNA. Provided that LongAmp Taq polymerase does not degrade these fragment and that the purification beads (AMPure XP, Agencourt) do have affinity to both RNA and DNA, the RNA would be found in the sample.
Experiment:
This troubleshooting experiment had three major parts: i) optimizing the protocol for the use of RNase Cocktail using longer incubation time and/or larger quantity, ii) use of RNAse H for digestion and iii) clean-up step with purification beads to determine whether the beads have affinity for RNA.
1. Total of 8 samples with 125 ng of RNA were prepared (from previous cDNA samples that shown RNA contamination, eg. there was DNA present in the samples as well). The experiment was optimized for time and amount of RNase Cocktail.
2. RNA ladder was digested using both RNase H, RNAse Cocktail or both. Also each of the tests was prepared in either RNase-free water or buffer solution used during the cDNA synthesis. Digested DNA was visualised on a gel.
3. 1000 ng of RNA ladder were purified using AMX beads and shown on a gel.
Results:
Overall, it was seen that subsequent digestion of RNA contaminated samples was successful regardless of used concentration as shown below. Digestion of RNA ladder using RNase H and/or RNase Cocktail shows complete digestion for RNase Cocktail while RNase H seems to not be working. The beads do carry over most of the RNA including rather small fragments (200 bp). The detailed results of each experiments are shown below:

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HannahArendt_-_-_TEXT.html," the whole. Arendt phrases it in the following way: “the spectator occupies a position that enables him to see the whole; the actor, because he is part of the play must enact his part-he is partial by definition. The spectator is impartial by definition-no part is assigned him.” (Arendt, 55). In the context of iGEM this would mean that the teams would be drawn in by their particular perspective on synthetic biology which is shaped by their involvement in the competition and their ambition to win. A spectator would not be bothered by these ambitions and would be able to take a distance and see things in a larger perspective.
But how much does the public really know about synthetic biology in order to judge it? This indeed seems a valid objection. However, what we are concerned with in this paper is not assessing scientific truths, but with the ethical or social importance of scientific innovations. Even though, one might not understand how DNA is synthesized into a genome, one might still be able to judge the value of the creation of a bacteria that is able to prevent certain illnesses, protect our crops without using pesticides or the recreation of certain lifeforms that went extinct. What is required though, for the public to judge these developments, specifically within the field of synthetic biology, is that they are acquainted with the concepts of synthetic biology and the innovations that take place within this field. This mirrors what Arendt argues in her lectures, namely that to judge is to “go visiting”, meaning that one's own judgment is based on the possible judgments of others (Arendt, 43). In relation to developments in synthetic biology, this would include getting the public acquainted with the concepts and ideas of scientists working within this field.
In fact, Kant provides a standard that the public judges by, namely the idea of progress, which seems very close to the standard that scientists use to judge their own work, namely to advance knowledge within their respective field or discipline. Arendt argues that for Kant this notion of progress is not necessarily scientific progress, or man made progress but the progress of nature. Here we arrive at an important point, because due to this notion of progress, as Arendt points out, the importance of an event “lies precisely not at its end but in its opening up new horizons for the future. It is the hope it contained for future generations” that makes an event and important event (Arendt, 56). Both the position of the onlooker-that is, his informed non-involvement-and the idea of progress, which is to judge an event according to the promise that it holds"

Revived parts: I746351 & R0065
Initiator/Las receiver progress:
R0082-RBS-RFP was successfully ligated w/ RBS-C0051-B0015.
PCR screened R0082-RBS-C0051-stop. Miraculously, bands showed up for all 12 samples.  And this was done using both the old and new Taq polymerase.  Strange.  After this, we proceeded to PCR screen R0052-RBS-RFP-RBS-C0051-B0015 and I14015-RBS-C0051-B0015 as well, and we obtained positive results.  Time to prepare these for sequencing.
Next step is to place the I14015-RBS-C0051-B0015 into a carbenicillin backbone because it is currently in a kanamycin resistant backbone.  This is necessary because the chassis that we will be transforming these plasmids into are already kanamycin resistant.  Thus, we need to replace I14015’s kanamycin resistant backbone.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html," using common tools such as Clustal and Blast. I searched for a conserved motif to make one primer suitable for all four bacterial strains, but the conserved sequences were not  long enough. In consequence, I designed two different glmS of primers, one for E. coli and S. typhimurium and another one for P. aeruginosa and P putida.
attTn7, the insertion site of the Tn7 transposon, is very well conserved in Gram-negative bacteria. However, if you want to use our mini-Tn7 based BioBrick delivery system in an organism without the attTn7, don’t worry, we plan to create a ""portable"" attTn7 for you. To this end, I designed primers to amplify the attTn7 site in the E. coli genome.
Not having a better task to do, as you can see, this was primer design week for me
Week 4 (July, 25-29)
Back to a hard-working week. As my time in the lab passes I realize that I can perform more experiments in less time, which does not always mean to get better results. Wednesday was an incredible day: I did more of the molecular biology technics I already know, and our mini-Tn7 synthesis order arrived. I exploded with enthusiasm. These were my main tasks this week:
Checking DH5α-λpir electro-competent cells. I electroporated the previously prepared cells with a pBluescript SK(+) vector and I got approximately 2.5 108 transformants/μg. It was not the expected >109 transformants/μg, but it is an acceptable frequency even for cloning experiments.
Not amplifying the pUC18R6KT vector from pTNS2. This week I made a huge effort to obtain a suicide vector to deliver the mini-Tn7, but finally I did not get it. I performed at least one PCR reaction with this aim every day, changing conditions (polymerase, nucleotide concentration, DNA concentration, different primer preparations, even already made PCR mix) and PCR cycle (temperature and time of steps). In the last try I performed a gradient PCR to determine the optimum annealing temperature with a PCR mix kit where there was not much that could do wrong, but even then I did not get any amplification. Then we thought that the SfiI restriction site we added to the primers could be avoiding the annealing, so we designed new primers where some nucleotides of the"

6. Multiple Integration
At the beginning of our project, we set up our goal as sound visualization. We prepared for every part of our project based on papers we searched. We found that the sound receptor is the biggest problem for the construction of the whole system, while there is no direct receptor of sound on cell membrane.
During our Human Practice consultation, one of the professors, Fangyi Chen, who studied on artificial cochlea gave us a hint about looking for mechanically gated channels in human ears. Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent transduction from sound wave to shear force. Given those suggestions, we read a paper about channels on plant cell membrane may take responsibility for their ability of sound sensing, which suggests the possible applications of our project. [2] Also, we designed microfluidics and other stimulus to test our system.
When we studied advanced knowledge about sound-sensitive channels, we consulted Dr. Zhiyi Wei majoring in Biochemistry & Structural Biology suggested that if we want to achieve better efficiency, we ought to use directed evolution methods to strengthen the sensitivity on protein level.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", we aim for OxyPonics to eventually be used in full scale hydroponic systems. This means we must guarantee our end products follow more the FDA regulations for growing crops. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule has established a minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of fruits and vegetables grown for human consumption. Of particular relevance to our project, the FDA maintains that the E. Coli levels in our system must be below detectable levels, or less than 126 CFU (Colony Forming Units) per 100 mL of agricultural water [6]. Our containment system - placing the bacteria in dialysis tubing - should prevent the levels of E. Coli from rising to levels deemed unsafe by the FDA. For additional safety, we will also ensure that all crops produced with aid from Oxyponics are sanitized after being in close proximity with the genetically modified E. coli contained in the dialysis tubing. Further still, E. coli used in our system are non-pathogenic, which means their potential danger is greatly minimized and theoretically should not be considered a threat to humans.
Overall, we believe that the FDA, EPA, and USDA have a clear need to design more versatile policies to truly assess the legal implications of OxyPonics.
PUBLIC ETHICS
To understand the intersections between our project and society, we consulted the work of Dr. Greg Kaebnick of the Hastings Institute. Founded in 1969, the Hastings Institute was the world’s first bioethics research think tank and has the mission to assess the ethics of health and biotechnology and their impact on communities and public policy. In his assessment of synthetic biology, he discussed the intrinsic characteristics of synthetic biology. According to Dr. Kaebnick, the prospect of creating synthetic organisms may go against what we believe is natural, but it is hard, or even impossible, to draw a line between what is natural and what is not [7]. A strain of yeast that produces an antimalarial may not be “natural”, but is it ethically wrong to use it to save lives? Dr. Kaebnick’s report was especially valuable to us because it raised questions about the role of government and policy about biotechnology moving forward. We had to ask ourselves and our legislators about the implications of our definition of “natural” being altered and the role of government as it relates to what is natural.
In terms of policy making, Dr. Kaebnick’s work allowed us to think about synthetic biology as a broad enabling technologically with many applications, rather than a technology for a particular purpose"

Analysis of Protein
Software
Analysis of the Mtd protein was conducted using our own 'Protein Calculator' software alongside PyMOL. The Protein Calculator allows users to see the potential effects of polymorphic nucleotides in their DNA library on the protein level. The PyMOL software allows users to upload, visualize, and modify molecules of interest in 3D. Together, these two programs allowed our team to locate variable amino acids in the Mtd, as well as predict the effects on binding affinity that the polymorphic nucleotides can have on the resulting protein.
Instructions to download and use our program are as follows. (Disclaimer! There are still several bugs in the Protein Calculator program that are still in the process of being fixed. The dropbox download link below will be updated with newer versions as the fixes are made.)
1) Click the link dropbox link below and download the files.
Step 1.
2) Your computer may display some type of warning- ignore the warning to download the program.
Step 2.
3) Extract the zip file into the directory/location of your choice.
Step 3.
4) Open Sequence.txt to enter the DNA sequence you wish to analyze. Be sure to keep Sequence.txt in the same directory as Protein Calculator.exe. Important: enter the sequence such that it is within an appropriate reading frame (number of base pairs must be multiple of 3), the nucleotides are in all capital letters, and entered in the 5' -> 3' direction.
Step 4.
5) Once Sequence.txt contains your DNA sequence in the appropriate format, open Protein Calculator.exe. Another warning may appear- click 'Run Anyway' to run the program.
Step 5.
6) A cmd window will open with instructions. A new .txt file should appear in the same directory as Protein Calculator.exe called OutputData.txt. This text file contains information about your polymorphic DNA sequence library.
Step 6.
7) Open OutputData.txt to view resulting data. Before closing the program, copy this data onto a separate file- all text will be deleted upon closing the program (by entering '0' in the cmd window).

Utah_State,2013,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"SA (Li et al 2012). Further studies by (Zhang et al 2010) have shown that removing the first few amino acid residues of the peptide dramatically reduced the hemolytic activity while having only minute effects on antimicrobial properties. This attribute would be highly desirable in any usage that would interact with humans and helped to determine our choice our peptides. The combination of high bacterial toxicity with low hemolytic activity justify more testing into the precise mechanisms of OH-CATH and its ability to be used as a scaffold for other antibiotic purposes.
AMP production in E. coli
There are many problems with producing AMPs on a large scale. Natural purification of these AMPs is a slow process and is generally inefficient. A more viable option is chemical synthesis. However, this process is extremely costly (Li, 2011). Finding a way to overcome these problems is key to the development of a new antimicrobial product. Producing AMPs in bacteria such as E. coli using recombinant DNA techniques could provide an answer to increasing production rates and decreasing costs.
The first obstacle faced in producing AMPs in E. coli is how to avoid inhibiting E. coli growth itself before satisfactory AMP concentrations have been achieved. E. coli is easy to engineer, is quick to grow, and inexpensive to use. This makes it the most attractive bacteria to use for protein production. To prevent the culture from dying before producing the desired AMP, strong transcriptional promoters must be included to reduce gene expression to a very low basal level (Sorensen & Mortensen, 2004). This promoter allows the E. coli culture to reach stationary growth phase before being induced to begin high-level gene expression of the AMP. In this and most studies, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is used as an inducer.
We have chosen our antimicrobial peptides because they belong to several families of proteins and have the ability to inhibit a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms.
Antimicrobial Spider Silk
Antimicrobial spider silk proteins (functionalized spider silk) could be used to make antimicrobial spider silk fibers or films. A previous study by Gomes et al. 2011 demonstrated that it is feasible to produce antimicrobial spider silk films.  The Utah State iGEM team in 2012 was able to successfully produce spider silk proteins in E. coli with the use of BioBricks and successfully spin spider silk protein that was approximately 25.4 kDa in size.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In Vivo Characterization
In vivo Main | TetR-RFP System | TetR-LacI-RFP System | Ptet Characterization | Plac Characterization | Plasmid Details
Our overall strategy to develop new transcription factors includes an in vivo characterization of the affinity and specificity of our TetR mutants. To that end, we set up two reporter systems based on RFP fluorescence.
The first reporter system consists of a TetR-RFP cascade. It has been successfully used to characterize some TetR mutants. Our second reporter system is a longer cascade, made up of TetR, LacI and RFP. Whereas in the first system RFP is expressed in the absence of a TetR-Ptet interaction, in the second one, the TetR-Ptet interaction directly induces RFP expression. The affinity of each mutant can be deduced from the RFP expression profile induced in our reporter system. The specificity can be assessed by coupling each mutant to different Ptet sequences.
To set up and characterize our two reporter systems, we assembled several plasmids that are to be co-transformed in order to create the whole system. We also had to characterize the two different promoters we used to control RFP expression: an existing Ptet promoter and a new Plac promoter. It is important to know the intrinsic strength of these promoters in order to be able to properly analyze the data generated by our two reporter systems.

As a suggested direction for our future University of Calgary iGEM Team, we put forward the idea of holding an ethics conference in the online virtual world of Second Life ™. The purpose of this conference would be to foster debate regarding ethical issues, amongst people, who may have some background in the field of synthetic biology. This novel approach to the ethical aspect of our future projects differs from the surveys and conferences that are usually organized when exploring ethics. As a novel method of...

It is a three-dimensional chat engine, a videogame platform, a virtual reality, and an online classroom all combined into one. It has also gained a lot of attention for its potential as an educational platform because
It has educational groups that are devoted to promote some specific fields of Business, Arts, and Sciences; and
It has educational islands and centers that are dedicated to promoting educational fields.
Educational groups, such as those that are devoted to promote science, hold conferences and group discussions in which they invite guest speakers, who are either experts in the field or are part of some organization that is related to the topic of discussion. They also invite a general academic audience, that listens to the discussions"

As our PI had the necessary training he could act as the Biosafety Officer within the school. He scrutinised all the risk assessments and finally signed them off. Having done this, we approached the Imperial College team and asked their supervisors if they would act as out GMO safety consultants in order to obtain the permission to start the work. Having addressed their suggestions, we sent off our notification and were allowed to start working.
Transport of materials
Our organisms and DNA were kept securely in the school and Imperial College laboratories and transfer of any biological materials was performed under strictly controlled conditions as per the regulations - double sealed containers to prevent against a leak to the surrounding environment, clearly labelled and protected. Containers were clearly labelled with the details of the two labs between which they were transported and only our PI was allowed to transport these from one place to the other.
Researcher safety
In the school labs very few potentially hazardous chemical substances were used during the project and safer supplements for a wide range of processes were used to ensure our safety. With all processes (transformations, ligations etc.) proper sterile technique was used and all wastes, spills and used equipment was instantaneously disposed in Virkon and autoclaved to prevent contamination. All procedures and lab processes were taught to us by the personnel trained in these techniques, after which we were performing them on our own. All the wet lab sessions were supervised by our PI. All the team members were able to effectively carry out safety protocols laid down by the biosafety officer and the handbook. The team was properly briefed on emergency procedures such as fire drills and burn treatments. The entire team took part in a scheduled (and an unscheduled) fire drill during lab time over the summer.
Biosafety
The organisms used in the project were: E.coli DH5α (K-12 derivative) and Synechocystis PCC6803. None of the aforementioned were classed above a risk group 1 by biological safety associations including the ABSA  (American Biological Safety Association). None of these organisms, each used in varying procedures, pose any threat to healthy adults. We took care to ensure that none of the chassis used in the procedures were pathogenic and that each was extremely harmless.
Safe project design
Currently, one of the limiting steps is the rate of growth of cyanobacterias the rate of Carbon Dioxide transport into the carbxxysome. By overexpressing the bicarbonate transporter CmpA and linking it to a strong constitutive promoter we are hoping to increase the growth rate of cyanobacteria making it possible for them to be used in shorter time"

Design & Evolutionary Approaches in iGEM Projects
Flow Chart of Engineering a Genetically Engineered Machine
In the iGEM competition, teams specify, design, build, and test simple biological systems made from standard, interchangeable biological parts. Most projects engineer the systems by modeling and measurement, including this project itself. This engineering approach is proved to be feasible but difficult in the design of biological systems during this years.
Most BioBrick parts have never been characterized, because characterization and documentation of the parts usually takes a lot of time. Further more, the properties of BioBrick parts and devices are very sensitive to the conditions they work in, such as strain, plasmid, other parts used together, culture medium, growth rate, temperature, pH, shaking rate, light, and so on. It is very difficult to characterize all the parameters, so the parts often have to be remeasured in different projects before the behavior of the system can be predicted.
There are also many projects using evolutionary approaches. These approaches use selection or screening to find the needed part, eliminate the steps of measurement or constructing new parts with desired properties.

On a case-by-case basis, it is regulated by a specific non-ministry government institution The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety on 5 different fields: foods, plants, animals, fishes, and microorganisms. They review all the required technical documents and inform whether or not it is needed to do a follow-up laboratory test and so on.
Korea
The committee of the Biosafety is the umbrella body for other GMO supervising ministries. With the help of the Korea Biosafety Clearing House (KBCH), which is the information center, each Ministry takes care of case falling under their supervision. For instance, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning is in charge of the academical usages of GMOs.

Deterministic Model
Formulation of the Model
First of all, we constructed the deterministic model to estimate the behavior of the counter. In this model, biochemical reactions are described as differential equations and concentration of reaction product can be calculated by those of reactants. This model is intuitive, simple and hence popular to estimate the result of experiment. We were able to get some parameters for modeling of counter from previous works.[→ see parameter section]
We had simplified the construction of the mathematical model before described time evolution in which concentrations of mRNAs and proteins change as differential equations. First, we regarded that the reaction between taRNA(trans-activating RNA) and crRNA(cis-repressor RNA) in riboregulator is much faster than that of transcription or translation and equilibrium reaction. This diminution of parameters enable us to use the equilibrium constant as a parameter and prevent us from overfitting when we adapt this model to raw data.
equation (1):
<img src = ""
""  height=""50px"" class = ""math"" />
So, the concentrations of mRNAs and the coupling of taRNA and crRNA are represented as stated above . Subscript means the gene encoded by the mRNA. We regarded that the affinities between crRNA and taRNA on different mRNAs were equal. The dissociation constant of equilibrium reaction was therefore shown as following.
equation (2):
<img src = ""
"" height=""100px"" class = ""math"" />
Using dissociation constant, concentrations of reaction products such as [mcrcr-σ ] could be described as function of those of taRNA and mRNA of σ and GFP. We put X, A and B as the total quantity of taRNA, sigma and GFP, respectively.

equation (5):

Using these equations((3)-(5)) and equilibrium constant, concentrations of free taRNA, free mRNAs and taRNA-mRNA complexes are described as following. These are all of simplifications.

Introductory Lab Session: 9th July 2009
Experiment Recap
10 colonies of transformed E.coli cells - 2 containing GFP, 8 containing RFP
Up to this point, we have successfully isolated and cultured single colonies of E.coli cells. With these micro-organisms, we were able to induce competence and had the opportunity to transform them with the following BioBricks:
BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AK3
BBa_I13522 with plasmid pSB1AK3
BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AT3
So far, we are convinced that 2 colonies of our cultured E.coli cells have become transformed by BioBrick BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) which encodes GFP and that 10 colonies of our cultured E.coli cells have been transformed by BioBrick BBa_J04450 (with plasmid pSB1AT3), which leads to the production of RFP. This can be seen visually in the tubes; see image in the previous experiment under the heading ' Observations '.
However visual representations may not always available and in these scenarios, it is difficult to tell whether the E.coli have become transformed by the given BioBrick unless DNA analysis is conducted. Even though the cells have survived the negative selection process (i.e. antibiotic exposure), it doesn't mean that they all possess the BioBrick - they could have received that resistance through other means.

Life
When discussing ethical questions concerning the implications of the approaches in synthetic biology, the ultimate questions that always come up are: what is life? and what is natural?. Although these questions are possibly never fully answerable, there are a lot of different definitions going around and people have different opinions on it. The questions before are partially a means to help answer these questions. Can the reductionist approach ever lead to an explanation of life? Even though we tried to focus on a narrow subject in all the ethical issues that are raised by synthetic biology, the questions that involve life are still too massive to handle. Famous philosophers have thought about comparable dilemmas centuries ago. The prospects of synthetic biology re-initiates the discussion, a result of researchers working on the brink of understanding and creating life. How do the people involved in the iGEM competition think about life?

(2)The anti-sigma factors strongly repress the transcription from their corresponding promoter. (3)They and their corresponding anti-sigmas have negligible impact on growth of E. coli. (4) The sequence of their corresponding promoter conform to the standard of BioBrick. [4]
The cis-repressor sequence is crR12 (BBa_K1461000) and trans-activating RNA is taR12 (BBa_K1461003). This pair is selected because the leakage is minimum. ［5］The reporter in this construction is GFP(BBa_E0040) with AAV degradation tag (BBa_I11012).
mechanism and extension
At first, both the values of sigma1-memory and sigma2-memory are 0. Only the crRNA coding sigma1, which is at downstream of the constitutive promoter is transcribed. After the first induction of arabinose, taRNA at the downstream of PBAD is transcribed and the crRNA coding sigma1 is translated, and the value of sigma1-memory changes from 0 to 1. Since sigma1 exists, crRNA coding sigma2 at the downstream of Psigma1 is transcribed. After the second induction of arabinose, taRNA is transcribed and sigma2 is expressed, and the value of sigma2-memory changes from 0 to 1. At this time, GFP at the downstream of Psigma2 is expressed and the number of count being 2 is observed.
After induction of IPTG, anti-sigma1 and anti-sigma2 are expressed, and the value of sigma1-memory and sigma2-memory changes to 0 (if the value of sigma memories are already 0, they remains 0). GFP is decomposed since AAV degradation tag is added. Therefore the count is reset.

Since there are many kinds of pairs of sigma factors and corresponding promoters which have one-to-one correspondence, an n-counter, which is a resettable counter which can count up to the number n, can be made by the same way. Furthermore, the construction of 2-counter can be simplified.

The conditions used for detection in this image were the same as for figure 28, showing that our uncertainty in a measurement like this is likely around 10%. This is twice that of the automated cell counter we used [7]. This is a positive result, as it implies that, as the analysis techniques we have used are developed in future, we can approach the accuracy of widely used lab equipment.
Figure 31 shows E. coli LW06 at 5x magnification. The cells' diffraction patterns were misshapen for the same reasons as those presented, above, for figure 29. Regardless, the count achieved was around a factor of 2 less than the value obtained through optical density analysis (which was performed at 600 nm wavelength). Yet again, as evidence that our concept is useful, this result is promising.
Figure 32 shows Galdieria sulphuraria at 1x magnification. This was a densely populated sample, though the software still performed well. The blue outline denotes that the cell was detected by looking at the gradient image. The percentage difference between the Countess II FL reading and our own value was 15%. This equates to a difference in count of around 7. This serves as perhaps our best evidence that, when all goes according to plan with our current hardware and software, it functions as an at least somewhat viable alternative to other cell counting methods.
Confirming Cell Counts in a Co-Sample
Figure 33: C. reinhardtii and G. sulphuraria: C = 21, D = 1, M = 1, N = 150. The Countess II FL reading returned (6.28 x 105) cells/mL for the combined total of the organisms. Our calculated value was (3.8 x 105) cells/mL.
Figure 34: C. reinhardtii and G. sulphuraria: C = 9, D = 1, M = 1, N = 150. The Countess II FL was only capable of reading the total cell count, so we have no corroboratory datum for this test. Our count for the larger species was (1.6 x 105) cells/mL.
Results: Figures 33 and 34 show a co-sample of C. reinhardtii and G. sulphuraria. It was made by combining a sample of a set volume for each of the organisms. The C. reinhardtii sample had (4.17 x 105) cells/mL and the G. sulphuraria had (3.02 x 105)"

From the first june 2018 to the 26th of this month, I mainly carried out litterature and I helped for experiments on biobricks construction.
I had to design the freeze-drying and drying protocols, I made some researches and bioinformatics to design a plasmid to overexpress trehalose in DH5α and the primers for PCR to create the biobrick using Gibson Assembly method. I also had to look for a laboratory lyophilizer which worked.

This reveals, that a huge fraction of participants doesn’t feel well consulted about this topic by their doctor.
Figure 7: Vaccination
Are you, your family members and your pets vaccinated regularly? b) I think that nation-wide vaccination can prevent an outbreak of disease in nurseries (n=148).
We asked those who have been regularly vaccinated, whether a nation-wide vaccination campaign  can prevent outbreaks of diseases in nurseries. This is at the moment controversially discussed in Germany. Our participants were clearly convinced, that this would be an effective measure to prevent outbreaks of diseases in nurseries.
Figure 8: Vaccination is mostly accepted by society.
Nevertheless we would like to learn about your personal motives for this rather unpleasant procedure. State your reasons for vaccination (n=145). Possible answers: Totally agree, I agree, I rather agree, I rather disagree, I disagree, and I totally disagree.

Depicted here are the most common reasons for which people undergo a vaccination. As a leading motivation, the believe in the efficacy of vaccination was cited, followed by the awareness of responsibility not only for themselves, but also for others. The least motivating reasons are recommendations from the health insurance or general practitioner.
Figure 9: Mandatory vaccination
Since an outbreak of measles, there is a controversial debate on reintroducing mandatory vaccination. Some people regard this as a violation of personal rights granted by the German Constitution that states individual freedom of choice as basal right. Other people regard vaccination as necessary service for the common good (n=127). Possible answers: Totally agree, I agree, I rather agree, I rather disagree, I disagree, and I totally disagree. These questions were only addresses to people who stated to vaccinate themselves and their family members.

There are many reasons why a regular vaccination is not wanted or possible. In the following questionnaire you can enter which reasons are most true for yourself (n=19). Possible answers: Totally agree, I agree, I rather agree, I rather disagree, I disagree, and I totally disagree. These questions were only addressed to people, who stated to not vaccinate themselves or only their pets.

I Introduction to the Problem
In our design, our engineered bacteria work as a knife which breaks the surface of scale insect, and the ‘sucrose-induced enzyme release’ system makes sure that these enzymes would not harm other plants. Also, we transformed our bacteria into powder that can be easily used by the famers. We have instructions (see our modeling) for them to cultivate the bacteria to certain stage and then spread the solution to the plants suffering scale insect.
In view of the subtropical monsoon climate in Shenzhen, scale insects can be found everywhere when people walk through a grove, a park, a garden or even a school. These little white creatures are known for their wax covers which can effectively protect them from most contact pesticides and make them become one of the most annoying and formidable crop pests.
Plants like blueberry, citrus, pomelo and other crops can be easily infested by scale insects; therefore, when scale insects appear, it seems to be a calamity for farmers and planters. They are like a plague which can spread quickly from plants to plants, leaf to leaf, sucking the sap from their stems and bringing death to them. Usually, there is no way for farmers to efficaciously and environmental-friendly slaughter these little white creatures, which are like defiant robbers steal the sweet sap not only from crop plants but also from on urban plants.
For citizens who live in megalopolis, planting succulent plants have already become a new fashion today. However, when succulent plants are planted, no matter indoor or outdoor, they are easily infested by scale insects as well, for they often hide in the nooks and crannies of the succulents plants which make them difficult to detect and killed by insecticides.
In order to maintain optimal health of the succulent plant, people across the world have spent years seeking an ideal solution which can perpetually avoid the infestation of the scales and keep them from sucking out the sap of the plants.

Coliclock application
Speaking in general, Coliclock system controls the lifetime of GMOs in the environment. But further than that, our team was interested in some more specific applications. We chose to analyze previous and this year's iGEM projects and tried to theoretically incorporate our system in their genetically engineered bacteria.
Bee. coli
First project that we were interested in, was 2013 Taipei team’s Bee.coli project. This team suggested light induced system to prevent the spreading of their genetically engineered bacteria. According to their data and experiment, this system works in vitro in a lab environment. If we think about Bee. Coli in the environmet and live bees, it’s easy to imagine that this kind of bacteria can spread in the dark and get into other species.
If we added our Coliclock system into Bee. coli, bacteria would produce proteins against Nosema ceranae, parazite, which affects bees and causes them to get sick and after some time this bacteria will die. In theory, Bee. coli project would ne responsible for the protein system, whilst our construct, Coliclock would be responsible for the time of the performed function. Regulation of light is not essential here and bacteria will back out on its own.
PlastiCure
Many iGEM projects, associated with some kind of material degradation, are based on the idea that bacteria only lives, when there is enough food around it. For example, oil decomposing bacteria dies, when there is scarcity of an oil around. But this system is not 100% safe. Bacteria does not have a system that prevents accidental spreading. Our system can be a solution.
This year Pasteur Paris team created a project, called PlastiCure . Their bacteriaq is able to decompose PET in seas and use following degradation products to synthesize bioactive compouds. In this case we can suggest our system. If we had incorporated Coliclock in Plasticure, it would become a safe solution to world oceans.

Our lab in March.
During March, we displayed the experiment of fruit DNA extraction to some young children and instructed them to do the experiment by their own. A seminar with some high school teachers and students was held in the museum and a discussion about how to start and get involved into IGEM took place, which partly contributed to the foundation of Hangzhou No.4 High School and Hangzhou No.14 High School iGEM team.
Later in June, we presented an activity especially for high school IGEMers and other students interested in synthetic biology. Dr.Zhang Haoqian, who was the team leader of Peking IGEM and now a doctor doing research about synthetic biology, was invited to give a speech. The high school IGEMers then got the chance to try an experiment called Rainbow Kit, which is one of the achievements of the University of Alberta iGEM 2009. All students participating in the activity learnt a lot while having great fun.
In August, a carnival of synthetic biology was held in STM with our unique “Poly Cards” game, which taught citizens to know more about synthetic biology and our project.

Knowledge Parade: National Institute of Public Health and the Environment
During the knowledge parade, we met some farmers and doctors. Here, we gained more insights in the needs and the challenges in the field, like the demand for resistance detection for specific genes in the intensive care.
Doctors
Investigating the needs in antibiotics field, we visited our general practitioners. They confirmed that there is a demand for diagnostic tools that reveal antibiotic resistance. Doctors seem to face challenges considering viral or bacterial infections, the identification of the pathogen causing the infection, resistance detection and the susceptibility to existing drugs.

Doctors seem to face challenges considering viral or bacterial infections, the identification of the pathogen causing the infection, resistance detection and the susceptibility to existing drugs.
See our applied design page .
Validation with Dairy Farmer - Paul Oosthoek
We also received feedback on how we can improve our device. Paul stated that it would be better if the test really showed which specific antibiotic should be used for treatment, instead of knowing which antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Another piece of feedback was to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 1.5 mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to increase the visibility and to be more user-friendly.
See our applied design page and our demonstrate page .

Through digestion, ligation, transformation and cPCR, we have successfully selected the expected strain with J100071. The plasmid is pSB1A3.
Week3 (Mar 30 -April 5)
We sequenced the gene LdhA and the result is right. Then we transform the plasmid LdhA-pET28a into the BL21(DE3) and verified it firstly. The result of verification is success.
Through PCR, we constructed the device J23119+B0034+glsA(JBG) for further testing. The plasmid has been replaced by pSB1C3.
Through 3A assembly, we constructed the device J100071+B0034+E1010(RFP) for further testing. The plasmid has been replaced by pSB1C3.
Week4 (Apr 6 -April 12)
We used same method to got and constructed other acid production gene, such as PflB(formic acid production), Pta and AckA (acetic acid production) and so on. At the same time, we verified the gene LdhA again.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we tested the acid resistance ability of the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG.
We set a pH gradient pH=3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and measured the OD600.
However, the result is not ideal.
Week5 (Apr 13 -April 19)
We finished the verification of LdhA(lactic acid production), PflB(formic acid production), Pta and AckA(acetic acid production) three times.
We measured the intensity of red florescence to test the function of J10071 promoter.
Week6 (Apr 20 -April 26)
We finished the verification of DhaB(3-hydroxypropionic acid production), PhaC, PhaA and PhaB(3-hydroxybutyric acid production) three times.
We constructed the standard part with the functional gene glsA."

Process diagram of the steps a user must go through to produce a simulation in BSim 2009
The steps in the above process are described in more detail below:
The first step in the process is the ‘imports’ step. This portion of a JAVA file lists all the other files that should be searched when a function is called. This allows a programmer to call functions defined elsewhere, rather than having to define them explicitly within the main JAVA file.
Creating a blank simulation, is uniform across whatever type of simulation a user wishes to run. Once a blank simulation is created, it behaves like a workspace into which additional objects and behaviours can be added.
Setting simulation options allows the user to specify the size and boundary conditions for the simulation.
Defining bacterial classes involves specifying in detail the behaviour of any species of bacteria required in the simulation. This would also be the stage at which users would specify other objects, such as chemical fields or mesh shapes.
Once the types of bacteria have been defined, users must specify how many of each type of bacteria they want added to the simulation, and where their initial positions are. BSim can allocate random initial positions if needed.
The ‘ticker’ is a device that performs all the actions required during each time step. In general, the functions that are performed in each time step are defined before this point, and simply called within the ticker. The ticker also serves as the simulation clock, keeping track of how much time has passed.
The drawer is where the display properties of objects are described. Once the existence of an object is stated (in step 3), the drawer only needs to be told what colour to display that object in.
The final step requires the user to state how the simulation data should be expressed. This can be in the form of an immediate preview, a recorded movie or image, or as raw data in CSV (Comma Separated Variables) format.
Creating Simulations using the GUI
The figure below shows the process of creating a simulation using the new BSim GUI. Note that, by packaging many of the previous steps together, this new process is cut down to 4 compulsory and 1 optional step. Also, none of the compulsory steps require the user to understand JAVA code.
Process diagram of the steps a user must go through to produce a simulation using the new GUI
The first step in the process is completed automatically as soon as the GUI is opened, without any further user interaction. The next three compulsory steps are handled through dialog boxes that can be reached via the GUI 'Home' screen. Users are required to enter data in the form of numbers or mathematical equations"
Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," inside human bodies, in the ocean?
Because our prototype is meant to be used in the ocean, we envision a bioreactor design that ensures the engineered microbes act as a closed system that is not released into the ocean environment. (See schematic in description. ) The influx of plastic will make that difficult, but future directions for research will include solidifying design to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the ocean environment. At our current stage of research, we have determined that PETase production exerts a significant metabolic load on our expression cells, making them unlikely to be able to survive in the ocean environment. Furthermore, E. coli have been shown to lose viability after exposure to seawater, suggesting they would not survive and proliferate if they escaped Plastiback 1. This being said, our future work includes testing bioengineered control mechanisms such as a kill switch or synthetic amino-acid dependency 2 to make the risk of escape and proliferation in the environment even smaller. Lastly, because the Delftia bacteria in the microbial fuel cell is not genetically modified, its escape does not pose a significant risk.
If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?
Direct benefits of a successful and efficient plastic-sensing system, such as Plastiback, will be felt by researchers looking to map the distribution of plastics in the ocean, who have no alternative to physical sampling. Plastiback’s contribution to ocean plastic research will affect how well the effects of plastic pollution are neutralized. The device has immense potential to be useful tool for protecting ocean ecology. Because the ocean surrounds us and touches each of our lives every day, this application will benefit the global community.
As part of the prototype stage of our design, we are considering the environmental impact of the product in the oceans. Future directions of our project are mechanical design solutions to the following important questions:
How do we prevent small animals from getting trapped in the device?
Will the device stay afloat and be easy to retrieve from the ocean?
What happens when it's all used up? Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?
At the end of a Plastiback’s life cycle, it will be retrieved, sterilized, and reused. Collected debris will go to appropriate waste management systems.
Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?
Based on our research, Plastiback is currently the only remote plastic detection device. Estimates of plastic in the ocean are currently derived from surveys by research crews hauling nets through the ocean and hand-counting pieces of plastic3. Plastib"

Today, the summer semester ends and the biological experiment comes. As we are green-hands in the field of biology, everyone feels very disturbed. Doctor Chen encourages us to cheer up and teaches us how to transform. After one and a half hour, we finally get it. We successfully finish the transformation of B0034!
15th, Jul
Today, we continue to do cell transformation. We get our medium of B0034 from incubator. Unfortunately, we find that there is nothing in the medium. I am very sad, but our captain encourages us to try again. We manage to do it with the rest B0034 in the kit. After one hour, the assignment today is completed. We wish that our effort wouldn't be in vain.
16th, Jul
The transformation of B0034 proves to be a success. Everyone here is excited and ready to finish the transformation of C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034.At the same time, we contact Doctor Chen and tell him the exciting news. He congratulates us and promise to teach us the procedure of shaking bacteria.
17th, Jul
Today, we learn how to pick the right colonies that we need and the protocol of shaking bacteria. After some practice, we learn the point of this step, and quickly finish our work (including B0034, C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034) today.
18th, Jul
Doctor Chen teaches us the protocol of plasmid extraction. Compared with the experiments we have done before, plasmid extraction is really a big problem. To finish plasmid extraction, there are eleven steps that we have to do. The work takes us more than one and a half hours. With the help of Doctor Chen, we finally finish the extraction of B0034,C0079,B0015,R0079,J23116 and J37034.

When it happened
Week 0
A few members of the team, fresh from their exams, began the initial literature reviews necessary to identify the genes and promoters that were required in our biological sensors that would detect and respond to signaling molecules released by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (DSF), Burkholderia cenocepacia (BDSF) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PQS). Finally, rpfC, rpfG, clp and PmanA were to be cloned to detect DSF; BCAM0227, BCAM0228 and Pcbld for BDSF; and pqsR and PpqsA for PQS.    Primers were designed (which included restriction sites required for cloning and also HA-tags to detect for protein expression) for the PQS sensing system and ordered from Sigma Aldrich.  All sequences were analyzed with Webcutter 2.0 to detect restriction sites that conflict with the BioBrick assembly standard RFC [10]. It was found clp contained an illegal PstI site; BCAM0228 and rpfg contained an illegal EcoRI site. Primers were then designed for use with QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit to remove illegal sites. It was decided at this stage that for the DSF system, homologues of all sequences would be taken from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as they have"

Tryst (February-March 2015)
Tryst is the annual science and technology festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. iGEM team IIT Delhi set up a stall, which was aimed at encouraging and promoting synthetic biology by using a myriad of ways to do this.
The team set up an on spot DNA extraction technique which allows any person to see the DNA extracted from their saliva or a fruit (banana and strawberry) with their naked eye. The team also displayed its iGEM project from the 2014 jamboree. A fun quiz called bioathlon was also organized which included prizes for the top 3 entries. iGEM Team IIT Delhi was awarded the 1st runner up prize in the ‘Best stall in Tryst 2015’ category.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," methanogenesis still has a point in ruminal ecology. The removal of hydrogen prevents inhibition of the fermentative processes which are essential for the cattle’s digestion [6] .
Therefore, decreasing the rate of methanogenesis might be positive for the climate, but probably not so for the cattle’s digestion. In contrast, no such disadvantages come along with our idea of degrading methane because methanogenesis itself would not be prevented. Therefore, the methanogens could still fulfill their important role in the cattle’s digestion. As the methane is not further utilized anyway, degrading it should not cause any damage to the animal.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .
All our code was written by current team members, except the small bits otherwise attributed . All images which we didn't make ourselves are attributed beneath the image. Images without explicit licenses are reproduced with written consent of the rights holders.

Gillespie algorithm
the reverse process of the gene between the two Loxp sites could not be well described by the DDE or ODE equations since after the reverse process, the gene will have chance to flip again. This process is a discrete, stochastic process instead of a continuous, deterministic process. To make the model more convincing, we use Gillespie algorithm, which is a kind of stochastic simulation algorithm to generate a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation. readmore
Our model
In our model , we use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the process of inversion. Here we use   Markov chain to describe the process of inversion. We assume that the state ‘A’ , ‘B’ , ‘C’ , ‘D’ , is the original state , the state after inversion , the  Intermediate state when A forms holiday junction, the Intermediate state when B forms holiday  junction respectively. readmore
A better model
1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ are seen as a whole in the above model. To make the simulation more convincing, we then simulate the trajectory of every single molecule. After that we synthesize all trajectories to get the final result. readmore

Tsinghua-A,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," description in MATLAB and did simulation analysis accordingly. The result showed that the system could oscillate under certain parameters.
To further understand what parameters could make the system oscillate, we did bifurcation analysis on the Hill parameters. What we had to do was find the critical points where the system can nearly oscillate but a little disruption may lead to a steady state.
Depicting all those critical points, as shown in the figure, the system could oscillate when cellB's Hill parameters were located in the  area named Bistable.
The figure right is the phase trajectory of two signal molecules in environment,  the more it looks like a circle, the more steadily our system will oscillate.
Our system oscillates when parameters were selected in the area named 'Bistable'
By adjusting certain parameters, we saw that the oscillation’s period and phase could be controlled properly, which is the most impressive character of our system. Here we present a figure that the oscillation phase was adjusted by adding araC, which could induce the pBad promoter, in cell type B. After adding araC to our system at certain time, the oscillation was interrupted at beginning, but could gradually recover and finally, the phase was changed.

Dimensionless Model
In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, and sensitivity of parameters, we further simplified the model to make them dimensionless. In addition, we tried to introduce feedback to  our system and made a brief analysis on different types of   feedback we introduced. Some analyses were similar to the simplified  DDE model, and you can see more details by clicking read more

Quorum Sensing Effect
What we have analyzed so far is focused on two-cell oscillation. Quorum-sensing oscillator is not simply a matter of expansion in magnitude, but a matter of robustness in allowing difference of each individual cell. Moreover, we test the adjustment of phase and period of oscillation in this part.
As we all know, no two things in this world are exactly the same, so do cells. The major differences between individual cells that we take into consideration include:
●Each cell's activity of promoter is varied, so each cell has different rate to generate AHL.
●The initial amount of AHL may be disproportionally distributed among cells.
The rate of generating AHL is closely related to parameter m and n. Therefore, we introduce randomness to both parameters by letting them obey normal distribution, that is:
m(i)= μ1+N(0,σ1);
n(i)= μ2+N(0,σ2);

The Concept
Ethics
We are all collectively responsible for the future of our planet. We should therefore carefully consider and weigh choices that are made during all the phases of an iGEM project: ideation, execution and application concept design. This page will elaborate on how we have considered different applied ethics aspects during our project. Ethical questions are not simple, and one quickly runs into arguments about the nature of morality and the arbitrary definitions of value. In this section, however, life and the absence of suffering are considered universal values. Furthermore, utilitarianism is here considered to be one good perspective in ethics discussions relating to science and responsibility. Utilitarianism is, simply put, the view that morally the best action is such that results in the least suffering and most pleasure - combined together. Let us now speculate on our project, synthetic biology, intellectual property rights and science communication, this thought framework in mind. [1]
Ethics in Our Project
It is true that a genetically engineered machine could in theory be used in a harmful way on purpose, especially if the open source aspect is not supervised in any way. However, since we are working with Safety level 1 organisms, the produced product dermcidin can already be found from human skin and cellulose is a natural material, our project can be considered to be relatively safe and the potential harm in a situation of our modified Escherichia coli escaping outside the lab is relatively small and it would be difficult to use it to do harm even on purpose. This does not mean that it would be entirely safe or responsible to free them to the nature since their antibiotic resistance to Kanamycin or Chloramphenicol could spread to other bacteria in nature and cause some trouble in the future. During our project, we collected our team members' sweat and analysed the dermcidin it contains. Our original plan was to also analyse the amount of DCD-1L present in sweat, but our synthetic control peptide was better used in other tests, and we therefore discarded this plan. Sweat collection in mind, we first"
