It also increases the degradation rate of mRNA when it is bound in dsRNA due to the presence of the Hfq binding site on the asRNA sequence which is suspected to recruit RNase to degrade the targeted RNA chain.
Fig. 1 Positive Feedback loop of the Sensing Module
2 System of Reactions
We can describe the Sensing module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
Note that in our construct LuxR is constitutively produceed, and thus, treating its production and degradation as in         equilibrium, we assume they are conserved.
Note that in the second equation, which accounts for the diﬀusion through the membrane, if the intracellular AHL concentration         is lower than the extracellular concentration, the rate would become negative and this would represent AHL diﬀusing         into the cell. If the rate is positive, it would represent AHL diﬀusing out of the cell.
3 Approximations
3.1 Quasi-Steady-State Approximation
To simplify our model, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). Because the rate of binding and dissociation         are much faster than the rate of transcription and translation, we can simplify the set of reactions by treating         some reactions as being in steady-state equilibrium.
This approximation is applied to the reactions of
AHL and LuxR into LuxR_AHL and (LuxR_AHL)2
(LuxR_AHL)2 and pLuxR
asRNA and mRNA
3.2 Solution Volume Approximation
Because the volume of a cell is generally much smaller than the volume of the solution it is in, we apply the approximation         that AHL diﬀusing into or out of the cell has no eﬀect on the extracellular AHL concentration.
This approximation is applied to the diﬀusion reaction of AHL into and out of the cell.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied             the approximations as stated.
4.1 Simulation without asRNA
First, we simulate the model without asRNA to show how leakiness can potentially cause problems due to the positive             feedback loop.
Fig. 2 Positive feedback loop simulation from [AHL]extracellular = 0 M
The graph shows a simulation where the initial concentration of AHL is 0. The amount of AHL in the cell steadily             increases even though no AHL was added, which means that the leakiness of the promoter is creating more AHL,             which then"

To ""resuspend"", wash the solution up and down in a micropipette. Be careful to not create foam.
Return the resuspension buffer to the refrigerator when it is not longer needed.
Concentration measurement
Plasmid concentration is finally measured using the Nanodrop 1000 photospectrometer. It is controlled by the ""ND-1000"" software (icon on the desktop).
Load nucleic acid program: if necessary, click ""exit"" to return to the main menu, then ""Nucleic Acid"". Initialise as instructed, by depositing a ul drop of water on the sensor.
Calibrate the spectrometer: deposit a 1 ul drop of buffer solution onto the sensor, and click the ""blank"" button.
Measure plamsid concentration: deposit 1 ul of plasmid solution onto the sensor, and measure with the ""measure"" button. The reported plasmid concentration is considered valid if the ""260/280"" ratio is larger than 1.80.

5. Documentation
Please think of the way you want to document your workshop beforehand, if at all. Keep in mind that you ask for permission and that your documentation does not interfere with the workshop ambiance. A good way to document is to ask people for quotes.
6. Recommendations
From our own experience, we would like to give some recommendations on parts that did not go according to plan.
Different from our plan was that we had bigger groups of 15 to 20 people, because we did not have enough moderators to enable smaller groups. The discussions were still interesting, but this did mean that some of the depth we had hoped for was lost. Feedback from our moderators was that 20 minutes was not enough time to have everyone in the group participate fully. So if in any way possible, make the groups small.
As expected, the discussions on gene drives were more broad than the ones on bioluminescent trees. Choosing the introduction material is very important. If you have a shy, bigger group more guided material is good. For people to really think of their own views and values, less guided starting material is better.
If you want to assign participants to (several) tables, you need some sort of system to do this. We decided to hand out sheets of paper with two numbers on it (a group number for the first and second round). You can also assign people by counting or let them choose themselves.

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, there are many problems and obstacles in their experiments. Thus, it is necessary for them to get familiar with regulations of the competition as soon as possible for the purpose of researching in a more directional and objective way. So, we explained the concept of laboratory safety, Interlab, some technical methods and precautions commonly used in the experiments. And we also shared our experiences of experiments with them, such as what to do when you get an unexpected result During the lecture, the members of the CDHSU listened to us very carefully and asked us in detail about what they did not understand of the video, such as the laboratory safety levels. At the same time, we found that they had some mistakes in the aseptic operation. So we reminded them of the importance of the aseptic operation, for it is the basis of successful experiments. We also gave them some failure examples. Then it came to the Gibson assembly and the golden gate assembly. For most of the students in CDHSU, it was the first time for them to get to know these two technologies. But they showed great interest and came to understand the main methods and functions. They also tried to compare their strengths and weaknesses critically. After that, they shared what they had got in this lecture. Although some complicated gene circuits were still somehow beyond their understanding, they got to know how to start an iGEM project after our patient explanation. We had a sense of achievement that this lecture did help them to some extent. On the other hand, through the communication we also realized that we should pay more attention to the simplicity and operability of our project -- CRISProgrammer. After the lecture, we went to their lab, observed their experimental operation and put forward many constructive suggestions, such as the plates cannot be completely exposed to the air at any time. Also, we obtained more detailed information about their project, which enabled us to give them reliable advice later in the further cooperation. Due to the lack of certain experimental equipment, the CDHSU came to our laboratory to use the fluorescent microplate reader to test their products. In September, we guided them to fill in the registration information and gave them a part in the Interlab section, which is described in detail in our collaborations. The lecture in July was the beginning of the contact and cooperation between SCU_China and CDHSU, which also spread the spirit of iGEM and made contributions to the inheritance and development of iGEM.

To facilitate expression of inducible glyoxylate shunt in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cell), cell viability at different sodium palmitate concentration was measured. While a high fatty acid level is known to lead apoptosis, the cell viability test ensured maintenance of a stable cell line for transfection.
We used MTT assay to test cell viabilities in different fatty acid concentrations. The objective was to determine a range of optimal concentrations of fatty acids to be introduced into HepG2 cell and achieve more than 60% viability after 24 hours incubation and/or more than 50% in 48 hours.
MTT Assay Description
MTT assay measures the enzymatic activity of oxidoreductase enzymes that only show activity when the cells are alive. MTT, a tetrazolum dye, is reduced into an insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. Organic solvent such as DMSO can be used to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance at 570 is measured using a spectrophotometer to quantitatively determine the amount of formazan formation.
In our experiment, HepG2 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. After one day incubation gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0 mM to 1.0mM, and 2.0mM were added into each row. After adding the sodium palmitate, we have incubated the cells for 24 hours and 48 hours respectively. MTT reagent was added and formazan formation was observed and measured using spectrophotometer.
Results
Figure 1: Average Cell Viability in Different Palmitic Acid Concentrations. A. HepG2 cells were incubated in gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0mM to 1.0mM and 2.0mM for 24hours. MTT reagents were added and formazan formation was measured using spectrophotometer. The relative ratio of absorbance at different fatty acid concentration was then calculated by comparing with A570 at 0mM fatty acid concentration. The percentage of relative absorbance ratio was regarded as values of cell viability. B. HepG2 cells were incubated in gradient concentration of sodium palmitate for 48hours.
From the MTT assay, we observed that after 24 hours of incubation with palmitic acid, around45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours"

BIT-CHINA team of BIT gave a lesson to the pupil of Wanquan primary school on September 27, 2013. First of all, we toked something like life, environment protect, energy. Then we told the children what is the synthetic biology and how can they work use synthetic biology. Third we explain the importance of synthetic and iGEM. At last we let the kids to think about what can we do thought synthetic biology. Kids are very interested and excited, they came up with many ideas which came form children’s life and they experience. what made me happy is the pupil are seem interested to synthetic biology,. I believe somebody of them will make that more advanced.
On September 18, 2013, BIT - CHINA team came to Sunny Baby Kindergarten and spent a pleasant afternoon with children. While discussing with preschool children in biology frontier such as synthetic biology sounds funny, we are not constrained in the exchange form, We can also help these children remind of the interest of science. The communication of the kindergarten was one of the most successful one in all our activities. ""What are bacteria?"" ""You know what the biology is?"" ""Have you heard gene?"" ""The design of synthetic biology is just like the children building blocks, and what kind of synthetic biology building do you want to build?"" Here, we also felt their rich imagination and full of vitality, and we believe that they will exert their director to make a better future.

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Japanese#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, putative values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were assumed insignificant initially to this value. An ideal light pulse was introduced at an instant and removed thirty simulation seconds later. From this rudimentary simulation it can be drawn that the nonlinearities of the phosphorylation and transcription factor binding kinetics effectively smooth the sharp light input.  By design, the light switch ON yields phosphorylation of OmpR and repression of the pucB/A genes which would give rise to LH2.  Conversely, when left OFF, the concentration of pucB/A recovers and increases until the steady state determined by its translation and degradation rates.

Furthermore, there is a generally positive outlook on the future of biomanufacturing. 80% of survey members who identified themselves as academics felt that biomanufacturing will eventually outperform traditional manufacturing techniques.
Here are a few representative quotes to express some of these sentiments:
❝ [Biomanufacturing] requires larger seed investments to set up, so it’s a risky business area in comparison to traditional manufacturing, for which most of the logistics are already in place.
❝ Scale-up and demonstration of either equivalency or superiority to traditional routes of manufacture. Cost and environmental advantages also need to be demonstrated.
In response to the question ""What do you predict will be the direction of the field of biomanufacturing going forward in terms of new applications and its potential for wider implementation?""
❝ Wider implementation could be challenging if the current techniques work and are 'good enough.' There is a big hurdle to changing what works (even if it's more expensive to implement than something new).
❝ The only place where bio based production have an advantage long term, large molecules with several chiral centers.
Integration
The results of our survey indicated to us that synthetic biology needs to be incentivized with lower financial costs for research and development and enriched with more productive techniques. This motivated us to pursue our low-cost bioreactor and microfluidic device. Wet lab and genome engineering work is only one part of synthetic biology. The logistical factors like access to equipment are equally important to the progress of the field, and we wanted to highlight that.
We would like to thank the teams from Aalto-Helsinki, AQA Unesp, Hamburg, Linkoping Sweden, RPI Troy NY, Stony Brook, and UPMC-Paris for their help creating and disseminating the survey questions.

To ensure our venom protein folds properly, we have a periplasmic signal attached to both the venom/fibrin protein as well as the thiol isomerase. Foreign proteins don't fold well within the rough cytoplasm, so we sent our proteins to the periplasmic space which is a more ideal situation for our venom. With addition to the DsbC, the enzymatic activity of the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need to puncture the outer membrane in order to lyse the cell. This function also allows us to release our construct without introducing E.coli inside the body.   As a side note, we decided to use E.Coli as our chassis because it is easier to use than other chassis such as yeast, and we have experience of working with it before. We have looked into using other chassis such as plant cells, but based on the convenience of E.Coli, we went with that.

In order to stabilize the clot, we added Human Factor XIIIa (propeptide removed) which is the enzyme responsible for the polymerization of fibrin monomers, by keeping the promoters and binding sites the same strength we ensure that all of the fibrin-venom strands bind at the wound site and form a permanent plug that will not be easily re-opened. Having Factor XIIIa will accelerate the rate of polymerization which further ensures that the venom-fibrin strands will stay localized.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Proof of Concept
Unit Testing
We used the built-in unittest module to verify the functionality of our software, as is recommended in the Django documentation. In particular, we ran tests on:
Protocol upload and retrieval
Category upload and retrieval
Reagent upload and retrieval
Viewing standard pages as both anonymous and logged-in users
User creation
Our software passed these preliminary tests, and so we took to user testing to continue with the verification.
User Testing
Once ProtoCat 3.0 went live, we began by testing the interface. Our team swiftly located a numerous number of bugs and issues with ProtoCat. Once we felt certain that the majority of issues were behind us, we began working with other groups so that ProtoCat could be tested by non team member users. These groups included, but not limited to, Michigan iGEM team, Rice University iGEM team, and University of Michigan's biology lab staff. These users not only found more bugs that were previously overlooked, but also provided valuable insight on how an outsider who has never seen the software uses it. In turn we cleaned up our interface and improved labeling in order to bring attention to new features that were being missed.
One of the main goals of ProtoCat is for the software to be used in order to crowd source protocols. During our testing period our team uploaded a protocol , an improvement was suggested in the comments by a member of the University of Michigan biology lab staff. Thus a new branch of the protocol was created with the correction, demonstrating the power that collaboration has in creating the best protocol."

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the supplied donor DNA sequence is integrated into the genome. For non-targeted integration, intact lacZ confers chromogenic catalytic functionality when growing on X-gal, resulting in a blue colony phenotype. For targeted integration, lacZ is disrupted, resulting in loss of chromogenic capability and thus in a white colony phenotype. This composite part purposely contains both Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) and kanamycin, in order to distinguish surviving colonies based on whether genomic integration occurred, or whether the plasmid is simply propagated. The latter  is a false positive, expected to confer a red color. In combination with blue product formation by intact lacZ, this is expected to result in a purple phenotype. Table 2 gives an overview of the expected possibilities.

We optimized diagnostic genomic PCR reactions for verification of putative integration of the kanamycin fragment in/near the lacZ locus (figure 10). When designing and optimizing these genomic PCR reactions, we favoured PCR reactions that always result in amplicons, regardless of integration. Such anticipating primer design helps evaluating the results and judging whether genomic PCR on a picked colony worked in the first place, and then evaluate whether targeted integration took place. When integration occurs, the amplicon size increases. The control used for these genomic PCRs was purified isolated gDNA of the BL21DE3 parent strain. Alternatively, we were planning on whole genome sequencing of individual colonies, in the case of encountering blue or white colonies, to verify where and how many times the donor DNA would have been integrated, and whether this activity was indeed concentrated near the original target sequence.

The screening program
Introduction
The late diagnosis of lung cancer is the main reason to why the disease has the highest death toll out of all cancer types, causing 1,69 million deaths in 2015 [1]. This is due to the fact that the symptoms of lung cancer often occur in a later stage of the disease. At that point, the cancer can be hard to treat and only 5-14% of the patients survive the first 5 years. If lung cancer could be detected earlier, many lives could be saved. One way to efficiently detect lung cancer in people would be to introduce a screening program [2].
The Swedish National board of health and welfare takes the decision whether a screening program is needed. To do so, the board has 15 criteria that are taken into consideration. These criteria are built on the government organisation Socialstyrelsen’s criteria for screening and are also mentioned in Cancerfondsrapporten 2016 (Cancer Fund report of 2016) that was made available to the team by Aina Törnblom at The Swedish Cancer Society, Cancerfonden [3,4].
The main points comprises that:
The disease should be common, severe and cause strain on the society
Efficient treatment should be available
Early detection and treatment should lead to a higher survival
The diagnostic test should with high probability classify truly diseased people as diseased and truly healthy people as healthy
Diagnosis of symptom free individuals should be possible
The function should be commonly accepted by the population that is included in the screening and it should be cost effective
Being the fifth most common cancer form but still having one of the worst prognosis, as well as costing the swedish society 3,6 billion SEK in 2013 [5], the first criteria must be said to be met. Availability of efficient treatments and the fact that earlier detection and treatment should lead to higher survival rate can be demonstrated by the estimation from Cancerfonden, that about 200 to 500 people, of patients dying each year of lung cancer in Sweden"

Exeter iGEM
After speaking to Exeter at the UK iGEM Meetup we arranged a collaboration. Initially, we had multiple ideas of how to collaborate, involving using some specialised equipment we had access to at Cardiff University. However, in the end we arranged an experiment to validate the hypothesis that they are working on for their project. They were interested in testing the use of UV as a bactericide, as a way to ensure the biosafety of their filter model.
Exeter sent us a  protocol, which we followed. We showed that UV treatment reduced bacterial growth and therefore that UV acts as an effective bactericide. However surprisingly we found that the shortest time of UV treatment (1 minute) was sufficient to reduce bacterial growth by greater than 90%. However extending the treatment time up to 20minutes did not further reduce the amounts of bacterial growth. They have published this data on their own wiki .
Valencia UPV
Valencia UPV contacted us as both teams were working on similar expression systems, using tobacco plants. We began by setting up meetings over Skype to discuss our projects and begin to understand ways we could collaborate. We began discussing the different promoters both teams were trying to synthesise, and agreed that we could validate the promoter in one another’s expression system to confirm its function. However, due to time constraints we were unable to complete the experiment to test Valencia’s PR1:Luc+:NosT construct, which they had created and sent to us. We also encountered issues generating our WRKY:Luc+:NosT construct that we had aimed to send to Valencia, meaning we could not complete the collaboration.
However speaking to Valencia UPV iGEM’s team proved very useful, as their host lab has a lot of experience using plant expression systems and we are using this system for the very first time in Cardiff.  Therefore during our discussions with them we were able to understand where some of our experiments may have been going wrong.

The product may be different from the reactant. It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasmid with promoter LacI (we call it pLacI:LacI4 below). Only the products of the replication reaction will be repressed with a certain rate. In this example, pLacI:LacI4 would not be repressed since it is not among the products of its replication. Via MoDeL language, we design a template reaction with no reactants, two modifiers and one product. The two modifiers are template species containing a certain plasmid backbone (say pSB1A3), and binding state is allowed for both. The product is also a template species containing pSB1A3, however, it has only one chain and no binding is permitted. Hence, modifiers have Chain-Node structure ANY--pSB1A3--ANY, while product has its structure ANYUB--pSB1A3--ANYUB. The listOfTransferTable makes parts transfer from part ANY of either modifier to its corresponding part ANYUB of the product. The reaction rate is <math>-k_{g}C_{mod1}C_{mod2}/C_{max}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the same as that defined in the replication reaction, <math>C_{max}</math> is the max concentration of plasmids containing pSB1A3 as backbone, and <math>C_{mod1}</math>, <math>C_{mod2}</math> are concentrations of modifier1 and modifier2, respectively.

Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
In principle each research-project that bears any risks for engaged researchers, mankind or the environment should be treated under the precautionary principle as proposed 11 : ""treat synthetic microorganisms as dangerous until proven harmless"".
This would mean to work on such synthetic DNA containing Bio Bricks at least under Biological security levels two.
Additional to this secure working environment the system itself can be optimized according to biosafety aspects, means to reduce it's viability outside the laboratory. This aim can be approached by reducing the systems ability to evolve, proliferate and interact with it's environment. A common method to achieve this goal is to engineer microorganisms in a way that they depend on nutrients that can't be found in the environment in sufficient amount.

Intelligent quorum regulating system
We designed an Intelligent quorum regulating system contains three devices to make cell density decrease moderately and control the apoptosis happen in a certain part of cell. The first device is for quorum sensing. The second device is for moderation and targeting and the third device leads to programmed cell death.
The first one is quorum sensing device. Quorum-sensing molecules called AHLs can cross cell membrane freely, which means that it can be used as a symbol of cell density. When the density of AHL is high enough, AHL will combine with a protein called LuxR and become a complex. This complex can inhibit downstream gene, TetR. So the next device will not be inhibited anymore and then begin to work.

We added an oscillating circuit as the moderate device. In this circuit, three proteins inhibit the expression of each other, forming an oscillation as showed in figure 12.

The function of oscillator is outputting the CI periodically which leads the accumulation of mazeF. In other words, the accumulation of mazeF is moderated. At the same time, different cells response to this signal differently in the beginning so that the cells responded quicker will die first (more detail in third device).

OVERVIEW
Synthetic biology can be controversial, and we know that. As scientists, we wanted to make sure that we explored the societal and humanitarian consequences of OxyPonics. We tasked ourselves with deeply analyzing food legislation laws, farming costs, environmental impact, and risk. Through industry interviews, research articles, consultations with legal experts, and intense analysis, we developed a 360 degree view of our project. From the ground up, society to scientist.
WHY OXYPONICS?
Hydroponics is the future. Because it is space and water efficient, as well as an easy to locally source, hydroponics is a rapidly growing industry projected to be worth nearly $400 million by 2020 [1]. However, despite its promise, many hydroponic growers struggle to break even. Overhead is high and profit margins are low due to disease and a lack of experienced labor.
OxyPonics addresses this issue. By optimizing growth using oxidative stress, a novel but reliable method of measuring health and the chemical balance, hydroponic growers can improve crop yield and thus their margins. OxyPonics provides comprehensive, remote, real-time monitoring that existing systems cannot provide. Furthermore, the optogenetic feedback loop we developed enables OxyPonics to respond in real-time, while remaining significantly cheaper than more limited existing solutions.
THE LAW
Before putting OxyPonics out to market, the product must abide by federal and state regulations for water quality, agriculture, and food safety. Despite the extensive legislation on the regulation of genetically modified organisms, there is no existing body of legislation regarding synthetic biology-assisted food production. Since our crops are not genetically modified themselves, we had to look past existing legislation for answers.

Motivation
To enhance the the effect of the micro dialysis machine in the intestine lumen, the half life of the micro dialysis machine is designed to be prolonged. However, since our micro dialysis machine is made in the chassis of E. coli, there are two possible risks while staying in the intestine too long. One is that the E. coli may be apoptosis or necrosis due to large amount of the metabolite wastes it absorbed. The other is the bacteria balance in the intestine may be disturbed thanks to the E. coli being added. Thus, it's crucial and necessary to have a timer in our micro dialysis machine.
Besides, the timer has many biological and engineering application, such as artificial pacemakers, biological clocks, etc.
Literature review
Overview of the cyanobacterial Kai oscillators [3]
Cyanobacteria
Kai proteins globally regulate circadian gene expression of cyanobacteria. The KaiC  phosphorylation  cycle,  which  persists  even  without  transcription  or translation, is assumed to be a basic timing process of the circadian clock.    The  self-sustainable oscillation  of  KaiC  phosphorylation had been reconstituted in vitro by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and adenosine triphosphate. The period of the in vitro"

In the 2ml culture plate, we noticed what seems to look like debri or contamination on the bottom of the wells from rows A,B,C.  We tried to make the time point plates by pipetting everything singly.
After taking a look at the 0 time point plate through the flow, we can see that the size of molecules running through are not yeast but bacterial contamination.  We need to totally redo this experiment again because this contamination gives us inaccurate data.
Yesterday, the 0 time point plate was not run all the way (only 10ul was run and there were not enough events).  Derrick saved"

Carmen Zhou
My name is Carmen Zhou and I will soon be entering UCSD as a freshman molecular biology major. The seeding of my interest in biotechnology began when I first observed my transformed plate of fluorescing bacteria under a black light. A silly seed, I know, but having been able to see an actual result of one of my experiments first hand was something quite thrilling. This single seed grew as my knowledge of the causes and effects of diseases expanded, which made biology seem more dynamic, disgusting, and like it was begging to be changed. I guess that is where I stand today-on an open field full of possibilities to reverse such diseases. And that is where iGEM comes in. Although I initially joined iGEM as a means to get to learn more about the techniques bioengineers use and to just get an idea of how research is conducted, I was pleased to find out that my iGEM experience was going to be one of those possibilities in the open field. The combination of health, cancer killing, new techniques, and silly mentors just surpassed my expectations and made this summer unforgettable. I can now see myself zooming through lab work with confidence and even landing a research position as an undergraduate!
Lianna Fung
I just recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and am now attending UCSD. I have always been interested in science and the limitless possibilities it can yield. Biotechnology in particular caught my interest after taking a course on it in high school. It fascinated me that we had reached a point where we could modify and improve upon the biology of organisms for specific purposes. This fascination caused me to seek out more opportunities to learn and improve my experience in the field. This led me to my desire to participate in iGEM. iGEM seemed a perfect combination of what I wanted and more. It was a chance to work with others as a team in a welcoming environment. It also"

Noise in a system is a repeating issues from engineering to science. In a biogical system noise can intrinsic, for e.g.- from randomness of chemical reactions in side of the cell or extrinsic, for e.g.-, different operating temperature or cell shape size variety. To model such behavior we have adopted stochastic simulation algorithm by Gillespie.
Fig.1 Stochastic modeling flowchart
The algorithm model the set of chemical reactions and the instant they occur as random. The model takes account of intrinsic noise more accurately. After each reaction, the algorithm determines which reaction will occur next, and how much time will elapse before it occurs. The flow chart of the Algorithm is presented as Fig.1 which describes the Monte Carlo simulation based simulation.
Fig.2 GFP expression simulated via Gillispie algorithm
Fig.3 mRNA                              Fig.4 Proteins
The simulation results presented in the above figures show a square wave pattern in the mRNA and protein level. On simulating the system in stochastic enviornment, few more interesting results comes into picture. One of such is noise propagation in the biological  system. The simulated results show a noisier mRNA expression than the protein level, which makes the mRNA less stable compared to the protein. On investigating further we observed the translation procedure is acting as a low pass filter. If we model the translation process (which is linear in nature) in frequency domain, the transfer function becomes,
The frequency response of translational dynamics is shown in Fig.5 validate the analysis. The mRNA dynamics which is noisy, and as noises are always are of high frequency in nature, the low pass action provided by the process can attenuate such characteristics. As the γ increases the bandwidth"

Remaking of Starter Culture and Miniprep of Expression Vector
Starter Culture from 5/17 had an OD 600 of 3.1 for tube #1 and 3.0 for tube #2
This is too high, as the desired range is around 0.5 to 1.5.
Remaking starter culture. Picked 3 colonies from plate #2 (P+S 2) and incubated in 3 tubes with 10 ml LB and 10 ul 1000X chloramphenicol
Incubated at 37C starting at noon. (200 rpm)
At 2 pm, the OD was still essentially 0.
So apparently, I was reading the spec incorrectly.  I was using cuvettes, but I had forgotten to change the setting to ""10 mm cuvettes""
At 7:30 pm, (7.5 hours of incubation), the OD600 was 1.21
This is a little too high, as 0.8 is about optimal, but I went with it anyways.
Added 5 ml of the starter culture to 245 ml Difco LB and 250 ul of 1000X chloromphenicol to a 1L flask with the little ridges in the bottom for better aeration (baffled flask)
Incubate at 37C 200 rpm starting at 8 pm
At 10:40pm OD600 = 0.336
At 11:05pm OD600 = 0.441
At this point I added 1 ml of 100 mM IPTG to make 0.4 mM final IPTG concentration.
Placed back into the incubator starting at 11:10 PM

Given this situation, we figured out a                                     unique                                     way to measure it. The key to the problem is to draw Lineweaver-Burk plot                                     forwadly                                     and reversely. That is to say, we can reverse the role of S and P, since every                                     enzyme reaction is a reversible reaction. Then, we can get the equation (2.19):
      Beyond (2.19), we can even include the                                     chemical                                     equilibrium constant equation (2.20)
      In this way, we could be able to determine                                     the                                     whole parameters in one enzyme reaction instead of reduce the equation just to                                     get a                                     simple but not practical equation (2.8). Also, we get an extra equation (2.20)                                     to                                     test the result of our experiment.       Aiming to measure the relative parameters                                     (there                                     are totally 12 parameters in this                                     complex system), our team measured the activity of enzymes in vivo                                     quantitatively.                                     Honestly, the result is not satisfying, but we strongly believe that our method                                     is                                     still applicable given enough time and energy. Hence, we would show the                                     numerical                                     result Fig.4. with equation (2.18), and the parameters are set optionally.

They are all chosen optionally, but the model itself is still general.
2.5  Summary
      With all the above mentioned, we believe                                     that we have derived a unique way of modeling a complex enzyme system.                                     Although                                     the relative parameters are sometime hard to measure (especially reversely                                     measure the reaction), but it still is a much more accurate and effective                                     way                                     compared with traditional way. Besides, there are still some more details to                                     add                                     to the model. For instance, enzymes won’t diffuse through cell membrane, but Tryptamine, Ser"

DOPA-DUO
LASA iGEM
Dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a catecholamine and phenethylamine family chemical that perform important functions within the brain and body. While its causes are still unknown, Parkinson’s disease is highly associated with the lack of dopamine in particular regions of the brain. Presently, one of the most common treatments for Parkinson’s is the prescription of levodopa tablets, which increases dopamine levels by introducing dopamine’s chemical precursor, levodopa to the body. Our project involves building DNA circuits that produce and sense levodopa levels using bacteria. One plasmid focuses on the production of levodopa, including the HpaBC gene, and the second plasmid, a multigene assembly, senses the levodopa produced by the first plasmid. The sensing plasmid includes a promoter ppddc, a cognate promoter for the L-dopa responsive transcription factor, pp2551, a LysR family activator. We have a Venus fluorescent protein assembled into the sensing plasmid so that we are able to visualize and measure the amount of levodopa produced via a fluorescence assay.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#July2011_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence comes from green-lysine and red fluorescence comes from DNA (cy-5 labeled).
Although we don't observe much protein bound to the anti His-tag antibody, we can still see that it does bound TetO1 sequence and did not bind any (-)control sequence.   Some possible reasons for low protein fluorescence under the buttons: the expression yield from the linear template with T7 promoter might be too low, the His-tag to antibody binding is not strong enough or the concentration of antibody is too low.
Friday, 1st of July 2011
Alina and Lilia amplified the His-tetR linear template. After PCR sample was loaded on 1% agarose gel with Rad Safe, “1Kb Plus DNA Ladder” was used.
We also prepared about thirty LB-agar plates with ampicilin, they are in the BM fridge.
Colonies from Gibson
After an overnight incubation, we found four colonies on the Ampicillin plates that had cells containing the plasmids from the Gibson assembly. The low number of colonies is attributed to the low competence of the cells. Of the four colonies, two were pink and two were yellow.
Tween experiment
Clara and Henrike tested the right dose of Tween 20 that can be used for the ""chemostat"" experiment without affecting the cell growth. Tween is a detergent that would prevent the cells from sticking and thus clogging the microfluidic channels. We tested 12 different dilutions of Tween 12 both for GFP and RFP e-coli which can be potentially used for the ""chemostat"" experiment. We read the OD(absorption @600nm) and fluorescence every 10 minutes, for 18 hours at 37°C.
Growth curves for all the different concentrations vs time
The legend shows the percentage of tween 20 that was added to the medium.
We can observe that the growth factor is smaller for Chloramphenicol resistant e-coli due to the fact that Chloramphenicol is stronger than Kanamycin.
Calculated growth factor for the previous curves(Lilia)
Growth factor
We can observe that tween did not have a major effect on the cells' growth.  I suggest we use 0.075% tween in media for the experiments
Monday, 4th of July 2011

Mutation
Power through diversity
Motivation
Without mutation our world would look very different to how we see it today. The evolutionary process, as we know it,     is mainly based      on the variability produced by mutagenesis and recombination. While recombination redistributes already existing features in nature,     mutagenesis may vary existing ones and create completely new ones. In nature the process of mutagenesis is random which means      quite a lot of unsuccessful variants regarding survival. A successful mutation, on the other hand, may be the first step to a new and better      adapted species. But an advantageous mutation in one species may bring chaos to another. A predator for example may profit      from a mutation but its prey could quickly become endangered. In this race more mutations in a shorter period of time     could make the difference in survival or extinction. In a way this, so called mutation rate, could be seen as     the speed of evolution. One of the highest mutation rates known today is present in the family of Flaviviridae.     This group of viruses contains popular members like Dengue and Zika virus. Less than 150 years     ago, in the blink of an evolutionary eye, Dengue was only able to infect"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#transformandtranslate_-_-_TEXT.html,"Build your own Biosensor
As an interactive activity for the students, we had a make your own biosensor station. By choosing any input, and any output they desired, we got younger children to engage with our project on a  basic level, and found this to be an effective way of explaining what a biosensor was.  Things that students chose to sense included food, happiness, and pain!
Picture this
We had loads of fun and interesting conversations, with both students and teachers. After we got some discussion and debates started, we got the students and teachers to write down their thoughts and draw some doodles…  As is obvious, there was a huge range of different responses for each question. There were responses that were creative, cute and amusing– someone suggesting synthetic biology could be used to make smaller elephants a personal highlight! It was also so great to see students making use of the knowledge they already had to inform them to engage with a more alien area. One student was interested in artificial organs, and they talked about how synthetic biology could be applied to this!  On the whole, it was quite disheartening to learn that barely anyone had even heard of synthetic biology, let alone thought they knew what it was. Mostly, once the prompt ‘well, have you heard of genetic engineering?’ was given, there was a light bulb moment and the comments would be more free flowing. We were glad to spread awareness of synthetic biology with the discussions we initiated!
Science isn’t just for the Classroom
While it may not be with synthetic biology specifically, it was clear that students actively engaged with science outside of the classroom, and enjoyed doing this. Seeing how the children were engaging with other areas of science gives some ideas of where synthetic biology coverage should target. The pupils said talked about reading news articles, watching TV programmes, taking an interest in adverts, attending after school clubs…the list goes on! It was great to see a few children had even investigated further on issues they had seen and taken an interest in- one girl told me about coming across a story about nuclear bombs, before finding out some more videos to watch on the subject herself because she was so interested!
Always listen to your Teachers
The teachers were all really happy to speak to us about how science is taught in schools, and gave lots of interesting comments. What came out most was that teaching can be too focused on reaching targets, or teaching set things to reach certain grades in exams. This leaves little time for independently led learning from the students, or developing their own ideas, or investigating further a topic they have been particularly interested in. We established some contacts that were"

Front End
The work of front end is various and complicated. We generally divided it into 4 large parts as below:
UI Framework
Canvas System
Project & Cloud System
Functional Units
In concise, users can create a biological network on the Canvas, save or browse their work as Projects, get or share biological information by Cloud, and analyze biological data with Functional Units, all of which happen in the friendly environment provided by the UI Framework.
We based our program on Adobe Air 15.0 platform, with programming language Action Script 3.0 (AS 3.0). AS 3.0 is powerful in vector illustration processing, and provides rich interactions and responsiveness, these two features meet the demand of our project exactly.
The major techniques we used are as following: Smart Canvas, Operation Track, Multi-Threading and Heterogeneous computing.
UI Framework
In order to provide a better user experience, we designed a completely new UI Framework, in which most of the operations can be directly performed while the interface keeps simple and tidy. Meanwhile, this new framework aims for demonstrating information clearly, so there are fewer containers but richer contents. We also added guiding animation responding to most operations so that all the processes are smooth and easy to understand.
Canvas System (Smart Canvas)
The canvas to display the biological network is the most important part of this software, so this receives the most concern. A simple canvas with all objects sticking on could not meet the demand of a boundless and highly complicated visual network. So we need to design the structure of both data and displaying object to guarantee the capability of performing mass information while consuming limited system resources. After several trials and analyses, we build our canvas in two major layers and five sub layers:
1. Node Layer
a) Float layer
b) Compressed partitioned layer
2. Link Layer

MCL1
In order to verify the ability of immune-avoidance in MCL1-transformant, the following experiments were performed.
The wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128 and MCL1 transformant were cultured in 1/4 SDAY broth. The expression of MCL1 was detected by quantitive PCR at the mRNA level and SDS-PAGE at the protein level. Besides, to compare the differences of immune-avoidance ability between wild-type and transformant M.anisopliae, we will inject hyphae homogenate into a cockroach and extract hemolymph in different time points. Then count the nodules under the light, nodules are formed by hemocytes surrounding pathogens. The number of nodules grows in proportion to the degree of immune response. Meanwhile, observe hemolymph smear under a phase contrast microscope. We confirmed that MCL1 can promote immune-avoidance.
Suicide Switch
To verify the function of Suicide Switch, and get the limited concentration of Tryptophan, the following experiments were done:
The transformed strain Metarhizium anisopliae 128 was grown in solid and liquid czapek with different concentrations of L-Tryptophan. After 6 days of cultivation, we compared the Metarhizium anisopliae in 10 different solid medium. We also detected the dry weight of Metarhizium anisopliae cultivated in 10 different concentration of 100mL liquid medium. Finally we can see the result that the transformation succeeded for a solid medium without Tryptophan could not survive. And we found the limited L-Trp concentration of the transformed strain Metarhizium anisopliae was 0.9%.
Application and realization
In order to make our Metarhizium anisopliae spores into products, we designed GreenGround, a containing box for spores, with a structure similar to the cockroach house.
Compared to regular chemicals, GreenGround reduces the elimination of cockroaches. To prove its         usefulness, we built a simulated room to test it. But according to the principle of no release,         we could not use the modified Metarhizium anisopliae. So in the experiment we used the         wild type Metarhizium anisopliae.

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

Project Description
iGEM Stockholm 2018 presents Biotic Blue: our attempt at tackling the problem of antibiotic pollutants in water.
Antibiotics - A Double-Edged Sword
Αntibiotics are powerful medical tools that can be utilized to treat almost any bacterial infection. Immense amounts of pharmaceutical antibiotics are prescribed not only to ensure our safety and health, but also in the livestock industry. Unfortunately, not all antibiotics we consume are degraded by our body. In some cases, up to 70% ends up in our urine and, as a result, in our sewage systems [1],[2].
Since the majority of wastewater treatment plants are not equipped for the removal of these pharmaceuticals, antibiotics ultimately end up in our rivers, lakes and oceans [2],[3]. In the aquatic environment, these alien substances often cause imbalance in the marine ecosystems which can potentially lead to severe consequences, such as the appearance of antibiotic resistant bacteria [4],[5]. Because of its low biodiversity and slow water-exchange rate leading unavoidably to longer retention times, the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly sensitive to this adverse pharmaceutical pollution [6].
Sulfamethoxazole - An Emerging Threat
One of the most prevalent antibiotics in the Baltic Sea is sulfamethoxazole (SMX). It has been detected in wastewater streams, sludge, groundwater and surface water. In addition, it has been found in marine biota at the alarming concentrations of >50 µg/kg, implying that  it can potentially move up to the food chain [6].
SMX is a bacteriostatic sulfonamide antibiotic used to treat infections and as a prophylactic measure [7]. Despite of its beneficial qualities in fighting off pathogenic bacteria, it also causes severe ecological disturbances, such as changes in microbial communities, algal blooms and disruption of the nitrogen cycle [4],[8]. Moreover, its bioaccumulation may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance leading in turn to serious consequences in clinical settings [5],[9].
The aforementioned reasons urged Swedish Medical Products Agency in 2015 to take action and include SMX on their list of proposed substances that should be monitored in the environment. In the same year, SMX was also among the candidate pharmaceuticals to be included in the EU’s surface water 'Watch List' [6],[10], demonstrating the urgency of preventing SMX reaching aquatic environments.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," traced back to a 'bootcamp' week during April, where we were introduced to iGEM, and non-biologists were brought up-to-date on biology terms. We were also introduced to human practices and modelling aspects of the project, and met members from previous teams.
We then began the work in mid-June, with members either staying in Exeter for the summer or commuting. The early summer work saw a lot of ideas develop and many discussions were had, but then we finally settled on 'Project Perchlorate' as our focus. Since then, it's been Mars, regolith and perchlorate.
Below is the list of what each team member felt like they were involved with the most, and what we enjoyed most about iGEM:
Emily Browne:
Key focus: Wiki, laboratory, and InterLab.
Enjoyed the most: ""Learning to code from scratch, and also undertake protocols in the lab I've never had the opportunity to do before e.g. cloning and transformations. These two skills have opened many doors for me, and have made me appreciate that there is much more to the scientific world than reading journals and testing a few things.""
Nahnsu Dawkins:
Key focus: Bioreactor, Human practices, and Wiki.
Enjoyed the most: ""I headed up human practices, worked towards developing an easy assay for perchlorate, generated graphics and diagrams for the team. At the beginning of the project, I worked towards selling Project Perchlorate as an idea to our team and supervisors, and had lots of fun seeing how it developed over the summer with so many smart minds working on it. At Boston, I will be presenting our project again, this time selling it as a finished project, and I'm proud of how much we've accomplished.""
Phil George:
Key focus: Wiki.
Enjoyed the most: ""Creating the more advanced elements of the site (e.g. JavaScript elements, and using P5.js and Bootstrap), and the skeleton of the pages, as well as maintaining the size of the pages across a range of browsers and devices. Also, various minor and major bug fixes to make the page work smoothly in general.""
Amy Hewitt:
Key focus: Bioreactor, Wiki, and Human Practices.
Enjoyed the most: ""Working on the bioreactor. Quite often I struggle to finish what I start, but what started off as just a couple of ideas grew into a fully designed bioreactor. We also got to experiment with a model bioreactor provided by Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which was incredibly exciting.""

Welcome to the Clotho FAQ
Last updated 10/29/08
How do I contact the developers? - Send mail to clothodevelopment AT googlegroups DOT com.
When should I contact the developers? - Whenever you have a meaningful question or comment! We don't bite:)
What are the system requirements for Clotho? - Clotho requires Java 6 to run. We have run Clotho on Windows XP and Windows Vista based systems primarily. However it has also been run on Linux and Macs as well (just far more infrequently). It is our understanding that Java 6 is currently only available for Intel based Macs (although there may be workarounds to this) . You can get Java 6 here .
Is Clotho open source? - The code that we have made available is open for anyone to use provided they follow the legal disclaimer provided with the code. This is a standard BSD style license.
What language is Clotho written in? - Clotho is written in Java using Net Beans 6.1 as a development environment.
Why did you choose Java? - Java was chosen since it allowed the GUI to be developed quickly, is a widely understood language, provides automatic documentation of the code, and is relatively portable. We can also build upon the Java Plug-In framework as well.
Are there going to be future releases of Clotho? - Clotho will be release periodically as we either fix bugs or add new features. It is our intent to do this quarterly if new releases are warranted. The next release (Beta) is planned for late Spring 2009.
Can I contribute to the Clotho development? - Sure we would love to have help provided that we can find a reasonable way for people to contribute. Feel free to contact us at clothodevelopment AT googlegroups DOT com. The best way will be to get started by writing plug-ins.
How do I write a plug-in? - We are currently working on getting this system more robust and user friendly. We have some toy plug-ins available now along with the beginnings of a tutorial here .
I found a bug in Clotho that is not"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

During this activity, we met different kinds of people, and most of them were curious about our project and its procedure, some of them even asked whether this product will go public or not. 
What impressed us the most is that we met our seniors when he was giving out free hugs. He gave each of us a hug, which is an encouragement to us. The mutual aid like this is the value that we want to put stress on and convey.) Although there were some people who didn’t coordinate, instead of feeling upset, we remained optimistic and searched for another subject. In the end, we got nearly a hundred opinions on our project. This not only made our data more detailed, but also gave us the power to move forward.
 
 
We choose Taichung Train Station, National Science Museum, CMP block museum of arts, Taichung City Hall, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, Maple Garden, and National Taichung Theater to make the poll.

S&T month
S&T Month is a tech activity hold by Mingdao annually. In the period time of five weeks, teachers and students trained in Physics, Chemical, Earth science, Biology and iGEM lead the other students to have an inside look into the world of science. 2017 Mingdao Team arranged two days of experiment and one day of a lecture. It is because iGEM still remains unfamiliar to them that the registration is quite enthusiastic. Such an optimistic start it is our campaign on iGEM has.  
The first experiment is plasmid DNA extraction. After explaining the concept of it, we divided them into six groups, and chose a leader from our team members for every group. Most of the students had never used pipette before, which made them tense but eager to try. After all, what we students usually use are always droppers, beakers…and so on. 
  During the experiment day, we showed them our newly-opened-up lab and had them take turn operating at the same time. They all felt it cool and funny to extract the plasmid, and showed more interest in the experiment, electrophoresis, the next day. Not only did they ask questions enthusiastically, but they were more skilled because of the practices the day before.
As for the lecture on the third day"

Stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in turn increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier measured in bulk RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence reference nucleotide count correlates with the in bulk measurement data. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
In addition to ribosome binding sites, we have constructed Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of a different toehold and triggers pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio).
Figure 3. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq. The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and assigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The graph displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score is only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present, due tue esterase being expressed. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results, carried out earlier. Based on this fact it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences.
Conclusion
The three proof of concept experiments presented above - mutant library activity and sequencing recording, ribosome binding site"

There are still two tasks which need to be resolved:
Run both the undigested and digested plasmids on agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis.
Conduct midi-preps of the plasmids if gel results are positive.
In addition to this, the Metal Sensing team are hoping to carry out a test PCR reaction on the genome of Bacillus subtilis with the pGFP-rrnb plasmid integrated within it. The Metal Sensing team have designed primers which are embedded within the amyE region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome so any integration at that site (the pGFP-rrnb plasmid integrates in the amyE gene in B. subtilis) will be detected.
Practical Outline
Mathew loading the pSB1A2 + BBa_J33206 DNA into the wells of the gel
The tasks needed to be completed by the Metal Sensing team by the end of the day are:
Run both the undigested and digested plasmids on agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis.
Conduct midi-preps of the plasmids if gel results are positive.
Run a test PCR reaction on a crude extraction of the genome of the Bacillus subtilis which had successfully been transformed by the plasmid pGFP-rrnb
Procedure
DNA gel electrophoresis
The gel loaded with DNA samples; the top row of wells belong to the Metal Sensor team whereas the bottom set of wells belong to the Stochastic Switch team
DNA gel electrophoresis was used to analyse the restriction enzyme digests for the three samples of the plasmid pSB1A3 containing BioBrick BBa_J33206. Three samples set aside for electrophoresis contained no restriction enzymes where as three samples of the BioBrick were treated with both EcoRI and PstI. The protocol used to prepare the DNA and to load the samples into the gel can be found at these links.
The way in which the samples were set up in terms of DNA gel wells were as follows:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = DNA ladder (HindIII ladder)
Lane 3 = Sample 1 (BBa_J33206) + no enzymes
Lane 4 = Sample 2 (BBa_J33206) + no enzymes

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," manipulate. We decided to shift our goal, and rather than killing S. aureus, we would limit the virulence of the bacteria and restrict its ability to form a biofilm. This could be achieved by subverting the quorum sensing of the pathogenic bacteria and blocking the signal. In this way, S. aureus could be handled by the host’s immune system and by the patient’s doctor with a normal dosage of antibiotics.
In order to learn more about the significance of these issues in the medical field, we interviewed many professionals working either directly with patients, industries working on high tech metallic or ceramic implants, and amputees through the contact of ADEPA « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated People ». Through all this work, we were invited for many tours, first at the European Hospital George-Pompidou where we had the chance to observe Dr. Benjamin Bouyer M.D., a lumbar rachis surgeon, during surgery to see the procedures put in place to diminish the risk of infection during the integration of an implant inside the body.
Targeting pathogenic bacteria and Chassis
The first thing we needed to do was to narrow down the pathogenic bacteria we would work on. After researching in the literature and talking with experts in the fields of prosthetics, we found out that S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the two most frequently found bacterial infectious agents on implants. We decided to use the biobrick designed by the iGEM team SDU-Denmark 2009 who worked on a genetic circuit enabling Escherichia coli to actively detect S. aureus .
Our bacterial chassis of choice, which would inhibit the quorum sensing of S. aureus, needed to be a bacterium naturally occurring inside the human body. Indeed, we didn’t want to introduce a new strain inside the human body. The chassis also needed to have a good secretion system, as well as a good tolerance for the immune system. We narrowed down our choices between Bacillus subtilis, which the iGEM LMU Munich 2014 worked on, with the same problematic, and E. coli, naturally living inside the gastrointestinal tract of humans with mostly no problem except for some strains. Because we wanted to improve the construction of iGEM SDU Denmark 2009 and because of convenience inside our lab, since we already had competent E. coli cells, we decided to use this strain. We optimized our sequences for an E. coli expression, and adapted them to its secretion system by adding export signals. This way, our construction could"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Reproducibility_-_-_TEXT.html," their protocols, but the components we had used in the work. The enzyme we used were of a different type than the one used by 2015 UCLA and our streptavidin beads had run past its expiration date.
This is a great example of there not being a final falsification – there was clearly something wrong with our auxiliary hypotheses. The auxiliary hypotheses were also the first place we started looking when the results did not arrive as planned – so having an overview of them helped us find that the mistakes perhaps were with them and not UCLA's protocols . We also found a mistake in our preliminary purification of PHB. The hypochlorite we used at the first had been stored wrong and the purification became visibly better when we used a different hypochlorite.
Scientific reproduction
Besides using UCLA's protocols , we also tested their BioBricks. We also tested existing BioBricks in the production of PHB. More information on the BioBricks can be found here. Testing existing BioBricks helps other iGEM teams in the coming years, because they will know that the BioBricks have been tested.
Unfortunately, we ran into problems when we tried their protocols for assembly of the silk genes. To do this the restriction sites are a crucial part of the silk gene sequences because they can overlap each other creating desired gene sequences. The genes were designed so that digesting with one enzyme would result in overhangs which would be able ligate.  We tried to follow their protocol on digestion several times, however we did not succeed before we tried to digest for a longer time and at a different temperature. We found out that the enzymes we used were slightly different from the one UCLA used and this was the reason why we were not able to make a successful digestion at first.
According to their wiki, and the uploaded parts ( K1763009 & K1763423 ) in Parts Registry, the genes named MaSp1 AB- and MaSp2 AB core sequence should contain two restriction sites for the enzyme BsaI, but we found, through SnapGene, that the sequences only contained a single restriction site at 108bp. The two genes could not be applied for Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) as they had suggested.
When following UCLA's protocols , we were not able to assemble more than three genes corresponding to either one MaSp1 gene or MaSp2 gene (see more on the silk page). Even though we made adjustments to the protocols, we were still not able to make the four monomers, consisting of 12 fragments, which we aimed for. This could be due to the"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Functionalisation_-_-_TEXT.html,"akeri et al 2012) which binds specifically via a covalent isopeptide bond to its protein partner, ‘SpyCatcher’. This SpyCatcher is fused to the proteins of interest. In our project we only had time to pursue strategy 1 but are still excited about the potential of strategy 2 in the future.
Bacterial cellulose is already a useful biomaterial as is due its attractive mechanical properties, with research on applications from loudspeaker diaphragms to protective packaging and wound dressings (Lee 2014). However, our project also aims to extend the properties of cellulose by conjugating functional proteins and peptides to it. This allows us to target specific contaminants in water which can not be filtered by size exclusion alone. (See water report and informing design sections).
We considered two ways of functionalising cellulose (figure 1) but continued to work fully on the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) method. The curli-fibre method would be an exciting avenue to explore in the future; it is feasible since there has already been research into making a “programmable” biomaterial from curli fibres using a peptide tag approach (Nguyen et al 2014), and in combination with cellulose could produce a composite with robust mechanical properties as well.
Aims
We aimed to make and characterise new cellulose binding domains, and fuse them to functional proteins.
Cellulose Binding Domains (CBDs)
The cellulose binding domain (CBD) is the link between our functional proteins and the cellulose. Therefore, we wanted to use a CBD which had high affinity and strong binding to cellulose. However, weaker CBDs may still be useful since they could have the potential be controllably eluted under specific conditions, thereby enabling regeneration of the filter when saturated, and controlled disposal of the collected contaminants (refer to water report if relevant?).
We started our search by looking into the parts registry and found two CBDs already existed in the registry: CBDclos ( BBa_K863111 ) and CBDcex ( BBa_K863101 ). We also made three new CBDs to contribute to the registry: dCBD, CBDcipA, and CBDcenA. All the CBDs are in RFC(25) freiberg fusion format to allow for ease of use in protein fusions.
CBDclos and CBDcex
These parts were biobricked by Bielefeld 2012 , please see their part pages ( BBa_K863111 a and BBa_K863101 ) for detailed information. CBDclos is from the"

While China's energy reserves are among the highest in the world, China is also the world's second largest energy producer and consumer country: after the United States and Russia, the energy production output of our country ranks third in the world, and the basic energy consumption accounts for one-tenth of world’s total consumption, which ranks second in the world. However, the level of energy resources per capita is much lower than the average level of the world.
Government
Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and the society. President Xi Jinping, at a speech at the UN office in Geneva earlier this year, stressed that ""ecological construction"" would become an important aspect of a shared international future. We have held innovation, coordination, green, open and share as our concepts of development; and we have already incorporated ecological environmental construction into the national development strategy. Energy is the basis for everything which can joint three spheres together.
Administration
National Energy Administration held mid-2017 working meeting, and pointed out that the first half of energy development was a good trend. We achieved our goals such as constantly optimizing the energy structure, supplying effective continuous improvement, making efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation and development, strengthening the construction and operation of agglomeration energy market more orderly and comprehensively promoting international energy cooperation.
They have put together projects to help people access green energy.
Corporation
There are hundreds and thousands of small energy plants struggling for finance, as most capital usually goes to big operations. To help them, Chinese government built a bridge so financiers could work out funding issues.
Professors & Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of Resources and Environment. He told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which was conducive to the smooth development of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in our experimental design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Today we did a double digest of B0034 at the S and P sites and sequentially digested B0034 first at the E site using Buffer 4.
We miniprepped samples using both the Invitrogen and Biobasic kits. Using the nanodrop spectroscopy, we determined that the Invitrogen kit was still better, so we continued to use that.
We also began to look into Gibson assembly, and due to past iGEM inability to attain success, we requested the protocol from the iGEM Washington 2011 team.

Synthetic Biology Exhibition during the  HKUST Information Day
Aim of the exhibition:
- Promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs. (For public engagement)
- Demonstrate our project and give explanations to encourage public engagement. (For integrated human practices)
- Promote environmental sustainability (For project benefits)
Apart from involving public's participation, there are several objectives for our exhibition. We would also like to promote the use of synthetic biology as an advance concept to solve current problems, promote student activities in HKUST through demonstration of iGEM project and suggest bioenergy as a fuel source for environmental sustainability.
There are three things we would like to do for the exhibition: the promotion and introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology, the project description and survey, and education on bioenergy as a renewable energy source.
To start with, the team would like to take this opportunity to promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs. The iGEM competition calls on students to build interdisciplinary teams of biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists to ask new questions about what synthetic biology can do. We are required to ""go beyond the lab"" and apply our project in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of our technologies.
Besides, a project can never be made into a product if we do not consider its users carefully. Thus, project explanation to the public is one of the key components in the development of our iGEM project. We would need to consider the many ways that our project can impact society as well as how the public might perceive our project in order to build a safe and sustainable project that can best serve the public interest. For biosafety concern, we will not use any engineered bacteria for display. We will"

introduction
Compared to traditional modeling tools, such as ODE, PDE and many other numerical methods, the Agent-Based Modeling bases itself on the discrete modeling of individual behaviors, in which the agent choose his actions according to the circumstances. The most intriguing part of ABM is that the overall phenomenon emerging from many agents can be discovered, not verified, which is a regular case in equation modeling methods. So, the reason why we use ABM in our model is that:
Give a comprehensive analysis of our artificial system
Discover possible problems or unexpected results
Visualize the regional behavior of a colony
Modeling Details
NetLogo Prototype
At first, we constructed a simple model based on NetLogo.
Specification
Agent: C.crescentus
Environment: 2-D Plate, with solid surface (where enough nutrition may exist) scattered at certain places; the light can also effect the cell's attaching behaviors
Behavior: The agent cell have two state: swimmer and attached. In the previous state, the cell will move around the plate in a nearly random discipline, and when it get near to the solid surface, its holdfast will attach to the surface so it can intake the nutrition from surface. When reaching a certain level of nutrition accumulation, the cell will reproduce another cell.
Version 1: Light Control
Usage: After setup, you can toggle the Light on GUI panel, and the cells' growth curve will be affected by the light. When the light is on, the cell's movement will be inhabited temporarily.
Version 2: Attaching Visualization
This is trying to simulate the scenarios in which the C.crescentus goes around and get attached.

Celllab
Celllab is a bio computing framework I am developing, enlighten by the using of NetLogo. The reason why we decide to develop such a web-based, flexible framework is that it is very tempting to give user the ability to customize the modeling running arguments, seeing what happens instantly in a single browser, and be freed from (maybe) heavy computing burden.

Design
The Plan was to restructure the BioBrick compatible, integrative Bacillus subtilis vectors pSB1C , pSB2E and pSB4S in a fashion that leads to deletion of the antibiotic resistance after an insertion of a gene of interest has been generated. Integration of those basic vectors is achieved via homologous recombination between the amyE/lacA/thrC locus, respectively, and the corresponding up and down fragments on the vector. This leads to an insertion of the gene of interest within the RCF10 compatible multiple cloning site and the resistance for positive selection (Cmr/MLSr/Specr).
We wanted to add the upp-cassette, containing an I-SceI site, as well as an additional up/down fragment to the vector. The desired vectors are presented in Fig. 1. The upp-cassette will allow negative selection in 5FU media. The contained I-SceI site will be cut by the I-SceI restriction endonuclease which is encoded on a helper plasmid pEBS-cop1. [5] (Figure)

Lab work on this project only started at end of July So far the upp cassete has been modified to fullfill the Freiburg Standard (RCF25) criteria and was successfully sequencend and submitted to the registry as BioBrick part BBa_K1351023 . Creation of the complete and functional backbones has not been successfull. We assume that due to the duplication of homologous sequences for the integration into Bacillus subtilis genomic loci a deletion has occured during phusion PCR. This is supported by the results of multiple digests of the resulting plasmid by different restriction enzymes.
We plan on continuing work on this project after the iGEM Competition
Fluorescent Proteins
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are important tools in research on a cellular or molecular basis and in the past years, many different FPs with very diverse qualities related to color, brightness, duration, bleaching, maturation time and other parameters were developed. Unfortunately, most of these FPs are optimized for use in E. coli, yeast or mammalian cells, and we aim to evaluate the properties of different FPs for the use in B. subtilis to enhance our Bac"

Antisense RNAs can reduce basal expression level
The efficiency of basal level reduction for antisense RNA type I and II are compared prior to AHL induction ([AHL]=0M)               and after the induction ([AHL] = 1.00E-05 M) Unpaired t-test analysis suggests that the differences between               w/PFB and PFB+ asRNA2 and the difference between w/PFB and PFB+asRNA2 could be considered as highly statistically               significant.
Antisense RNA type II reduces basal level more significantly
To visualize the difference between antisense type I and type II better, Fig. 2 and 4 were illustrated. Using               unpaired t-test calculation, it suggests that there are significant differences between antisense RNA type               I and type II both before and after induction with 1.00E-05 M AHL, where Fig. 2 and 4. imply that construct               with antisense RNA type II can reduce basal expression level more significantly. This may be due to higher               GC content of its complementary sites (55% for asRNA type II comparing to 47.4% for asRNA type I) according               to our first hypothesis.
Positive Feedback Loop works after AHL induction
There are also notable statistical differences when comparing the changes before and after induction using two-tailed               paired t-test analysis for both PFB+asRNA1 (p <0.001) and PFB+asRNA2 (p<0.01). The average of fluorescence/OD600 for PFB+asRNA2 is 4,199.18 while the average after its                 induction is 6,121.58, showing an increase for around 2,000 GFP/OD600 (45.8% growth) after 3 hours. Whereas,                 PFB+asRNA1 also experiences an increase by 4,765 GFP/OD600 (65.7% growth) under the same controlled time (Fig. 5),                 suggesting that antisense RNA regulates translation"
Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Bioelectric-Interface_-_-_TEXT.html," that the mtrCAB gene cluster is sufficient to engineer an efficient extracellular electron transport system. As such, we've decided to research and model the system of extracellular electron transport in S. oneidensis and an engineered strain of E. coli. We have identified MtrCAB, CymA and NapC to be elements with the most potential to influence the efficiency of electron export and the ccm cluster to be responsible for cytochrome c maturation [1]. Following these findings, we have modeled the system and attempted to test the selected genes in E coli.
In both organisms, electrons are being generated by the TCA cycle and need to be transported to a terminal electron acceptor. The first step is the generation of an intracellular quinol pool which serves as an electron shuttle, transporting electrons in the inner membrane of the cell [2,3] . The electrons are then transferred to appropriate transmembrane proteins: NapC in E. coli (NapC is a tetraheme cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase, involved in the nitrate reduction pathway [2] ) and CymA in S. oneidensis (tetraheme cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase, related to NapC [3] ). The transmembrane proteins then interact with MtrA (S. oneidensis decaheme cytochrome c) which is free floating in the periplasm. Reduced MtrA then transfers electrons to MtrC (S. ondeidensis outer membrane decaheme cytochrome c); the MtrA and MtrC interaction  is facilitated by MtrB (S. oneidensis outer membrane beta barrel porin). This way, electrons are transported across the membranes and MtrC can interact with a multitude of electron acceptors outside the cell. S. oneidensis can also utilise nanowires and mediators to further improve the efficiency of the process [4] .

Fick’s first law dictates that
, where J is the diffusion rate (flux) across the membrane (Lonsdale et al.). This models negative flux entering a closed surface. For our model, we want to model the flux that leaves the closed surface, which is our bandage. Thus, we use the model
, where J is a positive flux.
[Concentration] is the concentration of molecules inside the bandage, in our case the GzmB inhibitor. The thickness of the membrane is inversely related to J. D is the diffusivity, or the diffusion constant, of a certain configuration – a greater D generally represents a greater rate of diffusion. In our model, the diffusivity of our cellulose ester membrane was found to be 5.7x10^-6 cm^2/sec. Therefore, our diffusion model is
.
When graphed, the 3-dimensional equation looks like Figure 3 below:
Figure 3. Flux relative to concentration and membrane thickness. Fick's first law was used to predict the rate of flow across the membrane.
As demonstrated by the graph, thickness is inversely related to the diffusion rate; on the other hand, concentration is directly related to the diffusion rate. As part of future work, we can try to combine this model with the calculator to find proper treatment concentration, perhaps mathematically integrating the flux to determine an effective concentration that the bandage delivers. However, this would likely require experimental data to verify the accuracy of our current models.

Comments:
We picked blue colonies instead of white by mistake. We need to pick colonies again but this time make sure we pick white colonies.
For the repetition we must find another enzyme instead of BanII as we found out that it doesn't cut very well.

We picked again 3 colonies for each construction, and we made sure that we picked the WHITE ones. We cultivated them in a ""double check"" (name invented by us)  liquid medium. Those tubes contain:
3.5 mL LB
7 μL Amp
7 μL X-Gal
3.5 μL IPTG (turns the tube blue if the colonies picked were blue)

We made minipreps of yesterday's culture. Thanks to our ""double check"" medium we found which colonies were well picked. Finally we had minipreps of tubes HarFAR 1, 2, 3; EaDAcT 3 and AtrΔ11 2, 3.

On October 25th, 2013, we participated in a Science Café at Sir Winston Churchill High School. At this event, we had an hour to talk to high school students about synthetic biology and our project. This was a great way to engage a younger audience, allowing us to educate them about synthetic biology, our project, and participating in iGEM in the future. We also had the chance to speak about our University and what it has to offer. The students were very engaged and asked us questions about our project, what kind of opportunities exist for them when they enter post-secondary education, and how to get involved in iGEM. We were incredibly happy to see the enthusiasm they had for science and their excitement for the emerging field of synthetic biology. Our presentation was so successful, we were asked to return to speak to students at a Science Expo Information Night. This event will be hosted at Sir Winston Churchill for all high school students from around Calgary on November 6th. This will allow us to educate students from around the city about synthetic biology and let them know how they can be involved in science and iGEM in their future. We hope to see them at an iGEM information night in a year or two, but even if the students do not end up as participants in a future iGEM competition, they will be able to act as ambassadors for synthetic biology by using their knowledge to educate their friends and family.

This part was constructed with a mutation on the prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part is also constructed on the pSB4K5 standard vector.
SIMPLE PARTS
Biotinylation Tag brick
Description: The sequence codifies for the biotin ligase recognition peptide (BLRP) ( 5’ GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE 3’) which can be biotinylated in the presence of the biotin ligase BirA enzyme native from Escherichia coli. This Biotinylation process allows a strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin that can be used for protein purification purposes, specifically as an extraction method for the Carboxysome. The sequence is preceded by a methionine start codon along with a second codon consistent with efficient translation in E. coli and a terminator of transcription.
This part is an adaptation from the INTACT method (“The INTACT method for cell type–specific gene expression and chromatin profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana”. Roger B Deal1 & Steven Henikoff)
