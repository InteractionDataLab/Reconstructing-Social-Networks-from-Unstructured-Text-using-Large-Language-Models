BCCS-Bristol,2009,Team:BCCS-Bristol#BSim#Case studies#VESECURE_-_-_TEXT.html,"aged dissemination into the environment (bottom).
Experiments were carried out using the BSim agent-based modelling framework . We considered 100 E. coli in a volume of fluid of size (100 microns)^3 with wrapping boundary conditions, maintaining a bacterial density of 1e-4 bacteria/micron^3. The temperature was set to 305 K and the viscosity to 2.7e-3 Pa s. BSim features accurate models of E. coli motility and Brownian motion (important for vesicle and protein motion).
For experiments featuring packaged delivery, vesicles were produced at a realistic average rate of v = 0.25 vesicles/sec. We assume that there are n proteins/vesicle (one of each kind), resulting in a packaged protein production rate of nv.
For experiments featuring unpackaged delivery, proteins were produced at the same rate as packaged proteins (nv) for purposes of comparison. Vesicles had a radius of 20nm whilst individual proteins had a radius of a few nm. We assume every bacterium-(protein/vesicle) collision results in activation of the appropriate switch(es).
We recorded the proportion of activated bacteria in the population as a function of time for different values of Δ (the time before switches pop open), n (the number of switches making up a series switch in a bacterium) and the packaging method (packaged or unpackaged). We considered two limits of Δ:
Δ → 0 (switches pop open straight away): In this case, we expect packaged delivery via vesicles to result in a significantly enhanced rate of activation, as the chances of two unpackaged proteins arriving simultaneously will be low.
Δ → ∞ (switches stay shut indefinitely): Here, unpackaged proteins need not arrive simultaneously to activate the reporter, though packaged delivery may still be a more efficient method of activation.
Note that the proportion of activated bacteria in the population as a function of time for packaged delivery is independent of both n and Δ as all n proteins arrive simultaneously by definition. Footage of a simulation is shown below (two populations in red and green):
'Switches pop open straight away'
The graph below shows the proportion of activated bacteria in the population as a function of time averaged over 10 runs for Δ → 0. For unpackaged delivery to activate a bacterium in this limit, all n proteins must arrive simultaneously by chance. For the case n=2, we see that this does indeed happen. For n ≥ 3, it never happens (and so the curves are not shown).

Human Practice Done in Each Region
Fig 4.1 Percentage of teams who did human practice in each region
Fig 4.2 Number of teams who did human practice in each region
In each region, it can be deduced that the number of teams who did human practice projects in each region differ from one another. Graph 4.1 indicates the relationship between the percentage of teams who did human practice projects in each region whereas graph 4.2 indicates the number of teams in each region. The results from graph 4.1 indicates that approximately 90% of the teams in Latin America did human practice projects and roughly 79% of the teams in Europe and Asia. North America scores the lowest among the region with approximately 62% of the teams did human practice projects.
The evidence shown from the 2 graphs is quite surprising especially towards North America. Despite the fact that North America has the most number of teams, it seems that compare to the other regions, North America did not show as much attitude towards human practice, in reference to the data in graph 4.1. It can be concluded that from the values of the percentage of number of team who did human practice projects in each region is different from one another.
Projects Done for Each Type in Each Year
.
Fig 5.1 Number of human practice projects done each year
Fig 5.2 Number of human practice projects done for each type each year
Fig 5.3 Number of human practice projects done each year for each type
The number of human practice projects in each type is estimated to be growing in number in the past years. Taking the data from graph 5.1, the amount of human practice projects done has increased more than expected. This may be caused by the growing trend of synthetic biology and the increase in the importance of human practice projects. Graph 5.2 describes the amount of projects done in each type from the year 2008 to 2013. The observation from the graph can conclude that the amount of projects done in every type increased in every year.
Graph 5.3 also shows the number of projects done in each type from 2008 to 2013. From this graph, it is suggested that from 2011 to 2013, talks has been the most favourable types of projects. It is estimated that half of the total projects of each types occurred in 2013. This may prove that the number of human practice projects is increasing at an acceleration, also as given from graph 5.1. By observing the correlation between the "

Cell Sorting
Cell Sorting
Summary
The ability to sort cells by type or physical properties is a valuable tool in many synthetic biology labs. Prior to analysis or in order to perform specialized protocols, creating homogenous cell suspensions from a mixture is necessary. In addition to sorting cells, the removal of cell fragments, activated magnetic particles or unwanted debris through sorting also makes up a key part of purification protocols.
This microfluidic chip design carries out cell sorting as a cell suspension is passed through it. Cells are sorted based on size and pushed to the periphery of the channel. These cells are then carried away from the main solution through the two periphery outputs, and the cell-free solution can be collected from the central output.

Studier for his amber t7 phage strain Next class we plan on growing up phage so that we will have a decent amount of phage to work with.  We have several procedures that we plan on testing so that we can see if we can purify the protein capsid.  We hope to be proceeding with these as soon as we have phage that we can use.  Another issue that we need to consider is how to get drugs into the capsid.  We need to be able to test and see if we can actually fill our empty capsids with a material.  We have several procedures found in other papers that could possibly help us with this.

I spent time trying to find a good procedure to propagate phage in a liquid medium. I finally found one that I think will work well for us.
Today we learned a procedure for how to count phage.  We performed a phage titer on the T4 phage to see if we have a high enough concentration to work with.  This is the general procedure: Phage titer: reported in Pfu/mL (Pfu stands for plaque forming unit)  mix E. coli (500 microL) with 50 microL of phage lysate  incubate for 20 minutes  mix with 4 mL top agar and then plate  holes will appear in the agar that are called plaques
How we followed it: We filled five test tubes full of 90 microliters of Liquid Broth each. We added 10 microliters of our desired phage to the first test tube and then mixed We took 10 microliters of the first tubes mixed solution and added it to tube 2, and followed the same procedure for each test tube down the line to tube five. We then labeled 6 culture tubes 0 to -5. In the first culture tube, we added 20 microL phage to .5 mL bacteria. In tubes -1 to -5 we took 20 microL from eppendorfs and added to .5 mL bacteria.  We then allowed a 20 minute waiting period for the virus to infect the E. coli. Then, 5 mL top agar was added to each culture tube. Each tube was then plated and incubated at 37 degrees C.

Other events including helping them with employment and other living problems and holiday consolation are often arranged. They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized to develop activities on their own.
Two Cups of Water Sign Language: They set up sign language class at Shenzhen Centre Book Store, one of the biggest book store in Shenzhen, to teach people for free. According to their person in charge, people with hearing loss account for 1/10 to 1/5 who participate in learning.
Shenzhen Ear Caring Plan: This organization provide hearing aids and Cis for child with hearing loss, aiming to let them go to school and receive education just the same as normal healthy child.
We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteer (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech. They have arranged activities to help people with visual disorder and their work is very impressive. Helping with hearing-impaired people could be the next thing they plan to do.
Activities
Commonweal organizations
After collecting and analyzing our questionnaires, we found that most people lack the experience of communicating with severe hearing-impaired people. However, they showed great enthusiasm on learning more about them and caring them as possible.
We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public. For example, Two Cups of Water Sign Language set up courses every week in Shenzhen Center Book Store for people to learn simple sign language.
We think the biggest problem of people with hearing loss is caused by communication difficult. If normal people can learn basic sign language, they can have more contact with hearing-impaired people and thus discrimination and prejudice on this population can be largely decreased. Further, it is the simplest way to make people with hearing loss feel comfortable in this society.
The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss. Hence, we printed booklets and also set up several public media accounts to make the public focus on things about hearing loss people including news, scientific education, welfare, etc.
In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate. Also, we recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more chances for SUSTecher to help people with hearing loss.
Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize sign language teaching on our social media constantly.
Company cooperation
Notably, in the questionnaire, some interviewees suggested that there could be some applications (APPs) on cellphone, functioning to simplify the communication between normal people and hearing-impaired people, and thus make people with hearing loss convenient"

Simplification
Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.
Assumptions we have made to deduct the original equations involve:
●Relatively faster reactions such as transcription reactions and binding reactions will reach to Quasi-equilibrium.
●Basal expression of protein is so meager that they can be ignored in modeling.
●Two series of Hill Kinetics equations can be estimated through a single Hill Kinetics equation.
●Protein which is translated from mRNA is proportional to corresponding mRNA in a previous time.
Consider gene lasR and luxR which are all constant genes, since AHL has a relatively low concentration compared to other substances, we assume that protein concentrations of PlasR and PluxR are irrelevant to AHLs. Therefore, concentrations of these proteins will reach to constant quantities. Moreover, certain mRNAs will also be constant. That is:
We have:
Then focus on compound LA1 and LA2. The binding process is far quicker than other reactions such as translation reactions, thus we assume that the compounds are Quasi-equilibrium:
We have:
Take the expressions to equation (6) (15), the functions are transformed to:
The transformed functions have nothing to do with feedback factors compared to original ones. Knowing that such feedback is essential for our system, we add additional feedback factors ka,kb manipulatively.
Then we want to come up a clear expression of A2c1,A1c2.They are generated by protein PluxI and PlasI, whose translation rate is much slower than the transcription rate. So we assume that certain mRNA is Quasi-equilibrium:
We have:
By ignoring the basal expression:
Knowing that protein PtetR is controlled by LA2 through Hill Function, we assume that concentration of mRNA is directly related to LA2:

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Gold-Media Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM teams are written their description and overview in a neutral tone. Newspaper and magazine perform equally well. It is worth noted that the rate of negative attitude in newspaper is twice the rate in magazine.
Attitude—Newspaper
    We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that when it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes to 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry. It is the technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.
     Generally speaking, in information sufficiency, we discover that the iGEM wiki perform worse than Newspaper and Magazines. We speculate that iGEM team tends to organize and rephrase argument so as to convince the audience, it then, however, fail to inform the audience with other information other than the one the team is focusing on. As for suggestion to Newspaper, we found that more attribution of responsibility can be provided, or the audience will be informed only the same idea.
     As for the information understandability, we discover that newspaper provides little explanation or definition of technical terms. If more definition is made, it will better the understanding of the audience.
    iGEM wiki is tremendously great for the iGEM community, much information is offered and is tremendously beneficial. It can, however, be a pity if those project is performed, presented, or transferred in a difficult and harsh way. If iGEM team can write their result in wiki in a clearer and more understandable way with more information. it can definitely lead people who are science layman into the splendid world of biology.

Penn,2013,Team:Penn#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," better presentations. We began transforming promoters for an additional screen for methyltransferases that we had envisioned, with the belief that methyltransferases could silence promoters.
WEEK 11
Aug 15 2013 - Aug 21 2013
Goals:
We wanted to get our Cas construct working after additional drylab work in designing better assembly reactions. We needed to make a detailed plan of where our funds were going to go for the rest of the summer and begin planning our slides for our iGEM presentation. We wanted to decide where we wanted to be by the competition and what we needed to do to get there.
Achievements:
We began creating a plan for creating a video about methylation in general and our project specifically. After consulting with our advisors we decided to change the direction of our methyltransferase-DNA binding domain fusion from a two-plasmid to a one-plasmid system that would incorporate a digestion-based assay within the plasmid.
WEEK 12
Aug 22 2013 - Aug 28 2013
Goals:
Our main goal for this week was to finalize our ideal cloning constructs and figure out how to port what we had already created into the one-plasmid system. We wanted to elaborate more on the assay, as our advisors had emphasized that as one of the more important contributions that our project could make to the synthetic biology community.
Achievements:
We focused on drylab this week, as we needed to get our plans for the rest of the summer set. We worked on a human practices essay about the ethics of targeted methylation in medical therapies. We also began work designing new primers for our revised cloning strategy.
WEEK 13
Aug 29 2013 - Sep 4 2013
Goals:
Our goal was to once again begin a new cloning strategy focused on assembling our one-plasmid systems. We needed our cloning strategy finalized as soon as possible, and we dedicated the majority of our time this week to streamlining our cloning process.
Achievements:
We began setting up our travel plans to get to the Jamboree. We began the initial stages of cloning our new systems and made substantial progress on cloning our zinc finger and TALE.
WEEK 14
Sep 5 2013 - Sep 11 2013
Goals:
Our goal for this week was to make further progress on cloning our constructs. We also wanted to continue our work on the human practices essay, and begin creating a poster presentation for presenting at University research conferences. We also wanted to begin thinking about designing a computer application for analyzing gels.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," gene of interest - terminator) all in a versatile one-pot Golden Gate reaction without time-consuming conventional cloning steps.
Figure 1: The yeast toolkit starter set comprises of 96 parts and vectors. The eight primary part types can be further divided into subtypes. (Dueber)
The cloning steps regarding the plasmid levels are implemented in E.coli in order to reduce the required time to generate the final plasmids. The different levels are therefore defined by their part content and their antibiotic resistances.
To generate a level 0 plasmid, the gene of interest is ligated into the provided level 0 backbone via Golden Gate assembly using the enzyme BsmBI. The backbone contains a resistance to Chloramphenicol, as well as an origin of replication, creating a very basic yet functional plasmid.
The level 1 plasmid contains a promoter and terminator suited for S. cerevisiae. There is the possibility of including  a polyhistidine-tag if there is a need for Western blot analysis. The antibiotic resistance contained in the level 1 plasmid changes from chloramphenicol to ampicillin which enables filtering out residual level 0 plasmids contained in the Golden Gate product. Furthermore, the Dueber toolbox includes the possibility of designing GFP-Dropout cassettes. These are custom-built level 1 backbones whose inserts are sfGFP as well as promoter and terminator suited for E. coli.  Upon a successful cloning step the GFP is replaced by the part(s) of interest, and correct colony shows a white colour. In case of a wrong ligation event colonies show a green fluorescence. This provides a very useful tool to detect unsuccessful cloned colonies. The enzyme used for level 1 changes from BsmBI to BsaI to avoid any interference between different steps.
The level 2 plasmid combines two or more genes of interest with their respective promoters, terminators and tags. The resistance changes from ampicillin to kanamycin. The enzyme of this step is BsmBI again. This level is useful, if the construct you are designing requires multiple genes to be transformed into one yeast strain.
Yeast nomenclature
To make it fast and easy to differentiate between endogenous and heterologous genes and gene products we decided to use S. cerevisiae nomenclature according to yeastgenome.org .
Below nomenclature at the example of your favorite gene 1, YFG1 is explained.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#Events_-_-_TEXT.html," concepts in synthetic biology rely on an understanding of other concepts i.e. DNA, genes and cells. As we had to cater for a range of levels of previous understanding we had to be able to explain these concepts to people (especially children) who had never heard the terms before. Our Solution:
1. Simplify the concept of synthetic biology to exclude a detailed knowledge of genetics – introduce it as moving ‘instructions’ from different living things into other living things in new combinations. E.g. ‘We can take the instruction that makes this coral pink and put it into completely different living thing, a bacterial cell. Now the bacterial cell, which is normally colourless, is the same colour as the coral.’ This could be extended to think about two kinds of instructions; ‘when’ i.e. regulatory components, and ‘what’ i.e. an instruction that tells a cell what to do or what to look like.
2. Have ways of introducing these concepts e.g. describing what bacteria are using the Bacteria Combat card game.
How were we informed by the survey and focus groups?
- Addressing the concern raised in our focus group that the possibilities presented about synthetic biology are ‘over-hyped’ we specifically only used examples of ‘instructions’ that have been submitted as BioBricks to the iGEM registry.
- As anyone could come up to our table we were able to engage older people, a group which our survey shows is more likely to have a lower level of previous knowledge about synthetic biology.
What did we improve for our second go?
We found that people were more interested in the objects and having a discussion than necessarily the ‘Can you give our cells new instructions?’ activity. In fact, this became a good demonstration tool during discussion rather than a starting point for it. For our second event we were also publicised on the museum’s website.
Synthetic Biology and Restriction Enzymes Talk @ Question of Taste Workshop
Audience:
15-20 A2-level Biology students (17-18 years old) and their teachers.
The Brief:
Give 20-25 minute presentation about synthetic biology focusing on molecular biology techniques during the Oxford University Museum of Natural History ‘A Question of Taste’ day-long workshop.
Content:
In the course of the day the students undertook PCR, restriction enzyme digest and gel electrophoresis so we discussed how these techniques could be used in synthetic biology.
We also developed a model of a plasmid and insert to demonstrate complementary ends and the problems with a one enzyme restriction digest and how this can be overcome by a double restriction enzyme digest.

Gray Value-Concentration Model
Gray Value-Concentration Model
By building a mathematical model, we demonstrate the principles of the project and provide guidance                     for optimizing product design and its application.
A grayscale model is built to solve the image quantization problem.
A kinetic model was established to solve the problem of time optimization of antigen fixation,                     reaction concentration ratio and detection time optimization.
The spatial perturbation model provides relevant conclusions about liquid crystal interference. A                     fixed antigen concentration threshold is given.
The relationship between the gray value and the added substance                     concentration
To describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody ligation, and detection, a grayscale model                         was established. The model can more accurately reflect the results of the three phases.                         Especially in the test, the results can be digitized to provide better detection limits.
For the result of the gray value calculation, it is firstly grayscaled. Since it is a color                         picture, it needs to be grayed out first with Matlab. At the same time, in order to give a clear                         grayscale image, image equalization is performed and a balanced image is given[Attachment                             1]. After obtaining the grayscale image, it is necessary to calculate the grayscale of                         the image using the formula (1). To make it easier to get accurate data, design a small software[Attachment                             2] in a programming language that calculates the average grayscale of the image. There                         is an error in the data of the grayscale image. According to the experimental results, when the                         gray value is not too low, it is about 5%. The error is about 10% compared to the balanced                         grayscale image.
$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$
For the experimental results, no matter which process. In the initial stage, the gray value is                         positively correlated with the concentration of the additive; as the additive concentration                         increases, the gray value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy                         these properties, equation (2) and equation (3):
Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$
Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$
Substituting the above two formulas into the relevant literature [2], where model (2) is very                         consistent. Simultaneous model (2) If the enzyme"

The work for this project was fully performed by the iGEM TU-Eindhoven 2013 team members, the lab work started from June 2013 onwards.
The idea of the CEST protein producing bacteria was developed by the team way before starting the actual lab work, it was the result of thorough literature research and discussions. All the experiments, the modeling and the device design were planned and executed by the team. Our advisers gave us guidance when we required it, but their function was merely as counselors. We receive lab guidance from Stijn Aper, who is a PhD student at TU Eindhoven. He supervised our lab work, especially in the beginning of the project, and gave us valuable advices whenever we encountered an issue with the outcome of the experiments.
The human practices project was completely developed by the team with the collaboration of 6 iGEM teams from across the world. The teams were asked to revise and classify a common statement about Synthetic Biology as true, false, or inconclusive. These teams were also asked to write a brief discussion piece about the statement and the arguments behind the final classification given to the statement.
The team managed all the organizational matters, including sponsoring. We made our own logos, designs and drawings, except for those found on the safety section of our wiki which were made by the industrial designer Mariana Félix. The wiki, presentation and poster style were also designed and developed by the team, but Mariana Félix helped us with the aesthetic details of the poster and presentation.

Today we measured GFP for the Measurement Interlab Study.
Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in ten folds the culture volume with a phosphate buffered saline (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl), as performed by Scholz et al., 2000. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Panreac. NaCl was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents.
A GloMax-Multi Detection System form Promega fluorometer configured with the Blue optical kit (&Lamda;ex=490 nm, &Lamda;em=510-575 nm) was used to measure fluorescence. For measuring fluorescence 250 Î¼l of each sample were placed in a black 96-well plate. Each sample was measured three times and an average was displayed on the screen.
A Biowave CO 8000 from Biochrom spectophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 600 nm. For measuring absorbance 700 Î¼l were placed in a cubet and measured one by one in the spectrophotometer.

site visits
Based on advice from our advisors, we started to grow our own algae as a way to prototype and simulate our localized fuel production model. Creating home growth algae kits, we needed to source algae from around Los Angeles. Samples were pulled from the Huntington Library Koi Pond (pictured right), turtle ponds in Chinatown and at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, and from the Los Angeles River.
simulation 1
For our first investigation, we built two miniaturized communities of three pools on a sunny rooftop in Pasadena, CA. We introduced algae samples from ponds and rivers across Los Angeles and monitored day to day growth and activity for four weeks. We measured against a constant, observing contamination rates, acidity, population, and color of the pools. With enough to time to grow a large colony, we were able to determine how to create productive environments for growth.
To create the models, we used CNC milled foam for houses and vacuum formed plastic for the pools. All samples were collected by hand, and water replenishment was carried out daily.
simulation 2
In our second investigation, we enlarged our geographic scale and context. Our growth sites were 10 miles apartment, one in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the other in Highland Park. Using two inflatable kiddie pools, we introduced hand-collected algae from the Los Angeles River. Because the experiment was done at a human scale, the work of tending the algae colony grew exponentially. The pools required stirring and monitoring, with mosquitoes and raccoons making regular visits to both sites. By actually incorporating the pools into backyards, we were able to explore the behavioral outcomes of actually monitoring an active biofuel pond.
The pool models we used were store-bought inflatable pools for children. All samples were collected by hand, and stirring, skimming, pH testing, and partying was carried out daily.
so.cal. igem meetup
Over the summer Media Design Practices hosted the Southern California iGEM meetup. We had been in contact with local teams such as UCLA, CalTech, LA Biohackers, and UCSC and found time to organize a group session in our Pasadena Studio. We talked about current iGEM projects, learned about genetic synthesis, and socialized with other interested and interesting people. Knowledge transfer definitely occurred.

Throughout the process, we realized numerous insights:
First, mosquito control became a serious problem. As a West Nile outbreak sizzled in the region, we had to find tools that could address the problem without hurting algae"

Background
KcsA
KcsA is a prokaryotic potassium channel from the soil bacteria Streptomyces lividans that has been studied extensively in ion channel research. The pH activated protein possesses two transmembrane segments and a highly selective pore region, responsible for the gating and shuttling of K+ ions from the extracellular environment into the cell. The amino acid sequence (TVGYG) found in the selectivity filter of KcsA is highly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic K+ voltage channels; as a result, research on KcsA has provided important structural and mechanistic insight on the molecular basis for K+ ion selection and conduction. As one of the most studied ion channels to this day, KcsA is a template for research on K+ channel function and its elucidated structure underlies computational modeling of channel dynamics for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species[1].
The selective filter is the central structure of the ion channel. Its amino acid sequence is TVGYG from77-79[2], which is the same in all potassium channels. The carbonyl oxygen atoms on the amino acid sequence point inward toward the ion channel and form four ion-binding sites on the potential energy.

Anti-sigma factors are proteins which is related to transcriptional control mechanism by sigma factors. An anti-sigma factor inhibits the binding between RNA polymerase and sigma factor. Consequently, anti-sigma factors repress the transcription from the promoters which sigma factors initiate. In the same way as sigma factor, anti-sigma factors have great variety and some anti-sigma factors prevent only a specific sigma factors from transcriptional control. Therefore a transcription control system (i.e. not only activating but also repressing) can be constructed by using specific sigma factors and anti-sigma factors which have one-to-one correspondence.

Sigma-Memory Construction
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" />
<legend>Fig.7 Construction of Sigma Memory</legend>
This is the construction of our sigma-memory. This genetic circuit is composed of three parts. The gene of a sigma factor is placed at the downstream of the promoter that is induced by a substance A and at the downstream of Psigma, which is the promoter induced by the sigma factor. The latter one forms a positive feedback circuit. The gene of the corresponding anti-sigma factor is placed at the downstream of the promoter which is induced by a substance B.
At first, sigma factors and anti-sigma factors do not exist. Input A induces the sigma factor expression and the concentration of the sigma factor rises. Though sigma factors are subjects to degradation [3], the state where sigma factors exist remains after the induction of A finished since the positive feedback circuit produces more sigma factor when sigma factor exist. After the induction of input B, anti-sigma factor is expressed and transcriptions from the corresponding promoters, including positive feedback circuit, is inhibited. Both sigma factors and anti-sigma factors are subjects to degradation［3］, so all of them are decomposed after some time and sigma-memory returns to its original state (i.e"
Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model:Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a new population of XL. At t=5 hours   a lytic phage is introduced into the system at a starting concentration of 1.0·104 particles/ml and starts to infect XS, converting them to XI. At t=5.5 hours the first population   of XI lyses, with each bacterium releasing 98 phage particles into the solution, which repeat the cycle. At about t=10 hours, the rate of infection of XS by populations of both phages,   combined with the rate of outflow of cells due to dilution, becomes equal to the growth rate of XS, leading to the levelling off of the solid red line representing XS. This is followed by a further   slowly increasing decline of XS due to the increase in population of both phages. At about t=20 hours the concentration of XS drops below 10-15 particles/ml, leading to extinction. Meanwhile,   the concentration of XL keeps growing steadily fuelled by the conversion of XS to XL up until about t=13 hours. It then continues a slower growth due to   depletion of XS, but fuelled by a steady natural cell division. Figure 3A shows simulation of the same model over 250 hours. It shows that in this particular simulation populations of temperate phage and lysogenic   bacteria can co-exist in chemostat in an equilibrium over a long-time period.
Figure 2. Simulation of the new model in a chemostat. All parameters set as in Table 1, ε = 5 hours ( d13160f ). XS – concentration of susceptible bacteria, XL – concentration of lysogenic bacteria, XI – concentration of bacteria infected with lytic phage, P – concentration of lytic phage, PT – concentration of temperate phage, S – concentration of substrate.
For comparison, we simulated all models that we used for the development of a new model using the same set of initial parameters (Table 1) next to each other (Figure 3). The plot of XS is somewhat similar in Figure 3B and   C, whereas the dynamics of XS in Figure 3A and D is completely different from the two before and from each other.

May 3 ~ May 9, 2010 Write a PPT on the framework of our game, which focused on database. We came to the conclusion that the database should have the following features, quick search, links to reactions, inheritance between different parts, easy to add elements, and most of them are still suitable now(Aug, 2010).
May 10 ~ May 16, 2010 We decide to realize the database and simulation of a biological oscillator first, the model was presented in article “A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators”, Nature 2000.
May 17 ~ Jun 6, 2010 Summarize the reactions of oscillator, learn SBML and libsbml APIs. Search biomodels.net for SBMLs on oscillator created by other people and learn from them.
Kun Jiang
May 3 ~ May 9, 2010 Study the specification document of libsbml make an attempt at developing a sbml ode solver basing on the sundials math library.
May 10 ~ May 16, 2010 After meeting difficulty of developing a sbml ode solver from scratch, We turn to the existing library. At last, soslib v1.6.0, a library covered by the LGPL license, was choose to be as a part of our software.  Add simple data display function to the soslib to get curve representation of the output data. And also need be noticed is that the soslib only support sbml version 2 level 1.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," PBS served as the blank reference against which OD600 and fluorescent measurements were comparatively                         made (i.e., by subtracting the OD600 and fluorescent readings of the blank from each aliquot under study).  The comparative fluorescent reading of each aliquot was divided by the comparative OD600 reading of the same aliquot in order                         to obtain a measure of “per cell” fluorescence.  The triplet samples were then averaged and the standard deviation calculated to obtain the results shown below for the overnights:
Figure 1:  Fluorescence Measurements (Hourly results)
As expected, the positive control (in 1uM AHL) shows a clear, three-fold increase in fluorescence compared to the negative control (in 0uM AHL).  In contrast, the test system is seen to exhibit fluorescent behavior similar to that of the negative control over the five hours of study.  The test system is seen to be different than the negative control system when cell growth is considered in the figure below:
Figure 2:  Cell Growth (Hourly results)
The unit-step introduction of AHL in the test system has a delaying effect on cell growth, whereas the constant presence of the same, high concentration of AHL in the positive control does not impede growth relative to the negative control (where AHL is consistently absent).
Over enough time, we expect the fluorescent behavior of the test system to converge to that of the positive control (since the positive control was created in a manner identical to that of the test system).  A concentration of 1uM AHL over five hours is insufficient to demonstrate convergence.  The behavior of the system as a function of lower AHL concentrations is also an important question as it may better reflect the environmental circumstances that our biosensor would naturally encounter.
In summary, these measurements provided a first confirmation of our prototype device regarding fluorescent responsiveness to AHL concentration (i.e., greater fluorescence in the sustained presence of AHL compared to its absence).  These measurements also guided the next steps in our evaluation of the prototype including: 1) use of different reporters, such as LacZ, 2) evaluation of system behavior over timescales longer than four hours, 3) evaluation of system behavior in response to different concentrations of AHL.

Validating the hypothesis
Dr. A. Senthil Kumar
Professor & Division Chair, Environmental & Analytical Chemistry Division
The CO2 equilibrium is always established in nature. With the increase in CO2 emissions with industrialisation and                     other anthropogenic actions, the overall CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased. Considering the equilibrium that nature is trying to establish as given below:
From the above equation, it is clear that with increasing CO2 in the reactants, with respect to Le Chateliers principle, the forward reaction is favoured and there is more dissolved CO​2​. This establishment of equilibrium is what causes the increased CO2 level in the ocean and thereby leading to ocean acidification. Initially we had decided to use a system that facilitates an influx of carbonate/bicarbonate ions. Thankfully, our discussions with Dr.A.Senthil Kumar after almost 2 months of working brought in              light the fact that by using a system that removes products from the above reaction, will tend the reaction to move in the forward direction and that would mean we were doing the reverse of what we intended i.e., we were going to reduce the pH by dissolving more CO2.
This was a major contribution after which we changed our system completely.
V. S. Saravanan
Asst Professor, ​ Department of Microbiology ,Mūvattupula, India
Since our system leads to a high concentration of H+ ions in the cell, we were doubtful of its fate                    inside the organism. Dr.Saravanan very enthusiastically explained to us that H+ions are majorly used               for energy generation,and once homeostasis is established the excess H+ ions are flushed out of the                system.
Choice of organism
Our organism of choice should certainly be saline friendly, be able to survive varied pH and also                 accommodate the system that we have in place.Early in our project, we got on a Skype call with                  iGEM Marburgh who are currently working with ​Vibrio natriegens. ​ Our discussions with the team              further interested us to use ​V. natriegens as a model organism because of its less doubling time and its                                       necessity for 2% NaCl for its growth (thalophilic). This was not put into action because of the                 difficulties in protocols. Our experiments were contained to ​E.coli DH5 Alpha. With due course of             "

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#NotebookDaily_-_-_TEXT.html," which was PCRed from the plasmid with pBAD.
Wednesday 17th of August
We started the day off with a CTAB minipreparation of the ligated constitutive promoter with GFP and INP and afterwards we did a restriction and purified the samples out of the gel. We also did a restriction of the plasmid which was PCRed the day before.
Thursday 18th of August
The purification protocol usually used has a very low success rate thus today a restriction was purified from gel with a different protocol to see if this one has a higher success rate. The vectors pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and pSB1A3 were miniprepped and restricted. Restrictions were also done on LuxR, pBAD, Ribolock CeaB and ribokey ( no purifications were done). pBAd was ligated to GFP and a transformation of LuxI was also done.
Friday 19th of August
GOOD NEWS: a ligation was successful!!! We started on making the data page.
Monday 22th of August
Restriction was done on the constitutive and HybB promoters. This was followed with ligation of LuxR and pBAD, Ribolock-CeaB and Terminator and HybB and Ribokey-terminator. During the day we also did a 10 minipreparation; 8 of the ligated fragments we ligated last week and 2 of LuxI. The vectors psB1A2, psB1C3 and psB1K3 were PCRed.
Wednesday 24th of August
Two ligations were attempted; 1.Ribokey-terminator and HybB promoter and 2. Terminator and INP. Restriction of these biobricks were done prior to the ligations.
Thursday 25th of August
The ligation of Ribokey-terminator and HybB promoter was successful in contrast to the ligation of the terminator and INP. Restriction of the terminator was because of this repeated.
Monday 29th of August
The GFP testing was continued. The PCR of LuxI, done last week with the general primers, keep failing thus we suspect that the functionality of the primers is the cause of the continual failure. To test this we PCRed LuxI and HybB with the general primers and when we put the PCR on gel, we saw no bands and have concluded that the general primers are faulty.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"ADP conversion is used as an energy currency in many cellular processes like translocation of proteins and metabolites or anabolic and catabolic turnovers. It is assumed that ANT1P, an ATP/AMP antiporter, is located in the peroxisomal membrane. Furthermore, the shuttle mechanism of the peroxisomal protein import machinery is ATP dependent (Palmieri L. et al., 2001) . NADPH plays an important role in anabolic pathways and is also indispensable to our desired pathways of nootkatone and violacein. Glutathione is an antioxidant and redox buffer which is also found in yeast peroxisomes. It is used as cofactor by at least two types of peroxisomal proteins, the glutathione peroxidases and glutathione transferases, which reduce lipid- and hydrogen peroxides or transfer glutathione to lipid peroxides for the purpose of detoxification (Horiguchi H. et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it partly represents the redox state of the peroxisome. Knowing the pH of a compartment is important for predicting the activities of almost all enzymatic processes inside and to follow up acidification and basification upon conversion of metabolites.
We finally chose two ratiometric sensors to perform measurements with. The pH sensitive and glutathione redox state reporting green fluorescent proteins pHLuorin2 (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) and roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . Our aim was to target them either to the peroxisomal lumen or the cytosol. To achieve peroxisomal targeting we attached the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 via Golden Gate cloning .
Figure 5.1 Level 1 plasmids with medium promoters and uracil auxotrophy. Top left: cytosolic roGFP2. Top right: peroxisomal roGFP2. Bottom left:  cytosolic pHLourin2. Bottom right: peroxisomal pHLourin2.
Using promoters with different expression strength in order to find optimal measurement conditions is of high interest. There is a trade-off between a high signal-to-noise ratio and self-induced effects which are both dependent on expression levels (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . This is not generally the case for each sensor. For example, pHlourin2 has only a minor influence on the existing pH because of the buffer effect of proteins"

Kritam, Braulio and Rita visited a secondary school to educate pupils about synthetic biology here, we gained perspective and external opinions  on Mag-nano-tite. This provided a wider picture on the synthesis of our magnetite nano-particles which we had  not previously considered synthesising chemically. Rachel, Braulio, Jasmine and Sam were ambassadors for iGEM  at open days for University ofKent. Here, the team interacted with the public, shared our project ideas as well  educating many on the iGEM competition. Daniie interviewed an expert in the magnetic nanoparticle area, who provided insight into the chemical synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles. Kritam, through topic modelling provided a novel means for quantify human practices in iGEM. More information on Human Practices can be found here .
Writing
Throughout the course of our iGEM project the Kent team have been carrying out research including reading related articles to our project. We have discovered that there is not a lot of background information on our chosen project, as well as lack of information on the proteins we have decided to engineer. We have had weekly meetings where we discuss, share thoughts and ideas, as well as make decisions for the benefit of this group. We have recorded the progress of this project in our notebook which can be found here. (hyperlink to notebook) We have designed posters, prepared presentations and written detailed explanations into our project that the whole team has contributed to. The wiki was organised by our team organiser Rachel, and coded by Aleksandra.
The Team
Kritam Thapa
Kritam’s main contributions was as a member of the Human Practice team. He was involved in the outreach aspect of the project. He gave an oral presentation at an outstanding school where he shared and received ideas from the students. Key information gathered from this event has proven central in some decisions we have made in the development of the project. Kritam developed the modelling for our project, he also wrote code for software to be used for the quantitative analysis for integrated human practice via LDA topic modelling.
Daniie Smith
Daniie’s main contributions to the team were as a wet lab member as well as her work for Human Practices. Her work provided a unique angle to this project which allowed us to investigate into alternate methods to chemically synthesise of magnetite nanoparticles. Daniie spoke to experts in the nanoparticle"
WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," rekindled interest and research in the West. This therapy is increasingly cited as the best alternative to antibiotics, the overuse of which has led to increased bacterial resistance.
Purpose and Function
The purpose of phage therapy, according to the Phage Therapy Center in Tbilisi, Georgia, is to provide “an effective treatment solution for patients who have bacterial infections that do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapies”[1]. Phage therapy has been used to cure acne, some symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and countless other conditions. Bacteriophages function by infecting a bacterium, replicating inside of the bacterium, and causing the bacterium to lyse (bursting the cell membrane, spilling the cytoplasm, and killing the bacterium).
History
The first use of phage therapy is relatively unknown, given that several scientists have made the claim of discovering its usefulness. In 1896, Ernest Hankin, a British scientist, reported the presence of “marked antibacterial activity (against Vibrio cholerae), which he observed in the waters of the Ganges and Jumna rivers in India...”[2]. In 1898, Russian bacteriologist Nikolay Gamaleya observed a similar function with Bacillus subtilis. Neither of these scientists developed their observations further. However, the British scientist Frederick Twort “reintroduced the subject almost twenty years after Hankin’s observation by...advancing the hypothesis that it may have been due to...a virus”[2]. While Twort did not further the research due to lack of finances, a French-Canadian named Felix d’Herelle managed to further the  Afterward, d’Herelle used his discovery to successfully treat dysentery in a 12-year-old boy. This became the first attempt to use bacteriophages therapeutically.
Importance
Phage therapy, while not seen as a “be-all, end-all” for infections, is offered as an alternative treatment in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance has become an ever-increasing difficulty and microbiologists have not been able to keep up with the mutations conferring resistance and the transmission of resistance genes (often occurring by horizontal DNA transfer from one resistant bacterium to a nonresistant one). One “superbug”, MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus), has become common place in hospitals. While it is often not lethal, it can still pose a threat to immunocompromised patients.

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

The students were especially excited to discuss the microbial fuel cells and their possibilities in the industrial sector. This lead into further discussion about the interdisciplinary nature of genetic engineering; in addition to the manufacturing sector we briefly discussed what other fields related to engineering  and what jobs are available that relate to genetic engineering.
The discussion with these students, and their unique questions, inspired us to apply an dplane a CICATS Science Cafe. Schedule for November 16, 2018 this event is designed to open a dialogue with 30 minutes presentation by Mark Mimee of the MIT Department of Biological Engineering. This keynote presentation is to be followed by Q&A session where we hope to see similar discussion as with Dr. Granger’s students at E.O Smith. The audience of the event is members of the surrounding community, from high-school students to working professionals in any field. We will be advertising the event to persons of all backgrounds, encouraging both faculty and students to attend.
Integrated Human Practices
Dr. Steven Suib
Dr. Steven Suib is the director of the Institute of Material Science at UConn. He has worked in the fields of inorganic catalysis and materials science for almost 40 years. We had been looking into biofuel research at UConn when we discovered a project Dr. Suib had worked on: converting waste cooking oil from the dining halls into biodiesel to be used to fuel the university shuttle buses. Dr. Suib developed inorganic catalysts to assist in the reactions of the system they developed for converting the waste oil to biodiesel.
We reached out to Dr. Suib and he agreed to meet for an interview. He shared his insight about inorganic catalysts with us, explaining how they can aid biological enzymatic activity in a micro-organisms because they are very stable and robust. He has collaborated with researchers at UConn working on microbial fuel cells and developed such catalysts for these systems.
Moving on to biofuels, he explained how they can only provide a small percentage of the energy demanded by our society and recommended that we reach out to contacts he has in the UConn school of business for an economic analysis of our system. He suggested that a device or concept similar to ours would be more applicable on a smaller-scale in remote areas as a way to harvest and store energy. Dr. Suib praised our out of the box thinking and encouraged us to keep exploring the possibilities for microbial electrosynthesis.

Corridor, a Platform for the iGEMers, Established by SZU-China
     We were glad to get the invitation from SZU China and be a member of Corridor. It is a platform that tries to provide a community for iGEMers to ask the question about synthetic biology and make the discussion. We hoped that in the future, Corridor can be a communication center to gather wisdom to spread the concept of synthetic biology around the world and the name of iGEM to be far-famed. Furthermore, we also asked SZU China to try out our Parabase.

Table 1. Translation rates, as computed with the Penn State University RBS calculator, using the MIT 2006 BioBrick ( BBa_J45700 ).
When MIT produced their MeS brick BBa_J45700 in 2006, it was meant to convert salicylate to methylsalicylate and produce a wintergreen scent in the process. However, the scent could only be detected when salicylate was added to the medium, proving that the BSMT1 equation functions yet the PchA and PchB equations may not function. Initially, it was thought that the RBS problems discussed above could be the cause but we could show this is most likely not the case : we entered the MIT brick sequence in the operon specific tool and obtained satisfactory data. Thus, at least in silico the pchBA operon could function, suggesting the lack of salicylate is caused by a different reason. For further elaboration on this topic we refer you to the methyl salicylate wetlab page .
Protein degradation:
The perceived degradation rate results not only from the breakdown of proteins, but also from the dilution due to cell growth. Every cell cycle the proteins are divided amongst the two resulting cells and the amount is thus effectively divided by two. We will look into both to conclude which effect dominates and what ranges are possible.
The breakdown part of the degradation of proteins is highly dependent on the presence of a degradation signal, called degron. These degrons could be hidden in a folded protein and could become exposed for example after a stress reaction (Dougan et al., 2010). One of the most characterized and important degrons is called the N-degron, which is a destabilizing N-terminal residue. With this information, the laboratory of Varshavsky has created the N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (Varshavsky, 1997).
The N-end rule is applicable to a wide range of organisms ranging from E. coli to plants and mammals (Dougan et al., 201"

The meeting ended on a positive note, with much interest sparked in synthetic biology solutions, followed up with requests from Telos to share our results, which we did.
C. TELOS and SWAN LEGEND Outreach, September 16
Marissa and Adriel Sumathipala made a brief presentation before John Wood and Lisa Kimball of Telos, and Fred Schaufeld, Founder of Swan Legend, a venture capitalist firm, about our iGEM project, rapidly covering the content of our project; problem, solution, results, and future work. As supporters of technology and community, they were interested in what we were doing and after that meeting generously agreed to fund our trip to the Jamboree!!! Thank you Telos and Swan Legend, we are so grateful to your community support. Through our iGEM project, we have informed business leaders of our community about synthetic biology, and created greater awareness of youth initiatives like our iGEM team’s vision to turn science into solving problems and useful products.
Telos and Swan Legend extended their community support by taking us over to Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm Research Campus to meet very briefly with Director Dr. Gerald Rubin, where we got to speak briefly of our iGEM and other research.
CONCLUSIONS
Through our synthetic biology solution to the starch problem in Armstrong’s plants, we have the potential to impact way beyond our Broad Run High school and local community, Virginia, Maryland, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but also to impact people in many nations where Armstrong has its plants.
In conclusion, from our own team’s composition uniquely made up of students from different states and school districts, to our educational outreach to students at middle and high school, and the penetration we have made into the business community by presenting synthetic biology as a viable solution, we have definitely educated our peers and the public, and raised their awareness of synthetic biology, iGEM, and science as a realistic and rewarding strategy for tackling world problems."

XMU-China,2016,Team:XMU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"I can inhibit the Pr promoter [3]. The lysis consists of Pr promoter and lysis gene ( BBa_K112806 ).
When the concentration of AHL around the engineered bacteria in a low level, AHL cannot be sensed by the Lux sensor part, so the responder and lacI-1 gene is inactivated, and the regulatory lacI+pL is able to stay an activated mode. It leads an expression of cI at its wild-type level, which inhibits the lysis gene. However, when the AHL molecules reaches a certain concentration, AHL can be sensed by the sensor part, then regulatory lacI+pL promoter will be activated for the expression of responder and lacI-1 [5]. The products of the lacI-1 inhibit the regulatory lacI+pL promoter so the expression of cI is inhibited. As a result, inhibition of Pr promoter will be relieved [6]and lacI-2 and lysis gene can express. The product of lacI-2 can further repress cI, and the products of lysis gene make the cell cracked.
Lysis
Our lysis consists of a Pr promoter ( BBa_R0051 ) and a lysis gene ( BBa_K112806 ), this gene can express T4 endolysin lysozyme from enterobacteria phage T4 degrades peptidoglycan layer. Endolysins are proteins which can help the phage through the bacterial cell. The endolysins can cause lysis by degrading the peptidoglycan, which is a necessary substance for the cell wall [7].
When the pathogens reach a certain concentration, the sensor part responds to their signaling molecules and start the transcription of the M13K07 packaging. Then the toggle switch transforms from the ""ON"" state to the ""OFF"" state. This transformation needs some time, so enough time can be left for the M13 phages to be synthesized. When the switch is in the ""OFF"" state, the repression of lysis will be relieved. The M13 phages packaged and the cell of the engineered bacterium begins to fracture, then the M13 phage can be released to kill the target bacteria.
Figure 7. The lysis gene which can express a lysozyme called T4 endolysin.
The following picture shows how our gene network senses the signaling molecules AHL and finally releases the M13 phagemid containing sRNA cassettes in the programmable bacterium.

The now unprotected ε-amino group of the lysine was coupled twice with 5-fold excess to HBTU activated carboxyfluorescein, whereas the second coupling occurred overnight. After extensive washing and deprotection of the α-amino group, the resin was transferred into a peptide synthesis automat and processed over two days. Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Met-OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH and Fmoc-Ahx-OH were used for this purpose. Additionally added N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to the solvents increased the solubility of the amino acids and prevented precipitation in the machine.
The processed product was cleaved from the resin and unprotected from their side chain protection groups using a cleavage solution consisting of 670 mg of phenol, 450 μl of water, 450 μl of triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) and 9 ml of TFA. The resulting peptides were precipitated in cold diethyl ether and lyophilized overnight. Purification was executed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the resulting product was checked by mass spectroscopy using electron electrospray ionization (ESI).

Safety of our project
We have described above the relevant security measures taken all through the summer to minimize the risks of incident in the lab. But when working in the field of synthetic biology, one of the main concerns is the dissemination of our engineered strain, which could be a threat to the general public and the environment.
First of all, we decided to work with the E. Coli chassis, since its genome is very well characterized and it was well adapted to the molecules we wanted to produce. Of course the strain we chose to work with was non-pathogenic. Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the acids doses produced  are harmless for humans).
The main threat is thus the dissemination of our bacteria in the external environment where its DNA or RNA would be in contact with microorganisms present in the external environment.
To minimize this risk, all our waste is autoclaved before being specifically disposed of and the French regulation does not allow any genetically modified microorganisms to be taken outside the lab. For example, if we would like to test our device on an actual hive, it would be by using the chemicals alone, and not the strain that produces them.
But since regulations are different around the world, and to have a complete overview of our project, we decided to reflect on the biosafety issue, if our device were to be put in place on hives.
We first thought about addressing the containment issue through physical means. In fact, the trap we designed is in itself a first barrier, preventing the engineered bacteria from being in contact with their environment (and particularly the bees). But that was not enough, and the second barrier was developed relying on Groeningen’s team work in 2012.
In fact, we reproduced their idea of packing our bacteria in a small bag made of a special plastic called TPX®, by Mitsui Chemicals. This special material is actually microporous, which means it will let gases such as oxygen or formic and butyric acid pass through while the bacteria stay inside the bag. You can see here the sterility tests we realized. You can learn more about this in the video below.
Apart from this physical containment, we were also thinking of adding to our system an auxotrophy to a specific nutriment not found in the natural environment. In this case, bacteria directly died if they are in contact with the external environment.
Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag"

A suicide system depending on time is also designed for bio-safety concerns. E.coli Prometheus will deliver Mo directly to the root. This opens a new chapter of biological fertilizer.
Wiki Design
Art design, pictures, figures and the latest experiment results were put on the wiki, an important platform to show our works.
ModA & INPN
ModA we use in our project can bind the molybdate, and INPN can display ModA on E.coli surface.
Chemotaxis
We use McfR plasmid to give E.coli the capacity of Chemotaxis, so that those E.coli carrying molybdate can ""swim"" to the root of peanut.
Modeling
We have made a model of peanut roots and E.coli in surrounding environment to simulate our idea in soil.

Wat betreft de subprojecten kan dit van tijd tot tijd worden aangepast in de template (bijvoorbeeld als een subproject wordt afgerond en een nieuw wordt opgestart). We moeten natuurlijk wel weten welke subprojecten er zijn en hoe precies we hierin zijn in de template. - Antoine
Ik zou opdelen per projectfunctie, en hierin per deelproject (bv. de verschillende bricks die gaan gemaakt worden - eens iedereen het hierover eens is, kunnen we deze definiëren). Zo wordt het overzicht behouden. Waarschijnlijk niet echt haalbaar, maar enerzijds een kalender per deelproject, en anderzijds een kalender die het globale overzicht van het project geeft? Of bv. vertrekken vanaf het schema van onze constructie en als je dan op een 'brick' klinkt, dat je dan naar dat deelproject wordt doorverwezen? - Sigriddk
De template bestaat ( Tools , en dan New Day template), alleen ben ik nog een beetje onwetend over alle verschillende projectfuncties (voorlopig nog slechts Labwerk en Modellering). Wat betreft de kalender per deelproject, dat gaat een beetje moeilijk worden. Maar met de table of contents op elke notebook dag pagina zal dat niet veel uitmaken denk (als we de deelprojecten als subtitels zetten, dus tussen gelijkheidstekens), dan kan je simpelweg op het deelproject klikken in de inhoudstafel en je krijgt het meteen. Ondertussen zal ik wat meer ervaring proberen op te doen bij notebooks van voorgaande teams. - Antoine
Templates
Voor de templates verwacht ik nog een mail van Meagan van het IGEM team om gebruik te maken van de Template namespace waar we dan een folder KULeuven aanmaken... reden hierom is dat meta-informatie (templates/css files) niet wordt uitgevoerd onder de Team namespace. - Antoine

When looking at the expressed GFP per cell in Figure 2, it becomes apparent that both test device 2 and test device 4 had a high expression of GFP, outperforming that of the positive control after 4 hours. When comparing test device 2 and 5, it is clear that test device 2 has a higher expression of GFP, which could indicate that the BBa_B0034 RBS is stronger than the BBa_J364100 RBS. Test device 3 and test device 6 both had an expression of GFP similar to that of the negative control. Knowing that the BBa_J23117 promoter is relatively weak, this result was expected.

A “future” for Golden Rice?
Golden Rice radical yield- release on August 8, 2013
Like a tropical storm four hundred farmers and activists in the Philippine province of Camarines Sur in the Bicol peninsula uprooted genetically modified rice crops.  So that the processing sets aside in the moment. According to B. Autor (speaker and farmer from SIKWAL-GVO) this was a stern warning for those planning to GMO field trials in Bicol: “What we need is to tackle comprehensive and long-term solutions to hunger and malnutrition. Golden Rice and GMOs generally only worsen the already dire state of small and poor farmers. We call on the Ministry of Agriculture, immediately discontinue Golden Rice and other GMO field trials in the country. We do not want Golden Rice”. Another cause of the vandalism is that against the promise of no carry out of field trials of Golden Rice by the Philippine Rice Research Institute it happened. Other reasons for the vandalism were the fear of contamination their traditional indigenous rice varieties, financial losses based on exploding seed prices for GM crops and thus the increased profit for the agrochemical companies. The last argument shows the interplay between input traits as benefit for the producer (agrochemical companies)  versus the output traits as benefit for the consumers (poor population, farmers). Benefits for farmers but not directly to producers was the aim of the humanitarian treaty according to Protykus. This action of vandalism shows that in reality the interplay plays a major role.  V. Shiva ( Indian environmentalist) called the Golden Rice Project as an “Trojan horse” whose purpose was to win public support for all manner of GM- crops that would benefit multinational agrochemical corporations at the burden of poor farmers and consumers.   Due to this vandalism the Philippine government has given a new dimension resulting to allow the Golden Rice annex. Supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation resulting to the final testing of GM crops in Africa (sub-Saharan) will develop other genetically modified crops: Golden Banana for VAD, a pest-resistant black-eyed pea, cassava that"

The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.

Fig.9 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.9 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 mins,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 mins, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5 mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.
Codon optimization of roGFP2-Orp1
Determinate the DTT concentration making                         roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5 mM, 3 mM and 5 mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Fig.10 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (After Codon Optimization)
Fig.11 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (Before Odon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after                         codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5mM DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Theoretical_-_-_TEXT.html," in E. coli however we have also added it to increase the production of PPIX and hence more chlorophyll a. This precursor produces the colourless intermediate protoporphyrinogen IX (PPIX) where the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway branches dependent on the binding of either iron to form heme involved in electron transfer for oxygen transport, or magnesium to form chlorophyll. E. coli naturally produce heme, this means they also produce ALA, however we will be supplementing this substrate to allow optimum yields of chlorophyll a.  This pathway incorporates a magnesium cofactor with magnesium chelatase. The compound is then reduced by protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase to form a chlorin. The final step involves esterification of the alcohol phytol by chlorophyll synthase onto the remaining sidechain of chlorophyllide a, forming chlorophyll a. This year we have produced 3 models, the first reveals the amount of time required for the transformation of all ALA to the final product chlorophyll a.
The second model breaks down this pathway, showing the time required for the transformation of all ALA to form MgPPIXmonomethylester, the second last substrate in the pathway before the production of chlorophyll.
The third and final model produced from this years team followed the formation of MgPPIXmonomethylester from PPIX to see which enzymes are important for the speed of reaction.

Model 1
Chlorophyll a Theoretical Yield.
The yield of Chlorophyll a, and furthermore hydrogen, is dependent on the amount of PPIX supplied to the pathway, dependent on the concentration of ALA. ALA→ PPIX was previously modelled by the 2015 Mq iGem team. We have furthered their model to show the formation and depletion of substrates to produce chlorophyll a. We modelled this pathway using MATLAB to determine the highest yields of chlorophyll a we can achieve using E. coli as the expression host. Our model shows that if we input all necessary enzymes for the Chlorophyll a pathway"

Shijie Gu is biology lover, willing to explore as much as he can before settling on one specific topic. This year, he joined iGEM at ShanghaiTech as his first try in bioengineering. Although this summer was the first long-period lab commitment for him, he nevertheless quickly absorbed different styles in lab and developed a style of his own. His open as well as a little pushy predisposition also let him bring in different ideas to the host lab of our project, and was regarded as an interesting…funny one. His contribution of the project mainly consists of the cloning of the biofilm section. In addition, his interests in art has greatly contributed to the iGEM project as well, from logo designing to video making"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," or interact with proteins making this an ideal solution. On further research, we came across an engineered analogue of hirudin called bivalirudin. Bivalirudin is a bivalent, high-affinity, reversible inhibitor of thrombin;it binds to both the active site and exosite 1. It is 20 amino acids long, as opposed to hirudin which is 65 amino acids long, and has similar kinetic properties. Approximately 0.5 nM of bivalirudin is needed to prevent clotting in blood. For a more detailed discussion on how blood clotting was accounted for in modelling, see the DNA Based Model page .
We initially considered encoding the anticoagulant in our DNA-based system and expressing it in response to the protease. Our modelling, however, informed us that this method would not provide sufficent anticoagulant fast enough to inhibit clotting. For more details, see the modelling page . We therefore decided to use a sterically inhibited version of bivalirudin in both our systems (DNA- and protein-based). Due to the small size of bivalirudin and the extensive contacts between its termini and hirudin, we should be able to engineer a suitable peptide.
Interaction between Bivalirudin (red) and Thrombin (green) (pdb: 3VXE)
Our solution is to sterically inhibit the anticoagulant by attaching a TEV protease cleavage site and, if necessary, additional large domains domains onto the termini. We believe bivalirudin will provide a more chemically and economically feasible solution due to its smaller size: hirudin with attached TEV cleavage site/sterically hindering domains exceeds  the size limit of peptides which can be synthesised chemically. Please visit the applied design page for more details on our cell-free systems, including how our output would work in practice and the physical device.

Figure 3: The RFP reporter system
The reporter system which we initially intended to use was a cAMP/CAP-dependent transcription of the gene encoding Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). On the target plasmid, transcription of RFP was controlled by the cAMP/CAP-sensitive promoter PcstA (BBa_K118011) . In this reporter system protein-protein interactions would result in expression of red fluorescence.

Bacteria with this reporter system would become blue when the two proteins are able to interact with each other.

For pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI, we also have positive results for the negative control. Here it's unlikely that it can be because of the template plasmid for the PCR, because be used the repressilator that has ampicillin resistance when the plates contained kanamycin. We'll see tomorrow the results of the sequencing of colony 7.
Preparing for the next Gibson assemblies, Nadine also ran two PCRs:
One for amplifying the lysis cassette and putting it into J61002 backbone (with a new primer)
One for amplifying LacI and put it into J61002 Plac-RFP or Plac-lysis, once we'll have them.
Vincent mini-prepped the liquid cultures of the original K1-T7-Lys plasmids that had been (unknowingly) successful on Saturday. He then transformed these into BL21 cells and plated them. The C5-lys plasmid liquid cultures did not grow because Vincent had accidentally used gentamycin instead of chloramphenicol in his liquid cultures. He re-did the C5 cultures.
Vincent also ran a new set of 18 T7-Lys promoter variants using Extension PCR. Because we were running out of Hifi+ enzyme, we used only half of the enzyme requirement (9 uL instead of 18).
Apparently, 14 through 17 were amplified correctly.
Lilia made a PCR with the primers containing biobrick extentions (prefix and sufix) on the linear templates of the muTetRs.

The sequencing results of the pSB3K1 TetR-LacI plasmid came. It seems that LacI got insterted correctly, but that TetR got lost... We'll try to send this plasmid again for sequencing with another primer to be sure. Also, a new Gibson assembly has been done. For the J61002 Plac-RFP plasmid, Nadine  forgot the cell cultures on the bench so the sequencing will have to wait over the week-end. Here again, a new Gibson assembly has been done, along with J61002-lysis.
Vincent made liquid cultures from the successful transformation of the K1-T7-Lysis into BL21 cells. Nadine was kind enough to purify all 18 of Vincent's T7-RFP variants, as well as the 4 T7-Lysis variants. In the same spirit, the C5"

Conclusion
Synthetic biology can become a very powerful tool if it remains under control. Risks exist, of course, but we have to be aware of these risks causes, and the finality of taking them. It is without doubt the scientific community to make the community accept this idea, by transmitting the knowledge. Some problems, such as various diseases, seem also to be resolved through it. But the sought interests are those of the entire society, and not particular groups. It might be beneficial to put quickly in place a regulation to avoid abuses, without limiting the development of this promising science
Survey
Today everything is patented or patentable, and worse it is possible to patent in simple concepts that have not been applied. Thus the purchase, exchange, submission and management of the patents bank of a company is a real business activity and it can be really profitable. Patent an invention, a concept or a brand is there real consequences on the daily progress? That is what we asked Sup'Biotech students and non scientists to respond.
32% believe that patents represent a barrier to innovation, while 43% disagreed. The opinion seems pretty divided, which is quite surprising because in theory the patent is a tool for encouraging innovation. Indeed, the temporary monopoly allows to finance investment in R & D. However, in practice the patent appears as a secondary tool, some people do not even have little confidence, while others do not hesitate to follow the example of the law fragmentation when innovations are cumulative and / or complementary as computing, biotechnology or electronics.
Do you think that patents slow innovation?
As part of a therapeutic application, we may wonder if we can patent a living thing, giving it a value? This is the question that is facing synthetic biology.
Do you think an organism created by synthetic biology should be patented?
Like other technologies, synthetic biology would  show us  a new era, of ""Biolithic"", where the living is becoming the instrument. A tool that could be greatly promising to cure many diseases. But what is the therapeutic goal legislates she use? Synthetic biology thus challenges our life conception. Where is the boundary between natural and artificial? Can"

then, using the definition of the visual contrast C(x), we get:
assuming that the background light is homogeneous (i.e IB(x) = IB) we get a simple relation for the contrast:
It is possible then to define a visual threshold for the contrast, from which we can infer the minimum concentration of GFP needed to make the diagnosis visible, calculated from the relation:
where the values of Phi and epsilon can be extracted from the literature. For the Green Fluorescent Protein we have Phi = 0.79 and  epsilon = 55 000  M^-1 cm^-1.
Estimating the minimal GFP concentration
To estimate the value of [GFP]min, it is necessary to make a last assumption, concerning the value of A = A. Following the prescription given by the 2013-USP-Brazil team , we consider A = A, i.e homogeneous and constant. We will assume that half the light is absorbed by the surrounding air, meaning A = 0.5, this estimate is rather pessimistic, given that air opacity for visible light is around 10%. We also have to determine the distance of the observer, we consider that 1 meter is enough to give a good rough estimate. We then have:
which give us [GFP]min = 6.55 x 10^-5 M. In possession of this value, it is possible to construct a phase diagram, where we can determine whether or not our system will be visible in terms of the concentrations [IPTG] and [ComE*]. This conditions for the diagnosis to be possible are:
For the first case
For the second case:
where the values of [LasR]eq and [QteE]eq can be calculated in terms of the initial values of [ComE*] and [IPTG].

Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow : an ethical future for SynBio ?
The iGEM competition is an important showcase for the emergence of Synthetic biology, as well for scientist and non-scientist people. But, as a new unknown activity, especially a scientific one, SynBio brings interrogations:
Is it dangerous? Are there some risks? How can it help our future? What are the challenges?
Medias and Public speak about Synbio
In order to see how much people know about Synbio, Eleonore Pauwels, a research scholar working in the foresight and governance project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington D.C., has made a public investigation for the “Ethical Aspects of Synthetic Biology” round-table, organized by the European Union in 2009. It appears that Synbio just begins to be an integrative process.
The first way to introduce Synbio to society is the newspapers. During the last few years, the number of articles published in the press has been increasing. Especially in Europe: more than 100 articles have been published in five years, whereas about 50 in the USA. In Europe, France and the United Kingdom are the leaders.
However, they have a different approach to Synbio. The US articles refer more about benefits of Synbio, and the topics are focused on Energy and Health. The European vision is more cautious: they  focus on the ratio benefits/risks, in the environment and energetic domains. And these differences get bigger concerning the type of risks. American Medias just focus on the biosecurity, while European ones write about biosafety, biosecurity and ethics.
Optimistic US vs Precautionnary Europe
Biosecurity vs Biosafety?
""Public Perception and the Media: the Case of Synthetic Biology"",Eleonore PAUWELS
Even if newspapers are trying to make Synbio more popular, focusing on potential applications closed to people's concerns, this subject doesn’t seem to interest them. According to an investigation realized in the US, more than 70% of"

There is no physical problem of using human protein in yeast. And has more possibility to do our pathway. Therefore, we use Yeast instead of E. coli.
Biochemical Receptors
  The upper table represents classification of all biological receptors. First of all, since our genetically engineered machine has to detect on mycobacteria directly, we should select cell surface receptors. Next, we should consider using fusion-antibody-receptors. We used gene combination simply (add antibody to biological receptor without original receipt part). If the receptor has conformational change property when it accepts input signal, we guess that our fusion antibody receptor cannot operate well because antibodies characteristics (antigen size, antibody size, etc.) are different. They don’t have special receipt part in a whole receptor, of course, so whole receptor is important receipt part; we cannot create fusion-antibody-receptor with this protein anyway. Therefore, we choose ‘Dimerization’ receptor. Most of these receptors have Immunoglobulin-like receptor part which can be alternated by antibodies easily. Also, since biosensors should activate gene expression, we selected gene-regulation related receptors.
  Finally we choose cytokine receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Among them, interleukin-6 alpha receptor was selected.
Fusion Antibody Receptors
  The Fusion Antibody-Receptor is a protein which receptor genetically combines with a specific antibody. The following figures show what the fusion antibody-receptor is for details.
  The fusion antibody-receptor is designed by simple gene modification. We altered the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen detectable antibody single chain instead of the cytokine receptor’s antigen acceptable part (Immunoglobulin-like parts). Light chain part of the antibody – Linker – Heavy chain part of antibody is enough. (There are some evidences to success making fusion antibody-receptor with this method in some experiments. [4]) Then in order to express the receptor on cell surface membrane of Yeast, we change the original signal peptide to Omp(Outer membrane protein) signal peptide of Yeast. Surely the receptor should satisfy our standard for biosensor.

BOKU-Vienna,2017,Team:BOKU-Vienna#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Turan et al.25. However, extended FRT sites needed for efficient recombination are palindromic and form stable hairpins possibly acting as transcription (or reverse transcription) terminators. To evaluate this potential problem we determined the bidirectional termination efficiency of extended FRT sites using the classic terminator strength assay .
Does it work? Find a rigorous proof
In the early phase of development the mutation rates achieved might be very low as the full D.I.V.E.R.T. cycle will rarely be completed. Hence, using mutation frequency as an indicator or test on whether the system works might be problematic. Crook et al.11 solved this problem by using a very elegant and rigorous proof of concept assay (Figure 1, b) that was inspired by a test on recombination frequency of the Ty1 element27. Basically, they chose a selectable marker as cargo (i.e. GOI) that was inserted into the retrotransposon in reverse orientation. The GOI was disrupted by an intron which again was reversely oriented with respect to the cargo (i.e. oriented in the retrotransposon’s sense direction). Hence, upon transcription of the cargo the mRNA would contain the reverse complement of the intron which would not be spliced leading to nonfunctional protein. Upon transcription of the retroelement, however, the intron would end up in the right orientation and going to be spliced. After reverse transcription and reintegration the intron would not be present in the new version of the retroelement leading to functional protein and selectable cells.
For our D.I.V.E.R.T. experiments we used a similar concept, details can be found in the experiments section .
Single gene copy for optimal selection – we need to integrate!
As mentioned before, an efficient selection process relies on only one copy of the GOI being present in every cell. Hence, the D.I.V.E.R.T. construct needs to be genomically integrated into the host genome. Homologous recombination in E. coli (usually conferred by the phage-derived lambda Red system 28–30) is an inefficient process making the application of (mostly antibiotic) selection markers necessary (efficiencies lie between 10-3 and 10-4 30). Living in the age of CRISPR/Cas9 we planned on utilizing this technique by selecting recombinants as was done in a number of recent papers31–33. Unfortunately, only the Cas9 gene was in stock in the iGEM registry at the beginning of our planning phase and no ready-to-use Cas9 or sgRNA plasmids were available for us via"
