Other BioBricks identified"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," also saw that several labs have a little kitchen in it. In one lab, the ""kitchen"" is just located beside the experiment bench.
The situation in few labs: the kitchen is really close to the experiment area. The experiment bench is on the left of the shelf while the kitchen is on the right.
Cross analysis: How long have you been working in the lab?
A. Less than 1 year.
B. 1-2 years.
C. 3 years or above.
From this analysis, we could approximately infer that the students would have meal in lab more frequently as they work in the lab for longer time. First, they might become busier and busier. Students are under more and more pressure gradually so they have to spend more time in the lab. Second, they are used to the working environment. As a newcomer, they are vigilant about the dangerous factors. When they are used to the lab, they gradually lower their guard.
Q3. How do you spend weekends and holidays?
A. I spend almost all my time in lab.
B. I often give up my spare time to study in lab.
C. I sometimes give up my spare time to study in lab.
D. I never give up my spare time to study in lab.
E. Other situation please specify
Q4 Approximately how many hours do you spend in lab on weekdays?
Average=10
Max=15
Through Q3 and Q4, we could see that students tend to spend most of their time in the lab nearly every day. Many of them work more than 8 hours a day and give up their spare time. In fact, most of them told us that they lack exercise. Though they are encouraged to be hard-working, this habit will show negative influence on their health gradually.
Q5. How do you treat organic waste in your lab?
A. We directly pour them into sewer.
B. We collect them in a special waste liquor bucket.
C. We collect them in a special waste liquor bucket for further treatment.
D. Other situation please specify
Most labs do well when they treat the waste liquor. Most labs have special liquor buckets and use them correctly. Some special labs deal with the waste liquor with the help of specialized companies.
Some labs collect waste liquid in a special bucket for further treatment.
Q6. How do you treat contaminated wastes in your lab?
A. We discard them into a special biological waste bag.
B. We directly discard them after sterilization.
C. We collect them for further treatment without sterilization.
D. We collect them for further treatment after sterilization.

Hello, dear reader!!! Welcome to September!! Today we had to think a lot and a lot to do!
Today we had the final result from the test using medium LM (LB + Mercury chloride) 20ug/ml made on 29/08/2014 . The result after 3 days of incubation at 37°C in medium LM 20ug/ml:
DH5α with our construction BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
Our hypothesis is that the constructions BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004 made for bio detection and accumulation, respectively, don’t present the main protein to resist mercury: MerA (Mercury redutase present on biobrick BB_Bioremediation). This means that the bacteria easily dies in mercury’s presence. We developed a strategy to solve this problem!
Our strategy is to analyze the growth profile of DH5α in several mercury concentrations, aiming to know the concentration that won’t harm DH5α, but will still activate our promoter regulated by Hg. Today we prepared the concentrations and the strategies!
At the same time, the tests and improvements on mediums were made. Today we transformed in JM110 the biobricks BBa_K516030 (mRFP protein generator TERM+ RBS+ B0030) and BBa_I712074 (strong promoter from T7 bacteriophage). We will also produce a bio sensor with mRFP to be able to see it at naked eye, and in the other construction, a super expression of K346004, the metal binding peptide, to transform this bacteria into a super accumulator! :D

Final step was prefix insertion of BBa_J00450 the original constructs.
In every steps of works, we only confirmed the insertion by colony selection in appropriate antibiotics containing LB agar plate, and purification of backbone plasmid for insertion by gel electrophoresis to completely separated small insert fragments. Thus in theory there will be no self-ligation. However for either prefix or suffix inserts, the digested samples were not purified, instead used directly for ligation reaction.
Below some representative gel electrophoresis data were shown.

Sheffield meet up
The Oxford iGEM team attended the meet up organised by the team at the University of Sheffield on Friday the 18th of July. The purpose of this visit was to continue building the relationships between teams that were started at the Oxford-based meet up last month. The team gave a short presentation on the project so far.
Team members give talk at Royal Society
Team members Glen Gowers and Philipp Lorenz attended the 2014 London Biochemistry Alumni Event hosted at the Royal Society. The occasion attracted alumni from across a period of more than 50 years – bringing together those who completed their PhDs in the 1950s, with students graduating last year. Following an introduction by Head of Department Mark Sansom, two Royal Institution Christmas Lecturers and our iGEM team members entertained guests with their presentations.

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Design#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"be T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), the sgRNA was produced and purified at last.We specially thank ZHAO Xuejin (Research Assistant, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for providing us with the sgRNA Generator!
Figure 16. Schematic of sgRNA Generator backbone, containing T7 promotor, lacZa’, crRNA(tracrRNA) and T7 terminator.
Testing PC Reporter system
We invented a new protocol for testing our PC Reporter system (Figure 17).
Figure 17. Flow chart for testing PC Reporter system. Since one dCas9 fusion protein would form a complex with a pair of sgRNAs simultaneously, which will decrease the complementation of Nluc and Cluc, we incubated two split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes separately at 25°C for 10 min. After adding target DNA into the mixture of two complexes and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, they simultaneously bind to two adjacent half-sites on target DNA, bringing Nluc and Cluc into close proximity, thus leading to recovery of its enzymatic activity. Then transfer the mixture to 96-well plates before adding Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) and promoptly measure the luminescence in Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific).
High-throughput array detection assay
Based on the results we acquired, single-site target detection presents relatively high specificity and sensitivity. However, taking strain mutations, sample differences and other environmental factors in clinical practices into consideration, we set an array (Figure 18) to detect multiple target sites (markers) of MTB to make our PC reporter quantitatively reliable.
Figure 18. The 96-well plate layout in array detection assay. 9 fragments (F1-F9) screened out by SSPD from MTB genome were set in each line, and 8 MTB markers (M1-M8) in each fragment were respectively set in each sample pool. In total 8*9=72 markers were detected in one single assay. For each fragment, P9 meant a negative control with a mismatch sgRNA pair added. Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control strain (E. coli) as experimental subjects respectively.

The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the third year that I have worked with iGEM but different from the past two years I am not an adviser, and the project is less about the bio and all about the business. It is has been a great experience for me to see the world from this perspective and I look forward to a future in research and development of a product I had a part in creating. The rest of my team and I hope that this is the launchpad for a successful business and we are excited about this opportunity to present our plan in this competition.

Introduction
Our aim with these tools is to assist the user with primer design for coding and non coding Biobricks. In order to achieve this we chose two slightly different approaches for designing coding and noncoding Biobricks. While only one input sequence is needed in order to design a coding biobrick we chose to use flanking regions of the sequence of a non doding biobrick. The reason herefor is that using flanking regions of a non coding sequence which is supposed to be amplified enables the possibility to create a broad range of primers which meet the necessary criteria for a working primer.
Hence we created Adjacent Regions and Design Primers.
Adjacent Regions finds upstream and downstream sequences of the desired target sequence which can be used for the design of non coding Biobricks. Besides the source genome of the to be amplified biobrick the user has the option to choose cutoff rates for the downstream region as well as the upstream region.
Click here to use Adjacent Regions.
Using these upstream and downstream sequences the user can design primers for non coding Biobricks with Design Primers.
Click here to use Design Primers.
Design Primers is also able to design primers for coding sequences. Here the only needed input is the coding sequence of the Biobrick. Design Primers also has a number of options:
The length of the annealing region of the primers.
The Biobrick standard.
You can choose between the ""Classic"" Biobrick standard and the ""Freiburg"" standard.
Whether to check for enzyme restriction sites in the input sequence or not.
You can choose between all known restriction sites, only those used in the two Biobrick standards or none at all.
For coding sequences Design Primers varies the primer length between 15 und 35 bp and names only those potential primers which and with a G/C on the 3' end.
For non coding sequences Design Primers uses the by the user set primer length and finds all possible primers within the upstream and downstream regions. It checks every primer for selfannealing and uses"
XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#wetlabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," curve seemed to be normal, but the dry weight and OD values were not showing an  obvious linear relationship. Through analysis, we considered the error might be  brought in the drying process. We didn't have all samples drying for an  equivalent period of time.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. Cause we had analysis RBS0.6, RBS0.3, RBS0.07 and  luxI-TT yesterday and the result for ligation was good, we extracted gel and  did the ligation.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel for next day as well.RBS0.01 and luxR-TT was right.
Design:
We met  for uniform design and got preliminary schemes.
 
Saturday,  August 11th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Continue  the construction, Isolation, digestion and ligation. Also made 8 tubes of  competence BL21.
Cell Immobilization:
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.
PcI-RLT  beads emitted fluorescence in CaCl2 solution.
Prepared  NaCS solution (0.7706g in 15mL deionized water) and tested its concentration.
Result:  The concentration was too low so that the spheroidic membranes were easily torn.  So we decided to dissolve more NaCS.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT, RBS1.0-luxI-TT, and do the ligaion of  RBS1.0-luxR-TT again.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel, RBS1.0 was correct but little. LuxR-TT and luxpR2M19  were correct. The target gene of luxI-TT was too little to be seen, we did not  extract it.
The  transformation of RBS1.0-luxI-TT was failed but luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT was correct.
Design:
We  finished the first draft.
Sunday,  August 12th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Today  went smoothly, except for the plates of the previous day. We cannot figure out  why no colonies could be observed"

THE PROCESS
The main objective of our project is to accomplish a verbal communication with our microorganisms. To do that, we need to establish the following process:
The input used is a voice signal (question), which will be collected by our voice recognizer.
The voice recognizer identifies the question and, through the program in charge of establishing the communication, its corresponding identifier is written in the                 assigned port of the arduino.
The software of the arduino reads the written identifier and, according to it, the corresponding port is selected, indicating the flourimeter which wavelength has                 to be emitted on the culture.  There are four possible questions (q), and each of them is associated to a different wavelength.
The fluorimeter emits light (BioInput), exciting the compound through optic filters.
Due to the excitation produced, the compound emits fluorescence (BioOutput), which is measured by the fluorimeter with a sensor.
This fluorescence corresponds to one of the four possible answers (r: response).
The program of the arduino identifies the answer and writes its identifier in the corresponding port.
The communication program reads the identifier of the answer from the port.
""Espeak"" emits the answer via a voice signal (Output).
You can see an explicative animation of this process here:
In the following sections we analyse in detail the main elements used in the process:
Voice recognizer
Arduino
Fluorimeter

Happy 4th of July!
Happy 4th of July!!  This flag was streaked out this summer using intermediate constructs created throughout the course of our project. We used wild type E. coli (white), pSB1C3 expressing a dsRed derivative (red), and an AmilCP (blue) expressing part we constructed from the chromoprotein submitted by the 2011 Uppsala team.

ABOUT PhagED
The threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria is a pressing issue which must be addressed. It is difficult and expensive to develop new antibiotics, so our project is designed to make currently available antibiotics useful again. Our aim is to create       a toolkit to re-sensitise pathogens to antibiotics using CRISPR and a two-phage system, based on work by Yosef et al. (2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1500107112). An engineered lysogenic phage will transfer a CRISPR       system to its host bacterium, designed to cleave resistance genes and also confer protection from an engineered lytic phage. When this lytic phage is added to the population, it kills any bacteria that have not been successfully re-sensitised. We       chose to target genes found in the highly-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and worked with 4 different phages - P1, lambda, T4 and T7. Our system was modelled in silico and tested empirically on a specially designed E. coli testing platform.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae. We decided to codon optimize and synthesize these genes to clone into a common E. coli expression vector pET29b+. A nucleotide alignment showing the codon optimizations to Bba_K771303 is shown below.
We screened each enzyme based on three criteria:
The enzymes had to over-express well in E. coli,
They had to have activity at the nanomolar level,
And they had to be inhibited by nanomolar levels of triclosan, the concentration leaving wastewater plants [18]
1. Overexpression:
Protein purity assessed through SDS-PAGE gels shown below:
Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically from absorbance at 280 nm (A280). A280 readings converted enzyme concentration to mg/ml. The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme’s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme’s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/  Extinction Coefficients used:
influenzae 17,420
falciparum 46,885
protothecoides 34,380
tricornutum 37,360
coli 15,930
B. pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.
2. Enzyme Activity Screening:
Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA. Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute. Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay. Each enzyme was assayed with 100 uM NADH and 100 uM crotonyl-CoA. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, no enzyme. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale. Two biological replicates of each enzyme was used.
S. aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12]. We later found out we didn’t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent! Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night"

Primers were designed for making BioBricks out of the separate genes from  the nisin operon. For this, the sequence of the transposon Tn5307 was used, a transposon that contains the nisin operon, and of  which the sequence is known.1 This sequence is close to the sequence of the transposon Tn5276, the transposon which will form the template for making the new BioBricks. The primers for making a BioBrick out of PNisI with a RBS were based on a sequence found in a research paper that documented the identification of this promoter.2
It was decided to combine the genes NisR and NisK as one BioBrick and NisF, NisE and NisG as one BioBrick, because these genes are related in function or work together.

I am a 17 year old student at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I am interested mainly in biological sciences and that is the main reason I chose to be in GenetiX. I really love this area of science and I believe iGem offers an amazingly wide range of experience to enjoy and learn from. Learning everyday not only from the project itself, but mostly from other team members has been one of the best rewards this experience has given me. I believe it is amazing how we are able to mix the practice of science with everything else the industry should involve at such a young age. We manage the project, as well as finances and important events. I especially appreciate those that allow contact with other people to inspire the great love and interest for science our team shares. GenetiX and iGem have given me great knowledge and experience, as well as a profound interest on our topic and the people involved.

Human Practices
I'm 17 years old, and I'm currently studying my third semester in Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus. I recently joined the Human Practices team in GenetiX because since middle school I have been very interested in chemistry and biology, it amazes me to study how we and everything that surrounds us behaves; plus I get to learn very interesting stuff, interact with many people and help others. But what I like most about GenetiX and the other iGem groups is that they actually do something, they make sure their projects are heard of, and change for good the world we live in. Often we hear how we are destroying our world, but come to think about how many people try to change that; that's why I think iGem and GenetiX are such a good opportunity, not just for us, but for all the people who want to improve things.

Overview
The improvement of function was focused on BioBrick
BBa_K2165004
built by iGEM16_Washington, which is a copper-induced promoter in S.cerevisiae. This promoter has been proved to be a good element for Cu ion’s detection with many different eukaryotes. We have also characterized this promoter with different copper concentrations and induction time.
However, this promoter is much longer than other Cu-induced promoter used in prokaryotes, since it adapts to much more complicated conditions in eukaryotes. We redesigned this promoter by deletion of some unrelated bases and kept the core sequence which control the main function of this promoter. After experimental verification, we got the new part (BBa_K2407000) .
On the other hand, we found this promoter has a leakage expression and its response range in S. cerevisiae is not as wide as what some previous team described. Under this condition, we used error-prone PCR to reduce the leakage expression and enlarge the response range. Finally we got new parts with less leakage expression and lager response ranges, and they are: (BBa_K2407013) , (BBa_K2407014) , (BBa_K2407015) , (BBa_K2407016) .
Functional Improvement
Redesign of CUP1 promoter
Transcription with CUP1 promoter is activated by sequence-specific transcription factors which bind to the CUP1 upstream activating sequence (CUP1 UAS). This sequence contains five binding sites for the Cu2+-dependent transcriptional activator ACE1/CUP2. The CUP1 UAS is necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust activation of this transcription.
First, based on the part (BBa_K2165004) provided by iGEM16_Washington, we read researches about this promoter and ensured the core part consisted of 5 ACE1 binding sites (UAS), 2 TATA boxes, and one initiation element. The complex of ACE1 and copper ions will bind the promoter, which causes the activation of CUP1 promoter with TATA boxes’ help. ACE1 complex’s binding directly increases the possibility for TBP (TATA-Box Binding Protein) to bind"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

6/1/2015 : Day 1
Today was the first day in the HCI lab! We had orientation this morning, and I met my teammates Sam and Vivien, today. I also met the other people who will be working in the HCI lab as well this summer. We also had lab orientation and learned more about the HCI lab and all the cool tech in the lab. Before we did anything concerning the multitouch screen, we read up and familiarized ourselves with the iGEM requirements for the community track. We read up on all the qualifications a team needs to get a Bronze, Silver, and Gold medal.  We also explored around the iGEM website for a bit.  After that, we downloaded Cornerstone SDK, a software development kit that is used to create applications for multitouch screens. One thing we noticed was that C++ was the most common language that is used, and we had decided to use Javascript.  So we fiddled around with the few examples in Cornerstone that were in Javascript and used those examples as a baseline for our helloecoli app we were going to start working on this week.
6/2/2015: Day 2
Today we started working on our own application. We initially had randomly colored squares that when tapped on, they duplicated.  We changed the squares to circles which also when tapped on, duplicated. At this point, the circles were resizeable with the right hand gesture. The circles also went off the screen. Orit met with us to see what we had so far and gave us the suggestion to make the circles look more like e.coli. We decided to try to change the shape to an ellipse.
6/3/2015: Day 3
Today, we had guests from NYU come in to talk with the other PGHCI team.  Sam, Vivien, and I joined them, and they have a very informative talk about genetics. After the talk, we went back to playing around with our app. We changed the circles to ellipses. And when the ellipses consumed/ran into each other, the ellipse being consumed turned"

Week 10 notes
7/30/12
-Colonies grew, but we have to replate transformations because we lost colonies due to Colony PCR we weren't supposed to do. Ran a gel anyways; A BAND WORKED! (L1 - 3). Replated more L1, L2 Transformations to use for colony PCR tomorrow.
-Started two new digestions of pBAD miniprep from angela and another digestion of PUF PCR. Used newly bought nuclease free water for these reactions.
7/31/12
-Isiah ran a colony PCR and restreaked colonies on a gridded plate. Divya ran the gel; no bands showed. Talked to Dr. Jin about GCMS; have to regrow cultures in order to have enough samples for a standard curve. Restreaked two colonies from original transformation plates on a gridded plate, innoculated 2 colonies from Asha/Anthony's PUF-YFP/protet colony plates, transformed remaining ligation (L3) and streaked onto a separate plate, replated remaining L1/L2 transformations. Isiah made 5 K12 TB cultures.
-Talked to Kori as well as my graduate student about test expression of PUF. Finished test expression plan details. Received Arabinose from Kori.

This represents the CRISPR-Cas13a system being used to localise RNA in the nucleus, where the nucleus is set as the background of the game. The second part of the game involves a maze where the Cas13a system is GFP bound and is guided by the player to find the Endoplasmic Reticulum ready to be translated.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the consuming rate of that in TCA circle. The excessive acetyl coenzyme will convert into acetate and release to the outside. Inversely, the shortage of lactate leads the utilization of acetate which then maintains the metabolism by acetyl coenzyme formation.
③ Although both acetate and lactate can be used as carbon sources for Shewanella, acetate can restrain its growth. On the one hand, acetate will drop the acidity inside the cell, which, a step forward, can affect the activity of enzyme in vivo resulted in uncompetitive inhibition to cell growth. On the other hand, acetate can itself limit the growth by uncompetitive inhibition. In particular, the process of acetate metabolism and lactate metabolism are competing for acetyl coenzyme, which reduces the lactate utilization and influences cell growth. (Tang & Meadows, 2006)
④ The redox of mediator in the outer membrane is the rate-limiting step of electron transfer chain in Shewanella. TCA circle, an important pathway for the synthesis of energy and biomass , largely depends on the concentration of electron receptor at the end of electron transfer chain. When there is a deficiency of oxidized mediator, TCA circle will be inhibited, thereby, affect the whole process of metabolism as well as biomass increase.
According to the four assumptions above along with acetate uncompetitive inhibition and competitive inhibition, we decide to use multi-substrates Monod equation(Blanch & Clark, 1997) with two kinds of inhibition to demonstrate the relations between restrictive substrates and biomass increase rate. Considering that the accumulation of NADH will remarkably affect metabolic process under anaerobic conditions, we add a product factor in the Monod equation reflecting metabolites inhibition function.  μ
L
and μ
A
refers to the lactate and acetate biomass specific rate, respectively. We quantify the relations between specific rate of lactate/acetate and restrictive base concentration as following:
 
(7)
 
(8)
Biomass, lactate and acetate concentration can vary with time and its construction depends on kinetic model which is based on the general kinetics of the fermentation process model. Consumption of lactate and acetate can be both used for biomass increase and endogenous metabolism maintenance. However, considering the rarely energy losses caused by metabolism in vivo, we ignore the carbon consumption brought by metabolism. In this way, lactate can only be used for biomass increase and acetate production while acetate is merely used for biomass increase.

Abstract
Every year, one third of global food production -1.3 billion tons of food- is thrown away, partially due to the “best before” dating system.
iGEM Groningen 2012
seeks to provide an alternative method of assessing edibility: the
Food Warden
. It uses an
engineered strain
of Bacillus subtilis to detect and report volatiles in spoiling meat. The introduced
genetic construct
uses a promoter to trigger       a pigment coding gene. This promoter,
identified by microarray analysis
, is significantly upregulated in the presence of
volatiles from spoiling meat
. The activity of the
promoter
regulates the expression of the
pigment reporter
and will        be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable
capsule
, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows
germination and growth
, thereby activating the
spoiling-meat sensor
.
Completed after European Regionals
Tested a construct with downregulated promoter WapA
Performed enhanced construct characterization
Characterized the influence of oxygen on germination and growth within the sticker
Expanded the scope of the market survey
Collaborated with Cambridge 2012
Our main accomplishments
Hover your mouse over the pictures to see more!
1. We designed and tested the "" Sticker "": a capsule in which bacteria are kept inside and volatiles can go through. We used a model to get insight on how to tweak the growth of Bacillus subtilis.
2. We explored the definition of spoiled meat and ways to check meat spoilage. We identified various compounds present in spoiled meat.

iGEM EXPERIENCE
iGEM has become a well-recognized program throughout the University of Lethbridge. It is regarded as being very valuable by both faculty in the science departments and by people in other departments, such as management. iGEM has also been recognized by the President, Vice President Academic and Vice President of Research at the University. These individuals have been extremely supportive of our endeavours over the last few years.
Steve Craig, a member of the Faculty of Management, said “Entrepreneurial iGEM is an excellent opportunity for students to expand their educational experience to areas outside pure science.  Through this initiative students develop knowledge and skills in market research, project management, stakeholder analysis / communications, ethics and risk management (among others).”
iGEM has clearly given us the opportunity to learn skills that can be applied to areas outside scientific research, such as presentation skills, creativity and social awareness. And like Mr. Craig said, in the entrepreneurial stream, we learn how to adapt our skills to a business-focused project.
For many of the members of the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team, their first public presentation was at an iGEM Jamboree. Scientific presentations are not addressed in class until upper level courses are reached. We had to learn how to create and give an impactful presentation. We are all familiar with the scientific aspects of our project and are quite comfortable talking about them.
When we were required to give a business pitch presentation at the business plan competitions, we were somewhat less comfortable speaking about our project, as we had to address market size, financial statements, etc. At this point, we were still learning about these aspects of business, which posed challenges when it came to presenting about these topics. Due to past experience with iGEM, we already had developed the skills to give presentations and we were able to apply this to our new content. This experience made it much easier for us to do well in the business plan competitions.
The entrepreneurial stream of iGEM has given us the opportunity to explore the economic impact of synthetic biology. In previous iGEM projects"

★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Penn State iGEM 2010
This year, Penn State iGEM created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms(GMOs) in Agriculture.  The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a ""cell-death"" mechanism, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs.  For this survey, we decided we wanted to get a random sample of college-aged students from around the world.  All of the other iGEM teams were contacted and asked to participate in sending our survey to a group of random students from their respective schools.  In order to distribute the survey to their schools, the iGEM teams were asked to undergo training required by their school or country necessary to distribute surveys.  Of all of the teams, the University of British Columbia, Georgia Tech, Harvard, RMIT Australia, USTC and USTC Software, Uppsala University, The Citadel, and UCSF showed interest in helping us distribute our survey.  Unfortunately, mosts schools received few responses, with the University of British Columbia having one, Georgia Tech having none, Harvard four, USTC and USTC Software seven, Uppsala University none, The Citadel one, and UCSF nine. In addition, four were listed as other, which we believe were from UCSF.  We believe that they misunderstood our intentions of the survey and instead of distributing the survey to other members of their university, they took it themselves. RMIT Australia did receive permission from their ethics committee to distribute the survey to random students at their school and collected 191 responses for us.  Unfortunately, we were not able to gather their responses in time to include in our survey analysis, so we listed their results separately.  We really appreciative their cooperation and willingness to help and collaborate with us!  They did an amazing job!
Our results are presented as the Northern Hemisphere (comprised of mostly the United States) and the Southern Hemisphere (comprised of solely"

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#Policy and Practices#Scaling It Up_-_-_TEXT.html,"ounding up to a more common 5 liter bag size gives room for variances in the density of the granules and a more easily obtainable bag size. Shipping three 5-L bags per box necessitates a box of 15 liters minimum volume. This is 915.356 cubic inches which was rounded to 1000 cubic inches. Because a 10in x 10in x 10in box can be easily shipped anywhere in the world, this size was chosen to contain the three 5-L bags.
Field Use
The final Minecrobe product will be shipped out in a box containing three 10 lb bags. Since a 2.5 lb. bag of Milky Spore can treat a 10,000 sq. ft. area. Therefore, each 10 lb. bag of Minecrobe should be able to treat an estimated 40,000 sq. ft. or 0.913 acres. However, because B. subtilis is more active in the soil than Milky Spore, a 10 lb bag of Minecrobe likely will be able to treat a full acre. Thus, to disperse Minecrobe, a 10 lb. bag should be used per acre and spread as evenly as methods will allow. This is best done before rain or watering to dissolve the calcium lignosulfonate. Multiple applications may be considered to increase Minecrobe concentration, but the first application will be effective.

Goettingen,2015,Team:Goettingen#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," 2010. I completed my bachelor in 2014 with my main focus on molecular biology. The current Master study in Microbiology and Biochemistry (and the iGEM completion) is a great opportunity to gain new experiences in the lab and work with a group of students from all over the world.
Interesting fact:
I was raised bilingual, learning german and english at home. Apart from working in the lab I watch a lot of series and play videogames.

About you:
My name is Dennis Twesmann, I am from Germany and currently participating in the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in molecular biosciences there, too. During my bachelor thesis in the department of molecular structural biochemistry, I established a purification protocol for the spliceosomal DEAD box RNA helicase Prp28 from the thermophilic eukaryote Chaetomium thermophilum in order to investigate its structure by means of X-ray crystallography. The work in this field reflects my general interest in understanding the functions of enzymes on a molecular level as well as the underlying biological chemistry, done by these greatest chemists on earth. That is one of the reasons I joined the iGEM team 2015 pursuing a project where distinct enzymatic activities, brought together in a “Flexosome”, play a major role. So far, I inter alia helped to develop the booklet of our project in order to find sponsors and I am currently within the long-winded process of solving the practical implementation of our project in the lab.

About you:
Hi there, my name is Julian Schwanbeck. Originally from Hamburg, I obtained my bachelor’s degree here in the Georg-August Universität Göttingen in the field of Microbiology, mainly by failing to find a new trans-membrane transporter in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. I am also with the organisation committee. iGEM interested me mostly, as planning, organising and undertaking an own research project is something an ordinary masters student usually doesn’t get to experience. I am mostly interested in learning new methods as well as planning the experimental setup efficiently. During the weekends, I like to play with our dog in Hamburg.
Interesting fact:
I enjoy writing lab journal entries and repairing keyboards more than writing a short passage about myself.

Leicester,2015,Team:Leicester#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Ross) have gone back to their previous schools and talked about the iGEM competition and the team has been present at many of the University open days, and GENIE workshops for year nine students, talking about the competition and about how our project works.
Publicity
To ensure members of the public were aware of our project but also gain some funding to travel to Boston for the iGEM project. One way we did this was by doing cake sales during the University Open Days, we also had some of the team talk to their previous schools about our work as described in the Education section. We also publicized the work that we had done by talking the University of Leicester news team who kindly wrote about us on the News announcement page. As shown on the link:
Genetically modified bacteria to help combat muscle fatigue being developed by students
Furthermore we contacted Parkinson's UK to use their logo on our work as we think that our project could be something that could help with reducing muscle fatigue. We heard back from them and were given permission to use their logo. In addition our project supervisor Dr Badge will be doing an abseil to raise money for Parkinsons. A press release released by the University of Leicester for this is shown as:
Geneticist roped into abseiling challenge for charity
Collaboration
As well as creating our own survey, we wanted to understand about other projects done by iGEM teams and helping them with their surveys, we collaborated with a number of iGEM teams. This includes: Aix-Marseille iGEM team and worked with Team CGU_Taiwan and many other igem teams on a Global Co-operation survey the translated results for this are shown below:
In this survey you can see that most didn't know whether they would use GMOs
Like in the survey had shown the results for above it can be seen that surveyors thought the best way to understand synthetic biology was by teaching in schools but also a good number also thought that designing a leaflet was a good idea too.
Product Design
As part of our product design we created the logo, as such:
which shows our bacteria colonising (with the bundle forming pili) and also makes the bacteria look ‘friendly’ so that the public understand it is to help and not harm. This logo also uses the original iGEM logo and has Leicester in to show that it is iGEM team Leicester.
This logo was put onto our t-shirts (as seen below) which were worn on our sponsored walk:

We transformed out HSP+pACYC184 ligation with DH5alpha cells. We used 5uL of ligated plsamid and one tube of DH5alpha. We did this twice, once with the DH5alpha that we made (I) and once with the ones Dionne made (II). In order to test the two batches of DH5alpha compotent cells, we also used a control of PUC19 plasmid, so that we would be certain something would grow. The ""transformation"" protocol was followed, except that they were heat shocked for 50 seconds, instead of 40.   We then looked at the five plates that were streaked yesterday: control, UV shocked for 1 second, UV shocked for 5 seconds, UV shocked for 30 seconds, and UV shocked for 60 seconds. Looking on the UV light, it appeared that the 5 second one was significantly greener than the control. We took 500uL of PBS and added some cells for each of the three colonies for each of the five plates. This was vortexed, centrifuged, liquid was taken out, 500uL PBS added, and vortexed. Then, we put 200uL in the plate reader and measured fluorescence and concentration. Normalized fluorescence was calculated. See ""GFP Fluorescence Reading on the co-transformed plates #2"" for results.  We researched BioBrick/iGEM compatible plasmids so we can send these g-blocks in to the competition as our parts. See ""Biobrick Conversion Info for G-Blocks"" to see the plasmids that we can use instead of pBR322 and pACYC184, which can't be used for iGEM.  We also set up more test plates by re-streaking the UV+pACYC184 (chlor 150), GFP+pBR322 (amp 100), UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 (amp 100/chlor 150), and DH5Alpha (LB). For each we made 2 plates; a control plate that was not hit by UV (and covered in tin foil to assure it does not get UV exposure from the surrounding) and a plate that was hit by UV for 5 seconds. They were left in the incubator at 37 C overnight.      6/18/14"

Now I am back to looking at the activities that I began two months ago and am now updating them to suit the lab activities. I have started and will continue tomorrow:
Cleaning up scripts – getting rid of unnecessary code, making machines work for specific activities
Renaming items so everything can function together
Creating instructions for activities such as restriction digest
Changing the script for gel electrophoresis to give specific gels back depending on the materials used
Adding more conditions to the sequencing machine so that the various products obtained throughout the lab can be analyzed there

2. cPCR of Pqrr4+I13500
Since yesterday's cPCR only yielded one possible colony that may contain the circuit of interest, today I performed cPCR on more colonies to see if I can get more to ensure that what I have is what I want. A total of 11 colonies were picked and cPCR was done on then using BBK CP F/R primers. The following is a picture of the gel:
The colonies 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11 seems to have worked. Contamination in negative control, and nothing in positive control. Perhaps the tubes were switched around.  Overnight cultures of yesterday's Colony3, today's colony 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11 were grown for tomorrow's restriction digest.
2. Transformation of B0034 and E0422
For future needs, I need to take B0034 (RBS) and E0422 (RFP:LVA+Term) out of the 2009 igem distribution plates. B0034 is needed because I need to construct Pqrr4+RBS+GFP:LVA, but the part with GFP:LVA does not contain RBS. E0422 may be needed for characterization. B0034 and E0422 were thus taken out of the plates and transformed into TOP10 cells. They were then grown overnight. Carol promised to take the plates out tomorrow.

As for Switch B, it is followed by the sequence of protein ECF42_44454, which will activate promoter P42_up4062 and start the transcrption of Switch C. When Trigger C matches with Switch C, it will start the translation of GFP.[2]
In conclusion,our circuit will only express GFP when both miRNAs are detected.Based on this,we can detect fluorescence concentration and use math model to calculate miRNA expression level .

ARREN LIU
TREASURER
Arren is a junior in Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE… also known as America’s Best Engineers) with a focus in Cellular and Biological systems and a minor in Biotechnology. Arren is the current treasurer of Purdue’s Biomaker team and has only lost his wallet once this whole semester. He has an interest in Synthetic Biology and plans to become a researcher/professor in a lab for an educational institute or for a synbio related industry after slaving away his life to school. Arren is also an Orientation Team Leader for the incoming New Students of Purdue and can’t stop himself from dancing whenever the song “All Night” by Icona Pop plays. The cherry-on-top of Arren’s career would be to work on resurrecting prehistoric dinosaurs and to display them in a theme-park/zoo. He claims is “definitely not dangerous at all”.
TONY
DIRECTOR OF LAB
A new member of the Purdue iGEM team, Tony is in his third year of college, pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. He came to Indiana from Beijing, China at the age of six. Since then, he has tried his hand at mastering many skills from playing the piano to becoming a Pokemon champion (both of which are ongoing goals). Some of the things Tony enjoys are creative infographics, Rube Goldberg's, free food, and the oxford comma. If you ever catch him in vivo, Tony is usually exchanging bad puns with friends, procrastinating on dishwashing, humming Chopin to himself, biking to his next destination, or behind a LCD screen. As of now, he is planning to go into either pharmaceuticals or materials with his major, since he is as excited about chemistry as he is eager to share"

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," was a pretty cool multidisciplinary project, which drew in a few different disciplines that I have never really interacted with previously.  It was very impressive to see what we, and all the iGEM teams, had accomplished by the end of last year's competition.
Andy Spencer
Honours Biochemistry
In 5 years I see myself on one of two different paths, medicine or oncology research. I grew up in the Okanagan, British Columbia, and love spending my summers at the beach . In my spare time I enjoy playing squash and bouldering.  iGEM to me represents a fundamental value of science as a discipline; that people can from diverse backgrounds with a common interest and curiosity can work as a cohesive team to overcome barriers and problems.
Jonathan Tam
Honors Cell Biotechnology
I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Honors Cell Biotechnology and intend to pursue a degree related to medicine in Germany in the near future.  I am very interested in the fields of Molecular Biology and Immunology.  For the last two years, I have been keeping myself busy studying the development of macrophages in the lab of Dr. Daniel Barreda.  Outside of the lab, I am an avid photographer and downhill mountain biker.  The iGEM competition accelerates the development of Synthetic Biology as a field.  To be a part of our University of Alberta team is an excellent opportunity for collaboration and advancement.
Jennifer Yau
Honors Biochemistry
I am currently in the second year of my undergraduate program with the ultimate goal of attending graduate school to pursue a research career in Geriatric Medicine.  Additional science related activities of mine include my interest in astronomy and promoting science to elementary students through volunteer work.  Otherwise, I dedicate the majority of my free time to the arts of chainmaille, knitting, and jazz/classical piano.  This is my first year on iGEM and I am ecstatic to be partaking in a project that requires such diverse disciplinary backgrounds.  Not only will this be a great learning experience in so many perspectives, but also an opportunity to contribute significant ideas to the ongoing research in Synthetic Biology

Introduction
After we decided on Evobodies for our project in April, we quickly learned the difficulty              of explaining our plans to others. Because binding proteins have major impacts on public life e.g. in pregnancy tests,             we decided to spent a lot of time on elaborating new ways to explain and communicate Evobodies with non-scientific people as well as with experts from              other fields. Additionally, we were getting in close contact with scientists who would give us important              information and interesting feedback on our project. In our opinion, a scientifically well executed              project is equally important as the associated dialogue between scientists and the public. The more we spoke             with people not related to science, the more we learned how difficult it is to understand what whitecoated people do behind the             closed laboratory doors. To breach this barrier, we engaged on different frontiers.
Language barrier
Evobody generating system we experienced extreme difficulties explaining topics              like ""directed evolution"" or ""two hybrid system"" to a non scientific auditorium. Our first presentation on our project              was in April when we discussed the generation of Evobodies with scientific staff of Bielefeld Unniversity.             Already in this early stage,"

Team Nankai 2015 is consist of 9 junior students, 11 senior students and 5 instructors. With our team established in March 2015, we are more than excited to join the big community of iGEM.
The idea of synthetic biology attracted us in a way that other fields of study never could, and our passion about science is the engine that has led us all the way through obstacles and setbacks. We are persevering and capable as a research team. However, at spare times, we are just a group of fun-loving young college students. There is always an atmosphere of anticipation that we could blend into iGEM community. So we are looking forward to seeing you at the Giant Jamboree! Want to know more about us? click here……

What is “Pudding Health kit”? Pudding Health kit is actually a jelly-like unguent made of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and wound healing medicines. It aims at mitigating prolonged inflammations during the process of tissue regeneration, and speeding up the healing process of chronic wounds like diabetic wounds.
What is Poly-γ-glutamic acid? Poly-γ-glutamic acid, i.e. γ-PGA, is an important, naturally occurring polyamide which exhibits excellent peculiarity in water retention and sustained drug release.  How is γ-PGA produced? We used engineered Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 for mass production of γ-PGA, yet the original B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 strain that we isolated from fermented"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," technical difficulties of working in a laboratory environment, and realized that many safety concerns could potentially arise while working with biological organisms and chemicals, safety concerns that are not understood or known to the public because of synthetic biology’s recent emergence as a leading field.  We realized the importance of educating the public, especially the next generation of synthetic biologists, on the safety concerns of working in a wet-lab environment, and started brainstorming on a project that eventually turned into SynFlo .
Brainstorming and Collaboration with BU
Brainstorming and Collaboration with BU: As our lab had also previously collaborated with the BU iGEM team, we decided to continue our collaboration this year by focusing on a project that helps visualize and simply a complex parts assembly method, the Golden Gate Modular Cloning method.  We had three brainstorming sessions with BU , where we talked about semantic search, lab-organizing tools, potential outreach projects, and also collaboration-based software tools.   A researcher in industry, Robert Kincaid from Agilent Technologies also came in and talked to us during the brainstorming process.  Through out the summer, as we built SynFlo , MoClo Planner , and also SynBio Search , we kept constant communications with the BU team, and asked them for repeated feedback in the UCD process.  We were able to test our software with the team, and their feedback made dramatic impact in the designs and implementations of our software projects.
Tamara Hendrickson Biosafety and Bioethics Interview
While we were in the initial stage of brainstorming, we had the privilege of sitting in on a bioethics lecture Professor Hendrickson, from Wayne State University, gave during the summer research program.  From the talk the computational team learned that regulation, training, and organization are absolutely essential in working in a wet-lab environment.  Also, in our follow-up interview with Professor Hendrickson, we able to ask her in detail about how collaborative research works in her laboratory, how trouble-shooting occurs among students and PIs, and how technology can be of assistance during a lab meeting.  We also brainstormed lab organizational tools with Professor Hendrickson.  As we realized that troubleshooting occurs not only between PIs and students, but also among students, we also interviewed a current Wellesley student Angela Lei, who used to research the Hendrickson lab.  She gave us some insight to the lab structure from an undergraduate perspective, and spoke with us on how troubleshooting works in the wet-lab as well as the responsibility of students in peer-education.

We would like to thank the iGEM Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras for providing us with an opportunity to collaborate on their project. iGEM IIT Madras has offered us with a language project, chance to translate the video from English into our native language, Korean. We have translated their video of Introduction to Synthetic Biology into Korean. Our group has translated the English script from IIT Madras into out language and put it with the original clip that had drawings of what synthetic biology is and their significance. They have generously provided us with the English script used for their video which has already been uploaded to Youtube. Through participating in this collaboration, we were able to proudly present our knowledge in our own language and to offer this amazing source of information even towards native Korean audiences. It has been a massive pleasure collaborating with them and their help has deeply lead to our team heading towards achieving a great amount of success.

Safety
When it comes to safety, LASA does not take short cuts
Safety is not something to disregard. Especially in a lab where one is surrounded by dangerous chemicals that need to be handled carefully. We at LASA understand the consequences of not following all safety regulations, so we make sure to avoid all accidents possible.
General Lab Attire
Gloves, lab coats, and pants are mandatory for protection from potential spills and to avoid contamination
Closed toe shoes are required to protect feet from spills and falling objects
Long hair tied back to prevent contamination and being caught on objects
Loose clothing and hanging jewelry are not permitted in the lab to prevent being caught on objects and contamination
Equipment
All laboratory equipment is checked constantly to make sure it is fully functional
Detailed logs are kept of equipment checks and who uses the equipment for the purposes of repair in the future
Organization and Storage
Laboratory supplies are kept in an organized manner so supplies for experiments can be located in a safe manner
Organization spreadsheets updated so all materials are accounted for
Flammables such as ethanol are stored safely away from flames
Acids and bases are also kept separated to prevent hazards
Although not used in our experiments, the team knows how to store cryogenics and compressed cylinders as other members of the lab use these hazards
Personal items are kept in a separate location from the laboratory to prevent tripping and also to keep better organization of materials
All items are properly labeled with name, date, and/or concentration (if applicable)
Training
All members in the lab are extensively trained in laboratory procedures
If members forget how to complete experiments, they have mandatory refreshers to make sure they are safe while completing the experiments
Always one experienced person working at the bench at a time
Lab Notebook
The notebook is used to keep all information about the whereabouts of objects known by all members
Chemical Safety
In order to ensure safe chemical usage in the lab, LASA puts extra effort into taking care of our chemical's needs, whatever they may be
First of all, we always pay attention to fire hazards by keeping combustibles at a minimum and only turning on gas or keeping an open flame when it is actively being used
While LASA has not specifically used them, flume hoods have been made available for"

Collaboration with artists and participation in ‘European Researchers’ Night‘
We were proud to discover that the news about our team had spread out and reached many people from different fields: we were contacted by Kristupas Sabolius, Lithuanian writer and Associate Professor of Philosophy at Vilnius University, who expressed interest in both our project and scientific research in general. Throughout this year we have conducted several meetings with Kristupas and his colleagues and had a few very interesting discussions, one of which was open to the public and took place during our discussions cycle ‘Café Scientifique’.  The important part of this exciting collaboration was the workshop ‘Adjusting Bacteria’ at the public event, called ‘European Researchers’ Night’. During this event, we were able to not just introduce people to the theoretical background of the topic, but also give them the possibility to put this theory in practice – to stain microorganisms and examine the results using microscopy.  We have also exhibited 3D protein structures. This exhibition perfectly illustrated the need of visualization in science. Read more
Participation in National Science festival ‘Spaceship Earth’
National Science festival ‘Spaceship Earth’ is an annual event, where children of all ages, schoolchildren and families are taking part at the various activities. Our team took a chance to organise few events during this festival. We conducted a lecture for high school students about the modern biotechnology, genetic engineering, iGEM competition and synthetic biology. The other activity was more interactive. We created an escape room, called BioBreakroom, where students had to use their life sciences knowledge to get out within a set time limit. The purpose of this activity was to make science more attractive to students, engage them to pursue career in life sciences and spark new scientific curiosity. Read more
Human Practices collaboration with iGEM Aachen
We have organised a Human Practices collaboration with iGEM Aachen. We have found out the opinion and defined the current knowledge of the common public about genetic engineering in Lithuania.

The pQE80-L – lbpA plasmid was then transformed into M15 pREP4 to allow for more tightly controlled protein expression. E. coli cultures harbouring pQE80-L encoding LbpA were subcultured and grown to an OD600 = 0.6 before being induced with 1mM IPTG. Following 6 hours induction the cells appeared to die as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 - LbpA Culture Samples.Lane 1: Sample from uninduced culture. Lane 2: Sample from culture induced with 1 mM IPTG. On comparison of the two cultures, it seems that inducing expression of LbpA causes the cells to die given the significant reduction of protein levels visible on the gel.
In order to investigate this further, we performed plate reader experiments where different concentrations of IPTG were used to induce LbpA expression. The cells were also given a longer period of time to grow. Although cells started to grow again ~7 hours after induction, this was determined to be due to the emergence of mutants.
Figure 2 - Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5 mM, 1 mM and 2 mM IPTG)The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, the induced cultures stop growing when LbpA expression is induced. After ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have adapted to the production of the foreign protein.
Despite this, we did try to grow large cultures of M15 E. coli containing pQE80-L-LbpA¬, to see if we could detect any expression. We attempted this under a number of different growing conditions, however, none of these were successful. It is suspected that LbpA forms inclusion bodies and therefore insoluble which makes it difficult to purify.
Future Work
We would continue to try to find the the optimum conditions required to express LbpA and prevent them from forming inclusion bodies. However, we could also prepare and extract the inclusion bodies from E. coli and therefore purify LbpA.
If we were able to successfully purify LbpA we would, as in the case for the other binding proteins, attempt to attach the carboxylate modified fluorescent microspheres to LbpA and characterize its interaction with lact"

Overview
We spend a lot of time and energy to construct our models, which played an important role in both parts of our project. For database integration, the first step of integration is to find the entry corresponding to the biobrick in the database to be integrated. For this we use the ncbi BLAST tool. However, the original BLAST matching results are not usable, since there are problems like redundancy and low similarity. In order to screen the BLAST results, we used JS divergence for feature extraction and innovatively employed logistic regression classifier with polynomial features to classify BLAST results, which performed pretty well. For promoter prediction, we used machine learning method to construct promoter classifier. Then, we constructed multiple classifier system to improve the performance. With large-scale search model, we can identify promoter in a large-scale sequence. With these, we constructed a promoter prediction model that can be used in both of prokaryote and eukaryote, which benefit biologists to find more promoters.
Get the power of BLAST
Introduction
NCBI BLAST is one of the most well-known tools in the field of nucleic acid and protein sequence alignment. In order to efficiently analyze a large number of sequence data, we chose the local version: BLAST+2.7.1 as our sequence alignment tool [1]. The raw BLAST results are not usable, since there are redundancy and not all of the matched items are in high similarity, so we developed this model to select the trustworthy matches, then treating these matching sequences as identical or homologous sequences, and then performing subsequent information docking extensions. Through our manual sampling test, the two sequences matched by the BLAST have a high degree of consistency in function, so the accuracy of data expansion can be guaranteed to some extent.

Introduction Results
ABSTRACT
Promoters are the key regulators of gene expression. Possessing promoters which are active under a desired condition, at a desired strength and in a specified tissue is of great value for Plant Biotechnology, Gene Therapy and fundamental research in Bioscience. Therefore, it has become a desire to synthetically construct promoters responsive to a variety of pathways. We explore two ways to the synthesis of promoters: On one hand, we have developed a bioinformatical model and database (HEARTBEAT) describing the structure of promoters responsive to user-defined inputs. On the other hand, we have developed a biochemical method for the synthesis of randomized promoter libraries. Using this method, we have created a library of constitutive promoters of varying strength. Also, we have created libraries of promoters putatively responsive to a variety of pathways. We have screened these libraries for functional, pathway responsive promoters and present a detailed characterization of a NF-κB responsive promoter of our making. We finally discuss ways to combine randomized biochemical synthesis and bioinformatical modeling to propose a method towards the generation of promoters of complex regulation (i.e. by multiple pathways).

Software HoloPyGuy
Here, we present HoloPyGuy, an universal software solution created for Digital Inline Holographic Microscopy (DIHM). HoloPyGuy is an easy-to-use hologram reconstruction suite for self-made DIHM. We employed the open-source framework HoloPy, extended the existing solution with a graphical user interface, which greatly ease the whole process of parameter tuning, visualization of the holograms and reconstructed images. The software also supports 3D imaging from the reconstructed stack of images, by invoking the open source software Fiji. The graphical user interface relies on the Qt5 framework and is written in Python. The project is hosted on GitHub under MIT License and is also available for download. A complete user manual is provided in the following section.
HoloPyGuy: User Manual
HoloPyGuy functions simply by uploading the reference picture, the recorded sample hologram, adjusting parameters, and hit “Reconstruct”. As demonstrated in the video, we first adjusted the parameters according to our experimental setup, whereas the settings in “Point Source” tab are explained in the table below. Note that HoloPyGuy also supports collimated source calculation,  if an collimated source instead of a pinhole is used.
As HoloPy only supports square images when it comes to point source, HoloPyGuy automatically cuts the images into square images stemming from the center, with equal linear pixel size, once the images are imported. In addition, HoloPyGuy also converts the images to gray scale, this is due to the fact that for a coherent light source only a single wavelength is considered in the algorithm, thus color information is discarded for a simpler and better reconstruction.
Parameters
Description
Spacing
Distance between the center of two pixels, can be arbitrarily specified in point source setup, relative to “Magnification”
Wavelength
Wavelength of the used light source in nm, in our case the cell phone flashlight has a wavelength of approx. 450 nm
Medium

GET TO KNOW OUR MAGAZINE
LATAM
In order to strengthen ties between Latin American countries, we have decided to create a second version of iGEM LATAM, a magazine that mainly introduces the Latin American teams participating in the iGEM 2018 competition together with the projects that are being developed by them, in order to promote the transfer of knowledge. After analyzing the first version and noticing that we could improve certain things, this year we decided to add information about the respective countries of the participating teams as a way for our readers to be more familiarized with the Latin American culture. Inside the magazine you will find information about the best season to go visit the country, the most popular festivities, the most typical dishes alongside some recipes for you to try and other funny things. You should check iGEM LATAM down below! An important thing to say is that iGEM LATAM couldn’t have been developed without the following Latin American teams: TecCEM, TecMonterrey_GDL, iGEM Ecuador, iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018, iGEM Tec-Monterrey, USP-EEL-Brazil and ColegioFDR_Peru team.

Choosing Target Substrates and PCR Primers
Possible target substrate:
Single Colonies
Bacteria Solution
Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction
Use agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA to validate the reaction.

Interactive Metabolic Pathway Tools (IMP Tools) is an open source, web based program that involves model-guided cellular engineering where new metabolic functions can be added to existing microorganisms. This program will assist in the design stage of synthetic biology research. IMP tools is written primarily in python using the Django web framework. It takes a user-defined input compound, output compound, and weighting scheme and determines the ideal pathway from the starting to the ending compound. Our program presents an exciting capability to help transform important processes in the world for applications ranging from bioremediation to biofuels.
IMPtools utilizes the reactions stored in the Kegg (Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes) database to create a metabolic pathway that is in some sense optimized for the production of a desired by-product while consuming some desired input. After inputting your desired input and output products, our program searches for the optimal metabolic path connecting the input and output compound. Our program has the ability to provide different pathways according to user defined weights; as an example, least ATP consumption or fewest changes to host organism. The end product we give you is a collection of metabolic pathways and their associated gene sequences. Along with the sequence, we also give you useful information necessary, such as a graphical representation and stoichiometric matrix, to carry out experiments in order to validate our results. Our long-term goals include being able to determine what intermediate BioBricks would be necessary to activate the required enzymes for production. In future years, this tool may be useful for other teams to predict some of their synthetic biology ventures.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Introduction
Throughout the summer, Rose-Hulman iGEM has been collaborating with NTNU Trondheim . The teams found each other by luck when a speaker came to Rose-Hulman to meet with students participating in a math REU and talk about network modeling. This speaker was Eivind Almaas, NTNU’s iGEM main advisor.      After touching base with our lead advisor, Dr. Anthony, Dr. Almaas provided us with great perspective about being a starting iGEM team because his team was in the same position last year.      He suggested that we should video conference in the near future.
On 7/23/2012, the two teams met for the first time via video conferencing to talk about their projects and to offer advice to the other team.      In efforts to help each other out, RHIT agreed to help to characterize their lactate promote. In exchange, the NTNU team agreed to help critique our Mathematical Model and produce a stochastic model.      We hope that this newly found friendship will continue throughout the years and that we will be lucky enough to meet the whole team in person this November.
Promoter Characterization
Our NTNU colleagues requested help characterizing the Lld promoter they cloned from E. coli. strain K12. We received the promoter as a 373 bp EcoRI-SpeI fragment cloned into pSB1C3. The fragment was sequenced in both directions using primers VF2 ( BBa_G00100 ) and VR ( BBa_G00101 ). The sequence obtained matched that which was expected and is given in the Registry ( BBa_K822000 ).
We then used standard BioBrick construction methods to clone the EcoRI-SpeI promoter fragment into the EcoRI-X"

From thought to rubber
The overall process the team went through.
The first part of our team was assembled on the 28th of February 2013, and three newcomers joined the team afterwards. The following months were used to get to know each other, compare expectations, learn how to work together as a team, and how to organize a project.
On the 8th of May our team agreed on a project: Bacteriorganic Rubber. Research into how to build a biological system that might enable a bacteria to produce rubber was commenced. A basic idea of how we would accomplish our goal was put together. From the basic idea, we designed a model of the system, including a design of the biological production system, and the laboratory work could begin. We started building the BioBricks, BioBricksBioBricks are DNA pieces that are comparable to Lego bricks. BioBricks have standards, just like Lego bricks, and because of the standards a BioBrick can easily be combined with another BioBrick. These BioBricks are handy when building new biological system, as complex biological circuits can be composed from simple BioBricks.
