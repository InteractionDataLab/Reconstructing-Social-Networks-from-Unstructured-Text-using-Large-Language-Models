Staining
Gram and spore stains of Bacillus subtilis was desired to ensure that after transformation had occured the cells still gave a result that was expected. B. subtilis is a Gram-positive bacteria, and when a Gram-stain is performed on it a purple to dark blue colour is expected, where as Escherichia coli is Gram-negative and would stain red to a pink colour.  During a spore stain of B. subtilis the spores stain green and the cells stain pink. E. coli was used as a positive control to ensure that the stain worked, providing a colour that was expected, and that the bacteria was growing successfully in our lab.  Two Gram stains for each of E. coli, B. subtilis were performed, as well as two spore stains for B. subtilis were performed.  Before the stains were performed new streak plates of the bacteria were madeto incubate at 37 ° C overnight, ensuring that the bacteria came from fresh colonies.  The bacteriawere plated on regular LB agar plates for incubation.  The spores for B. subtilis were not streaked, as Israt and Anna Fei were taking care of the spores by changing the water in which they were stored to keep them maintained properly.

Bacterial smear:
These newly streaked plates provided the colonies for the bacterial smear slides necessary for the staining procedure.  Clean microscope slides were labeled according to the corresponding plates from which the colonies were taken, and a circle on the back of the slide was drawn to show the area in which the smear would be done.  2 μL of distilled water was dropped in the circled area on the slides, this water was then used to spread the bacteria around in.  The bacteria was spread using a sterilized, using a Bunsen burner, inoculation loop, before the bacteria was fixed by running the slide through the Bunsen burner flame a four times.  Once the smear was dried the staining was able to be performed.

CH2.2.3 - HEALTH & MEDICINE
“Many health and medical problems might best be addressed by improved biological technologies. What can synthetic biology do?”
Example:
There are not enough organ donor for patients with organ failure, and with the shortage, the donated organs are expensive. Organs are formed by the various combinations of 4 different kinds of tissues: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial; and they are groups of cells.
The project, Tissue-by-Design was an exploitation of this basic structure of human body. The mechanisms of the tissue and organ formation could be engineered in different aspects: cell-cell communication pathways, intracellular information processing circuits, and cell-cell adhesion, thus the undifferentiated cells are control to synthesize desire organs by the respect pattern.

Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already"

Each part will be upregulated by control under a T7 Promoter. Modifications to the parts we uploaded to Benchling were made:
FLAG tags for easier protein expression validation were added to each coding sequence
Restriction sites were removed from Part:BBa_K2018029 to make the part RFC10,12,21,23,25, and 1000 compatible.
Week 3 (May 15-May 19, 2017)
This week we finished editing our secretion parts before ordering them from IDT. Our complete system with Phasin-HlyA tag, HlyB, and HlyD was split into two separate gBlocks: Secretion Part 1 (SP1) and Secretion Part 2 (SP2). SP1 contains Phasin-HlyA tag + HlyD and SP2 contains HlyB. A gBlock with just the phasin-HlyA tag was ordered as well so that we could compare secretion of the endogenous E. coli secretion system to our system with upregulated HlyB and HlyD. Restriction sites for the HindIII-HF enzyme were added to the ends of SP1 and SP2 so they could be easily ligated together. Before ordering, further modifications were made to the original parts we uploaded onto Benchling:
All stop codons were changed to TAA because it is the most effective stop codon in E. coli.
Codons were optimized for protein expression in E. coli using this tool .
Week 4 (May 23- May 26, 2017)
Jacob and Sam began working on the Interlab Study. To begin, chemically competent DH5𝛼 E. coli were made and stored at -80°C in glycerol stocks, PSB buffer was made and diluted several times to develop a standard absorbance curve for the study, and the plate reader was calibrated.
Actual work on the Interlab Study was not very successful because there was little to no growth on plates of the transformed DH5𝛼, even though they were incubated at 37°C for two days.
The entire iGEM team was given very informative tour of the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Calgary. Many questions were answered and the information we have gained will be used in deciding which application route our project will take. More information about this can be found on our Silver Human"

Specific Experiments and Results
 
There were two essential goals of the assays we conducted for the oscillator plasmid (pMC001).
 
1.     To characterize the rhamnose inducible promoter in order to manipulate the concentration of KaiA. Our hope is that altering the KaiA to KaiC ratio will help optimize the oscillations. In vitro, this KaiA : KaiC ratio was found to be ~ 1 : 3 (Nakijima, Science 2010).
 
2.     To portray oscillations of KaiC phosphorylation. This was to be accomplished after goal 1, as an overabundance/lack of KaiA will prevent oscillations from occurring (See Figure below).
 (Lin et al. PNAS, 2015)
 
We first attempted to characterize the L-rhamnose inducible promoter, expanding on the investigation from the Paris-Bettencourt 2012 team. The characterization of this part can be found on our “Measurements” page.
 
We then conducted more tests on the L-Rhamnose inducible promoter and the stability of KaiA in the context of our oscillator biobrick. In consideration of the research we conducted about the L-rhamnose promoter, we determined 16 hours to be the maximum induction time to investigate. We developed an assay in which we induced cells with 0.5% L-rhamnose and took samples of E.coli cells expressing our oscillator biobrick every 2 hours for 16 hours. These cells had been induced with 0.5% L-rhamnose, as previous characterization had confirmed that this relatively high amount of Rhamnose would lead to KaiA expression. These samples were frozen in a -80C freezer to preserve the cell conditions. Over this time course experiment, we were seeking to observe the degradation/stability of the Kai proteins. Specifically, we wanted to determine the point at which KaiA expression reached steady state. This was of utmost importance before starting oscillations, as the KaiC oscillations are dependent on steady levels of Kai proteins.
         
Additionally, we had to deal with the issue of synchronizing our group of oscillating cells in order to properly assay for oscillations. To do so we referenced the Silver Lab paper (Chen"

In order to properly map the PyeaR part in the range of soil nitrate concentrations that agrEcoli would be exposed to, we needed to get some data on the sensitivity of the component within that small range of concentrations. To that end, we decided that a β-galactosidase assay would be the most appropriate method of obtaining that data, especially given that Edinburgh were kind enough to provide us with the necessary BioBrick to run the tests.
Unfortunately it turned out that the BBa_K216009 part was not entirely appropriate for the assay - the data could be limited by the cellular expression of the LacZΩ portion of β-galactosidase which is under the regulation of a separate promoter on the chromosomal DNA. So we decided to build our own biobrick to enable us to run the tests (see the page on design of the PyeaR+LacZ construct for"

Colorful Creations
This station combines science, art and play to present an analogy for synthetic biology. First, participants used legos to build their own plasmid, mixing and matching different parts. Different legos were used as an analogy for BioBricks, and contained pieces such as promoters and terminators. Visitors were able to pick what physical characteristics they wanted their bacteria to have, such as body color and number of legs, by picking the appropriate lego BioBricks. Then, participants were able to draw the bacteria they just built on our worksheet.
How do scientists feed their bacteria? Visitors learned about LB broth and were able to make their own “imitation LB broth” by mixing lemonade powder and water. To make their mixture, participants weighed out the proper amount of powder using a scale and measured out the correct amount of water using beakers.
Science is an art! Participants were able to try pipetting food coloring into test tubes with water, and then mix different shades to make their own colorful creations.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," for two reason - the increase height of the nut provided a larger surface area for the glue joining the rotor and the nut, and the nylon lock prevented the rotors from becoming stuck on the motor.
The design of the centrifuge and vortex pieces were relatively straightforward - the centrifuge rotor relies on perfect balance of forces while the rotor is spinning while the vortex piece relies on rapid spinning of a slightly off centered rotor. The designs were obtained and modified from commercial equipment.
The shaker rotor was more complex to design because the fundamental method of shaking had to be different from a commercial shaker. A commercial shaker uses an unbalanced weight that spins around a motor, with a platform on top that is elastically held to the weight. Therefore when the weight spins, it generates a shaking motion that is translated into the circular movement of the platform. The platform where the samples lie is only loosly held to the unbalanced weight, therefore the movement of the samples is translational rather than rotational.
In our design, the shaker relies on rotational motion rather than translational motion. While some shakers rely on rotational motion, they simply spin the samples 360 degrees up-side down to achieve the shaking effect. This is not feasible with overnight cultures because the container is open to allow air flow, and will leak if flipped. We achieved the shaking effect by using an unbalanced force that is at an angle. When the motor spins, it provides an inherent shaking motion, but since the samples lay at an angle, the force experience by the side closer and further from the axis of rotation will be slightly different - leading to a slight vortexing effect.
We also had to overcome the lower limit of the speed of the motor. The lowest possible speed is still around 2000 RPM, 10x what is normally needed. Therefore a manual pulsed spinning of the shaker was necessary. The program would activate the motor for a short time, wait until the shaker has come close to a stop, then spin again. This spun the shaker at a lower rate.
Arduino
An Arduino Mega was used to control and provide feedback throughout the system. It accepts input from the temperature sensor and the push-buttons on the LCD screen, and outputs to the ESC, H-Bridge, and the LCD screen. The Mega was chosen due to its faster processing speed and memory capacity, which was beneficial for our program and makes it more able to be expanded in the future. However, it can be run from a lower powered Arduino such as an Arduino Uno if necessary.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Exact positioning of ICs is controlled with a magnifier lens.
The components were soldered onto the PCB in two soldering rounds. First, the LEDs were soldered onto the bottom side of the PCB. Afterwards, the second stencil was used to apply solder paste on the top side to mount the remaing components. While soldering the second time, the LEDs stick to the PCB due to adhesive forces of the remelted solder, even though they hang freely on the bottom side of the PCB.
The PCB with the SMD components is placed inside the reflow oven.

After reflow soldering of the SMD components, all other components such as the DC socket, pinheaders and the status LED were soldered to the PCB by hand. Afterwards, the LED panel was assembled with the 3D printed case, the Bluetooth adapter, the display, the microcontroller and the fans.
3D Printed Case
In terms of flexibility and accessibility, a 3D printed case is the optimal solution for prototyping and low cost product development. For the creation of our 3D models, we used the Google SketchUp Make 2017, which is free to use. The SketchUp files containing the 3D models of all printed parts are available in the Downloads section.

With this framework we want to suggest a new standard for the fast and accurate computer aided design of customized short peptides.
Introduction
Even though biological processes can be characterized by their physicochemical properties, they can also be translated into an abstract model of interconnected functional entities. This is exemplified by the central dogma of Biology describing the information flow from DNA, to RNA and finally proteins. Synthetic biology has always tried to interfere with these levels of organization with the goal of systematically controlling the projected outcome [1].
NRPS carry this principle to the extreme by adding yet another hierarchical level:
The modular complex sequentially synthesizes its own short non-ribosomal peptide (NRP). These peptides in turn are not limited by the standard set of proteinogenic amino acids; instead D-isoforms and diverse modifications can be utilized [2]. Nature has made great use of this system by creating versatile natural products such as antibiotics, metallophores or dyes. [2] [3]
Although, little is known about the actual dynamic properties of the synthesis process most of its logical rules are indeed understood: A NRP-synthetase consists of a number of modules, each of which is responsible for adding one amino-acid to the nascent peptide. But even a module can be further sub-divided into domains, each with a distinct functionality [4].
This hierarchical organization demonstrates the large potential for the synthetic biology community: The exchange or combination of modules and domains from different organisms or different proteins has been repeatedly shown to produce fully functional NRPS [5] [6]. Not surprisingly, several bioinformatics approaches have put great effort to meticulous categorize NRPS and their functionality. For example, databases such as NRPS-PKS [7] or Clustermine360
describe the domain organization of diverse NRPS, while the Norine [8] database includes information about non-ribosomal peptides and their sequence of monomers. Also, many tools are capable of predicting domain sequences, substrate specificity and hence the putative product of a particular NRPS. Exemplary, the NRPS-PKS [7] and PKS-NRPS [9]analysis tool (hereafter referred to as Maryland tool) elaborate in this direction. While antiSMASH [10] [11] also provides similar prediction capabilities its scope is broader and covers many different secondary metabolite pathways.
At the same time, as the understanding of the underlying biological processes and methods for assembly of diverse DNA constructs has improved, many novel software tools aim at"

Singe Gene Knockout Softwares
The Penn State team created a python script to perform single gene knockouts, and determin which genes gave greater metabolic values.
Workflow
Create a list of all genes, constructed from the provided GPRs in the genome scale model.
Create lists of reactions that will be deleted for each gene knockout. This is done by evaluating each reaction GPR for each gene. If a gene is essential to a given GPR, the reaction is added to the list of reactions which will be deleted for that knockout.
Given a list of deleted reactions for each gene, FBA is run iteratively for each gene knockout. Running FBA will determine maximum biomass, max and min ATP values, and max and min flavodoxin values.
The FBA results are collected and outputted for further analysis.
The code can be found here

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#Inclusivity_-_-_TEXT.html," work of Paris Bettencourt, 2013
Our survey is an expansion on the Gender Study conducted by the Paris Bettencourt iGEM team in 2013. While the 2013 study examined the numbers of women and men on iGEM teams, our survey looked at multiple identities to get a more complete picture of the diversity of teams. Additionally, we provided multiple options for gender identification besides male or female (genderqueer, gender fluid, transgender), and also provided respondents with the opportunity to self-identify. We sought to build on the important results on gender provided by Paris Bettencourt to provide a more intersectional examination of iGEM demographics.
While Paris Bettencourt evaluated data from iGEM teams around the world, our survey controlled for regional and cultural variation by collecting data only from North American teams. Paris Bettencourt’s regionally sorted data shows that they found that less than 40% of iGEM team members in the Americas were women, making women the minority on iGEM teams on the American continents. 53% of the individuals who completed our survey were women, showing a slight female majority among teams surveyed.  This increase may be due to regional differences (the breakdown of countries included in Paris Bettencourt’s “Americas” data is not given), or may reflect a change in the gender demographics of iGEM teams in the years since 2013.  Our data provides a picture of North American iGEM teams race, gender, and sexuality demographics in 2018, showing both progress in gender balance since 2013 and an expanded view of the diversity of iGEM teams and the experiences of marginalized groups in iGEM.
To build on the results we obtained, we followed the approach of giving recommendations used by Paris Bettencourt. We expanded on the suggestions given in 2013 with actionable items for individual iGEM teams, to drive inclusivity and change at the student level.

Illinois,2008,Team:Illinois#Research articles_-_-_TEXT.html," novel biosensor for odorant screening.
The aim of this study was to optimize the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host system for properly expressing an OR at the plasma membrane, and for its efficient coupling to a signaling pathway that produces a measurable response to odorant stimulation.
The yeast system was chosen for several reasons. Firstly, S. cerevisiae has been successfully used for functional expression of many GPCRs [22–28]. Secondly, yeast constitutes an attractive system to study membrane receptors providing a null background for mammalian GPCRs and G proteins. Finally, yeast cells may provide a means for detailed investigation of receptor pharmacology in vivo through the use of sensitive reporter systems that take advantage of the functional homologies between yeast pheromone and mammalian GPCR signaling pathways.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane UV_-_-_TEXT.html," multiple feedback resistant variants of the DAHP synthase isoenzymes AroG ( BBa_K2027013 , BBa_K2027014 ) and AroF ( BBa_K2027008 ).
Genomic AroG and AroF are inhibited in vivo by the presence of phenylalanine and tyrosine respectively, both of which are synthesized through the shikimate pathway. [9] In AroG, two single codon point mutations (Pro150Leu and Leu175Asp) can be altered to generate feedback resistant forms of this isozyme. KU Leuven’s 2013 iGEM team biobricked the natural AroG enzyme and identified the same two mutation sites (found here BBa_K1060000 ). Accordingly, our team ordered the part from iGEM headquarters, and designed primers to perform site directed mutagenesis at these two locations. Before biobricking these parts, we inserted our two AroGfbr mutants into a pSB1C3 backbone derived from our composite rAIP plasmid ( BBa_K2027000 ), which included a constitutive promoter, strong RBS, and double terminator that flanked our genes. A similar point mutation to wild-type AroF (Asn8Lys) can instill tyrosine feedback resistance in the enzyme. [10] Having never previously been biobricked, we ordered our AroFfbr gene as two gBlocks from IDT and assembled the construct using Gibson Assembly Protocol into the same composite backbone as our AroGfbr genes.
To further stimulate the shuttling of carbon into the shikimate pathway, we aimed to decrease the metabolic consumption of PEP and E4P, the substrates of DAHP synthase. PEP and E4P are consumed by the glucose phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). Inactivation of this system has been shown to increase the yield of these compounds in E. coli grown in a glucose medium. [11] Instead of spending hours in the lab performing genomic deletions in our host cells, we contacted Dr. Guillermo Gosset of La Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in request of a live sample of his PTS- tyrR- glucose+ strain VH33tyrR. [10] This strain, derived from W3110 E. coli contained genomic knockouts of PTS and the tyrR negative transcriptional regulatory protein, decreasing the cellular consumption of PEP and E4P and increasing the biosynthesis of and transport of ty"
NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#IHP_-_-_TEXT.html," by having enough clinical trials can we ensure the safety level, which takes a long period to accomplish. From the public’s aspect, they may not have sufficient basic information about the risks related to gene editing. There are public concerns even about GMOs, not to mention having their own genes altered, as one of the interviewees mentioned. Therefore, public education is needed to establish a more objective view towards gene editing instead of a subjective one fueled with fear for change.
When we asked about the issue of cost, they affirmed that cost is going to be inevitably high at first, due to the fact that the technology is still at its early stage — even sequencing was very expensive at the start, one of the training doctors added. The general view towards cost is optimistic as they believe that as the research progresses, gene therapy will eventually become more affordable.
On the issue of DNA and RNA editing, they hold the view that both are important and it will depend on the particular disease. For a life-threatening disease such as cancer, DNA would be a better option while for a less severe disease with short-term effects, RNA editing might be a better option. Since most patients would have no idea of what DNA editing or RNA editing is, it would be important that the doctors have professional knowledge and advice the patients the best method according to the need of the patient. It is the patient who makes the ultimate decision, so it is equally important that the patients have some basic understanding of different forms of treatment.
 Our Takeaways
Both DNA and RNA editing have their own values, as each has a unique advantage under different situations. Since gene therapy is still a rather unexplored field, we cannot be sure that one will definitely work better than the other. Therefore, we should research in both areas, especially gene editing on the RNA level, which is less developed and researched as compared to DNA editing.
Currently, DNA editing is likely to be preferred due to the possibly larger cost incurred from multiple treatments of RNA editing. In order to not limit ourselves to DNA editing only, we seek to reduce the cost of treatment at the very early stage — disease analysis. We could develop an easier sequencing technique and make it more affordable to identify the genetic mutations since current transcriptome analysis is too time-consuming and complicated.
Integration to Our Project
After all our effort to understand different opinions from stakeholders in the discussion of gene editing, we have reflected upon our project and decided on what may be good to stay relevant to the needs of our society. We felt the great importance in developing RNA editing techniques and in reducing the cost in the current transcriptome analysis. After researching more on literature"

Podcast
As a means to engage the general public in a more broad and accessible manner, we at a team Incell decided to create a podcast, inviting expert into interviews about synthetic biology and the different relevant aspects surrounding it. In this way we got the opportunity to not only interview experts, but share their insights with the rest of the world.
Through this podcast we managed to spread the word about synthetic biology and what researchers see as the future possibilities and limitations. We learned the importance of biocontainment and general biosafety in regards to genetically modified organism and how these concerns differ between Europe and the United States of America. Also, we got inspired to take entrepreneurship to future road after iGEM and received a knowledge about how to go from idea to company - to encourage tomorrow´s Steve Jobs and Bill Gates of biotech.
All of this new knowledge we have shared on all our media platform, hoping to engage the public and possibly create some interesting reflective discussions.
Episodes:
Bioentrepreneurship w. Andreas Laustsen Many of the aspects in iGEM resembles an entrepreneurship; you have to brainstorm an idea, engage the general public, brand your project in order to receive funds and learn basic project management skill. Therefore a natural directions for many iGEM alumni is to pursue life as entrepreneur. This episode is highlighting the process of getting an idea, and executing it into a successful business. Interviewing entrepreneur of multiple companies Andreas Laustsen, who have had a great success  with - among others - the companies Biosynthia and VenomAb IVS.

Birger Lindberg Møller and Cathrine Rhodes An important topic within Synthetic biology is Genetically modified organism (GMO), what it is and which safety issues we need to take into considerations. This episode is split into two parts, where the first part is an Interview with Birger Lindberg Møller who is head of Center for synthetic biology at university of Copenhagen, explaining what GMO is, what we can use it for, and also an insight to his work at center for Synthetic Biology and how they take biocontainment into"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Project#Life science#curli#theory_-_-_TEXT.html," materials, you can choose your material in a way it meets your requirements. A beautiful example of these “living materials” has recently been shown by MIT engineers, who were able to reprogram E. coli in a way in which the bacteria were actually making gold nanowires and conducting biofilms when gold nanoparticles were present [1].
For the CONDUCTIVE CURLI part of the project we induce curli formation in E. coli. Curli are extracellular amyloids that form fibers. They are involved in adhesion, cell aggregation and biofilm formation [2]. The curli pathway involves the so called CsgA-G proteins (see figure 1). CsgA is the major curli subunit, with a CsgB subunit at the beginning of every fiber. CsgE, CsgF and CsgG are non-structural proteins involved in curli biogenesis and CsgD is a transcriptional regulator [3].
Figure 1. Model of curli assembly.There are two curli gene operons. CsgD is a positive transcriptional regulator of the csgBA operon, encoding the major structural subunit CsgA. The CsgB subunit is found at the beginning of every fiber. CsgE, CsgF and CsgG are non-structural proteins involved in curli biogenesis. Source image: adapted from M. M. Barnhart and M. R. Chapman (2006).
But how to make these curli conductive and thus make ""living material"" ourselves? Our curli subunit CsgA carries a histidine tag, which facilitates binding of gold nanoparticles to the curli [1]. The gold nanoparticles on their turn end up in the biofilm, increasing the conductivity of the extracellular environment. This change in conductivity is easily measurable on its own, but in combination with the extracellular electron transport module , it could even result in enhanced extracellular electron transport.

Fig.7 Process of liquid crystal molecules being disturbed
Fig.8 Immobilized antigen 500ng/m, nanobody 1500ng/ml
Design of self-assembled film
It has been investigated that the effective birefringence, which is relative to the color and                         brightness of LC ﬁlm, varied with alignment layers. Accordingly, the surface modification of                         substrate is critical for the detection of biomolecules by LC biosensor, in the current process                         of LC biosensor construction. The substrate sensitive membrane was constructed by APTES and                         DMOAP hybrid self-assembly method. The long-chain alkyl chain in DMOAP can induce liquid crystal                         molecules to be oriented in the long-chain direction and arranged vertically. At this time, the                         polarized light cannot pass through the liquid crystal cell, and the optical image is uniform.                         Black pattern. The amino group in APTES reacts with an aldehyde group in GA to immobilize                         biomolecules as functional molecules. Since APTES is a short-chain alkyl group, liquid crystal                         molecules cannot be effectively aligned vertically, and background interference can be caused by                         polarized microscope imaging. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the influence of the ratio                         of APTES and DMOAP on liquid crystal orientation, determine the optimal ratio, and on this                         basis, further determine the optimal content of GA.
Using immunocompetitive detection to detect β2-MG
Based on the principle of competitive immunity, the lower the concentration of β2-MG, the more                         β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the substrate surface, the brighter the image; otherwise,                         the higher the concentration of β2-MG, the fewer β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the                         substrate surface, the more black the image tends to be. When the concentration of β2-MG mixed                         with nano-antibody was 400 ng/mL, the optical imaging of liquid crystal was almost uniform black                         pattern (Fig. 9 (a)); when the concentration of β2-MG mixed with nano-antibody was 100 ng/mL,                         the optical imaging of liquid crystal had large area color (Fig. 9 (b)). Therefore, we need to                         design experiments to explore the maximum antigen concentration fixed to the surface of the base                         slide and the most suitable antibody concentration.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour33_-_-_TEXT.html," concludes that according to the model, it will cost 8.8 [million USD/yr] for PAST to produce 250   batches.
Pricing and Profitability
The challenge of biotech companies is to price a product that is of yet not on the market. This has to be an   evaluation of the costs estimated above and the investments needed for maturing the concept on one   hand, and how much customers are willing to pay on the other. PAST aims to replace mAbs, and it must be   assumed that though there are concerns of animal welfare, the customers will be inclined to keep using   mAbs, if the price of the peptide aptamers are not considerably lower. Therefore an average of the price of  mAbs has been estimated by 50 products from Sigma-Aldrich, details can be viewed in the following pdf ( Sigma-Aldrich antibodies ). Assessment of the pricing shows an average price of 1.7 [million USD/g]. This method of pricing presupposed that the peptide aptamers have   the same affinity and specificity as mAbs. The definition of sales can be viewed in equation 1, and it should be   noted that it is assumed that 30 % of production is lost. Reference: Seider, Seader, Lewin and Widagoo. Product and Process Design Principles - Synthesis, Analysis, and Evaluation; Third Edition - International Student Version; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 2010
S=Price x 0.70Production (1)
In figure 5 net earnings can be viewed. Net earnings has been calculated from equation 2. Reference: Seider, Seader, Lewin and Widagoo. Product and Process Design Principles - Synthesis, Analysis, and Evaluation; Third Edition - International Student Version; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 2010
Net earnings = (1 - t)(S - C) (2)
where C=Cost of production
and t=Property taxes and insurance
The goal of PAST is to sell the product at least 50% cheaper than of mAbs. Figure 5 shows that PAST will render positive net earnings and achieve this goal at prices in the range of 1.5-50% of mAbs.These calculations does not take into account the investments in the plant. Therefore three different methods were used for estimating the profitability, see table 3. They cannot be compared directly, but if all shows profitability, it must be assumed, that grounds to work further with the idea is established. Reference: Seider, Seader, Lewin"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," We also met the Lethbridge iGEM team and was introduced to their project.
Later in the week, we prepared overnight cultures and plasmid mini-preps for the parts required to assemble the genetic circuit. We also created antibiotic solutions for spectinomycin, erythromycin, and lincomycin in preparation for the supercompetent B. subtilis colonies we were going to receive, along with future use. The B. subtilis strains were generously donated to us by Dr. Wong and Dr. Wu of the University of Calgary. Given the importance of these strains, we immediately prepared backup stocks of the received colonies and incubated them. Meanwhile, colony PCR was performed on E. coli. colonies containing tetR+RBS and the 5`integration, which we prepared beforehand. Dr. Wong recommended we do additional background research on the life cycle and biology of B. subtilis.
We learned that B. subtilis, like most bacteria, are dependent on quorum sensing when trying to induce competence. When B. subtilis cells cluster together and their cell density increases, a collection of small peptides (called competence hormones) are excreted from each cell and recognized by adjacent cells. Research shows that the cells will only become competent if the concentration of these peptides is quite high (Graumann, 2012) . Research was also done on sporulation, a process by which bacteria enter a dormant state in order to survive adverse conditions such as starvation, irradiation, and heat (Eichenberger, 2012) . As B. subtilis reach the stationary phase of their life cycle, some cells acquire competence while others sporulate (Maier, 2012) . We determined that B. subtilis' tendency to sporulate under extreme conditions may be beneficial for our purposes, as the durability of a B. subtilis spore would facilitate an easy transportation of our diagnostic tool around the world. In theory, the spores would not require refrigeration en-route to their destination and could be stored for significantly long periods of time.
In regards to sporulation, the mother cell and the foreshore are genetically identical, but certain proteins must be made specifically in the developing spore. Thus, certain set of genes transcribed from mother cell DNA must differ from the set transcribed from foreshore DNA. The sporulation sigma factors replace the principal negative cell sigma factor A in RNA polymerase holoenzyme - possibly by out competing sigmaA for RNA polymerase (Eichenberger, 2012) .

January 8, 2009: This notebook's new purpose
For some time now, I have misplaced my iGEM (paper) notebook. I realize getting another notebook may only end up with me losing it once again. So I hereby declare that all my thoughts will go here, on my WIKI notebook.
The first thing I need to do is figure out this xml deal to give the parts manager more flexibility.
The second thing I must do it reconstruct what Anderson and Josh wanted me to do with the Parts Manager. I forgot their entire scheme with ctrl+click, shift+click, etc. I'll hold a meeting with them to do this.
That's all that comes to mind right now. Hopefully I finish the xml deal by the 15th. I'll keep posted.

Short talk. Met with Doug today, back from Columbia. Has vision about plan for Spring semester with circular flow. Will talk about it on Friday with rest of team. Cleaned up my notebook; old entries are now on different page, changed up bio to better fit new semester. Now know how to write XML, validate XML documents, make a DTD, write XML documents via Java. Have to learn how to read XML via Java, which includes learning about different XML parsers. Do I sound like Rorschach? Hurmm.
I've decided. I'm going to use the SAX2 API, and the Xerces parser.

The parts manager is an interface connection that is in charge of parts connected to a MySQL-PoBoL database. It gathers these parts and arranges them into a table by order of hierarchy. By default, this hierarchy is defined as: 1. Biobrick, 2. DNA, 3. Sample.
The flow for the Parts manager is as follows:
1. grab parts from database, including collections data
2. Dialog box pops up, asking if parts manager should be populated or empty (sidenote, there will be a ""Remember this option"" checkbox, so this box need not open every time)

The preliminary experiments conducted for the framework customised as the psicose biosensor were conducted by following data resulted from the model of the framework customised as the IPTG sensor. In order for future characterisation of this part, the model should be modified in order to guide in vivo efforts accordingly. We also lacked the time to co-culture this part with the Sensynova platform's multiple modules in order for the creation of variants for the Evry Paris-Saclay. The part BBa_K2205023 , the Evry Paris-Saclay's psicose biosensor system as the detecting unit of the platform, has been submitted to the iGEM registry for future work and characterisation by future teams.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by implementing the formaldehyde biosensor as a variant to the detector module of the Sensynova platform.
Background Information
The formaldehyde biosensor, part BBa_K749021, was selected was originally made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the TMU-Tokyo 2012 team. This part was chosen as a variant to the detector module present in the Sensynova platform due to the fact that our adaptor module present in the framework, Sarcosine Oxidase, was made in order to convert glyphosate into formaldehyde, in order to overcome the limitation in the detection of glyphosate due to its little-known knowledge.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html," the length of time for which these data are stored; funding and research grants; and interdisciplinarity (Borgman, 2015).  Thus, the increased desire for the improvement of information flow, reproducibility, and availability of data has driven this development of ‘open scholarship’ (Borgman, 2015).
However, what are the motivations for sharing this data in the first place? These are the four significant rationales associated with sharing research data; “(1) to reproduce data, (2) to make public assets available to the public, (3) to leverage investments in research, (4) to advance research and innovation” (Borgman, 2015). Reproducing data validates research or has the potential to reveal error, fraud or misconduct. The sharing of research data should allow scholars to use others’ work to ask new questions, to advance research and drive innovation. Sharing data also makes researchers accountable - socially - for their data, thus contributing to the goals of open science.  In instances where public funding is being utilized to support research projects, the public has a right to know the outcomes of that investment in order to determine whether the investment was beneficial. Overall, open access to data and publications should benefit all readers from scholars to the general public.
Openness in data occurs in different forms with varying rules and regulations. Policies change within disciplines, as well as across broad fields like the sciences and humanities. Although the format will vary along with the data collected and the published work, the principal motivations and desires for open scholarship will not change.
Data in Biology
Data in biology are collected and preserved in a number of forms. Genomics research, for example, often has large, international networks of researchers and collaborators with standards and expectations for data storage and reuse (Turnbaugh et al., 2009), whereas a discipline like marine biology will have a larger variety of data types and storage.  Genomics would be considered a big science, “a science that operates on a large international scale by a means of collaboration, data collection, and instrumentation” (Price, 1986).  Anything that falls beyond this classification is considered small science. Bigger sciences are often required to share data internationally for collaboration and for research mandates. This requirement encourages a more sophisticated knowledge infrastructure because of the number of parties involved and the communication required. Thus, there is often pre-existing infrastructure in “big science” which supports open science objectives.
Subdisciplines in biology each have a different classification within big science. These disciplines often publish data and discoveries in different manners that can vary by researcher and"

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.
Recommendations For Our Site
New Database Language
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological system. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#EvanNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," assumes basic Java programming skills) and is more powerful than Tern (which can only give a robot a limited set of instructions, like turning, making sounds, or spinning). She also told us to come up with a list of first-order logic symbols needed for genomic sequencing, and then use the list as a starting point for our interface design. It's really nice feeling like we actually have a direction toward which to progress, now.
Brainstorming a new interface design
Fri, June 7: We continued to work on interface designs with our mentor, Casey, today. We tried to distance ourselves from our previous designs and from block-based programming; in particular, we've started looking at game interfaces like Little Alchemy and Little Inferno (we also took frequent breaks to play these games :D). We're drawing inspiration from Little Alchemy's icon-stacking mechanism for recursively creating new icons and Little Inferno's general interface. The latter interface's ""table"" option--a permanent space on the bottom of each screen in which to put items for easy access--is especially relevant to Eugene DeSyne; being able to quickly access genomic parts and previously defined rules is definitely a key goal for our design. We spent the day drawing up new prototypes influenced by these games and preparing for our next presentation on Tuesday.
Week 3: June 10 - June 14
Mon, June 10: Today we met with Orit to discuss the interface design that Sravanti and I came up with last Friday. It seemed like she really liked it, but she encouraged us to come up with two more ideas by looking into UML and MoClo Planner's bio-visualization. She mentioned that, although our game-ified design was simple and effective, a lot of synthetic biologists might want a more ""serious"" interface (in my mind, unfortunately, serious = boring). Sravanti and I spent most of the day reading up on UML and trying to come up with inspired ideas; I guess the lesson for the day is that coming up with a great idea in the beginning stages (and becoming very attached to it) makes it difficult to come up with others. But the week is young, and I have faith that we'll be able to conjure up some ideas before we meet with the BU team on Friday. On a less academic note, the lab had our first potluck today, for which my S.O. and I made chocolate chip cookies, and it was great! Consuelo's chili was particularly delicious.
Wed, June 12: Sravanti and I came up with a new design,"

Sequencing of P395, P398, P422, P331, PCR2/P133 Klon 4
Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: Sequencing of P395, P398, P422, P331, PCR2/P133 Klon 4.
Procedure:
Plasmid concentrations were measured by nanodrop to calculate the dilution factor to have a concentration between 50 ng/µl and 100 ng/µl.
Plasmid concentration, determinated by nanodropping.
Plasmid
Concentration in ng/µl

P398
391.8
P422
375.8
P331
210.9
PCR2/P133 Klon 4
469.1
To get an end concentration between 50-100 ng/µl and an end volume of 15 µl, the dilution was performed as following:
Plasmid
Concentration in ng/µl
P395
1:5 dilution: 3 µl plasmid + 12 µl ddH2O
P398 dilution:
1:4 dilution: 3.75 µl plasmid + 11.25 µl ddH2O
P422
1:4 dilution: 3.75 µl plasmid + 11.25 µl ddH2O
P331
1:3 dilution: 5 µl plasmid + 10 µl ddH2O
PCR2/P133 Klon 4
1:5 dilution: 3 µl plasmid + 12 µl ddH2O
Also the VF2 forward primer must have a end concentration of 2 ng/µl. So a mastermix for everybody was done with O68 (100 ng/µl)
O68 (VF2, 100 pmol/µl)

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,": A patient with fructose intolerance could take up the lactobacillus via a probiotic product (e.g. a yogurt) together with a fructose-containing meal. In the intestine, the Lactobacillus would digest the fructose, preventing negative side effects for the patient. After the fructose is degraded, the Lactobacillus, incapable of digesting glucose, would lack further carbohydrate sources and die off. However, lots of further research would be necessary to get to this application, especially as the Lactobacillus is a GMO.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
Since the Lactobacillus is a naturally in the intestine occurring bacteria and no new functions were introduced, the risk for the patients can be considered very low. Furthermore, the Lactobacillus can only live in a fructose-rich environment, which prevents uncontrolled spreading. To further ensure the prevention of spreading, we would recommend additional kill switches which detain the organism from living anywhere else except the desired environment. A full proofed safety concept would be a central part of any further research on an application of our approach.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Promoters that are activated in an uncontrolled environment or anywhere outside the laboratory conditions could express parts that can induce cell death via apoptosis or autolysis. A vast amount of different examples for so-called kill switches was designed by different teams of the iGEM community and is now available in the registry (see for example 2011's team of UCL London and the 2013’s BGU Israel's iGEM-team ""Programmable Autonomous Self Elimination"")."

marA :The activator of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump exports some terpenes We improved the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part BBa_K1230000 and ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1230000 ) the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick marAgene as BBa_K1653006 . In existing part's information of marA, it gives E. coli resistance against kanamycin and give E-Coli resistance against geraniol as one of the terpene and decrease its intracellular concentration. In this year, we confirmed that overexpressing of marA gives E. coli resistance against farnesol as one of the terpene. This information is very beneficial for other iGEMers to production of toxic organic substances that are produced using bacteria.  We introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (MarA) to release the farnesol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase these flavors in the ""Flavolator"". In our study, we confirmed that overexpressing of marA gives host E. coli high resistance against farnesol.

E.coli JM109 and E.coli JM109 (marA) were dropped on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～〖10〗^(-6)), overlaid with 30 % (v/v) farnesol hexane solution (farnesol solution) and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that E.coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product better than the control E.coli JM109 wild type cells survived plates overloyed by 30 % farnesol solution.

PROJECT UPDATE
In our project, we have a robotics system, which had a huge update this week. There exists a centrifuge, a heater system, and a reagents insertion, for blood treatment. To reach a functional centrifuge design, we analyzed the weight, size and materials. The machine needs to have a stabilized mass center, in order to not break itself and the material has to support high temperatures, because of the heating system.
Besides the robotic part, we are working and learning the transformation and biobricks parts. We needed to adjust your biobrick part, due some problems of shipping that we had with our genes. So now, we are running against the time, working day and night to get the transformation and expression in the deadline. Now we building an alert system of DNA/RNA extraction, using a combination of regulators and reporters to make the E.coli recognize the extraction as a quality control.

In labs we have worked towards planning the assays to test our lipase and keratinase BioBricks, getting our BioBricks into submission vectors and producing a nutrient cartridge for use in the bioreactor we have designed. We went to a waste water treatment plant in North Yorkshire to see a fatberg with our own eyes, which definitely smelt worse than anything Paris Bettencourt or Polytechnic University of Valencia would have to deal with.
We have been working on an idea to create a standardised laboratory notation system to ensure iGEM protocols could be followed accurately and precisely. One member our team in particular has a little difficulty with English and have developed the notation to ensure procedures in labs will be carried out correctly. We have asked some other iGEM teams to trial the system to see if it work in practice and not just in theory. Other iGEM teams have also asked if they could contribute protocols to the system. It is"

SynSafe
We aim to transfer the outcomes attained in laboratories to our daily lives by implementing it on a larger scale and alterations of organisms whether genetical or epigenetical is one way to do this. However this is not always possible as we cannot predict how an altered organism will adapt to the natural environment and what it’s effects on the ecosystem will be. Hence, safety and security occupy a great space of importance when it comes to devising projects for iGEM; risks must be lowered at a maximal level.
‘Two heads are better than one’ is the best saying to depict our approach on safety.  This year, we read the abstracts and e-mailed most European iGEM teams to question and discuss the safety of their projects. Scroll down to view the answers of Grenoble-EMSE-LSU and METU-Turkey. Besides collaborating, we tried to increase each teams safety by preparing them for the obvious that can be questioned. With the support of iGEM, our aim is to form a biosafety congress in the future years because synthetic biology is like a potential limitless world source to anything that can be imagined by us. If Synthetic Biology is used for the right purposes then it  serves possibilities from treating the untreatable illnesses to erasing the word poverty from our dictionaries via feeding the hungry. Yet, it can also result in mass slaughter or the production of dangerous weapons such as atomic bombs or even worse. Hence, strict rules and regulations of safety is a must in this field and ATOMS-Turkiye decided to take the first step with SynSafe to raise awareness of its importance once again.

As it has been known to us since we were very young, memory is related to our mind and is able to be stored and retrieved about our pasts. Now, biological memory has been defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus. Cellular memory devices with cell or cell population have...
Two-signal system
To memorize a dynamic changing process of one signal or serial signal, we have raised an idea of constructing a unique memory device with sequential memory structure, called MemOrderY. Besides the signal we want to record, the Target signal,...
Multi-signal system
Of course, recording one changing signal in only two time periods is not enough for us to solve real-world problems. As a result, we have further designed multi-signal system based on two-signal system, which records one changing signal in more than two time periods...

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter3_-_-_TEXT.html," China is having great fun in the project this year. This is a team of diligent academic work and amusing daily life, as showed in following issues: (=w=)!
18 members participated, we have worked more than 7 months from the beginning of the idea this year, and we do put in huge amount of time in lab, working as a team.
We have senior bro and sis who never feel tired joking and teasing each other and fresh meat who excessively inherited this happy atmosphere. We have dinner and game together randomly, sharing cuisine and fun, and few weeks ago we had a fantastic trip to Taiwan. We are happy to invite more talented fresh meat into SYSU-China, marching for great honor.
OUR PROJECT
Selection of high affinity binding proteins of a target has broad medical applications, which has attracted many researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Traditional selection process is time-consuming and inefficient, which hinders the development process. This year, SYSU-China intends to make this process automatic and more efficient. We take advantage of the high proliferation rate of bacteriophage M13 and its artificially introduced DNA mutation to spontaneously establish a pool of candidate protein sequences carried in budding-deficient M13 genome. Those defective phages will infect E. coli hosts that carry the target protein, then M13 evolutional sequences are expressed. Due to bacterial-two-hybrid system in the host, only prospective proteins with high affinity will be capable of compensating the gene knocked-out in budding-deficient genome, resulting in budding of M13 with high-matching sequence. Additionally, different culture temperature, which can be easily and automatically operated by machines, and a temperature-sensitive RNA thermometer are applied to our system to make it more controllable. Ideally, with specific time and precise temperature control, this system is able to select M13 phage carrying higher affinity protein sequences in a fermenter with access to quantitative control.

Overview
Because our project is a fundamental one, there were a lot of teams that were interesting to collaborate with. For the next years we expect that by making an organized biofilm structure, a lot of teams can use the method we designed this year. During the development of our project, we received a lot of ideas and input from other teams - what is useful for a biofilm and what not. Some of these can be seen on the Policy and Practice page under iGEM Community section. For this we collaborated with the Berlin, KU"
Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#Project#application_-_-_TEXT.html," his colleagues described an approach to reprogram somatic fibroblast cells of both mice and humans to what they termed ""induced Pluripotent Stem Cells"" (iPSC) [1] [2] . In their precise methodology, the Japanese research group was able to define four essential transcription factors in early embryonic development - Oct4, Sox2, Kif4 and c-Myc. Under exogenously and combinatorial retroviral integration, these were shown to enable dedifferentiation of mature cells in certain tissues.
However, the techniques set up by Yamanaka et al. have not passed certain constraints: Firstly, dedifferentiation rates of their cells did not exceed numbers beyond 0.1% of the original fibroblast population. Furthermore, epigenomic and transcriptomic comparisons between iPSC clones and truly Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) revealed that the dedifferentiation profile of the obtained pluripotent cells have been at least questionable. The fact that combinatorial transcription factor introduction into somatic cells strictly relied on viral integration also gave significance to serious secondary disadvantages of the method - by hardly controllable target randomness of the utilized viral integrase, the risk of carcinogenic mutations or disruptions of vital host housekeeping genes has lastly become apparent.
However for the last six years since 2007, techniques expanded rapidly. In a stunning research article from 2011, Anokye-Danso et al. from the University of Pennsylvania described a first successful attempt to reprogram human fibroblast cells without any introduction of transcription factors [3] . Instead, their approach consisted of solely retrovirally transducing a combined microRNA-cluster. Thereby, efficiencies of iPSC generation have tremendously raised by two orders of magnitude (100-fold). A second and more demanding task, to dedifferentiate somatic mature cells without causing integrational mutagenesis and by the help of episomal plasmids, is being dealt with in many laboratories - including Yamanaka's [4] .
“...I would use this kit to better understand the transcriptional codes of brain development, by simultaneously regulating various promoters of neural transcription factors..."" - Dr. Jochen Holzschuh
What does it have to do with uniCAS? Efficiently up- or downregulating several genomic loci at once is exactly the task that the tool aims at. What about simultaneously upregulating the OKSM promoters or microRNA clusters on a transient basis? Different stoichometric proportions of the involved factors need to be assessed - by targetting more or less protospacers upstream of a gene"

Victor Gordeev
I am Victor Gordeev, 23 years old, from the Republic of Moldova. I finished the Bachelor Program in Molecular Biology at the State University of Moldova. Currently I am a second semester student in the Master Program of Molecular Bioengineering at Biotec, TU-Dresden where I am having an exciting international experience. The interest in synthetic biology is probably innate. I joined IGEM because this is a means to prove that science can be different from how it is usually viewed, there is place for imagination in it not only limited to the ways of dissecting a mechanism, pathway, function but also to designing ingenious approaches meant do deal with various problems. In addition it is perhaps, the greatest LEGO competition ever.
Svea Grieb
Hey there. I, Svea Grieb, am 23 years of age and I am german. Currently, I am majoring in Molecular Bioengineering in the Master program offered by TU Dresden. My Bachelors mainly dealt with nanobiotechnology so i guess I add an extra flavor to the team with my experience. I applied for iGEM because I am a big fan of teamwork! Furthermore I hope to learn new lab and organizational skills of such projects. My further expectations are, to be able to build a scientific network, to realize my areas of interest and figure out the path that lies ahead of me. Meeting new people and making friends is always an additional advantage! I love any kind of outdoor sports, I travel extensively and I am always up for some beer or parties.
Sarah Mansour
I am Sarah Mansour, I majored in Biotechnology for my bachelors and I am currently a student at TU Dresden doing my masters in Molecular Bioengineering. Coming from Cairo, Egypt, has taught me that the market demands for cheaper and efficient solutions are much higher than the supply. Concerning healthcare, it stages a problem as not many can afford the highly priced treatments. I believe that with the current knowledge, technology and concerted efforts, better solutions can be offered at lower costs. I am looking forward to iGEM being an experience where motivated people from around the world can share their views and solutions to various problems through the promising field of genetic engineering.

From the  Main Toolbar select ""Algorithm Manager"" from the Tools drop down  menu.  The Algorithm Manager is a  straightforward but robust tool - you take some input, select an algorithm, and  it gives you an output.  Each algorithm  has its own rules for its use, including the proper inputs and syntax.  After selecting any algorithm from the  'Algorithms' drop down box, select ""Get Instructions for Algorithm"" to get information on how to get it up and running.  After finding an appropriate input (whether entered manually,  imported from a file, or exported from another connection) select the ""Run"" button, and the output should appear in the 'Output' box.  From here you can view or save the  information in a number of different formats, graphically or textually.  The default Optimal Assembly and 2abAssembly  algorithms provide methods for optimizing the number of steps required to  create composite parts.

At the first NEGEM (New England iGEM) meetup, we began talking to the Northeastern iGEM team. After watching their presentation, we learned that they were interested in microbial electrolysis cells, wastewater treatment, and energy, and thought that they would be a good match for us. Their project seeks to improve the efficiency of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) by pairing the commonly used MFC/MEC strain Geobacter sulfurreducens with an engineered E. Coli that assists in exporting protons and removing oxygen from the media (since Geobacter sulfurreducens is an obligate anaerobic bacteria).
For our part of the collaboration, we assisted characterization of the Northeastern team’s novel part, BBa_K2182000, which encodes NADPH Oxidase. NADPH Oxidase, or the Nox protein,  catalyzes the formation of water from NADPH and O2. In their system, the Nox protein maintains an anaerobic environment for the Geobacter sulfurreducens. After receiving their Nox part, we transformed it into BL21 E. Coli, also provided by the Northeastern team. They requested that we then histag purify the protein and perform a coomassie stain to check for the presence of the protein. Unfortunately, their protein did not appear on the coomassie stain. In our communications, we learned that they were also having difficulties histag purifying and visualizing the Nox protein. One reason they gave for this is that the protein was not under a strong promoter, and was being expressed at low levels in the cell.
For us, the Northeastern team further characterized our PETase and sfGFP parts. We gave them our parts BBa_K201004, BBa_K201005, BBa_K201007 and BBa_K201008 (see here for details) in the plasmid backbone pSB1A3. They expressed PETase-sfGFP in BL21, a different E. Coli strain than the one we used. They then"

Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," perform our first ligations using these. This is probably a good sign. It will be taken as such anyway.
The plan for the movie is to finish the script by tomorrow, record the audio on Thursday, and make the thing over the weekend. Paper animation is slowly winning out over the claymotion which, let’s be honest, would have been a real pain.
The modellers matched all this with a breakthrough of their own. Their ongoing self-taught learning of ODE bore fruit today as they successfully modelled the original toggle switch. Cesar says soon they will be ready for the real deal. We should probably make sure we have something for them to model when that time comes...

The PCR products from yesterday were transformed into cells, and Yuma did some research into the kind of neglected population control side of our project. Philip also made the good point that it’s high time we just picked a pathway for the wiring and started transforming it in the lab.
Thursday 26th
There were some setbacks in the lab today, and it looks like the MABEL work will need to be redone. However we were able to transform yesterday’s ligations into some competent cells.

Today was movie production day – the script was finished, the dialogue recorded, and Brian the bacterium was born. It took a long time.
The rest of the team cracked on with the actual science. We got some primers designed for the metabolic wires, and the lab team made some progress with our RFP construct, though they had some trouble with a PCR run.
Weekend 28th-29th
The movie was bolted together from the pictures taken and audio recorded. We may not have any metabolic wires yet in our project on metabolic wiring, but at least we have an animated movie about a bacterium called Brian.

Made preculture of E. coli KRX without plasmid and with BBa_K863020 , BBa_K863000 , BBa_K863005 , BBa_K863010 and BBa_K863015 as well as BBa_K525710 .
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:
Ligation of tvel (PCR-product) and pSB1C3 and transformation into KRX
Gradient-PCRs (55°C bis 72 °C) with xccl-plasmid using xccl-g3633c and xccl-g2247c primer-mixes, respectively, resulted in no product of the right size.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Sequencing results showed, that the insertion of GFP_His wasn't successful at all, CBDcex(T7) had a lot of mutations and CBDclos(T7) had one silent mutation.
On the GFP_His -transformation-dish did not grow any colony. Did a new transformation with a little more ligation-product and plated the cells on selection-agar.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Co Culture_-_-_TEXT.html," when the compound it produces is needed by the astronauts. We believe that such a system would make transportation less expensive, avoiding the need of cryogenic storage, and maybe more importantly, enabling the possibility of a closed system where astronauts could avoid contact with the bacterial cultures directly because all initial protocols are prepared on earth. Such closed system would be highly relevant to avoid contamination of the closed atmosphere in extraterrestrial environments such as space stations, where opportunistic bacteria have been observed to thrive at the risk of the astronauts’ well-being (REF 2).
 
The ultimate goal of the project, is to reduce the amount of tools a space pioneer would need to bring along with him or her to facilitate biological based production, and, at the same time, enabling space pioneers to produce any goods needed, when needed. We envision, a cartridge-based system where astronauts use a closed system of containers with the described compartments inside (Fig. 4), the compartments are made switchable to allow for easy extraction and change of Manufacturer. ---- Not needed right now."
Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Community_-_-_TEXT.html," due to it’s support of boolean search operators. In addition, we implemented both Facebook and Twitter login using Spring Social. However, our implementation of Facebook login requires the manage_pages permission, which we repeatedly requested from Facebook without luck, and therefore the feature had to be scrapped at the last minute. Twitter login is fully functional.
As mentioned, the basic architecture of CollabSeeker is based around the Model-View-Controller or MVC design pattern.
The CollabSeeker database is based around a single repository storing the information for each team. Under the hood, the database is implemented with PostgreSQL, but the Spring Framework provides an abstracted interface requiring no proficiency with SQL.
In order to link the team repository to searchable project details, all project information is stored within ASCII-encoded text files that are indexed by the Apache Lucene indexer. Each file is named after the team that it contains the project details of. When the user searches for terms, say “cyanobacteria” and “microcystin”, the Apache search engine uses the index to find a corresponding file and returns its name. The name is then linked to a team in the team repository using the findByName() method, and a view containing a listing of the applicable teams is constructed and shown to the user.
The Facebook and Twitter login features are based on the Spring Social and Spring Security plugins. Spring Security essentially takes care of all the needed authentication, while Spring Social is used only to connect a facebook or twitter profile to the correct team, after which Spring Security takes over the login process. The normal login using Aalto-Helsinki -provided credentials runs entirely through Spring Security. The passwords we provide are cryptographically secure random strings produced by the SecureRandom Java class. It is nonetheless suggested that users change their passwords once they have logged in with credentials we have provided.
The front-end is based on the Thymeleaf templating engine. Additionally, we use Javascript to produce certain functions such as “show more..” -links for long project descriptions.
As stated, we have created a suite of tools in the Ruby programming language for automatically finding iGEM teams’ contact details on Facebook and Twitter as well as their project information on the iGEM website.
The source code for the CollabSeeker is available under the MIT license on Github .

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Glossary_-_-_TEXT.html," action of enzymes caused by enzymes called proteases.
Recombinant DNA
A vector containing a foreign DNA is called recombinant DNA.
Reporter
In molecular biology, a reporter gene (often simply reporter) is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in bacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population.
A common reporter that we use are the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) causes cells that express it to glow green under UV light.
Restriction enzyme
An enzyme which is used to make cuts at specific sites of a DNA sequence. The resulting fragments can then be spliced (joined) together to form recombinant DNA, which can be inserted into a plasmid or separated out on a gel.
RNA (Ribonucleic acid)
They are single standard biomolecules, presents in every living cells and is a basic unit for some viruses. Nucleotides acts as its basic units.
Serine proteases
Enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins, which has serine at its active site. The reactivity of the serine residue is ensured by the vicinity of a histidine and an aspartate residue (catalytic triad), all three residues are required for the charge relay system to take place. In mammals, serine proteases perform many important functions, especially in digestion, blood clotting, and the complement system.
Shuttle vector
A shuttle vector is a vector (usually a plasmid) constructed in such a way that it can propagate in two different host species. Therefore, DNA inserted into a shuttle vector can be confirmed or manipulated in two different cell types. It has two origin of replication each of which is specific to a host. Due to its ability to replicate in two different hosts, it is also called as bifunctional hosts.
Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM)
A molecular biology method to create specific, targeted changes (mutations) in double stranded plasmid DNA. There are many reasons to make specific DNA alterations (insertions, deletions and substitutions), including:
To study changes in protein activity that occur due to the change in DNA sequence.
To select or screen for mutations that have a desired property at the DNA, RNA or protein level.
To insert or remove restriction sites or tags.

British_Columbia,2018,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," White’s response helped to give our journalism article more direction. She quickly pointed out that a lot of our questions demanded broad, complex answers that could fill multiple textbooks. In the end, we honed in on biases people have, and how they can shape people’s perceptions of the science behind marketed products, as well as how to decrease the impact their biases have on their decision making.
E: Dr. White gave us three main ways that people’s biases can lead them to believe in the efficacy of dubious products. Firstly, they’re inclined to believe from the start that the product will work for them, simply because they want it to. Additionally, confirmation bias plays a role as the consumer preferentially seeks information supporting only their perspective. As well, people want to “fit in”, and companies can exploit this by buying likes and views on social, and hiring influencers to promote products. In order to combat biases, a person has to understand the mechanism behind the bias, which can help them avoid the particular pattern of thought.
A: We wanted some more information on biases towards sciences held by the general public, so we contacted Dr. Steven Heine. Additionally, we contacted James Vogl to learn about how to write better interview questions.
DR. STEVEN HEINE
UBC Psychology professor who studies people's attitudes towards science and with some focus on genetics
A: Before the interview the team was anticipating on understanding the science behind pseudoscience, why people tend to have a generalized stereotype about certain aspect of science and how we can change this stereotype all relative to Dr. Heine. Additionally, we anticipated the information that he would have given us to serve as a background knowledge when writing our journalism piece because we are able to understand the public’s point of view when reading a scientific article.
R: We found that the information given to us by Dr. Heine wasn’t exactly what we were looking for. Though he touched on the basics of pseudoscience, he did not go in detail about how this may affect the wavering public interest. Nevertheless, he was extremely knowledgeable about how to change the common misconception of pseudoscience and what the main factors is. All in all, the interview provided us information that we carried when executing our written portions of our human practices element.
E: A number of the iGEM team went over to Dr. Heine’s office to speak with him about his take on pseudoscience. Our first large discussion was about how people curate an idea of science and how this leads to pseudoscience. Dr. Heine explained to us that it is natural human habit to categorize everything"
Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Project FUR_-_-_TEXT.html,". In presence of iron, Fur binds the DNA, the RhyB expression is inhibited and the mRNA can be transcribed.
As shown in Figure 5, and if we apply it to the sodB gene expression system. In iron starvation, Fur-Fe2+ cannot be formed and RyhB transcription is disinhibited. RyhB is expressed in the intracellular environment and it can binds to sodB mRNA which contains RyhB’s target sequence. Once RyhB binds to SodB mRNA, RNA degrading enzymes, such as RNaseE and RNase III, are recruited and the new formed complex is digested.
However, if the iron concentration is high enough, Fur-Fe2+ complex is formed and it can inhibit the RyhB transcription. SodB is not repressed and can be synthesized3. That is why Fur is described as an activator transcriptional factor in such a case.
Siderophores
During iron starvation, bacteria produce siderophores, small molecules that can catch any atom of iron in the environment to feed the bacteria. There are different types of siderophores, depending on their structure and their interaction with iron:
Catecholate,
phenolate,
hydroxymate,
carboxylate types.
We focus more specifically on enterobactin which is a catecholate siderophore (composed of catechol = bi-phenol) produced by E. coli. Enterobactin has a very high affinity for ferric iron K = 1052 M-14. This number is greater than the affinity of heme B and EDTA metal chelator for iron, respectively K = 1039 M−1 and 1025 M−1. De facto, enterobactin is one of the most powerfull siderophores known: it can extract iron from hemic source and even from air!
Figure 7: Structure of Enterobactin molecule.
Ferric iron Fe3+ or Ferrous iron Fe2+ established hydrogen bound with the alcohol groupment of enterobactin.
Figure 8: 3D structure of enterobaction without (A) or with (B) Ferric Iron5.
Genes of enterobactin pathway are under the regulation of the Fur protein in E.coli. It means that genes of enterobactin pathway are expressed only in lack of iron.
Figure 9: Pathway of the synthese of the enterobactin.
In our project, we want to produce enterobactin. Then we focus on the 6"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Receptors_-_-_TEXT.html," that point we did not have enough stably integrated T-REx 2cells, yet. Thus we used transient transfected, semi-stable MEXi HEK 293T cells that were pulled down with magnetic beads in order to increase the number of transgenic cells in the preparation and to show the specific binding of the beads to the cells. For this immunoprecipitation we incubated scAvidin-receptor and eMA-receptor cells with biotinylated magnetic beads and on the other side cells transfected with the BAP-receptor together with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. After the immunoprecipitation the cells were washed twice with PBS and it was visible that the portion of transgenic (red fluorescent) cells was largely increased after this procedure. The depicted SEM image shows two BAP-receptor transfected MEXi cells which have a cluster of magnetic streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads at their cellular interface. At the border of the cells the superimposed fluorescence image of these cells shows red fluorescence located at the periphery of the cells indicating the presence of mRuby3 fluorescent protein at the cellular membrane. The green fluorescence is caused by biotinylated eGFP that was used for other preparations on the same microscopic slide and came into contact with these cells when the suspension cells were sedimented on the microscopic slide by centrifugation. Although for a reliable conclusion one would have to evaluate several such images this figure already gives a valuable evidence that the BAP-receptor is present on the cells (although perhaps at lower levels) and can bind to strepavidin that was conjugated to the beads.
Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display
Besides the design of biotinylated and biotin-binding receptors for eukaryotic cells, we also applied the biotINK approach for prokaryotic cells. For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli. Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. There, they are used to screen libraries of different antibodies concerning their affinity towards a given therapeutic target.
We based our design on the autotransporter EspP [24] .
