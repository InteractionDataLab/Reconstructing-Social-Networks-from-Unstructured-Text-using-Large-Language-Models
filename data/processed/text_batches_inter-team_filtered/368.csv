We improved three biobricks in terms of characterisation:
pYeaR improved by improved characterisation of sensitivity of promoter
ompR improved by discovering new applcation, NaCl sensitivity
flhDC was not characterised before, we characterised this promoter and confirmed its function
To demonstrate a functional prototype of our project and show this system working under real-world conditions simulated in the lab, we created a microfluidics device, Human Gut-on-a-Chip. We grow our bacteria with mammalian cells in it to study how our probiotic prototype grows and colonizes the gut. We also studied the interactions between the 2 cells, and established that they symbiotically co-exist after over 16hours in real-world conditions."

The constraint forbids that the junction of Ga and Ha (something irrelevant) can’t confirm the hypothesis “for every F, then G”. Since the hypothesis is about F’s and G’s then the evidence should be too (Fa and Ga and not Ha) Put formally: Ga confirms relevantly (1): ∀x(Fx → Gx) given Fa. As constraint: Ga∨Ha doesn’t confirm (1) given Fa. Otherwise there is room for cheap confirmation, where the hypothesis is confirmed with non-relevant evidence SCHURZ, G. 2013.

The problem of induction as told by David Hume
David Hume stated that we can never know something with complete certainty. Our knowledge will always be based on a finite set of observations. Hume believed there to be only two types of statements in the world: Relations of Ideas and Matters of fact. Relations of ideas are before our experiences (a priori) as opposed to Matters of fact that are a posteriori (after experience). Since our experience is limited, matters of fact will never be certain – because it isn’t a priori. The problem of induction is that we try to generalize from matters of fact to relations of ideas: from uncertain and limited experience to certain a priori ideas.
Our habits make us draw causal inferences: when I have observed several times that when I drop a stone from midair it falls to the ground – then I start to expect it to happen again and again. I say that it must be so – I state something about the future based on my past, instead of basing it on a priori knowledge. But when shown in formal logic, it seems clear that it isn’t a valid judgement:
All Fx observed have also been Gx
a is a F
From (1) and (2) it doesn’t follow with certainty that a is a G. There is, for Hume to see, no way of knowing that it will always happen, since we cannot see the causal connection – we can only observe the constant conjunction of dropping the stone and its falling.
The problem of induction is then that science extrapolates a priori truths from limited observations. There is no clear and logical reason for this to be acceptable as a general law VICKERS, J. 2016. The Problem of Induction. In:ZALTA, E. N. (ed.). Standford Encycplodia of Philosophy"

∴ concentration of the gene per cell = N x 200 x 1.66x10-6mM, where N = number of base pairs
∴ concentration of the gene proteinase K (N = 1194) in the volume of an E.coli cell is = 0.40mM
Transcription rate in E.coli = 80bp/s [38] = 80 x 1.66x10-6mM/s = 80 x 1.66x10-6 x 60mM/min = 7.97x10-3mM/min

Genetic Engineering for Kids with NEPTUN
The Northeastern Program for Teaching by Undergraduates, NEPTUN , is a student organization at Northeastern which hosts a free event for local area high-school students to come to Northeastern’s campus and take a day of fun and educational classes put together by undergraduate students at Northeastern University.
Our team had the pleasure of putting together a simple introduction to the fields of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. The two, hour-long courses consisted of a primer pre-quiz by show of hands to gauge prior knowledge and get the students interested followed by a brief historical and conceptual background on the field. The courses ended with a view of modern synthetic biology including a short interactive benchling demonstration, a very brief discussion of some ethical issues in biology, and a few cool cutting edge things happening in the field like CRISPR/Cas. The course was a rousing success and hearing the students excitedly chatter about the future implications of genetic engineering and synthetic biology was inspiring. Feel free to peruse the slide deck we used during the course below!
Bringing Research to the Experts
As a part of our education initiative, we collected information on a set of current biotechnologies to help inform the experts we spoke to in Mozambique. By sharing information about the state of inexpensive and effective biotechnology we hoped to inspire conversations amongst experts with agency to have a significant health impact in Mozambique. We also provided contact information with the experts, to facilitate their outreach to the researchers and the initiations of collaborations. The response from the experts that we shared this information with was overwhelmingly enthusiastic and inspired Keba Jobarteh to say that “a point of care test that gives viral load range for HIV is the holy grail.”
These resources are collected and shown below:

The Modular BioFactory
This project uses the yeast P. pastoris as a cellular factory to produce terpenoids. Terpenoids are hydrocarbon molecules that serve many purposes; they have anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-malarial and anti-bacterial qualities and are also of use in the cosmetic and chemical industries. Most terpenoids come from plants and, usually, their yields are low. The goal is to increase the yield through the use of synthetic biology, making a bio-brick platform which could be suited to specific ends and further expanded and controlled.
Taking advantage of the existent Mevalonate pathway in P. pastoris (the metabolic route which provides the precursors to the terpenoid biosynthesis) -engineered to limit negative feedback loops- the terpenoids of interest will be produced by introducing the appropriate synthases. By means of siRNA silencing, the sterol pathway will be controlled to ensure that most of the substrates will be channeled to terpenoid production.

After repeated several times, I succeed in PpbrA-CrtEBI at last. Then I ligated the CrtEBI to PmerT in pSB1C3 again and succeed. But the worst was still to come. The E.coli which has PpbrA-CrtEBI or PmerT- CrtEBI appeared bright red, just as the constitutive promoter-CrtEBI. So we had to give up CrtEBI as our repoter.

Week 1 (March.19 - March.25)
Wet Lab
Read excellent literatures about synthetic biology and projects on iGEM Official Website.
Week 2 (March.26 - April.01)
Wet Lab
We discussed with our instructors about the project designing and decided to improve Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface display technology. Then we read iGEM projects about Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface display.
Week 3 (April.02 - April.08)
Wet Lab
We had a brainstorm about yeast surface display.
Week 4 (April.09 - April.15)
Wet Lab
After discussion, we set our initial project theme that displaying human tubulins on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we read more literatures about tubulins.
Week 5 (April.16 - April.22)
Wet Lab
We visited Mr Meng who is the doctor of Chinese Academy of Sciences and discussed our project with him. Through the discussion, we found it difficult to keep tubulins lasting polymerization in vitro. So we attempted to look for more stable materials. At last, we found flagellin which can polymerize spontaneously in vitro.
Week 6 (April.23 - April.29)
Wet Lab
Our experiment was discussed and designed. We divided the display system into two parts: the display modules and the secretory modules. With the special structure of surface display system, we could display the particular subunit onto the Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface as a linkage site and secrete other subunits into the extracellular environment to create a subunit-rich surroundings. With the optimal concentration of subunits, GTP and other ions, those subunits could reconstitute into microtubules and flagellum. In this way, we could finally display the microtubule and flagellum on the cell surface. And then, we could use this upgraded system to facilitate small molecules screening.

Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and"

Part Submissions
As an iGEM team, we wanted to contribute novel and functional parts to the iGEM Registry.
We submitted 3 parts integral to our experiments as BioBricks. Here is a link to our parts page on the Registry . Below we describe these parts in more detail.
Recombination Directionality Factors:
orf7
This part (K1733000) contains the orf7 recombination directionality factor, corresponding to the TP901-1 integrase. It catalyzes the unidirectional inverse reaction of the TP901-1 integrase, allowing for the inversion, deletion, and cassette exchange of sequences of DNA flanked by specific recombination sites.
Orf7 recognizes AttL and AttR recombination sites that flank sequences of interest, and, when both TP901-1 and orf7 are present, the sequence within the recombination sites can be manipulated. After performing the reaction, orf7 will no longer recognize the recombination sites, since they change to AttB and AttP sites, so the sequence cannot be reverted as such.
We characterized functionality of the intact orf7 against a fluorescent reporter plasmid. This plasmid encoded for an mRuby protein in the inverse orientation, between AttL and AttR sites. We transfected this reporter with an intact TP901-1 protein and the orf7 protein, and the proteins catalyzed the inversion reaction to yield expression of mRuby. Below is the characterization data of our orf7 part:
Importantly, our part was characterized in a mammalian expression system. We have not characterized this part in other chassis.
Dimerization Domains:
ABI and PYL
These parts (K1733001 and K1733002) contain the ABI (ABA insensititve 1) and PYL (pyrabactin resistance like) protein domains that dimerize in the presence of the small molecule abscisic acid (ABA). By fusing these dimerization domains to inert halves of a protein, and adding or removing ABA, we were able to control the function and activities of several split proteins. We believe that other iGEM"
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," idea to arrange a Germany-wide action day was to address people outside the university and attract attention about iGEM and synthetic biology. Besides it was a step to have an ""open-science"". The people were very pleased to be informed about new approaches because they thought science is mainly behind closed doors. So we tried to change this view a bit, and hopefully it worked. Seven German iGEM teams participated in the action day and organized information booths and activities around synthetic biology.
If you want to read more about this day, take a look on our ""Human Practice"" page.

The LMU Munich iGEM team joined us on the Action Day. Our team organized the information booth, we organized the permission of the city of Munich, and we payed the fee for it. To get a booth in the city center of Munich is not that easy and costs a lot of time.  Besides we organized all the booklets and created a handout to distribute and inform the public. The LMU iGEM team organized the tables and the movable walls so that we had a booth at all.
Collaboration with Jessica Ebner from Stuttgart University
Mentioned in her Diploma thesis
Jessica Ebner is a student at the University of Stuttgart. She contacted us at a very early stage of the project and asked us whether she could describe the iGEM competition using our team as an example. Her diploma thesis is entitled: ""Engineering of Life – What is Synthetic Biology and how does it operate?"" She visited us once. We explained our project to her and she received a login to our internal wiki.  In her thesis she dedicated ten pages to the iGEM competition and our team.
Abstract
This diploma thesis aims at reflecting the cross-disciplinary field of Synthetic Biology as an emerging engineering technology. Initially this requires a concise analysis of the historical development of the term Synthetic Biology as well as the recent progresses concerning DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. Furthermore this comprises the exemplification of the engineering based approach to Synthetic Biology. With reference to the several major categories of Synthetic Biology, this thesis theoretically analyzes the distinct areas of focus and specifies those insights with applied-oriented examples. In addition, this work describes the basic principles of"

This year, our project researches the issues of the field sobriety test. We visited the judges, the policemen, the wine tasters, and the health care workers, who we considered as experts who may give us advice. Surveys were designed for the public concerning the breathalyzer test. We also met iGEM teams (NCTU, NTHU, CGU) and attended 2016 iGEM Asian Conference to exchange project ideas and share experience. In addition, a biotech company, BIONIME corp., provided us with technical supports. This page particularly presents our efforts concerning the Human Practices events.
Scenario: One day, a man drove lively on the road after eating lychees. Suddenly, he lost his control and his car bumped into the tree on the sideway. And he fell into a coma. For a while, a police officer came up and asked him to take a sobriety test. It turned out that he exceeded the legal alcohol limit in a breathalyzer test. He felt upset and decided to take action. How could we help him prove that he was innocent?
After researching news concerning the field sobriety test, we found many debates against the breathalyzer test such as individual metabolic differences, diabetes, refusals, people dead or in coma. We studied the principle behind the test and believed that there’s a way more reliable. Therefore, we went to the judges in the court, the police officers in the police station, the health care workers in the hospital and the wine tasters in a working place to discuss the issues and seek for opinions. We also designed a questionnaire to survey the public about their experience in the sobriety test. On campus, we educated the younger schoolmates with biotech skills and engaged the school’s teachers to experience the breathalyzer test. To connect iGEM community, we met teams hosted by NCTU-Formosa and attended the Asian conference held by NCKU-Tainan that provided us opportunities to exchange ideas and share experience. To work with iGEMers, we collaborated with NCTU-Formosa and helped them to confirm a function of one of their BioBrick parts. To develop IGEM BLOOD"

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Spider Silk Genetics_-_-_TEXT.html,"apped Assmebly (ICA) for use in designing custom spider silk genes. The spider silk protein has a highly repetitive primary structure, and its properties can be changed by changing the sequence and identities of these repeats. We want to be able to fully control the primary sequence of our silk gene, and develop a quick, efficient method of customizing assembly of the spider-silk genes.
Achievements
From 7/14/2015 onwards, we established ICA as a usable technique to create constructs of varying size and content.
We started testing ICA on 6/19/2015
We successfully constructed biobricks that contain our silk genes and the sticky overhangs. 4/24/2015
We proved that our designed sticky ends work as expected, and exhibit specific binding, showing that ICA can work in spider silk genes. 5/8/2015 and 5/12/2015
We have established a protocol generating fragments to be used in ICA.
We successfully characterized the use of ICA oligos with MaSp AB, BC, CA and showed that they could work in ICA! 6/3/2015
We successfully made a 3-mer using the ICA protocol on M-270 Streptavidin Beads! 7/7/2015

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," results.
We recommend using ELISA rather than western blot analysis to measure reactivity.
It is recommended to perform immunohistochemistry with markers for reactivity in the specific cell line used.
 Experiment 3 – Identification of reactive astrocytes using immuno-staining:
The previous methods showed opposing results. The ELISA results indicated that LPS activates C8D30 astrocytes, while the western blot analysis results indicated that LPS does not significantly increase the cell line reactivity. Therefore, we decided to perform a third experiment to confirm whether or not the C8D30 cell line is in a reactive state.
We organized a collaboration with Dr. Dinorah Friedmann-Morvinski from Tel-Aviv university. The DFM lab specializes in combines cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, immunology, cancer research, as well as advanced genome-wide techniques and microscopy. The DFM lab performs immune-staining to confirm reactive states in glioblastoma and therefore were well equipped to assist us with this matter, as our lab does not possess the necessary equipment. The DFM lab performed immune-staining on a sample of our C8D30 astrocyte cell line.
Results:
Figure 8: C8D30 cells stained with DAPI (blue), Nestin (green) and GFAP (Red)
Conducted by: Dinorah Friedmann-Morvinski's lab
GFAP and Nestin, both reactivity markers, were found and appear in the same location as the cells stained with DAPI.
Discussion:
The immune-staining results confirm the results we obtained in through western blog analysis. The C8D30 cell line is always in a reactive state. Apparently, the differences in C3 concentration we found when using ELISA were negligible and would have been rejected with enough repetitions.
Conclusion:
The C8D30 astrocyte cell line is in a reactive state without any additional treatment. In order to support this conclusion, we recommend using ELISA with many biological repetitions and biomarkers.

Part 1: Hardworking Coco
Once upon a time, there was a hard working guy called Coco. He was always busy working in his office. As time went by, He got more and more colleague. The workplace become crowd, everyone in the office could not work well.
Part 2: The bothering of warming
So he set an air-conditioner. That stuff cost him a lot of money for electricity. But that was not ended, the electricity consumed by air-conditioner came from the fossil fuel. As a result, the burning of fossil fuel not only damaged the earth but also made everyone outside the house suffer in hot.
Part 3: Help from the doctor
To find a way, Coco found the Doctor for help. The doctor, who has knowledge of synthetic biology, performed an operation on Coco. With the help of the Doctor, Coco did not feel hot at all in the office where he had used to feel scorched. And he found that there were not so many colleagues, but he didn’t lack any, either.
Part 4: The arrival of happiness
According to this, Coco could work without the air-conditioner. There was no sweat from heat, nor conflicts from crowd. Coco and his colleague work happily day by day, and produce a lot of happiness to the world.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html,"75% substitution, the reaction did not work at all, this is most likely due to a lack of ATP - the isothermal PCR buffer contains ATP necessary for recombinase activity, at higher substitutions of blood PCR mix the buffer was not used or was not enough in regards to the amount of ATP present.
We are also working on determining the sensitivity of our amplification. Results will be judged by visualization on agarose gel, if no other means of detection of DNA amplicons are available.
Week 17: Sept 15 - 19
This week we began the process of preparing our synthesized genes for submission to the iGEM registry. We started with the 15 previously successful transformed parts and made overnights of two colonies from each construct. We did this twice for the parts that failed on the first try, with the second time using different colonies than the first. I mini-prepped all successful overnight cultures. There were 3 parts that failed growing in overnight cultures twice so we will come back to those later and try again. With the remaining 12 successful constructs (refer to column 3 or 4 of Table 1), we did a restriction digest. On Monday we will run these samples on a 1% gel and then cut out the correct band, either the part we want (insert) or the vector. This week we also tested the competent E.coli that we made last week and by sent lacZ for sequencing.
Week 18: Sept 22 - 26
This week we continued using the parts we digested last week. We started by doing a gel extraction of the digested samples. We then did a ligation of each sample insert with each of two vectors. We did colony PCR to verify that each colony contained the ligated product that was previously made. The first time we did this only 6 out of 66 colonies that we chose contained the ligated product. We tried a second attempt and another 6 colonies appeared to be successful. We sent 6/12 samples for sequencing so far. Next week we'll be sending the remaining 6 samples for sequencing. So far there are 6 parts total that have been mini-prepped to the step 9. Once the sequencing results are back next week we will have confirmation that these BioBricks are correct and ready to be submitted to the iGEM registry. Next week in addition to sending the remaining 6 samples for sequencing, we will be trying the process all over again to get as many more synthesized genes BioBricked as possible.

When we completed Bio101, the first idea we thought was to give feedback to the public, so we held an activity, dabbed “To Be Scientists Tomorrow”. We invited children and their parents, and then informed them about some knowledge on DNA storage, also displayed our storage system. They were very active talking about the imagination about Bio101 and said that they hoped that files would not be lost.

NEW LEARNING MODE
To build a bridge between the public and biology, we created a new mobile phone game called Bio2048. Not only did we put it onto the Tencent’s App Store for ordinary people to download and play, but also pushed its information in our sina microblog and Qzone to collect feedback. Many people made comments after trying, and most said that the game was attractive for the combination of knowledge and enjoyment. Some thought that our game was lack of description words, therefore, we added introductions to build a learning mode in the game for easier understanding. Integrating the suggestion into Bio2048 makes the game complete.

INTERFACE REDESIGN
In “game-try” activity, someone didn’t know rule of Bio2048. For making the game friendlier, we modified ‘RULE’ interface with operation diagram. We also added more elements to enrich it. We aimed at edutainment, users can gain knowledge and get relaxed by playing Bio2048.
Fig.6.The “RULE” interface redesigned.
We got inspirations from our investigation and interviews, leading us to design Bio101, besides, Bio2048. Also, what we did should be given back to human practices. Thus, there exists bi-directional effect between our projects and human practices.

Sensing
The expression of human sweet taste receptor in yeast
In the sensing part, the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) T1R2 and T1R3 were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae due to its ability to regulate a wide range of cellular processes such as the senses of taste and smell. Moreover, we constructed a mRFP-based assay to achieve proper detection of sweetness responses.
So we had to achieve two goals:
1. To express T1R2 and T1R3 in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
2. Construct a response signal circuit to confirm that our receptors can detect the sweeteners.
Results:
1. Synthesized the gene of human receptors T1R2 and T1R3
2. Expressed the heterologous GPCR in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
3. The engineered yeast with T1R2 and T1R3 can sense the sweeteners.
Details of the results:
1. The gene synthesis of T1R2 and T1R3
GPCR sequences are extracted from NCBI’s NR database. The sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 (ID: 83756 and 80834) responds to diverse stimuli associated with the human sense of sweet taste, such as sucrose, d-tryptophan and aspartame. In reliable expression in Saccharomyces Cerevisiaei, we finished the codon optimization and reverse transcription of protein sequences into DNA sequences on the website http://54.235.254.95/gd/. The sequences of our receptors were established into the parts BBa_K2368003 and BBa_K2368004.
We synthesized the human receptor genes T1R2 and T1R3 using building block which based on overlapping-extension PCR. The PCR result was showed as Fig.9.
Fig. 9 The PCR result of synthetic genes T1R2 (2520 bp) and T1R3 (1989 bp).

Coming from a variety of backgrounds, the team have written up some bios below to introduce you to who we are and what we do. We may be a small team, but we are definitely big on character!
Emily Taylor
Emily is a second year Biochemistry student at the University of Leeds with a particular interest in proteins and nucleosomes, as well as in the field of immunology. Keen on volunteering, Emily hopes to one day work with elephants and children in Thailand. Emily is an ideal member of the iGEM team, being highly organised, hard working and forward thinking. By the end of the project, Emily hopes to have built upon her lab skills and gain research experience in a more realistic, scientific environment.
Jonah Ciccone
Jonah is a third year Biochemist who is also passionate about art, music and karate. As well as bringing his scientific knowledge to the plate; Jonah has been put in charge of the team's artistic direction - a wise choice if you take a look through our YSB Escapades .
Looking to gain further lab experience from the project, he's also keen to delve into the SynBio community.

⇒ Ompa (K103006) was digested with EcoRI and XbaI in a 100μL reaction; the reaction was held for ~3 hours, then inactivated at 80°C for 20 minutes.
⇒ All three components were purified and run on a gel along with a signal peptide (K32015) digestion from like a week ago:
OmpA appears extremely faint, likely due to the failure of the stock solution used.. J04500's PCR worked very well and yields a strong band with little to no mispriming; this will be cut later with EcoRI and SpeI. pBad is a mystery, as neither band corresponds to the correct length of the part. The signal peptide (J32015) is highly concentrated and appears well cut; this can proceed with the ligation tomorrow. pBad is generating two creepy PCR bands and will be discarded.
⇒ To continue, J04500 was cut with EcoRI and SpeI in a 3 hour, 50μL as it was quite concentrated. A gel was run with the result of the digestion compared with a previous, cut stock (less concentrated) as well as the raw PCR product.
⇒ Overnights of the signal peptide, pBad and OmpA were prepared for the hopeful ligation tomorrow.

Figure 2) Planned Caging Positions
Originally intended plan to clone 3 different C - inteins in 4 different postions.
Therefore we designed a fast track cloning strategy with solely two caging positions of one intein in the alpha-helix and two split fluorescent proteins(Figure 3). In case of the S11- inteins, we chose SspDnaX, since they it was described as the most efficient C-terminal S11 intein [11] . Previous studies showed that the amino acid sequence of the J-alpha helix in front of the isoleucine at position 539 (I539) should not be changed, in order to preserve its reactivity to light [10] . However the sequence following I539 can be adapted to small peptide sequence. We caged SspDnaX at the two most extreme positions, believing that those would result in the greatest differences in caging efficiency. The LOV - 12 mutant represents the caging of SspDnaX right after I539, resulting in the deletion of all remaining amino acids (-12) of the J-alpha helix. In the mutant LOV - 6, the short C - intein occupies the SspDnaX at the very end of the helix, resulting in the deletion of only 6 original amino acids (Figure 4).
Figure 3) Actual Caging Position
Plan of the cloned constructs. Only one intein is cloned in 2 different position.
In our sfGFP reconstitution assay, we already established an approach to easily read-out the intein splicing reaction. However in this assay we used the NpuDnaE inteins, which were known to splice even with unnatural exteins as far as the cysteine of the C-terminal extein is present. Therefore we obtained only this one amino acid scar in the spliced product, which can be crucial for the restoration of fluorescence in front of the chromophore region (65-67). It is not known if same assumptions can be made for SspDnax. To test this, we chose one LOV mutant using the sfGFP as split fluorescent protein with only one extein flanking the intein (figure 4, mutant 3). To provide a backup if SspDnaX does not splice with only one extein, we also designed two LOV mutants with split mRFP. In the case of mRFP, we decided for split position 168/169, since"

The protein structure of L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase was constructed by using Amber 14. It is demonstrated in ribbon diagram which is done by interpolating a smooth curve through the polypeptide backbone. The colors indicate the amino acids in the protein structure.
Figure 5: BBa_K2571003 check with FucO left and VR primers. Expected band length: 754 bp. Last three wells show positive results.
We’ve inserted the FucO composite part to pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 backbones. Then, we’ve transformed the construct for submission, BBa_K2571003 , (in pSB1C3)                      to DH5⍺; and the other construct, for our biochemical assay, (in pSB1A3) to KO11. As we isolated the plasmids, we’ve done PCR with FucO left and VR                      primers to test orientation of our parts to the backbone. We expected a band of 754 bp between the FucO left and VR primers and the PCR results confirmed                      our expectations and showed that our parts were correctly inserted and transformed.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are dangerous substances that distort protein based matters by taking electrons (Lu, 2013). The chemical structure of the protein-based                  substances are altered and become dysfunctional because of ROS (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011).
Furthermore; one of the most significant protein-based substance, DNA, gets attacked by OH radicals (Burton & Jauniaux, 2011). However, the reduced form GSH can protect                  the chemical structure of the proteins by donating extra electrons to ROS and free radicals (Lu, 2013).

BBa_K2843000
This part is an improvement of the 2017 East Chapel Hill iGem ""CHOP"" operon. At fluoride concentrations of 2uM and above, the delta-CRCB E. coli strain (strain JW0619-1 from the Yale Coli Genetics Stock Center) will grow on chloramphenicol. This vector is designed with Xhol cutting sites so one may easily remove and replace different segments of the operon to screen for combinations of riboswitch and promoter with highest effectivity.
To summarize, here is how this part functions in the presence of fluoride:
1. delta-CRCB E. coli accumulates fluoride intracellularly due to the lack of the fluoride efflux channel.
2. Fluoride binds to the fluoride riboswitch and activates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme, which allows for bacterial growth on plates that contain the antibiotic chloramphenicol.
BBa_K2843002
This is BBa_K2843002 operon with the ""Fluoride Binding Mutant"", which is a mutant of the fluoride RBS. This served as a control for our experiments because if there is growth of delta-CRCB E. coli on the chloramphenicol plates than this indicates that growth of delta-CRCB is not entirely dependent only on the presence of fluoride."

Our device would be used as an important proactive measure that could protect non-infected people if they are in close proximity to these particular hot spots (e.g. hospitals, airports) where infected mosquitoes are circulating. In scenario 1, these organizations have the resources to respond to the hazards, administer the kits, and analyze the results; making them ideal for Mos(kit)o. In Context 2 , which describes developing countries where access is not as easy and there are no local agencies as mentioned in scenario 1, the Ministry of Health, or equivalent instance, would assume responsibility for administering the kits. Personnel at the local Ministry of Health will be trained to properly set up the trap and on how to use the diagnostic device. We are aware that resources are limited in these settings; therefore, we designed the device to require minimum personnel for operation and to be low cost, user friendly, and safe. We were unable to discuss this specific scenario with a health ministry official to get their feedback, however, based on a conversation with tropical entomologists and the New Orleans Mosquito Control Board, which is solicited by the Brazilian government, we envisioned a situation in which a country receives a report of an outbreak of a vector-borne disease, like zika virus. In that case, the Ministry of Health would respond by requesting a Mos(kit)o device, either from the Mos(kit)o company or possibly a local NGO or CDC, with a stationary trap (for easily accessible areas) or a drone (capable of reaching remote areas). Upon arrival of the kit, trained local authorities will implement the trap in targeted locations and perform the required tests. An additional authorized person reads the results and the data will be entered into mapping software, capable of producing real-time updates. In both scenarios, the trained personnel will only have to inject specific syringes containing the reagents needed to test for various viruses, having no direct interaction with the mosquitoes, which are contained within the trapping device. Following use, the device will be returned to the distributing municipality/agency where it will be washed and reloaded. All waste will be properly treated and disposed of to eliminate the release of any pathogens in the environment. The data will be uploaded into a computer database for further analysis.
Data Management
The data generated from the Mos(kit)o diagnostic device could be used as a global tool assisting with the environmental surveillance of vector-borne diseases. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) is equipped with the resources to best manage, store, and protect the data. The WHO"

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

PROJECT
Overview
Fungal infections have detrimental impacts in agriculture by decreasing crop yields. Particularly, Fusarium wilt, a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum, affects a wide variety of foodstuffs. Current treatments for Fusarium wilt involve the cultivation of resistant crops; however, ever-evolving fungal pathogens can circumvent said resistances and induce blight within the resistant crop strains. As a result, an inherent component of all fungal cell walls, chitin, was targeted to combat fungal infections in plants.  A diversely found glucose-derivative, chitin provides rigidity in all fungal species and also acts as a similar constituent of arthropod and insect exoskeletons and harder external tissues in various organisms. Our proposed mechanism for the antifungal treatment was to degrade chitin through the use of the enzyme chitinase. Various chitinase isozymes act upon the varying chitin structures in different organisms, so chitinases LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 were selected as the chitinases of choice for Fusarium oxysporum.
Procedural Outline
The goal of this project was to engineer a bacterial strain capable of secreting viable chitinase to attack the cellular stability and structures of Fusarium oxysporum, thereby inducing structural collapse of the fungal cell wall. A plasmid containing genes encoding for LbCHI31 production and secretion was used to transform bacteria using standard heatshock and recovery protocols.
Plasmid Design
The pBR322 plasmid was used as a base construct for the plasmid design. When designing the plasmid, the gene sequence for chitinase LbCHI31 was incorporated with a GFP tag and a linker into the plasmid. Since the GFP gene was linked to the LbCHI31, the presence of green fluorescence under UV exposure would indicate successful secretion of the GFP-LbCHI31 complex (i.e., since GFP is secreted, the linked the LbCHI31 product is consequently secreted). A signal peptide following the GFP tag was added and linked to the chitinase in order to signal the E. coli to begin type II secretion. The type II secretion system is generally utilized to secrete degradative enzymes such as chitinase. Additionally, the pBR322 contains inherent ampicillin resistance; as"

Wisconsin-Madison,2009,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#Significane_-_-_TEXT.html,".3). Purification and refining of fuels results in additional carbon emission. Transportation contributes a large fraction to greenhouse gas production and the associated issue of climate change. We believe that this fraction can be drastically reduced.
Expected Consequences
The warming climate is expected to bring about changes associated with perturbations in weather patterns, including: 1) flooding and drought (7); 2) continued desertification of subtropical regions (8); 3) an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (7); 4) an increase in the range of disease vectors such as mosquitoes, which harbor diseases like malaria and dengue fever (9); 5) rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels which reduces the pH of bodies of water (10); and 6) the melting of glacial and polar ice, which will raise sea levels worldwide (8). According to a paper “Extinction risk from climate change” published in Nature, 15-37% of species may be extinct by 2050 due to the effects of climate change (11). Biofuels may pose a long-term solution to global warming by reducing carbon emissions.
Fuel Depletion
Fossil fuels constitute a declining non-renewable resource for which a replacement must be found.  Based on current estimates by the United States Department of Energy, there exist proved reserves for 43 years of oil, 61 years of natural gas, and 148 years of coal at the current rate of consumption in 2006 (21).  However, consumption rates are generally increasing faster than new reserves are being identified, lending a perspective that reserves will be depleted faster than currently estimated.
Water Scarcity
Water is one of the world’s scarcest renewable resources.  Access to drinking water around the world is a continuous problem; approximately 1.1 billion individuals (18% of the world population) lack access to safe drinking water (20).  With the continual increase in population, ground water is already consumed faster than it is replenished, especially in highly developed nations such as United States and China (20).  If water consumption continues at its current rate, it is estimated that by 2025 nearly two-thirds of the world population will experience at least moderate water stress (20).
BIOFUELS AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
Biofuels are energy sources recovered from living or recently dead biological matter. Although biofuels may be used in many of the same ways fossil fuels are used today, they have particular promise as fuels for transportation. Biofuels created from agriculturally grown crops are known as agrofuels, and include: sugarc"
Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Design#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,"Es have demonstrated some antagonistic affinity for the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen-alpha receptor (hER-α) [23] [24], making it a viable candidate for detecting plasticizers.
The estrogen receptor is a member of the intracellular receptor family and exists in two different forms, hER-α and hER-β, with significant overlapping sequence homology. Each receptor shares a common architecture consisting of five domains; the N-terminal A/B region able to regulate gene transcription in absence of a ligand, the C-domain able to bind to a designated DNA sequence (DBD) and a hinge region D (DBD) that connects the C-domain and the ligand binding domain (LBD) E [26]. The mechanism of gene transactivation by the estrogen receptor has been studied in detail through analysis of the ligand-induced conformational change of the LBD. The LBD has a similar organization to that of the other nuclear receptor LBDs, with a three-layered antiparallel α-helical sandwich motif, for a total of 11 α-helices (H1-11) with one additional anti-parallel β-sheet flanking the arrangement (S1-2). The central core, located between the two outer helical layers, constitutes a wedge-shaped molecular scaffold to bind the ligand [27]. Upon interaction between the binding site and a ligand, a sizeable conformational change occurs at the C-terminal helix H12 to modify the action at the DNA-interface. An agonistic ligand spatially displaces H12 to fit snugly over the cavity whereas an antagonistic ligand prevents such confirmation and instead forces the helix to reposition through a 130° degree rotation toward the N-terminus [27][28]. Such displacement of H12 has been utilized in complementation assays as a molecular switch. Complementation of a split protein fused to each respective side of a truncated hER-α LBD is made possible upon antagonist association with the binding site as the termini are subsequently brought in close proximity to one another [29] [30] [31].
Figure 3: 3D structure of the human estrogen receptor alpha ligand-binding domain (in complex with estradiol), a domain found in the transcriptional transactivator hER-α spanning 300 amino acids. The ligand-binding domain consists of a deep and promiscuous ligand-binding pocket consisting of a three-layered antiparallel α-helical sandwich motif. Upon recognition of a ligand, helix H12 will change conformation in"

E. coli Bio-Thermometer
 Introduction
            A biological thermometer would ideally be a simple, accurate and easily observable register of the organism’s environment.  A basic version is comprised of E. coli cells that respond to differences in temperature by producing different fluorescent proteins.  It is essentially cells that can appear blue or green or red depending on the temperature they are exposed to.
            The TU Delft 2008 team has produced a number of RNA thermometers, with varying levels of effectiveness.  They retrieved natural RNA thermometers from three species, then sequenced and redesigned them to test for temperature variability range.  They have produced temperature-sensitive RNA biobricks that include the ribosome binding site and can prevent the SD sequence for the next part from being read.  This is useful because it provides temperature control for any output.
 
 
Figure 1. General Temperature-Sensitive RNA Thermometer
 
 
            Combining this with activators and repressors produces temperature-dependent responses.  For the system to turn reporters on and off, multiple activators and repressors are used to provide the different states.  For instance, going from a low to a high temperature, the lowest state (cyan), must be turned off and stay off; the middle state (green) must be both turned on and then off, and the highest state (red), must be turned on only during high temperatures.  Ideally only one colour would be present at any stable state.
Using two of the RNA thermometers developed by TU Delft 2008, we can produce a system with three different states spaced along a temperature gradient.  Below 32 oC, cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) is produced under the control of a LacI promoter.  Both the LuxR activator for green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the LasR activator for red fluorescence protein (RFP), are unable to be translated at this low temperature, and thus the system glows blue.  Above 32 oC but before reaching 37 oC, two things change.  The LacI repressor can now be translated thereby shutting CFP off.  As well, the activator for GFP is produced changing the system to green.  After "

Lisa Oberding
I have just graduated from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology. This is my first year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. Outside of the lab I enjoy snowboarding in the Rockies (sliding down the mountain on my face), camping (being chased by angry insects), reading, and drawing (possibly the only two safe hobbies I have- unless you count paper cuts). On the team this year I have mostly been a part of the desulfurization project which aims at removing sulfur from hydrocarbons, as well as helping out with a transposon library screen for a naphthenic acid sensitive promoter element for the biosensor.
Mike Mooney
I am a biochemistry student entering into the fourth and hopefully final year of my undergraduate degree. I am not yet certain what I'm going to do with this degree, but I have lofty aspirations to go into dentistry in the long term. More likely, I will end up pursuing higher education in biochemistry. iGEM is my first genuine (non-class based) lab experience and has imbued me with the wondrous powers of science. I am very excited to gain some useful and practical knowledge of lab work. In what little spare time I enjoy, I like to draw pictures of things, write about other things, and lie around loudly lamenting how busy I usually am.
Stephanie Willatt
I am going into my third year of biological sciences specializing in Botany. This is my first summer working in a research lab and I am excited about this new experience.  I will mainly be working in the wet lab component. During the summer I hope to gain new knowledge about synthetic biology as well as learn new lab techniques.  Outside of school, I am interested in music, playing the bassoon, cycling and snowboarding.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," that encodes for sfGFP. The latter is under control of a pluxR promoter, hence it will be transcribed in the presence of LuxR and Lux. To assess crosstalk and leakiness we conducted multiple experiments: after adding one of the three AHLs to the cultures we analyzed the raise in sfGFP production using a microtiterplate reader. In a first step we measured the dose response of constructs with different ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and with or without riboregulator. We could observe differences not only in sensitivity, but also in leakiness; some strains expressed GFP even without AHL induction. To give an example: we evaluated the sensitivity of the siG0024 strain to different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (LuxI product) and compared its characteristics to  those of other constructs. Additionally, we measured the sensitivity of siG0024 to 3OC12-HSL (LasI product) and C4-HSL (RhlI product). Indeed, we could observe the induction of sfGFP transcription by comparably low levels of 3OC12-HSL. Crosstalk can be observed between the Las and the Lux system. To simulate a situation most similar to the final experiment, we added the diluted supernatant of AHL producer cells to the test cultures. However, we could not detect any GFP production as reaction to the supernatant. We assume that the AHL concentration is not high enough to induce transcription. By constructing stronger RBSs on the producer plasmids we aim at increasing the AHL production. All these informations we will use to design a system tailored to our plans.
Summary of cross-talk experiments results
The figure shows the dose response of xxx to 3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL and C4-HSL. Both 3OC12-HSL and 3OC6-HSL induce production of GFP, although at different concentrations. This is an example for cross talk between the lux and the las system.

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#ProjectDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,", which may facilitate formation of tertiary structures. Following ligation, RNA samples should be run on a gel by electrophoresis to separate the fully ligated RNA-splint-linker species from the smaller splint and linker fragments. The size difference between the unligated and ligated RNA may be too small to resolve separately on a gel. However, they can be isolated by using oligo-dT columns. The splint and linker provide the ligated RNA with a poly-A tail which can bind onto the column.
The sample can then be translated in vitro using commercial kits. It is important to translate the RNA after purifying the sample through oligo-dT columns, since keeping unligated RNA will reduce translation efficiency. High salt concentrations used during oligo-dT column purification could also disrupt the conjugated proteins. The protein-RNA samples can then be separated from untranslated RNA by pulling down the translated FLAG tag using antibodies or affinity columns. Finally, purified protein-RNA samples can be reverse transcribed into protein-DNA samples. While converting RNA to DNA earlier may decrease the chance of allowing RNase or harsh experimental conditions to degrade RNA, the order described provides the greatest efficiency of reverse transcription by removing competing incomplete samples. Steps following translation should all be done with as few freeze/thaw cycles in between. Completing the remaining procedures in one shot is preferred.
Screening the sample
Side (left) and bottom (right) views of Mtd trimer complex in green with variable repeat region highlighted in purple.
We plan on using the final protein-DNA library to screen for Mtd variants that can bind to proteins expressed on the surface of E. coli. If successful, our results would highlight the remarkable structural properties of the Mtd, and provide evidence that the DiversiPhage system could potentially be used to generate antibody-like proteins that can bind to specified targets. We are not immediately concerned about what protein the Mtd will specifically bind to, since binding to any surface protein on E. coli will demonstrate a change in specificity from its natural target. As a negative control, we will use the wild-type Mtd in the same screen against E. coli. 3D images of Mtd-target interactions suggest that the Mtd forms into a trimer through interactions at the static scaffold region. The mutagenic islands only modify the variable binding region. Since it is possible that each of the three associated monomers has a unique variable region, the possible permutations of complexes may enable binding to an even greater range of targets.

Light Sensing-Imaging System
Construction of Blue Light Sensing and Imaging System
Because of the complication of blue light circuit, work on this circuit began firstly. In the beginning, K592020 which is a blue light sensor output containing a FixK2 blue light sensing system and producing amilCP was constructed.
The culture of bacteria went like this:
And this is the bands exhibition of K592020 and K592016, another blue light sensor and RR with RBS, after electrophoresis, quite satisfied as we expected.
The electrophoresis result of other key parts in blue light sensing-imaging system including B0015, S04617 and K592024. The part I13502 which expresses mRFP was run with them.
Later, construction of the whole parts completed with validation of sequence verification.
Test of Blue Light Sensing and Imaging System
1.Test in solid media.
Without induced expression, bacteria containing blue light sensing-imaging system grew up and developed in the LB media. Then we divided the media into two regions, one of them receive blue light simulation while the other one keep darkness by a base plate to block blue light. The testing conditions showed in the following:
After 12 hours development, the result showed the bacteria could produce blue chromoprotein when stimulated by blue light and keep its color in the darkness.
2.Test in liquid media.
The idea of control-expriment is the same as in solid media. We prepared two test tubes containing equivalent bacterium solution. The test was conducted at 18:00, August 4th when one of them was put under blue light and the other was developed in the darkness.
At 11:00, August 5th, the tube stimulated under blue light turned light blue while the other one kept the original color.
After 24 hours, The blue bacteria showed evidently. Using centrifuge to get the bacteria showed extremely distinct blue chromoprotein expression base on blue light activation was come true.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html,", modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored"

2. Complete Judging Form
The judging form was completed and sent off on the 20th of September 2011.
3. Team Wiki
We, the Glasgow iGEM Team 2011, have created a colourful wiki, containing a summary of the project and information on all biobricks and constructs that we have created, as well as information on other interesting results and experiences we have had.
4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
We have created a poster and will present our project at the regional iGEM jamboree in Amsterdam on the 1st of October 2011.
5. At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device.
We have created multiple new biobricks, including the two amazing and extremely practical fluorescent reporters LOV2 and iLOV that function anaerobically and are very well suited to tag proteins due to their small size. On top of that we have created biobricks of the surfactant Latherin , and of c-di-GMP Phosphodiesterase that have multiple possible applications in synthetic biology. Currently we are awaiting the synthesis of our very own Multiple Cloning Site biobrick that will significantly ease testing and characterisation of novel biobricks for all future team by providing a pre-existing cassette that allows novel genes to be inserted easily and in a single ligation.  Not only did we create novel, functional biobricks, we are also providing the registry with an all new chassis, E.coli Nissle 1917 , which is easily transformable, compatible with standard E.coli constructs, non-pathogenic and forms biofilms!

Clinical Case Report:
Symptoms – patient can be located in a lab alarmingly often (mainly after 6:00 pm). He gets really excited by the look of several E. coli colonies on a LB Amp petri dish early in the morning. Searching of his computer showed six different cloning programs installed and recently used. Furthermore the patient was able to memorize and reproduce four symbol strings with length up to 5000 (plus finding small 6 or 8 elements palindromic motifs inside them).
Diagnosis – patient meets all diagnostically important criteria for a severe case of gene engineering obsession.
Prognosis – unfavourable. No treatment possibilities.
Future course of the disorder – it will involve contribution to different synthetic biology projects and initiatives. Participation in iGEM is both expected and inevitable.
Interests, hobbies, leisure time
Mainly natural sciences – everything from quarks to the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall (yet living things with editable genomes come first). Outside science – gamebooks and computers.
I don’t forget that...
If you can amplify it – you can clone it!

Neurobiology: About
Neuroscience or neurobiology is the scientific study of the nervous system. Being among the most vibrant areas in biological sciences, they are promising in pushing new frontiers in biotechnology. New discoveries in these fields usually lead to realization on how little we know about the whole system. Neurobiology is a truly challenging area but at the same time very exciting. Once we decrypt the mysteries within the brain, we will be able to treat patients with neurological diseases with better approaches.
The Sparkle When Synthetic Biology Meets Neurobiology
Professor Edward Boyden leads the Synthetic Neurobiology Group to develop tools for controlling and observing the dynamic circuits of the brain. They use the neurotechnologies to understand how cognition and emotion arise from brain network operation and to enable systematic repair of intractable brain disorders. The tools invented by his group include a suite of 'optogenetic' tools, which have been used in many labs around the world, for activating or silencing neurons with light. These tools enable the assessment of how specific neurons contribute to brain functions. The sparkle of synthetic biology and neurobiology shone in one daily conversation written in Professor Edward Boyden’s blog, ‘A few weeks back, Biological Engineering department chair Doug Lauffenburger declared to me, ""What you're doing is synthetic neurobiology,""’. And this drew parallels between his lab's work and synthetic biology.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," can be gathered. We imagine that BioBricks in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, can be directly mixed with a backbone vector. This will make assembly of expression vectors possible in only a few hours. All our parts in form of PCR-products, should be distributed in microtiter plates, like the original iGEM BioBrick kit. The parts in Plug 'n' Play kit are directly ready for cloning. Furthermore, the ""Plug ’n’ Play"" kit will contain back-up plasmids of all parts to ensure amplification from a mutation free template if needed.
Applications
The Plug ‘n’ Play assembly standard can be applied in a lot of different contexts. Use of the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard is especially advantageous for high throughput projects. In a previous study by Hussam H. Nour-Eldin et. al. (5), they were able to clone 240 genes from a library into an expression vector in only three weeks with efficiency close to 95% (5).
Below we have listed some different applications in which our standard assembly would be particularly useful.
Construction of DNA libraries.
High-troughput cloning.
Development of vector systems for gene expression analysis.
Development of genetic tools for eukaryotes.
Development of reporter systems.
To proof our concept, we developed a reporter system for mammalian cells and for Aspergillus nidulans .

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," been heavily criticised due to the failure of researchers, industry and public authorities to “address concerns prevailing among the general public”. In order to prevent a scenario like this, we recognise the value of engaging the wider public to understand their concerns and then to act upon these in an open and honest way. Our ultimate aim is to create an accessible platform to enable an open dialogue about concerns and solutions between researchers, industries, public authorities and the general public. Our public outreach enabled us to do this on a small scale; feedback gained from patients and the general public highlighted the huge concerns about the safety of a GM probiotic. In response to this, we modified our design to incorporate kill switches and performed additional safety analysis that was presented on our Wiki and at further public outreach events. Our openness about the safety measures we have taken in light of public feedback demonstrates how collaboration between researchers and the public can be achieved to fully meet the needs and address the concerns of the wider public.
The public outreach events that we organised were successful at engaging individuals and increasing their level of understanding of these issues, although a more sustained approach will be needed to educate all members of the public and healthcare professionals. We have created a Long-term Public Education Plan, which outlines a series of steps that will be required to enable the widespread education of the general public, clinicians and patients. The Long-term Public Education Plan provides further guidance for how to maintain an open platform for the public and clinicians to express their concerns about using GM probiotics, thus ensuring that public concerns are understood and acted upon throughout the future.
Our Long-term Education Plan can be viewed here:

Probiotic Information Leaflet
Having identified the lack of public knowledge about probiotics and genetic engineering, we developed an informative leaflet aimed at providing a basic level of understanding to the lay public. The leaflet, shown below, was distributed at our outreach events, such as at the New Scientist Live event and at our stall at Oxford University Museum of Natural History.

Project Achievements
1.
Constructed a multifunctional protein of interest via molecular biological methods, and introduced the constructed plasmids into the engineered bacteria for protein expression. (Learn more)
2.
Searched for methods and the best conditions for the extraction of each protein. (Learn more)
3.
Demonstrated a quick and stable crosslinking process of Triple SpyTag-SUP and Triple SpyTag-mSA with Triple SpyCatcher via covalent bonds. We also optimized this reaction concerning the relevant parameters such as temperature, pH, etc.. (Learn more)
4.
Demonstrated effective adsorption of uranyl ions by monomeric Triple SpyTag-SUP or polymer network containing the SUP module under a number of conditions. The adsorption was highly efficient and fast, not only under experimental conditions but also in simulated seawater or lake water containing uranium pollution. (Learn more)
5.
Attached biotin to amino-coated magnetic beads and achieved clearance of the polymer network formed via the crosslinking of Triple SpyTag-SUP and Triple SpyTag-mSA with Triple SpyCatcher with a magnet. (Learn more)
6.
Set up a signal peptide library and screened for optimally suited signal peptides in order to efficiently secrete the proteins of interest. We found two signal peptides of high efficiency - those derived from OmpA and LtIIb. (Learn more)
7.
Used all the above-mentioned experiments together to demonstrate that the complete Uranium Reaper system, consisting of Triple SpyTag-SUP, Triple SpyTag-mSA, Triple SpyCatcher and biotin-coated magnetic beads, could effectively handle uranium pollution under simulated real-life conditions in about 2 hours. We aimed to optimize this strategy and hoped it could be implemented as a uranyl removal kit. (Learn more)

Summary: As our simulation program becomes more and more mature, we encounter more problems in consistency of our database. We all want to make major changes and make it right this time, but sadly we don’t have the time. So we make minor changes, add patches to fix the bugs, but we have to let go of the unconsistency in substituent, compartment and other places. Now the DB looks not beautiful or elegant, but usable. This is good enough since our first goal now is to make our software work, and a DB that can properly describe simple reaction networks should be enough. We plan to leave major changes to further development.
Most of our team members work intensively during the 7 days off, and the achievement of their work is rich. DB of both EFP-Lausanne and Synchronized Ecoli are basically finished. Tables and graphs on DB structure has been published. Our software core seems finally begin to function right. UI is under constructing. All the codes are now on github.
We schedule our trip and book plane tickets to Beijing, Chicago and Boston. Jue Wang is now in charge of money and team wear.
We dined together on Oct 1, but without a relaxed mind, it was not fun for me. What actually thrills me up is to explore my potential and to find how much can be done in the 7 days. I do have fun working beyond my limit.

Positive team dynamics is key to a successful project. After more than half a year of working and spending time together, we made an idea of how to combine our strengths and minimize our weaknesses. Because we have team members with     both strong and no biotechnology backgrounds, we exercised science communication - an essential part in developing our project such that its usefulness is understood to non-scientific stakeholders. After practicing this type of communication in the     team, we are better prepared to achieve impacting outreach efforts.
Building consensus. Successful science communication helps in building consensus between members with different backgrounds. In our case, while some team members support the usefulness and marketability of the solution, others     ensure scientific soundness and validity. Productive conflicts that occur shape our project into something meaningful from several different perspectives.
Project limitations and acknowledgements
We acknowledge the limitations of our current team and project structure. First of all, for both cases of future failure or success, the structure and strategy of the company would need to be revised and adapted. Because prediction is nearly impossible,   we acknowledge that the proposals in the business plan fit the present, but are fully subject to change depending on the evolution of events.
We identify some of the limitations that may hinder future business development.
For constructing the printer, we lack electronic, mechanical and industrial designers. This problem can be mitigated by co-developing the 3D printer with an external company or collaborating with Industrial Design within TU Delft.
We have limited work experience in business and industrial setting.
As students, our knowledge and professional network is still in development. Despite our large academic network (TU Delft, other iGEM teams, supporting organizations, etc.), our ties with industry are still thin. However, with networking efforts,       this downside can be reduced during, and after starting the business.

Outreach
Reaching out to the public in order to show the opportunities synthetic biology has. All quotes in our website are from interviews or questionnaire responses.
Synthetic biology has a lot of opportunities, for example in the improvement of healthcare and the production of sustainable energy. However, the idea that we could create ""new"" life with synthetic biology, is for a lot of people kind of frightening. Within our outreach part, we taught the public the basic concepts of synthetic biology. Moreover, we showed that the improvement of living creatures, by human kind, has been performed for ages. Finally, we discussed our project and its possible applications. Due to the multidisciplinary team, we already practiced the science communication by discussing everything in such a way that the whole team"

A Brief Introduction
to Allergy Testing Master
Histamine increases significantly in blood when allergy happens. So, we modifidied the pheromone pathway in the yeast to test histamine release in blood sample under one specific allergen. The pheromone receptor ste2 in original pathway is replaced by human histamine receptor H3 or H4. In order to reinforce the coupling between H3/H4 and yeast G-protein, C-terminal of α subunit of G-protein is modified by replacing several amino acids from the homologous protein in human. EGFP is pludged afterward the  promoter Fus1 as a reporter gene. Sufficient works substantiate our modifications. Then We construct models describing the relationship between histamine and EGFP intensity, which make contributions to the analysis of diagnosis credence.Besides, we design an integrated kit for the whole process of the blood collection, testing reaction and dignosis.Diagnosis result, after being calculated on our server, will be sent to terminals as smart phones, which makes our project possible for domestic uses.
