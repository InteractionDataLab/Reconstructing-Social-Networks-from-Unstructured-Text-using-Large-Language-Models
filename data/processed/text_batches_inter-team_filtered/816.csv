In summary, a new gene to be added in the system should have the following standard structure (A):
An attP sequence different from the one that was used just before,
A Lox sequence (Lox sequences should be added in the same order they come in the Lox Array),
The operon to be expressed,
An attB sequence, orthogonal to the attP used for integration,
A selection system (not depicted here for clarity).
When the phage PhiC31 integrase is expressed, this plasmid will be integrated in the locus (B). The CRISPR-Cas9 system from S. pyogenes should work well for selecting the cells who integrated the plasmid(Jiang, Bikard 2013), as the attB contains the protospacer adjacent motif ""NGG"" next to the two central bases (Mojica 2009). It is therefore possible to kill the cells who still have an intact attB site, just by using CRISPR spacers targeting the following sequences:
GCGGGTGCCAGGGCGTGCCCTTGGGCTCCC for killing cells who have not integrated anything in the first attB version,
GCGGGTGCCAGGGCGTGCCCCCGGGCTCCC, for the second attB version.
It has the advantage of leaving no scar, thus reducing the number of recombination sites present in the locus.
After integration, the new cassette becomes a new part of the system (C).
Division of labour
Now that the different genes have been added to the chassis, it is time to see it in action.
The CRE recombinase will cut the LoxP sites in the middle, remove the region in-between, and join the two remaining halves of LoxP sites together (Nagy 2000). This only occurs if the overlap sequence are exactly identical (Missirlis 2006). This means that, in the picture of the right, only LoxP sites of same colour would recombine. Given the configuration of this system, any LoxP recombination event would result in the loss of several other LoxP site, in a such way that further recombinations are not possible. The pair of LoxP sites that undergo recombination is therefore chosen randomly by each cell.
Depending on which region is excised, one random coding region settles next to the promoter and starts to be expressed. For a"

Incidentally, the most important amino acids were confirmed computationally using a multiple sequence alignment of 8 different AimR homologs. A simple, but powerful way to investigate the effect of peptide binding on the AimR conformation, is to simply overlay the peptide bound and the apo form of the AimR homolog. This was used very effectively in the paper to show that the effect of peptide binding on the AimR structure was very different for spAimR and phAimR. Whereas peptide binding only causes a slight opening of the DNA binding domain in spAimR, it causes a bigger structural change and even dissociation into monomers for phAimR [2]. The paper also demonstrated that this different mechanism has an impact on infection dynamics and thus regulation, underlining the need for deep structural understanding of the AimR homologs prior to use in a synthetic context.
In summary, our work on peptide recognition and conformational changes induced by it on phAimR got overshadowed by the very of the newly obtained experimental structures of phAimR and spAimR. Nevertheless, we have discussed the strategies used in these paper and how they can be applied to obtain detailed information on any AimR homolog and suspect that this will be useful for the iGEM community.
Analyzing DNA binding modes of AimR by docking
In order to expand on the results obtained by [2, 3], we wanted to see if we could computationally predict the exact binding site of phAimR and spAimR, the latter of which was delineated in some detail in [3]. Knowing the exact binding site will greatly facility the use of AimR as a synthetic tool and is very cumbersome to obtain experimentally, partially due to the low number of known binding sites which precludes statistical analysis of ChIP data. As a consequence, cumbersome DNAse footprinting assays or equivalent methods have to be used. Afterwards, we also wanted to assess the binding strength and visualize the interactions between protein and cognate DNA to see if AimR binds its site strongly enough to be repurposed into a repressor (see 4.1). The cognate DNA used for docking was pAimX(full) and pAimX(short) used by the experimental team. The pAimX promoter sequences were first converted into 3D structures using the 3D-DART server [13]. This 3D structure was subsequently docked with the phA"

Prediction 2025: MTD based technology used to create teeth cleaning and teeth whitening treatments. The public gradually accepts the use of cosmetological biotechnology.
Prediction 2050: Use of cosmetolgcial treatment expands to modifying melanin to produce unnatural pigment. Public backlash causes new type of discrimination emerge against modified individuals. This in turn causes a schism within the modified community between bleach-skinned Bleakers and obsidian-skinned Inkers.
It’s 5 AM, April 15th 2047. It’s been 7 hours since the mock protests gave away to riots, and it’s not letting up. War of the fashions between the Inks and the Bleaks. A pale imitation of racial conflict of the previous century. And I find myself a Bleaker awake in a pile of Inked bodies. The streets look like chess board peppered in blood.
I remember how all of this began. A harmless shock statement to offend the common sensibilities. Starting with decades old viral treatment to sterilize and bleach the teeth as a basis, a group of grad students took it a step further by allowing it to modify genetic and epigenetic elements of the skin and making it open source. In the beginning, many variations of the treatment floated around such as chrome and glow-in-the-dark. Some were carcinogenic; others simply didn’t catch on.
Natural selection took course, and only the most popular variations remained: alabaster white or pitch black. White was popular with  wanted to have the image of a rebel without losing their clean-cut image. People who modified their skin wanted to look intimidating and offensive to the public. In retrospect, I think people liked the monochromatic simplicity.
I chose the color white because my girlfriend decided to be an Inker. Black and white go well together you see.
Naturally, the public was outraged. Accusations were made that we were"

The main idea at the start of our project was to reduce biofilm formation in bacteria and thus make them more susceptible to antibiotics. During the course of the Human Practices part of our project we learned a great deal about other areas in need of an effective biofilm reducing method, such as dental care, diabetes, prostheses surgery, diagnostics and aquaculture. A variety of treatments for biofilm are available as of today, however they all seem to have their limitations. Our approach to biofilm removal is unique in that bacteriophages have an ability to evolve, meaning that bacteria most likely wouldn’t be able to develop resistance for a long time. If successful, our method could be a potential breakthrough in the field of biofilm-reducing agents.
We want to thank all the experts for taking the time to talk with us. Their perspectives opened up our eyes for a whole new world of biofilm-related problems that we had no idea about prior to our project. We also got quite a few useful tips that we implemented in our lab procedures, such as the use of Crystal Violet Assay for biofilm quantification.
Marthe Lind Kroknes
Biomedical laboratory scientist at St.Olavs hospital
Conclusion for Integrated HP
Initially we wanted to find one area of application, but at the beginning we were not aware of the broadness of issues caused by biofilm.
Marthe gave valuable information that made it clear that infections related to prosthetics is a problem caused by biofilm.
To learn more about different aspects of this problem, she told us to contact Eivind Witsø, an orthopaedic surgeon and Kåre Bergh, a microbiologist. This way we could learn about how bacteria interacts in a biofilm and an orthopaedics view as well.
These interviews provided valuable insights in assessing the applicability of our project. Biofilm is hard to discover and diagnose, and therefore hard to treat. It requires extensive research to discover a delivery method for our CRISPR-system that is safe and usable. In addition we need to know that biofilm is present in the first place and the nature of the bacteria.
Key insight
Biofilm increases the risk of protheses-related infections.
Surgery might be a new application for the project, mainly regarding implants and prostheses.
An infection related to an implant has big consequences for the patients, and the surgery has to be redone. There is no"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
How to create products based on database description?
In MoDeL frame, products are composed of both definite parts and ST parts. The sources of ST parts are defined in component listOfTransferTable. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, A-B, where A and B are both NST parts. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be A and B. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products as expected are connected by the tree node. To find products with correct structure, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.

The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except"

Preparation
The Lysozyme Stock Solution was made on the 7th of August .
L-alanine
We need:
10mM L-alanine 0.01M L-alanine
We made 0.03L (30ml) of 0.05M L-alanine which we filter sterilised.
The amount of powdered L-alanine needed to make 30ml of 0.05M L-alanine solution is:
MW * Desired Volume (L) * Desired Molarity (M)  89.09* 0.03L * 0.05M = 0.134g
Our final solution volume inclusive of L-alanine is desired to be 1ml. Therefore, the amount of L-alanine stock solution to add, such that the final concentration of L-alanine is 0.01M is:
0.05M (Stock solution) / 0.01M (Desired Molarity) = 5 In order to obtain a solution with a final concentration of 0.01M, the stock solution needs to be diluted 5 times. Desired volume = 1ml 1000ul / 5 = 200ul
200ul of L-alanine stock solution should be added to the buffer and lysozyme solution to make up approximately 1ml.
Final Volume = 1ml Volume of buffer solution = 1000ul - 200ul = 800ul Since 1ml of buffer solution requires 40ul of lysozyme stock solution, 800ul / 1000ul = 0.8 0.8 * 40ul = 32ul
Therefore, 800ul of buffer solution requires 32ul of lysozyme stock solution.
Note
Due to previous calculation errors, only 4ul of stock lysozyme was added to a ml of buffer solution. Instead, 40ml of stock lysozyme should have been added. As lysozyme is added to disrupt the bacterial cell wall, 4ul may not have been sufficient.

Approach
Originally, it was intended to implement bacterial nanowires from G. sulfurreducens into E. coli. Through research, it was found that the Bielefeld iGEM team from 2013 had come to the conclusion, that this task was too comprehensive to undertake in the limited time of an iGEM project. However, a different approach was deviced, as postdoc Oona Snoeyenbos-West suggested us to use G. sulfurreducens as the model organism for our MFC.
It was then decided to work on optimisation of the G. sulfurreducens by increasing the electrical conductivity of its endogenous nanowires. To achieve this, synthesis of the pilA genes from G. metallireducens was ordered, which was used to create a BioBrick. Using the same approach for homologous recombination as in the dorm"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#development of new methods_-_-_TEXT.html," of these restriction enzymes will recognize their respective recognition sequences if the basepair between isoG and isoCm is present at this position.              For good annealing efficiency, it is necessary to add the two oligo strands together in equal molar amounts. The concentration can be calculated by the OD260 value, while an  OD260 of 1 equals 33 µg ml-1 (NEB calculator, September 2017) and the molecular mass of each oligo.

Figure 1:Sequenzes of M.A.X targets mutA, mutT, mutG ad mutC with relevant restriction sites as well as the sequence of UBP_target.
All reactions showed a nearly complete alignment. We prosecuted further experiments with the aqua annealing in order to avoid affecting subsequent digestion reactions by influencing the buffer conditions.
Subsequently, we tested different amounts of annealed DNA, varying from 50 µmol  L-1 to 0.25 µmol L-1, which still shows visible bands on the gel.
After first results, a final annealing concentration of 0.5 µmol L-1 seems to be a good choice in terms of visibility and low DNA quantity for complete digestion. For the following annealing reactions, 1 µmol L-1 of ssDNA was used to get 0.5 µL  L-1 of annealed dsDNA.
Restriction digest
The DNA strands were designed such that the partial restriction sites of four different restriction enzymes are located at the same position. In case of a mutation, we can validate to which base the unnatural base mutated without sequencing it. To test the practicability and quality of the restriction system, we performed several test restriction digests.
To ensure the digestion is complete, we calculated the amount of DNA which is digested per unit of enzyme in 1 hour at 37 °C. 1 unit is defined as the amount of restriction enzyme needed to digest 1 µg of lambda DNA. The lambda DNA consists of 48,502 bp (NEB) , which equals 1.99 ∙ 1010 molecules per µL. Depending on the sum of recognition sites of each enzyme, we calculated the cuts per hour of each enzyme.

BUCT-China,2014,Team:BUCT-China#small-dialogpj4_-_-_TEXT.html," references therein), and the mechanism of Hg(II) resistance is now well known (reviewed most recently by Barkay et al. (2003)).
In the mer operon from Tn501, MerR binds to operator DNA within a divergent promoter and regulates both its own expression and  expression of the downstream structural genes. The MerR family of metal-binding, metal-responsive proteins is unique in that they activate transcription from unusual promoters and coordinate metals through cysteine residues. They have conserved primary structures yet can effectively discriminate metals in vivo.
Activation of transcription from the PmerT promoter by MerR in response to Hg(II) is hypersensitive (Ralston &O’Halloran 1990; Rouch et al. 1995), with virtually total induction of promoter activity occurring across a very narrow Hg(II) concentration rang. MerR has a strong selectivity for Hg(II) (Ralston & O’Halloran 1990)and Hg(II) has a very high affinity for MerR (Shewchuk et al. 1989b).
The model for regulation of the mer promoter
The current model for MerR activation of transcription proposes that expression of MerR (in the absence of MerR and Hg (II) in the cell) proceeds from the PmerR promoter. In the absence of Hg(II), the MerR homodimer binds to the operator region within  the divergent  promoter  with binding centered on the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence between the -35 and -10 sequences of  PmerT, slightly repressing transcription of the structural gene promoter, and repressing transcription of merR from the PmerR promoter. This is probably due to MerR interfering with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding, or open complex formation. PmerT is unusual, it has a 19 bp spacing between the -35 and -10 sites , rather than the 16–18 bp  spacing found in most prokaryotic promoters (Harley & Reynolds 1987). This makes PmerT suboptimal for RNAP recognition of, and binding to, the -35 and -10 sequences, preventing formation of the open complex and transcriptional activation (see Browning & Busby 2004). In the absence of Hg(II), the tight binding of the apo-MerR homodimer to PmerT causes a further bending of the promoter DNA to itself, making it even less ideal for RNAP binding (Ansari et al. 1995)."
Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," higher concentration, the distribution shifts to the right till reaching saturation. (TRE-EBFP2N:IntN and TRE-EBFP2C:IntC group is displayed as an example)
The shift, however, is only intuitive. We need more accurate methods to study the quantitative properties. To do this, we plot transfer functions of each group. Transfer function demonstrates the relation between the input level (Dox concentration) and the output level (amount of florescent protein). Plot the function, and the shape of the curve is highly informative.
The transfer functions of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Receptor_-_-_TEXT.html,"iu and Patiño, 1993).
For our measurement system we decided to use membrane progestin receptors (mPR) of Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio as progestin detectors / “sniffers”. In the end when our system is ready for use we will analyze the properties of both mPRs (denoted mPR Xl and mPR Dr) and decide which one suits our needs best. Once progestin binds to the mPR the FET3 gene promoter (Pfet3) will be repressed by an endogenous signaling molecule from the PAQR-pathway of our chassis (S. cerevisiae). As a result the expression of downstream genes of Pfet3 will stop. In order to receive a positive feedback when progestin is detected we need to invert the receptor signal – therefore we have combined Pfet3 with a repressor that represses the promoter of our reporter.
The mPRs themselves are regulated by the constitutive promoter of the ADH1 gene (Padh1), which we created by PCR of yeast DNA. The DNA-sequence of our Padh1 is identical to BBa_J63005 .
Additional information:
The FET3 protein is an essential element of S. cerevisiae’s iron metabolism. FET3 is a multicopper oxidase that is responsible for high-affinity ferrous iron (Fe(II)) uptake in yeast (Askwith et al., 1994). FET3 is metalloregulated which means that FET3 is expressed when intracellular metal levels (e.g. zinc, iron) are low but repressed when there is an abundance of metals (Lyons et al., 2004). Since iron is a main cause for FET3 repression all measurements with our system must be conducted in low iron medium (LIM).

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids copy numbers will lead to different RFP intensity. More plasmids copies, more RFP expressed.
At the same time, we constructed the constitutive promoter with in-promoter (Fig. 12) on the plasmids with different copy numbers to see the express of the RFP started by in-promoter.
Fig. 12 the circuit constructed on different plasmids.
4. Employed different RBS and promoters with different strengths to change the inhibitor
In order to achieve the goal of regulating the threshold of plasmid number and finally control its number to meet different needs, we decided to set up different groups consist of different RBS and promoters with different strength
Table 6. The strengths and efficiencies of different promoters and RBS
Fig. 13 Constitutive circuits to reappear the threshold concentration of inhibitors. Only few will be selected and used to prove the concept of plasmid sensing.
By now, we can give you a summary. By combining with our modeling part, we have successfully proved that:
(1) The plasmid copies can affect the concentration of inhibitor in the constitutive circuit.
(2) The concentration of inhibitor can affect the in-promoter’s activity and affect the expression of killer gene in the end.
(3) Our system can help the cell sense the number of plasmids.
(4) The number of plasmids can affect the expression of killer gene.
When the plasmid number is above its threshold, the concentration of inhibitor being high enough, the killer gene can be repressed completely.
When the plasmid number is below the threshold, the inhibitor won’t work anymore, the killer can get the chance.
Killer device
Since the lethal efficiency of killer genes will decide the capacity of general circuit, so we have to:
1. Prove that the toxin protein we selected can successfully express and the lethal effect is obvious
2. Adjust the translation efficiency of toxin proteins through replace ribosome binding                                 site (RBS), thus to adjust the threshold
3. Construct gene circuits connecting killer device and inhibitor device
4. Find another possible way to produce the lethal effect
Results:
1. Successfully constructed the testing circuits of toxin proteins [Part: BBa_K2120002 and Part: BBa_K2120003 ]
2. After transformation, we measured the OD600 to draw the growth curve and observed the function of toxin protein.
3. In addition to B0032, we selected a stronger RBS B0034 and a weaker one B0031. Through measuring OD600, we demonstrated that we can adjust"

Interview wth Christine Loh
After we interviewed Professor Hendrickson we realized that issues of biosafety and bioethics would be handled slightly different in industrial research settings than in academia.  Thus, towards the end of the summer session we sought out Christine Loh, who is currently working at Sirtris Technologies in Cambridge, and interviewed her on development of a lab-organizing software tool, and also about biosecurity and bioethics concerns that may occur in doing proprietary research. Ms. Loh gave us feedback that information security was a strong concern in industry, and data sharing should be able to be limited.  Thus, if we were to design collaboration research tools, data sharing options must be considered before we designed the program.  Also, personal data organization was very important in during industrial research, because for later drug trials or for biological patent obtainment meticulous records of procedures and processes must be kept.  Usually all this information is kept personal, and on paper, but issues come up if paper copies are taken home or lost.  Sensitive research information is often shared among collaborators, but should information be shared and accessed via a cloud?  Would the cloud be secure?  Our search engine SynBio Search and our designing tool MoClo Planner are designed for academia, but if they were designed for industry, would the layout and security measures change?  Sources and research we deem to be reliable- would they remain so if the stakes were higher, and research we do eventually lead to human medical testing?  Ms. Loh gave us a preview of the potential questions that synthetic biology would face in the coming decade, as more biological constructs move from academic research settings into application in current biotech industries.
Interview with other Wellesley students and getting some initial feedback
Before we tested our iGEM software with BU and MIT iGEM teams, we were able to test them out with other Wellesley biology and biochemistry students, who gave us important feedback on the design and usability of our software.  The usability testings we did were all recorded with consent, and from observing our users we were able to refine our software more and go through several iterations of the MoClo Planner design.  Also, after each round of testing, students would provide us with written and verbal feedback on features they thought were strong and features that needed improvement in the next iteration of the MoClo Planner .  Thus, while the MoClo Planner was designed specifically with synthetic biologists in mind, general biologists and undergraduate students also gave us constant feedback in improving the efficiency and clarity of our designs.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," areas. Agent-based systems excel in giving a very clear idea of how the properties of an individual are affecting the greater system, especially when individuals are heterogeneous (Bonabeau, 2002). In this project for example, if scheduling is not optimal for a chip layout then there may be significant bottlenecking in a particular area. Bottlenecking is an example of emergent phenomena in that it can only occur as a result of the properties of many individuals. With only access to the behaviour of the entire system, it can be very difficult to determine the cause of a bottleneck. With an agent based approach however, and analysis of several individuals in the affected area, the cause of the problem will in most cases quickly become apparent. Another advantage of using an agent-based system for this project is that we are also implementing the scheduling for the software. Our scheduling system requires knowledge of each of the individual droplets in the system, and it must also be able to predict their movements for a certain period of time into the future. Computationally we are therefore already expending time and resources upon acquiring and manipulating these data sets and as such it makes sense to extend this knowledge into the agent-based model.

Unlike most humans, Eric   T.S.  Holmes was born from an orange flower on the tallest branch of the great sequoia  in Oregon. At the moment of his birth, lightning tore across the sky only to strike his fragile body. He then grew wings, slew a few dragons, and then decided he wanted to be an iGEM member. His full name, Eric Taylor Swift Holmes, warned his interviewers that he was trouble when he walked in. And yet, the iGEM  gods smiled  upon him in his most desperate hour, knowing that the female singer (who had been named in his honor) would be devastated by the grief of her beloved. A master of all knots and traps, he has since conquered every terrain in the universe, including the fiery depths of the autoclave room. He now looks to the vast waters of Cayuga Lake in search of a legendary fish, one that has only been spotted once, by him of course. He captured only a picture but now thirsts for the creature's carcass, to avenge his  lost left wing. In obsession, he surrounds himself with images of the deadly beast, Arunicus chakravorticum. He hopes that with his newly honed abilities from being an iGEM wet lab minion, he will be able to take down the creature.

Her second consecutive year in iGEM, Danielle has proven time and again that she's invaluable to the world of Biological Engineering.  When she's not sitting in one of the many classes she's taking, you'll find her conducting complicated experiments in the lab.  Already outclassing the Cornell biology labs by her junior year, Danielle spent 8 months doing an Engineering Co-Op at Johnson & Johnson as well as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, assisting in process development and antibody therapeutics analysis.  Danielle is the person you want to bring with you on a nighttime walk; she will enlighten you about the stars and constellations, in addition to being a great person to hang out with.  She is one of our team's highest commodities, being in demand by everyone all the time.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". The chyme is transferred consequently from one haustra to another by slow peristaltic waves. Those waves can be either mass movements, which are very slow and widespread movements happening a few times throughout the day and associated with food consumption by means of the gastrocolic and duodenocolic reflex or segmentation movements that mostly serve to chop and mix the intestinal content.
Peristalsis is a radially symmetrical contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates as a wave down the tube (in our case the intestinal tube), in an anterograde direction. In the case of the human intestinal tract, smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave, which propels fecal aggregates along the tract. This is the main kind of movement that will be taken into account in our model. More technical details on the physical model of peristalsis are presented in the Human Colon Fluid Dynamics section of our model.
The large intestine can be considered a mechanical propulsion system implying that one should determine its elastic and viscous properties before proceeding with the model.
Some primitive tensile properties of the human large intestine are the maximal stress and destructive strain, valued at 0.9 MPa and 180% respectively[ 1 ]. In addition, to gauge the elastic properties of the intestinal wall one needs to determine the elastic modulus (Young's modulus) as well as the Poisson Ratio.
Young's modulus (E) is a numerical constant that describes the elastic properties of an elastic material undergoing tension or compression unidirectionally and functions as ameasure of the material's capacity to withstand alterations in its shape. The mathematical formula describing this physical entity is the following:
\[E = \frac{{stress}}{{strain}} = \frac{{F{L_0}}}{{A({L_n} - {L_0})}}\]
The physical units of E in the metric system are Newtons per square meter (N/m2).
Poisson's Ratio (σ) is the ratio of transverse contraction strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction of the stretching force applied on the material's surface. The large intestinal tissue is commonly considered as soft tissue and the mathematical formula describing its Poisson's ratio is the following:
\[\sigma  =  - \frac{{d{\varepsilon _{trans}}}}{{d{\varepsilon _{axial}}}}\]
Those values exist in the literature; as a mean value across all locations of the colon (distal, medial and proximal) as well as in every possible orientation (circumferental and longtitud"

A special case occurs when the       concentration profile takes on a linear form. Everything that moves into       the point goes out at the other side and as a result there is no net accumulation       over time.

In the videoplayer below we demonstrate how the heat equation smoothes out      an initially heterogeneous concentration profile. When only diffusion is      acting on the system, it will always evolve to a uniformly flat      concentration profile, regardless of the initial conditions.

Agents
To model bacteria movement on the other hand, we used an agent-based model that                         explicitly stored individual bacteria as agents. Spatial coordinates are                         associated with each agent, specifying their location. After solving the                         equation of motion for all agents based on their environment, these coordinates                         are updated at every timestep. In principle, Newton’s second law of motion has                         to be solved for all bacteria. However, since bacteria live in a low Reynolds                         (high friction) environment, the inertia of the bacteria can be neglected. This                         is because an applied force will immediately be balanced out by an opposing frictional force, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration phase taking                         place.                                                                  This eliminates the inertial term and simplifies Newton’s second law to                         (5).
$$  \frac{d^2 \vec{r}(t)}{dt^2}=\sum_{i} \vec{F}_{applied,i}-\gamma \cdot                         \frac{d \vec{r}(t)}{dt}=0 $$                          $$\Rightarrow \frac{d \vec{r}(t)}{dt}=\frac{1}{\gamma}                         \cdot \sum_{i} \vec{F}_{applied,i} \;\;\; \text{(5)} $$
Basically, the velocity can be calculated as the sum of all applied       forces times divided by a frictional coefficient.       For more info about the Reynolds number and       “life at low Reynolds number”, we refer to box 2. In the following       paragraphs we will investigate the different forces acting on the bacteria       and ultimately superimpose them to obtain the final equation of motion.

Suicide System
Aims : Implement a kill-switch that features population-level suicide and complete genome degradation.
System : A synthetic toxin-anti-toxin system based on the wild type Colicin E2 operon.
Achievements : We showed that Colicin E2 cells induce cell death in sensitive populations, and that these sensitive populations can be protected by providing them with our engineered immunity protein.
Construction of 2 biobricks :
K914001  : pLac-repressilator RBS-Colicin E2 immunity protein
K914002  :repressilator RBS-Colicin E2 immunity protein
Part K914001 is well characterized and provides immunity to sensitive cells against the Colicin E2 activity protein. Part K914002 is promoterless and allows users to easily plug in the appropriate promoter for their desired purpose.
Creation of a new category in the part registry : XNase . The aim of this category is to provide users with DNase/RNase parts that can be used for improved kill switches featuring the degradation of genomic material.
Partially biobricked sRNA system :

Sterility during the printing process can be maintained by setup in a laminar flow cabinet:
Dissolving the alginate
Although dissolving hydrogel beads is described in literature as straightforward (J.A.Rowley et al., 1999), we experienced problems with dissolving our hydrogel samples to obtain the biofilm only product after 3D printing. In literature, the addition of 10 mL 2% (w/v) sodium citrate is described as sufficient to completely dissolve the hydrogel within 20-30 minutes. Unfortunately it turns out this does not hold true for larger hydrogel fragments as we were experimenting with, but works only efficiently on a very small scale ( < 400 µm).
Trying to regain the in the hydrogel entrapped cells, we incubated 100 µL of hydrogel bioink containing cells constitutively expressing RFP in 1 mL of 2% (w/v) sodium citrate at 37°C for 36 hours. While we were able to show that the cells did survive this procedure by inoculating them in fresh LB and regrowing dark red cells, the hydrogel however had to our big disappointment barely dissolved.
Trying to force its dissolution, we incubated 100 µL of hydrogel in 1 mL of 2% (w/v) sodium citrate at 50°C, 300 rpm over 48 hours. To our large disappointment, not even these conditions were capable of dissolving the hydrogel.
Repetition of the above experiments with low concentration sodium alginate (1% w/v instead of 2%) lead to the exact same results.
To this point, we have not been able to entirely dissolve and remove the supporting alginate hydrogel. In the future, more effort will have to be put either into developing and optimizing conditions capable of both fully dissolving the hydrogel and keeping the cells alive, or reorientation towards a different compound that can be used as a stabilising scaffold for the bacterial cells in the printing process.

In order to get more insights regarding the system behaviour, we applied a                     robustness analysis, shown in Figure 6. The result appeared as expected                     with sgRNA concentration increasing for higher copy number. The standard                     deviations show us that for little copy number the variation of the                     concentration is trivial but for higher copy numbers the variation                     increases accordingly. However, we can clearly tell that for most parameter                     sets the linearity of the system cannot be ruined.

The error bars                         represent the standard deviation of the mean, that is how much the                         sgRNA concentration can vary.
Main system
The main system consists of the formation of the repressor complex and the                     production of sfGFP, which is being repressed by the complex. The complex                     binds to DNA slowly, as dcas9 has to find the PAM sequence.The dissociation                     is also very slow and approaches the dillution rate of the cell. The                     disruption percentage of RNAP, arises from sgRNA’s complementarity with DNA                     and the concentration of polymerase. We also assumed the degradation of the                     repressor complex, being the same rate as dcas9 degradation.

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#ResultsTest_-_-_TEXT.html," domains have been chosen using modeling of the secondary structure, we can rank them by their orthogonality to other transcribed RNAs. These sequences are available in online databases (e.g. mRNA data for HEK 293 cells ). For strand displacement, the rate limiting step is the binding of a strand to a gate:output complex using the toehold. After this step, the process of strand displacement is sensitive to nucleotide mismatches, with early mismatches being more disruptive than later mismatches (Qian et al. 2011). Thus, we can use a weighted Hamming distance between a candidate domain and every subsequence in the transcriptome. This method is similar to identifying orthogonal sequences for protein-DNA interactions as previously published ( Silver et al. 2012 ).
Care has to be taken to make sure that sensors in a circuit are orthogonal as well, but the same method can be applied to any sequences that are introduced into a cell.
Four highlighted domains of eBFP2 with various secondary structures we chose to sense. Blue-filled circles represent toehold nucleotides, green-filled nucleotides represent sensing domain nucleootides. The border of a nucleotide's circle represents the probability of the nucleotide being in the given state (red - very likely, blue - very unlikely). These are closeups of the mRNA structure above.
Sensing Modeling
Modeling of mRNA secondary structure was done using NUPACK . Strand displacement reaction kinetics were simulated using Visual GEC .
Sensing In vitro studies
We chose 4 domains in eBFP2 with various predicted secondary structure properties to test out in vitro. eBFP2 (BBa_K779300) mRNA was produced by PCRing on a T7 promoter and terminator (TODO: link to primers?). The resulting template was then used for in vitro transcription (see Protocols TODO: link). After purification and quantification on a NanoDrop 1000, the transcribed mRNA, corresponding gate:outputs and fuel strands along with a fluorescent reporter were added to wells in a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was measured on a plate reader (See TODO: link to protocol).
For proof-of-concept studies we chose DNA as nucleic acid for the gate:output, fuel, and reporter complexes, as these results will mirror results with RNA-based strands, as shown by foundational experiments. However, the thermodynamics, kinetics and steady states will be different between DNA and RNA strands. We expect mRNA to produce less output than a corresponding DNA input mimic (comprising of just the toehold and sensing domains) in the same"

lane 7: ladder (8 ul)
lane 8: pUB119 digest (15 ul)
Based on the results, it seems that none of our digests are working. It may be that the enzymes we are using have lost activity, so we may have to obtain fresh ones.
The following transformations were carried out by Annie:
BBa_K314103 → Plate 1 : 4D in pSB1C3  (1638 bp)
BBa_K314100 → Kit 1 : 1G (518 bp)

Shaker was off when we arrived so unsure if that will affect anything...
In other news, the BL21 competent cells were dropped off by Karyl.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#TiffanyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," circuits. The Wellesley and BU iGem teams split up into mixed teams to try and code some example circuits into Eugene ourselves.
Tuesday: Day two of BU iGem, we presented our projects to the BU team. We asked them to give us their comments and suggestions about how we could more tailor our projects our audience. Some aspects of our projects were met with a little bit of skepticism and criticism, but the Wellesley team took it in stride because we were still in the design process and things were still in the process of changing.
Wednesday: Today, Sravanti joined the Eugene Desyne team! The team began to work on paper prototypes for the user interface we wanted for the project. I did not spend too long working on this as I needed to help conduct gesture studies for another project, Tabula. For the gesture studies, we asked participants to pretend to conduct certain tasks using either an upright or a horizontal touch interface along with Sifteo cubes, and recorded their thought processes and gestures. I was mainly responsible for recording the gestures and created a form to record everything in as uniform a manner as possible. As we went through the three user studies for the day, I noticed how I changed in how I chose to record gestures in order to record more quickly and accurately.
Thursday: More user-studies for Tabula. While there are a set of very common gestures that people generally use, there are certain individuals that approach the tasks that they are set to in a very interesting manner that we do not see from any of the other participants thus far. Also, as a lab at a women's college, we have certain difficulties in recruiting enough cis-gender males to participate in our studies so we have been using our personal connections to try and rustle some up.
Friday: Yet more user-studies for tabula.
Week 3: June 10 - June 14
Monday: We successfully finished the Tabula user-studies! I went through all the gestures I recorded for all participants and made sure things were recorded as uniformly as possible for the sake of easing the way during data analysis. I was not responsible for analyzing the data. That honor fell to Diana and Consuelo. The Eugene Desyne team continued to refine their UI design and came up with a new one, influenced by UML, that utilizes tree visualization in showing the build of the parts.
Tuesday: Together, the Eugene Desyne team refined the tree visualization method for rule creation in creating devices. We worked through how we would represent some example circuits provided by Swapnil. Even now, we can see that we are going to need"

Transformations/Minipreps of Parts from Registries
07/07/08
07/07: We transformed P42, P11, P51, P52, P77, P78, P17, Q01121, BBa_J06911, BBa_J06912 from both the 2007 and 2008 registries (P11 was available only from the 2008 registry). We also made a positive transformation control using pUC19 DNA that came with the TOP10 cells. We made three negative plate controls using mock transformed bacteria on Amp, Kan, and Cm plates. We used E1.
FAILED TRANSFORMATIONS
2007 -- P51 (Kan), Q01121 (Kan), P17 (Kan), P52 (Kan), P78 (Kan), P77 (Kan)
2008 -- P52 (Kan), P51 (Kan), P78 (Kan), P77 (Kan), Q01121 (Kan), P17 (Kan), P11 (Cm)
The Cm and Kan mock transformations (negative controls) also failed to grow.
Alarmingly, the E1 mock transformation (no DNA, neg control) grew on the LB Carb plates. All of the Carb plates had some colonies, so we only picked from those with significantly higher numbers than the neg control. 3 colonies each from BBa_J06911 & BBa_J06912 2007 (temp sensitive LacI system) were picked and grown.
Successful Transformations
2007: P84, P85 (BBa_J06911, BBa_J06912) -- miniprepped/glycerol stocks made
The Amp negative control colonies did not grow in liquid LB Amp. The Amp positive control did grow in liquid LB Amp (pUC19).

From 2010.igem.org
Monday 16th August
For most of the day Steve, Caz and Matt were autoclaving, pouring agar plates and preparing LB. Ampicillin and kanamycin plates were prepared separately and together. The restriction digest performed on the plasmid didn't work unfortunately, as the DNA ladder was too high in concentration compared to the palsmids.
Meanwhile Tom began profiling the team on the wiki and made 2 interviews, one with Groningen and the other with Harvard for human practices. Nii and Narmada tried to work out how a histidine kinase could be modelled by researching literature.

Team Stockholm shared information regarding microplastics from Stockholm wastewater treatment plants and other water treatment plants in their region: although microplastics are a widespread issue, wastewater plants filter out approximately 99% of microplastics into sludge material. This is the same information we received from Bellanira Lynch, a Microbiologist from our local wastewater plant, San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant. They also shared information from Novozymes that suggested washing machines are a significant source of microplastics, which is the same conclusion we reached after researching microfibers. This discussion further validated the direction we are taking with our project. In return, we contacted San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant to collect data on antibiotics, specifically Sulfamethoxazole, to further Team Stockholm’s data on the prevalence of their toxicant."
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," circuit containing mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel or transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5), and quantitatively characterize the different mechanical response of the two cell lines;
Developing platform for further improvement of the mechanical sensing ion channels with directed evolution. We'd like to call the ensemble of the methodology as audiogenetics.
Fig. Overview of the constructed system
MS channels open and close in response to various mechanical stress, which in turn allows for extracellular cations, such as calcium, to enter and depolarize the cell. Although not well studied, they could also transduce the audio wave energy as the extracellular input signal into intracellular downstream signals. Can they transduce these transient stimuli into stable gene expression? To study all of these, we first stably integrate synthetic circuit including, tunable-expressing MS channels, genetic calcium sensor and calcium sensing gene expression cassette into CHO cell genome. The calcium sensor activities were measured and validated with live cell fluorescent microscopy using ionomycin as positive stimulus. The downstream NFAT promoter report was validated with chronic sound stimulation of cells expressing Piezo1.
The second question is that, can the wide type and engineered CHO cells sense mechanical stress differently? After a lot of trial-and-error, we established three mechanical stimulation systems:
hypoosmolarity shock with transient tunable osmotic pressure;
tunable shear force with customized microfluidics chip;
Piezo1-driven sound stimulation cell culture chamber with tunable frequency and amplitude.
To our surprise, our data suggested that, they do sense different mechanical stress significantly differently.
Although the time is very limited, we also start engineering the TRPC5 to sense different sound parameters. We devised a directed evolution method using selection of mutation library from functional sound sensing CHO cells. It is a iterative approach consists of 1) random mutate putative mechanical sensing domain of the TRPC5 channel proteins, 2) integrate single copy into the identical locus of CHO cells, 3) select CHO cells expressing TRPC5 mutant library with downstream NFAT promoter driven GFP expression.
In addition to be used for engineering synthetic hearing cells for different sound, audiogenetics could also provide us with new synthetic biology tools, alternative to chemogenetics and optogenetics for research, due to its essential advantages, deep tissue penetration, temporal and submillimeter spatial resolution. It could also be used in cell replacement therapy such as modulating the physiology or gene expression of transplanted cells in vivo.

Chip design and functionality
The Chip we use was designed to meet the needs of our experiment: the device needs to provide a matrix devided into chambers where cells can grow. These chambers are connected by channels that will allow cell-cell, or in our case chamber-chamber,communication. The design that reflects best these aspects is the following:
On this picture, the flow layer is represented in blue. This layer will contain all solutions and cells involved in the experiment. In red, the control layer is used to close and open the valves controlling the inlets and outlets of the flow layer.
Here is a zoom on one element of the design. The square chambers are overlaid by circular buttons. The Valves controlling the connection between two adjacent chambers also appear. One can observe the 3-to-1 connection pattern of the chip: every other cell receives an input from 1 other chambers, and the other from 3 chamber. This particular geometry is traduced in the modeling of our circuit.
A set of vertical valves between the chamber columns allows to control the communication between two adjacent rows. This way, we can control the moment when quorum-sensing molecules from one column are free to signal to the following column. Practically, this will allow us to wait a sufficient amount of time before the response of a given column chamber is computed by the cells and is ready to be received by the following column.
The valves are designed in such a way that they can be sequentially opened, using a minimum amount of inlets (for this reason, they are connected 2 by 2 which reduces the control inlets to 2 channels). There is also a set of circular buttons that, when activated, allow to trap the cells under their surface and circulate the surrounding medium.
All in all, the experiment will be conducted in the following order: the chip will be filled with cells containing our engineered"

Student success is objectively evaluated according to their ability to produce building block DNA (8-10 out of 12-16 assigned) and to complete the entire gene synthesis protocol by generating clones of perfect sequence (at least 3).  In the course of one academic year (2 semesters, 1 summer, 1 intersession), the first pass of the entire ~280 kb synthetic chromosome III sequence was achieved.
Overall, the Build-a-Genome course has proven to be successful.  Student evaluations of the course were greatly positive, and many students became mentors or continued with side projects after completing the course.  Build-a-Genome will undoubtedly remain a challenging and popular course at Johns Hopkins.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#3 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," to determine whether we have been successful this time. If we are successful the team will purify the PCR product; if not the team will reattempt a PCR reaction.
Practical Outline
By the end of the day the Metal Sensing team hope to accomplish these objectives:
Run fragments from PCR reaction (carried out yesterday) on gel through electrophoresis.
If PCR reaction successful clean up products; if unsuccessful reattempt PCR reaction
Observations
We ran the products from yesterday's PCR reaction on gel and after about 30-40 minutes of DNA gel electrophoresis, the team analysed the gel using GelDoc:
The lanes of the gel were as follows:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = czrA PCR product
Lane 4 = czrA PCR control
Lane 5 = ara PCR product
Lane 6 = ara PCR control
Lane 7 = Bacillus subtilis genomic DNA
Lane 8 = Bacillus subtilis genomic DNA
Lane 9 = Bacillus subtilis genomic DNA
Lane 10 = HindIII DNA ladder
As far as the Metal Sensing team are concerned the PCR reaction involving the gene czrA did not work at all - this means we need to reattempt the PCR reaction. Meanwhile the Stochastic Switch team's ara coding sequence PCR did work.
Procedure
PCR
Today, after having run the gel for yesterdays PCR products, we are carrying out another PCR to amplify czrA gene which didn't work yet at different annealing temperatures: 40C 45C and 50C.

Nevada,2013,Team:Nevada#project#OMpermeabilization_-_-_TEXT.html," We chose to develop an assay using an outer membrane florescent cell surface detection method with the theory that any OM which was permabilized would pellet following centrifugation post exposure to the given chemical of interest. We would then quantify the results by examining the intensity of the resultant pellet. Therefore, we needed to develop a cell surface detection protein to be expressed in our gram negative bacteria model, E. coli. We knew many of these proteins existed in the iGEM registry so we aimed to find one, then improve upon it. One of Edinburgh’s parts from 2011 looked promising for our needs. This part was a fusion of an ice nucleation protein (INP) and a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Per Edinburghs 2011 iGEM wiki page, their part consisted of a LacZ promoter (Plac), the N and C terminal domains of INP, and YFP (Plac-INPNC-YFP). Per Li et. al (2004), we decided to improve this part by deleting the C-terminal domain of the INP through site directed mutagenesis. The final construct, Plac-INPN-YFP was constructed in E. coli.
Design 1
Given the efficacy of the protein, as described by Edinburgh, we chose to do site directed mutagenesis on the gene while in pSB1C3 and keep it under the control of the LacZ promoter. Further investigation revealed that the original part used by Edinburgh did not have the entire internal sequence deleted; we therefore took the approach of designing primers that would yield a more efficient protein containing just the LacZ promoter region, the INP N-terminal, and YFP. Edinburgh’s design was 2442 base pairs in size. We deleted 372 base pairs yielding a 2070 base pair construct.
Primers were designed based on Gibson Assembly protocols and the internal sequence to be deleted so as to keep the protein in pSB1C3 while we were working with it.
Gibson assembly was carried out
PCR followed by gel electrophoresis revealed that we had in fact deleted the appropriate length
Sequencing data revealed that we had deleted the appropriate region
This construct was transformed into BL21 cells and induced with 100mM IPTG
Results: This design resulted in the deletion of 372 base pairs yielding a 2070 base pair construct of Plac-INPN-YFP as evidenced by gel electrophoresis (figure 10). Fluorescence observed under fluorescent microscopy at equivalence to Edinburgh’s construct.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," We identified several design objectives for the lesson plan:
The lesson plan must help an instructor teach or reinforce one or more of the Next Generation Science Standards and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM. This was a necessary requirement to convince teachers to allow the activity into an already crowded class schedule.
The lesson plan should shift student appreciation and perception of: the interaction between science, technology and the use of technologies.
The experience should show some influence on “long term” behavior or attitude towards the responsible use of chemicals.
Assessments are Critical
Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to create assessments to evaluate the success of our lesson objectives.  He gave us some insight:
crafting “layered” questions that assess different levels on Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom’s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom’s questions might test a student’s ability to apply the core lessons to new situations
different objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.  (1) we are assessing the ability to teach certain concepts associated with science standards and (2) we are assessing student attitudes.  These require different assessment instruments.
assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we’re interested in assessing but rather the student’s ability to decipher the questions.  A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.
Dr. Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a “pre post test”.  These are sets of questions that are given to students before (pre) and after (post) and activity to assess any learning gains.  We decided to create two sets of assessment instruments:
1. Standard multiple choice questions that an instructor could use to assess state standards
2. A survey for assessing student attitudes towards responsible chemical use and their role in this process. The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]
Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.  Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are “good” or “poor” distractors, answer choices designed"

Julius B. Lucks is Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University, and a James C. and Rebecca Q. Morgan Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow. After attending the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics for high school, he became an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he performed research in organic synthesis and the application of density functional theory to studying the electronic properties of atoms and molecules as a Goldwater Scholar. After graduating with a BS in Chemistry, he spent a summer working with Robert Parr before obtaining an M. Phil. in Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge University as a Churchill Scholar. As a Hertz Fellow at Harvard University, he researched problems in theoretical biophysics including RNA folding and translocation, viral capsid structure and viral genome organization, under David R. Nelson. As a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley in the laboratory of Adam P. Arkin, he engineered versatile RNA-sensing transcriptional regulators that can be easily reconfigured to independently regulate multiple genes, logically control gene expression, and propagate signals as RNA molecules in gene networks. He also lead the team that developed SHAPE-Seq, an experimental technique that utilizes next generation sequencing for probing RNA secondary and tertiary structures of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment.
Professor Lucks’ research combines both experiment and theory to ask fundamental questions about the design principles that govern how RNAs fold and function in living organisms, and how these principles can be used to engineer biomolecular systems, and open doors to new medical therapeutics.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". Some of these can be seen on the Policy and Practice page under iGEM Community section. For this we collaborated with the Berlin, KU Leuven and Amsterdam teams.
Moreover, we helped other teams by sharing the knowledge we have about biofilms and even printed a biofilm for another team. For sharing this knowledge we had several skype different teams, we helped with organizing different events where we talked to other teams, and we eventually went to Groningen to make a biofilm for them.
Testing Biolinker
Throughout the policy and practice assessment, it became clear that the strong point of our printer was that it could be used for different types and strains of bacteria. We believed that it was important to test this hypothesis. At the RIVM/Rathenau discussion meeting preparation we learnt more about what the other teams were planning on making. A popular direction was biofilms such as the team of University of Groningen .
The iGEM Groningen team were creating a biofilm that would be used to create energy out of salt and fresh water. Their plan was to create an ion-selective biofilm that would be placed as a barrier between the two types of water, to ensure that an electro potential gradient would develop. This gradient would then be converted into energy called Blue Energy. Their biofilm had to therefore be ion-selective and robust. But they had a couple of troubles with creating a stable biofilm containing their engineered selective bacteria, Bacillus subtilis 3610 comI strain. They wanted to create a membrane that would be able to maintain itself, making it very sustainable and cheap. The two teams believed that combining their projects would lead to a good result, as well as it being important to help out a fellow iGEM team to test their hypothesis. .
Just before the track decisions were made, we contacted the iGEM team of Groningen through Skype, on the 17th of August, to discuss the possibilities of a collaboration between us. Like we mentioned in our policy and practice assessment, it became clear that a strong point of their printer could potentially be the usage for different types and strains of bacteria. .
On the 1st of september, Marit, Anne and Biolinker (our 3D-printer) travelled to Groningen to execute several experiments. The aim of the two teams were as followed: We wanted to prove that our 3D-printer can be called an open source platform technology, by letting the team of Groningen print their bacteria.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the colony produces only r or only s, the terminator is switched only once, so the terminator is OFF, and GFP and QS1 or QS2 are produced (depending on the colony). If the colony produces r and s, the terminator is switched twice, so it is ON and it blocks expression of GFP and of the quorum sensing molecule.
Rule that will be computed by all cells : an XOR gate between the signals from the 2 cells above. Biologically, integrases p and q are able to bind sites around a terminator and switch this terminator, thereby turning off the effect of the terminator and enabling gfp transcription. If p and q integrases are both present, the terminator is switched twice and comes back to its initial state, gfp is not transcribed.

BSSE Openhouse Day
Saturday, May 10th
Sharing our iGEM and synthetic biology interest with the public
On May 10th the public in Basel had the unique chance to get an insight into many different scientific laboratories and the work done there. It was the joint open house day of D-BSSE of ETH (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering) and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. The many different labs opened their doors to the public and many scientists were present to give interested people some details about their daily work. So did the ETH iGEM team 2014. The team was present with a poster showing the history of iGEM, the previous ETH iGEM teams with their projects and general information about synthetic biology. Additionally there was a slideshow giving a best-of photo collection of last years jamboree. The goal of this day was to inform the public about synthetic biology in general and specifically about the spirit and the many different projects of iGEM. Many people showed strong interest in truly student driven projects and are curious to follow our team wiki for the next months.

Project Abstract
The emerging field of synthetic biology is the combination of engineering approaches with state-of-the-art molecular and cellular biology techniques.  It has the potential to change almost every industry.  The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition allows undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to explore research in synthetic biology.   The University of Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team has created a synthetic-biology-based approach for bioremediation of the tailings ponds.  The industrial methods, used to harvest the oil sands, produce contaminated water in the form of tailings ponds that contain many harmful chemicals such as naphthenic acids, catechol and heavy metals.  We are targeting catechol for degradation into a common metabolic intermediate that can be fed into the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase .   Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments , formed from an engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  This complex can then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds. Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum has been shown to remove heavy metals from solution.  The Mms6 protein will be engineered for secretion from the cell into the tailings for the formation of nanoparticles such as iron and cobalt.  Removal of the heavy metals found within the tailing will aid in creating an efficient bioremediation process.

We went to an iGEM meet in Oslo where we had a conference with the Oslo team. During the conference we held presentations of our projects for each other and had a judge panel to give us feedback. After a lovely lunch (see picture) we had a workshop, and decided on doing some testing for each other.  The Oslo team tested our reporter plasmid, to see if the cultures turned red when heated to 42oC. We tested the detection limit for Nitroficin for the Oslo team.

Bacteria with an appetite for oil
Written by Caroline Zentner
Thursday, July 15 2010, 10:29 PM
A team of 11 undergraduate students at the University of Lethbridge is spending the summer on a project that could one day help clean up toxins in tarsands tailings ponds. Their project involves creating an engineered bacteria with a propensity for munching on a compound in oilsands tailings ponds. They’re working feverishly to have the bacteria ready for the iGem (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition held annually at the Massachusets Institute of Technology. This is the fourth time U of L team has entered the contest.
Student teams are given a kit of biological parts in the summer. They use the parts and add new parts of their own design to build a biological system. About 180 teams are expected to participate in the championship jamboree in November.
“It’s a really great opportunity for us,” said Justin Vigar, a fourth-year U of L biochemistry student and spokesman for the team. “Our plan was to degrade a compound in tailing pond water mainly because of the Oil Sands Initiative that came up. We need money to run this project.”
The students wrote a grant proposal, created a project and succeeded in getting more than $40,000 from Alberta Innovates Technology Futures and another $20,000 from various oilsands companies sponsoring the Oil Sands Initiative.
Working under the supervision of Hans-Joachim Wieden, U of L biochemistry professor, and a couple of graduate students, the students will be inserting a gene into a bacteria to create an organism that can survive in the tailing pond environment and break down the target compound to make it less toxic or even useful.
“There are two problems with oil in general: how do you get it out of the ground and what is the byproduct of that? BP is actually a good example because things go wrong. It’s a human enterprise so things go wrong,” Wieden said. “What we are doing is essentially exploring a way of looking at alternatives to cleaning this stuff up.”
“We all live in Alberta so it does hit us close to home,” Vigar"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Goal A: Characterization of R0011, a strong lactose promoter
Introduction
We used <partinfo>R0011</partinfo> [learn more] , a lactose promoter, for the Lysisbox.
Because part parameters of R0011 are partially unclear [1] , we measured the promoter activity of the R0011 at various concentrations of IPTG in order to determine the relationship between the activity of lysis cassette and the expression levels of its promoter.
We characterize R0011 by Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) [learn more] , because absolute promoter activity depends on test conditions and measurement instruments. RPU can reduce this Coefficient of Variation (CV) from 39.1% to 17.5% [2] . Therefore RPU can make it easier for us to share the data of promoter activity and use BioBricks.
Method
In order to measure RPU of R0011, E. coli host, KRX was transformed with <partinfo>BBa_K358000</partinfo> (R0011 lac promoter), <partinfo>BBa_K358001</partinfo> (standard promoter), or pSB4K5 (mock). The reason why we used KRX is that lacI repressor is overly expressed in KRX and lacI can repress lactose promoter fully at even low IPTG concentration [3] .
In order to measure RPU, we must use two types of E.coli transformed with the test promoter circuit and the standard promoter circuit respectively to compare absolute activity of the test promoter with that of the standard. BBa_K358000 has the lactose promoter (R0011) immediately upstream of GFP, and BBa_K358001 has the standard promoter (J23101). We constructed both parts with a low copy number plasmid, pSB4K5, because lacI cannot repress lactose promoter completely even in the absence of IPTG if a high copy number plasmid is used. The E.coli transformed with pSB4K5 was also used for correcting the autofluores"
Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," requiring cell lysis. The B12 Synporter consists of a signal for a Twin Arginine Transporter (Tat) mediated export that is linked to a B12-binding domain. This construct will be expressed in R. planticola and S. blattae. We will not only test these different production organisms but also different B12-binding domains.
However, Vitamin B12 can also be regarded as a prime example which is what we want to state with our work. This Synporter should work with basically any chemical which is desired to be exported out of a cell. We know from other iGEM Teams that they require bioactive compounds which are derived from nature, but are not synthesized by any organism (e.g. artificial amino acids). These are very expensive (< 1000 € per gram). However, finding novel enzymes for the synthesis of artificial compounds like drugs, for instance using metagenomics, turned out to be very promising and successful. Once one found the right enzymes, one is able to produce these compounds in an organism. Using our Synporter approach with an exchanged binding protein domain, these components can then be exported efficiently, making the production significantly easier and cheaper.
More Theory About Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 – or Cobalamin – is a very complex compound (see Fig. 1), consisting of a corrin-macrocycle with a centrally incorporated Cobalt-ion, carrying varying upper ligands, and further a dimethylbenzimidazole group attached to the lower side of the corrin-ring and the Cobalt-ion. Depending on what ligand is attached to the Cobalt-ion, different forms of Cobalamin can be distinguished. Natural occuring forms are methyl- (CH3-), hydroxy- (OH-), cyano- (CN-) and adenosylcobalamin (5’-deoxyadenosyl-) (also called coenzyme B12), while cyanocobalamin (which is Vitamin B12 by definition) represents the industrial manufactured form. [1], [2], [3]
Fig. 1: The Structure of Cobalamin. Modified from [2]
Only certain microorganisms are able to synthesize Vitamin B12. Since these microorganisms colonize animals’ gastrointestinal tracts where the B12 accumulates, we humans uptake it via eating animal products like meat and dairy, with meat containing more B12 in general. Thereby, the B12 content varies between different types of animals and also between the diverse tissues. Ruminants’ entrails contain most B12. However, the type of cooking has further impact on"

Kick-off meeting with Delft
This is the first year that the two universities of Amsterdam have joined forces, and have sent a single team to iGEM competition. In previous years, teams from Amsterdam have not made it to the jamboree stage. This unfortunately means we cannot draw on past experiences in our efforts to build a successful project. Delft, on the other hand, has already sent several teams to the competition with impressive results. Therefore, they know what being in iGEM means. In order to help their new team, the team of Delft 2010 organized a crash course to teach their 2011 team all the tips and tricks needed to be a winning team. Since we did not have any previous teams who could do the same for us, we requested to be present during this day as well.   On the 31st of March, we went to the TU in Delft were we got together with the their team. The day consisted of two different parts; During the morning we attended a presentation by a previous iGEM team and in the afternoon we talked with the Delft team of 2011 about both of our project ideas.
Presentation
Nadine Bongaerts and Eva Brinkman, from TU Delft 2010 gave a presentation about their iGEM team. Delft 2010 had an astounding project, where they created a bacterium that was capable of dissimilating oil particles. They also spend quite some time and energy in their human outreach program. To be short, they were an incredible iGEM team.  They took their time to talk to the two teams about how they organized their project and what they have done for their human outreach. During their summer they bumped into a couple of problems that every iGEM teams will collide with at some point during the contest. In order to get ahead of these problems they warned us againt some of  these pitfalls and told us how to fix these problems. For"

Symposium on Synthetic Biology
Together with SYSU-Software (2017), we held a seminar on synthetic biology. In this talk, we explained the basis of synthetic biology to the students at South China Agricultural University and tried to introduce our projects work. In addition, we and members from SYSU-Software also demonstrated the project and answered some related questions.
(We also have some other exchanges with SYSU-Software 2017, details can be found on our Collaborations page)
Primary School Basic Experiment Fun Class
Due to the lack of laboratory equipment, the affiliated primary school to South China Agricultural University do not have the opportunity to conduct any biological experiments. With this in mind, we have prepared some simple and interesting experiments such as ""The changing color of anthocyanin with the change of pH"".
