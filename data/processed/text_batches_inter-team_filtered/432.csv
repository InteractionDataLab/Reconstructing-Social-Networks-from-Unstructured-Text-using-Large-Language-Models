To comply with the engineering principle of modularity, each of these three constructs is under to control of a different promotor. This allows individual manipulation of              each component. Additionally, to maintain the plasmids during division of the bacteria, each construct has an unique origin of replication. To confirm uptake of all three plasmids, each construct has a different antibiotic resistance.              The three main construct designs of our project can be seen in figure 8. We used experimental data to model the ideal prototype hydrogel for the wound healing application, and subsequently used these outcomes to optimize our patch design and synthesis.
Figure 8. The three core constructs of the design of our project.
We achieved modularity by using unique promotors and vectors for each component allowing individual                         manipulation and optimisation the integrated system. We used prototyping to generate different shapes and sizes of our                         hydrogel and used PDMS fabrication to improve our design of the hydrogel. By performing all experiments at                         least in duplo and repeating them multiple times we ensured the reproducibility of our results. Via integration                         of our conversations we had with experts for Human Practices and Applied Design parts of our project, we implemented                         safety as a key feature in our design.

Another reaction we tried was to amplify everything on the LuxBrick except luxA and luxB. In this reaction we then switched the two genes with ADC to create a product with luxC, luxD, luxE, luxG and ADC.
Gene Synthesis
Instead of using the LuxBrick to obtain C, D, and E, C, D, and E was re-optimized to have cloning-friendly GC content. Primers were designed to synthesize the genes separately each in their own PCR reaction. Another PCR was used to amplify the respective pieces, and each piece was ligated into psb1C3. Once each gene was in psb1C3, it was re-amplified out and ligated into a vector containing ADC. This is done step wise until the full construct is obtained.
Results
The PCR and Gibson methods failed at multiple steps for uncertain reasons. Since we do not have our LuxCDE construct, no method or assay for testing the hypothetical construct was developed as of this time. We hypothesize that LuxCD's abnormally high AT concentration may have caused misannealing for primers, causing primer-dimer errors and other problems, but no concrete evidence exists for this as of yet. For gene assembly, we have lowered the AT concentration of C, D, and E to more optimal levels for PCR. To be precise, the C, D, and E had an AT content of 66.3, 65.0, and 66.9 percent, which was reduced to 50.2, 50.1, and 51.6 percent respectively. Re-optimization likely helped cleanly amplifying out the genes.
Current Status
Attempts to clone LuxCDE using standard PCR/Biobrick Assembly and Gibson Assembly have been abandoned. Gene assembly was successful and each of the three luxCDE genes have been sequenced, biobricked and submitted. We are currently working on assembling the full CDE + ADC construct.

NCTU_Formosa,2018,Team:NCTU Formosa#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," products cultivation process is also the key activity for us to ensure the quality of products. In this business model, the revenue of our company is from selling those toxic free medical plants in contract farms. Other than selling green products, we also will have revenue when build up contract farm for those farm holders that join our business.
SWOT Analysis
     To start our business, we first analysis the SWOT of our future start-up companies. The strength and benefits of our service is that we have IoT platform which can integrate all kinds of sensors easily that will be user-friendly to farm holders. With the platform, they can run the contract farm efficiently. Moreover, we also have developed various AI models including fertilizing, pest prediction, diseased prediction that can aid in management of a farm.  The challenges that we will face including the build-up of a stable open-air soil cultivation as there will have the chances to face the nature disaster. Besides, the smart farming knowledge and GACP cultivation information is not popular to most of the farmers in Asia, so to promote our business, passing the knowledge to those interested farmers is very important.  Although there are some challenges that we need to face, but there are also a lot of opportunities for our team. As awareness of food safety and environmental protection increase, the demand for non-toxic products also increase at the same time. Moreover, as the aging farmer population has become a serious problem, the trend of smart agricultural management rises recently. Furthermore, the market size of bio-insecticides, bio-antifungicides that are eco-friendly become increase year by year. These opportunities show us the chance for our business model to get involve in the agricultural field.
Patent Portfolio
     About the patent portfolio of our technology, we had started planning and applied since year 2016. Every year, we apply for US provisional application before unveiling our project in the annual iGEM jamboree including this year. We applied patents in China and Taiwan regions, as our start-up company will focus the market of these two regions. Recently, we have been informed two approving patents each in a region. Furthermore, we will develop our smart farm system in southeast Asia countries, such as Vietnam and Malaysia. So, application of patents in these countries are needed to be planned. To have sufficient time of planning, we are now planning for PCT application for the “Fungal Disease Occurrence Prediction System”.

iGEM meets CASLMU
1st Meetup of the German iGEM Teams
Regional jamborees or the annual congress of Initiative Biotechnology 2020+ have always been perfect networking platforms for iGEM teams. As neither of these events took place this year, we decided to host our own meeting. Encouraged by the Center for Advanced Studies of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (CASLMU), our team organized the meetup on the weekend before a CASLMU-based workshop focusing on Synthetic Biology. We invited members of all German iGEM teams to spend the weekend from Saturday to Monday (May 24-26) in Munich. Fortunately, members of 11 teams and in total about 70 people could attend the event.
The first day at the Biocenter was predominately intended to get to know each other and to listen to the inspiring keynote talks by Prof. Dr. Friedrich Simmel (TU Munich) and Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher (LMU Munich). The speakers introduced the concepts of Synthetic Biology and gave insight into their current projects. The talks were followed by a cosy get-together with barbecue until the late evening"

As a proof of concept, iGEM TU Eindhoven employed two membrane proteins as anchors, to which they anchored DNA. These membrane proteins were CPX and INPNC. CPX in particular showed promising results and is still being explored today.
CPX & OmpX
CPX is a membrane display protein developed by Rice et al. as an alternative to traditional display methodologies, such as yeast display and phage display [12] . The protein itself is derived from the naturally occuring Outer membrane protein X (OmpX) through circular permutation (see Figure 5). Circular permutation was a necessary step to obtain the termini on the exterior of the bacterial cells.
Figure 5: CPX (right) is a membrane protein derived from OmpX (left) through circular permutation. OmpX and CPX feature signal sequences (yellow) which ensure that the membrane protein is localized to E.coli’s outer membrane. These signal sequences are cleaved from the peptides after localization. In CPX, an amber stop codon was introduced to introduce a unnatural azide-functionalized amino acid.
iGEM Eindhoven 2014 inserted an amber stop codon (TAG) at the N-terminus to enable expression of an azide-functionalized amino acid. This amino acid could be used to attach DBCO-functionalized molecules to the membrane protein, allowing synthetic biologists to attach virtually any molecule to the cell membrane (see Figure 6). The now azide-functionalized CPX-protein was dubbed Clickable Outer Membrane Protein x (COMPx) by iGEM TU Eindhoven 2014.
Figure 6: The azide-functionalized amino acid enables clicking any DBCO-functionalized molecule to be attached to the cell membrane through SPAAC click chemistry. iGEM TU Eindhoven 2014 called this azide-functionalized CPX COMPx.
To enable signaling over the outer membrane, our system requires intracellular signaling domains. Unfortunately, the COMPx developed and characterized by last year’s iGEM team does not allow for fusing protein domains intracellularly. To obtain fusion domains with additional intracellular domains, we devised to revert to go back to the basis and use OmpX rather than CPX as the platform for our clickable outer membrane proteins. The azide-functionalized amino acid will be introduced in the loops of OmpX, to which the aptamers can be attached (see Figure 7).

A machine called a thermocycler works to cycle the temperature at which samples are incubated. The cycle has three steps: denature, anneal and elongate. The denaturation step melts the double-stranded DNA molecule into single-stranded molecules. The annealing step allows the oligonucleotide primers to bind to the single-stranded molecules at their complementary sequence. The elongate step allows the heat-stable polymerase to extend the DNA sequence. After many cycles, we have exponential amplification of the segment of DNA that is flanked by the oligonucleotide primers. For illumina sequencing, the oligonucleotide primers also contain an adapter region that is added onto the terminus of the amplified 16S rRNA gene DNA, allowing the DNA to be compatible with DNA linked to the illumina sequencer flowcell. The adapter addition is important because it introduces specificity in that only DNA containing the adapter will be sequenced.
Illumina Sequencing:
The environmental DNA extraction provides us with DNA from the organisms in the microbiomes of each of the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park mammals. Analysis of the genomic DNA mixture provides us with biological information such as the identities of the organisms present and the major functions of the microbiomes. This information is stored within the DNA sequence itself. To get access to this sequence information we used Illumina MiSeq.
The illumina sequencer works on a principle called sequence-by-synthesis. Using PCR we amplified all of the 16S regions found in our fecal sample DNA extractions When the PCR-amplified DNA is placed into the flow cell, the adapter region added by PCR binds to complementary oligonucleotides attached to the surface of the flow cell. These oligonucleotides serve as a free 5’-OH group to “prime” the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction. The bound PCR products are sequenced through the addition of fluorescently labelled deoxy-ribonucleotides that glow when they are incorporated into the DNA molecule. Each of these nucleotides glow a different colour, so serve to identify the nucleotide being incorporated. The illumina sequencer records each of these flashes of coloured light and is able to interpret this information to provide a DNA sequence. This happens hundreds of thousands of times in a massively parallel process to sequence all of the amplified DNA from our PCR amplification step. The sequence information can then be used to determine what bacteria are found in the sample.
Illumina sequencing provides a massive amount of data that must then be sifted through with the aid"

We not only introduced synthetic biology, the iGEM Giant Jamboree, other iGEM teams' works, and iGEM high school track but also briefly talked about our project -Smart AlgaEnergy. To advocate the IGEM competition was the main purpose of this seminar. We hoped it could stimulate their passion for synthetic biology, maybe even becoming iGEMers in the future! After our presentation, both NYMU-iGEM team and TFGBC wanted to have further academic exchanges in the future, such as lab visiting, student practices and so on.

Asist a 2018 iGEM team
During the period of iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10-Year Exhibition, the team has received messages from the Genetic Engineering Club members of The Affiliated High School of National Cheng Chi University.They are willing to set up an iGEM team next year, but they are uncertain of everything about iGEM. Therefore, they want to visit our exhibition and join the forum on iGEMers’ past and future. In two weekends, we took the club members to visit our laboratory, and explained to them about the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology. Also, we talked about our project in order to give them more details and views about iGEM. In fact, this is a very special communication, and we feel honored that we have triggered their passion for synthetic biology. We hope that they can set up their own iGEM team next year successfully, and we look forward to having further academic exchanges in the future. Most importantly, we believe that they can show their creativity and bring surprises to the whole world.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

    Through genomic mutation and high-throughput screening, we obtained a strain L. lactis WH101 with good acid resistance at pH 5.0 from 35,000 strains. Next, we compared the NZ9000 and WH101 by transcriptomics analysis and mathematical model and obtain key acid resistant components—msmK gene.
    The survival rate of L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 in acid stress result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-flood higher survival rate than parent one after 3 hours at pH 4.0.

○ Introduction
Naturally, the bacteria have developed several kinds of acid resistance system to ensure the survival under extremely acidic environment [11]. GlsA is a newly characterized functional gene in E.coli which encodes an acid-activated glutaminase [12].
This kind of glutaminase is able to catalyze a reaction in which the glutamine (Gln) and water will be transformed into glutamate (Glu) and gaseous ammonia [13]. The free gaseous ammonia will consume the proton (H+) and increase the intracellular pH (Fig.9). The robust glutaminase activity only exists at pH 6.0 or lower. The highest activity is obtained at pH 4.0, followed by pH 5.0 and 6.0. In contrast, GlsA is not activated at pH 7.0 and 8.0 [14]. The dependence on pH makes it an effective tool to respond when necessary.
Fig.9 The mechanism of GlsA
With the presence of extracellular glutamine (Gln), the membrane amino acid antiporter GadC will transport Gln into the cytoplasm, subsequently the glutaminase encoded by GlsA will transform Gln to Glu (glutamate) and release gaseous ammonia. Besides, the production glutamate is able to anticipate in a decarboxylation process led by decarboxylases GadA , and the latter process will also consume H+. More details about GadA wil be discussed in fine-regulation circuits .
○ Design
The functional gene GlsA is used for acid resistance in our project and is able to regulate the intracellular pH when the environment turns to acidic. It has been reported to protect E.coli from extremely acidic environment so we came up with the gene circuit of acid resistance part (Fig.10). A strong constitutive promoter J23119 controls the transcription of GlsA. The function of glsA will be activated under acidic environment and it will play a"

As the stability of our design relies heavily on having a balance in transcription/translation rates and inducer/promoter interactions from different components of the construct, it is necessary to understand how each component behaves in order to fine tune the construct for optimal performance. Therefore, we made smaller constructs to characterize each individual component in terms of promoter strengths, cross-talk between repressors and non-target promoters,"

For the purposes given above, we made liquid culture of two different bacteria together; bacteria including only pColA-Toehold-GFP plasmid and bacteria including pCola-Toehold-GFP and PSB1C3-Trigger RNA. We incubated these bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37C and added IPTG into their mediums at 13. hour. After adding IPTG, we incubated them for more 3 hours at 37C. At the end of three hours, we firstly measured GFP fluorescence of the grown cultures by using VarioScan device.  The results of measurements are given above. They were made twice.
When the results are analyzed, it is obvious that Toehold-Trigger RNA parts gave very high amounts of flourescence together while Toehold-GFP part gave flourescence in a very low amount. There is almost 15 times difference between these two fluoroscence amounts.  This proves that Toehold-Trigger system works successfully. Also it is shown that systems work IPTG-dependently.
The graphs of measurement results are given below. The difference between two systems can be observed clearly.
Figure : GFP flourescent measurrement in LB mediums.
We also observed the liquid cultures under the fluorescence microscope.
Figure 2: Flourescence microscope image of GFP producing E. coli.
For better results, we isolated protein and we fluorimetrically measured them. Firstly we centrifuged the liquid cultures which were incubated for 16 hours. We took pictures of tubes after centrifugation, they are shown belown.
Figure : Pellets can be seen after 16 hours of liquid culter precipitated.
We applied Standard protein isolation protocol after this centrifuge and managed to isolate protein from the occured pellets. We made GFP fluorescence measurement with VarioScan from those isolated proteins. The results of measurements are shown below.
The measurement results of isolated proteins indicate that Toehold-Trigger system works very efficiently. GFP fluorescence amount of Toehold-trigger RNA including bacteria is about 175 times more than only Toehold including bacteria’s. also the leak of this system is almost negligible. In the absence of Trigger RNA, Toehold’s GFP fluorescence is almost zero. This indicates that our system works very efficient and in a very specific way.

Huge lack of well-characterized biological parts.
Hard to predict multiple part biological circuits.
The lack of knowledge about sequence to function relationship, which hinders the development of novel synthetic biological parts.
Biological circuit testing is complicated and extremely time consuming
Close
Week 5
We have further discussed the current issues we have outlined during the last meeting.
More
In the end, the lack of well described biological parts and the insufficient knowledge about the biomolecular sequence to function relationship seemed like the 2 most pressing problems to solve right now. That is because basic parts are the core of synthetic biology, and if we cannot understand how the separate elements work or cannot engineer completely novel parts for our needs, it is, and will continue to be difficult task to create complex, yet useful systems that we dream synthetic biology can achieve.
Close
Week 6
We have agreed to initially investigate what are the current state of the art methods for characterization of biological part sequence to function relationships.              This was done in order for us to understand if our system should be based on already existing technology foundations or constructed fully from scratch.
Week 7
As we have narrowed down the problem we wanted to solve, we have then determined the stakeholders that would enable us to solve these problems as efficient as possible and that could help us reflect how our designed solutions would affect the world.
.
Stakeholders Of CAT-Seq
1. Life Sciences Center in Vilnius - one of the main collaborative research facilities in Lithuania, where academics from all over the Lithuania, and also the world, come together to solve various fundamental and engineering problems. We see LSC as an important stakeholder, as it can immensely influence our project in terms of helping us to forecast the right solutions to problems we are trying to solve.
2. Droplet Genomics - a startup based in Lithuania specializing in droplet microfluidics and single cell research. People at droplet genomics (DG) are worldwide experts in high-throughput research using microtechnologies. As we want to innovate the throughput and precision of part characterization even further, there was no better place to start then at the company which performs state of the art high-throughput research.
3. Thermo Fisher Scientific -  Thermo Fisher’s R&D sector has a long history of working with directed evolution and protein engineering. We are extremely interested in navigating the space of sequence to function relationship, therefore we wanted to establish a line of communication with Thermofisher, in order for them to share their experience and help us"

Problems with Current Pest Control Techniques
Small Molecule Pesticides
Small molecule pesticides or bio-pesticides are unconventional pesticides that use substances which make up, or are produced, by plants and animals. Examples of these bio-pesticides include pheromones, enzymes, hormones, and even micro-organisms as a method of pest control [2].  These types of pesticides are excellent alternatives to traditional chemical pesticides. Advantages of this type of pesticide include low inherent-toxicity to target and non-target organisms, low persistence in the environment, and low likelihood of selecting for pest resistance [2].  Disadvantages of bio-pesticides include a typically slower mortality rate for the pests as well as a higher susceptibility to variable environmental conditions [3]. There is also an issue of properly storing pesticides that are made out of biomolecules. One of the most well-known examples of small molecule pesticides is DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). Short term studies have shown that the potential benefits outweighed the risks. However, the stability of DDT, persistence in the environment, accumulation in adipose tissue, and potential estrogenic properties raise concerns over long term use. Accumulation through the trophic levels leads to adverse side effects such as thinning of falcon eggshells, leading to population decline [4].
Biological Pest Control
Biological pest control involves the use of natural predators against pests. In many cases, the pests are invasive species which have escaped from their natural ecosystem. When the natural predator of the pest is not present, the pest has the opportunity to proliferate without control [5]. Natural predators are then imported after pre- and post-release testing is done. Pre-release testing involves testing the natural predator to ensure it will not take over and proliferate in the ecosystem itself, as well as non-target testing to ensure beneficial species will not be targeted [6]. Testing is initially done in the lab; once there is enough data supporting the efficacy of the predator, field tests are done. Field tests give a better representation of what to expect post-release. Upon government approval, the predator is released into the ecosystem. Potential downfalls of biological pest control include predatory species"

Thirdly, we need to be accurate and effective in influencing the stakeholders and improving public health. To do this, we chose the “specialization” step to consult experts, doctors, specialists and related stakeholders of sectors and describe what had have been done so far and inquire what could further be conveyed.
LLastly, all the acquired data and knowledge could be utilized to form a product. However, we must obstruct the possible consequences and side effects of this product. The public should also be informed to prevent any social reaction. Therefore, we have conducted extensive research and performed several brain-storming sessions to depict the applicability of the product, and this is named as the “application” step.
Collaboration
For collaboration, we invited Paris Bettencourt iGEM team to the International Turgut Ozal Medical Congress, which our university hosts. The congress has the highest number of attendants in between medical congress’ across the nation. During the congress, together with the Paris Bettencourt team, a workshop on synthetic biology was organized. The unlimited potential that synthetic biology bears was delved into.
Secondly, we invited METU Turkey iGEM team to our university for dinner. We presented our projects respectively and discussed some ideas regarding our projects. We also debated on how we can help each other and what we can do for collaboration purposes or P&P. METU Turkey iGEM team requested to use some of the parts present in our iGEM kit plates for their project, which we gladly accepted.

After careful consideration and weighing both advantages and disadvantages of those two chassis strains, we finally adopted their suggestion and chose Bacillus subtilis to be the chassis bacteria in the dialysis system. Thanks TMMU China for their valuable suggestion and we believe all the groups attending this conference have gotten some useful advice. All in all, collaborations let our opinions more diversified and let our projects more intact.
West China Hospital Visiting for the 1st time With Dr. Yi Liu
After determining the main content and purpose of this project, we began to search for more related references to replenish our design. However, through this period, we found we shouldn’t only rely on references to design our subject. The data we researched on the Internet might not be real-time or specific enough, and a better way to know whether our design is meaningful to the clinic is getting close to it. Hence, we went to hospital and talked with doctors to get some first-hand clinic data and explore the real problems which they are facing with in the real clinical situation.
On 23rd April 2017, we went to rheumatology and immunology department, WestChina Hospital to visit Doctor Liu Yi. Doc. Liu introduced the cure situation of gout to us from many aspects, including patients’ condition, current clinical treatment methods, general drugs, etc. She also pointed out the argument on whether patients with hyperuricemia but no gout symptom should take medicine. Moreover, during the conversation, we knew that the biggest problem in the progress of decreasing patients’ uric acid level is that patients refuse to take medicine or can’t insist, for the cure progress is long and painful. Luckily, our design can be an alternative and suitable choice for patients, especially for those who are hyperuricemia but don’t have gout, as using the merit of intestinal flora, letting them colorize in patients’ gut can reduce the frequency of taking medicine. If our design can come true, then it will be a totally new and harmless method in the cure of hyperuricemia or gout.
The conversation with Dr. Liu benefited us a lot and gave us confidence to keep doing such research, as we had confirmed that what we aim to do has necessity and is valuable to the clinical circumstance. In addition, the supportive attitude and encouragement Dr. Liu gave us rendered us firmed our determination to make this year’s project as perfect as we can.

Biohub 2.0
What is Biohub 2.0?
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval and more convenient biological ideas sharing. It is constructed on the basis of iGEM's official database. The parts inside are filtered and ordered intelligently, and presented to users in a friendly way. Users can grade the parts they've used, or post critical articles under them and exchange ideas with other users. All the data collected in the community will be used for more accurate ordering.
More than a community, Biohub 2.0 is also a flexible plugin system, which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Plugins will have full access to the community's data, so plugin developers can make further analysis of the parts. It's also welcome to deploy plugins that implement useful synthetic biological algorithms. With this mechanism, new tools and algorithms can be acquainted by other scientists more quickly.
How to use it?
You may visit biohub.technology to have a try, or simply clone down our repository and run it locally. For more details, Please refer to our demonstration or installation guidance.
Motivation
The numerous parts provided by iGEM Parts Registry are precious to the biologists, but unfortunately displayed in a terrible way. For synthetic biologists with little or no knowledge about programming, the only approach to access the parts is by submitting the search box on the official pages, which is however too crude to use. The default matching algorithm defies multi-dimensional searching, and the default ordering is just wasting users' time. It's hopeless to get anything useful via this tool. Thus, a software to mine high-quality parts accurately is urgently needed.
With the data dumped from iGEM Parts Registry, which contains information like sample status or used times, the parts can be roughly ranked. But further ranking can only be accomplished after experiments are done, which requires the assistance from the whole community. Such feedback mechanism does exist in iGEM Parts Registry, which is called Experiences, but is seldom used probably because of its hard-to-use interface. We think a user-friendly forum centred on Biobricks is necessary, where users can grade the parts they've used, or share experiences with other"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

Overview
Collaboration has always played a crucial part in human society. So it is with the iGEM competition. Through various  meaningful collaborations with teams around the world, we truly experienced the joy of helping and sharing. Meanwhile, it is also a great chance to spread the idea of iGEM to more people.
In terms of that, we Nanjing-China host our own meet up as well as enthusiastically respond to collaboration invitations from other teams.
1.Language project with IIT Madras
This year, we contacted team IIT Madras and worked with them to make an educational video on synthetic biology. Not only did we help translate the scripts into Chinese, we also recorded the audio of all the lines. Our effort contributed to their multi-language project with the Mandarin version.
Later, we received the finished video. To  make the video accessible by more people in China, we posted it on Sina Weibo  and spreaded it widely. Our efforts were paid by many thumbs up and likes. It  is meaningful and informative to propagate biology in such interesting way so that more people would have a glimpse of the scientific world and gain more interest  in it.

2.Meet up with iGEM teams in Nanjing & the fifth CCiC in Shanghai
We have effectively communicated with many teams in various forms.
To share with each other our project and to chase perfection, we invited Professor Haoqian Zhang and all teams in Nanjing  to hold a meet up at Nanjing University. During the time spent together, we broadened  our horizon by listening to the diverse innovative opinions and gained a lot of joy by sharing stories along the way. Furthermore, through this meeting we  deepened our understanding of iGEM and improved experimental design and methods to optimize our own project.
After that, we also participated the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech University in September. CCiC, Conference"

Our Project
Numerous iGEM teams have designed biological devices that do not sufficiently emphasize their circuit safety measures        or do not include adequate standardized safety switches. In order to address the safety and ethics associated with using        synthetic biology, we wish to design a standardized safety measure in synthetic circuits,        without compromising the function of the construct that was originally designed. Such a system        has potential uses in both single and multicellular organisms, and for different applications - including but not limited        to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.

Next
Our Design
In our design, we employ luxR gene that forms a transcriptionally active complex with 3OC6HSL to activate a downstream     construct. Once activated, the desired functions of the circuit will initiate a ""time bomb"" that terminates this     synthetic process.

Next
Time Bomb
After a period of time (which varies depending on the application), termination of function will be accomplished by knocking     out the genes of interest using Cre-lox and/or Dre-rox. As a result, the entire local population of genetically modified     organisms can be reverted back to its wild-type phenotype, with or without getting exterminated to prevent sudden and     drastic changes in the ecosystem.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html,"108). The logic of scientific research that Beck illustrates shows how safety implications are expected to become known even before the issue can be fully understood. Therefore, scientific experts have taken up the ‘freedom of application’ as inherently part of their scientific liberties to be autonomous in their ability to oversee technological practices (Beck 1999: 61). The myriad of innovative initiatives that stem out of this hence become irrepressible while the accountability for wrongful practice remains unobtainable. This ‘social explosiveness of hazard’ and the increasing prevalence of risks has triggered the emergence of a reflexive fear out of uncertainty and ignorance associated to these risks (Barry 1999; Beck 1996, 1992b: 165). As a consequence, the incentive is produced to become even more dependent on expertise. This, subsequently, makes it possible for scientific experts to claim a monopoly to address the environmental hazard by exercising a public discourse of scientific practice revolving around minimal risk as they feel that increased production of scientific knowledge relieves society from growing uncertainty (Beck 1992a; Blowers 1997). This aspect was made explicit in the team as well when discussing how synthetic biology relates to concerns of uncertainty. As team member Edoardo noted:
“Uncertainty is what pushes the scientist towards doing more research […]. That’s why iGEM pushes [the iGEM teams] so much to safety […], [that] is because they want [us] to think about it […], [that] we thought enough about it to take away as much as we can [away] of the uncertainty […]”
Chapter 3: Transcending Multifaceted Borders
Scientific uncertainty is considered an inherent characteristic in the governance of synthetic biology. According to risk society theorists, this uncertainty also has to do with a setting in which the standards of typical modern institutions such as conventional science and politics fail to accommodate to the concerns relating to rationality and security. They have been treated by the public as suspects causing the risk instead of being considered the trustees who are usually expected to manage them. A decline in the confidence in these institutions and others is what led to a form of modernization that is reflexive in nature, meaning that new arrangements have prompted new institutional reforms for environmental and social objectives. Nevertheless, technological transformations contributed to this evolution, helping to reconfigure the institutional makeup of scientific, political and economic practice (Mol and Jänicke 2009; Beck 2009: 54).
The ‘erosion of trust’ toward science and technology has manifested itself through the disintegration of this fixed and self"

Basic Parts
We have cloned 5 basic parts in total.
HU ( BBa_K1932000 ) is the promoter of our devices, which could regulate the expression of the downstream gene in Bifidobacterium. The sequence of RBS was also added into this basic part.
To improve the stability of the devices in Bifidobacterium, the part of PMB1 ( BBa_K1932001 ), is also included.
Sec2 ( BBa_K1932002 ) and Tmp1 ( BBa_K1932003 ) encode signal peptides that direct the secretion process specifically in Bifidobacterium.
The fifth part encodes TAT-Apoptin ( BBa_K1932004 ). This part was originally introduced by the TecMonterrey team in 2013, which could selectively kill the tumor cells."
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2014,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Part2 Maximize_-_-_TEXT.html," Now the structure of the crown appears in the E. coli cell membrane or cytoplasm.
Test methods
We use formaldehyde to stabilize the connected fusion proteins and Connector, then separate the proteins-Connector complexes and digest the protein. Finally use PCR to detect the three sequences of the Connector which TAL proteins are designed to bind to.
Then, we can test the yield of different product to determine the efficiency of selective combination.
What’s more ?
We are trying to put more enzymes into the polymerization system, which makes the Crown more practical and brilliant. And with more enzymes on the Crown, there will be more possible choices for selective combination.

Introduction
=Overall Project=
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the changes of attitudes of the answerers.
After our providing some knowledge about yeast prions, we are glad to see these who haven't known prions before answering the questionnaire changed their contradictory attitude to prions and the percentage of them  holding the 3 different viewpoints is similar to that of people know about prions before respectively. About 64% of people are not worried about the application of yeast prions and agree that we should use them carefully enough. Clearly we can see that our efforts worked and the public can make their own decisions rationally after being equipped with related knowledge.
Finally we got many ideas about new applications of prions and difficulties we should consider from the reponders in question 6 and 7.
Here are some of the  answers.
Question6: ""To make some temperature-sensitive medical devices."" ""Maybe we can use it for 3D print by controlling its aggregation."" ""We can develop targeted drug with it by connecting prions with devided pieces of drugs. We inject the dispersed prions into the patients and let them to aggregate in the focuses, thus the pieces of drugs can be self-assembled and work."" ""Since yeast prions are sensitive to some drugs, can we employ them to test these drugs?"" ""Is it possible to use them to control the programmed death of fungus in bioengineering?"" ""What if we try to construct micro-robots with prions?"" ""If we can find how yeast prions be affected by some drugs, maybe we can find similar structures in human's prions, thus we can find a cure for Alzheimer's disease."" ""Maybe it can be used to produce a new kind of glue and we can control whether it works by changing the temperature."" ""Since they could be connected to macromoledules and their aggregation can shorten the distance of these chemicals, maybe they can become catalyst in industry.""
Question 7: ""Are you sure they are safe enough for humans only by analyzing theoretically without conducting a lot of experiments?"" ""Please be careful when transforming yeast prions to prevent producing another ""mad cow disease"" for humans."" ""You should try to provide enough information for media first to avoid them from spreading wrong reports and misleading the public."" ""You should make efforts to maintain their activity for a long time if you want to apply them to industry successfully."" ""Maybe you can change its name to make it sound less horrible for the public."" *Prion was translated into Chinese as ""Ruan Bing Du"",which means protein virus. ""Consider potential side-effects to the environment and you should ensure they are not spreaded out of labs or factories."" """
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html,"ing the images on the very right, we suggest that cells expressing indC with the T-domain of plu2642 produce the most indigoidine in the given timeframe, compared to both the delH4- and the bpsA-variant. The combination of the plu2642 T-domain and the indC indigoidine synthetase seems to be ideal, concerning both indigoidine production and overall growth.
PPTase and T-domain Interaction Strongly Influence the Yield of Indigoidine Production
As the previous experiments of shuffled T-domains and different combinations of PPTases showed, there are substantial differences in cell growth and indigoidine production when observed on plates. However, this observations were always of qualitative nature and did not give any insight into quantitative differences. We approached the quantification of indigoidine production in a time-resolved and highly-combinatorial manner: plasmids coding for indC containing all synthetic (4) and native T-domains (3) proven functional by the previous assays were co-transformed with the four functional PPTases.    The indigoidine production over time (30 hours) was measured at its absorption maximum of 590 nm and corrected for the contribution of the cellular components in the medium as described in the methods. As Fig. 8 shows, synthetic T-domains in combination with different PPTases lead to distinct differneces in indogoidin production.
Figure 8: Indigoidine Production Depend on Combination of T-domain and PPTase The absorption spectrum of liquid cultures expressing engineered variants of the indC indigoidine synthetase were measured for 30 hours. The graphs show the OD590 of indigoidine in E. coli liquid cultures over time. The absorption of the cell suspension has been subtracted (see OD Measurement in the Methods section). The left diagram shows the indigoidine production over time of a liquid culture expressing an engineered indigoidine synthetase with the synthetic T-domain #1 (synT1) and a PPTase, whereas each graph refers to a specific PPTase coexpressed. The diagram on the right shows the corresponding data for the indigoidine synthetase with the synthetic T-domain #3 (synT3). The indigoidine production correlates to the combination of a T-domain with a respective PPTase and the PPTases vary in their ability to activate T-domains. For example, DelC is unable to activate synT 1 but activates synT3, whereas svp activates syn"

4. CPEC cloning.
In the final CPEC assembly and cloning reaction, prepared linear vector and inserts are mixed together with the reaction cocktail, which includes dNTPs, 1×PCR buffer and a thermal-stable high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The composition of the CPEC reaction cocktail is almost identical to that of a standard PCR, except that no primers are added. The final vector concentration is normally in the range of 5–10 ng/μL and the insert-to-vector molar ratio is in the range of 1:1 to 2:1. The thermal cycling conditions are also similar to those used for a standard PCR reaction, except that fewer cycles are needed. For example, 1–5 cycles are sufficient to clone a single insert or a less complex library; 15–30 cycles may be needed to assemble multiple fragments or clone complex or combinatorial libraries. Depending on the number of cycles used, the total reaction time can be anywhere from 10 min to a few hours. A stringent annealing temperature should be used for thermal cycling, the value of which is determined by the Tm of the overlapping regions and recommendations for the particular DNA polymerase used. Extension time is calculated by the size of the construct and the extension rate of the polymerase. For single-fragment or single-library cloning, shorter extension times can be used.

3. ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit
Abstract: ClonExpress One Step technology is a simple, fast and highly efficient cloning kit which is based on homologous recombination technology. It allows to directly clone any amplified product(s) to any linearized vector, at any site.

Introduction
ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning kit is a new version cloning kit based on ClonExpress One Step Cloning technology. Exnase MultiS and reaction buffer supplied in this kit are especially optimized for multi-insertion seamless cloning (MultiS for short). With the help of this kit, sequential assembly of up to five insertions can be realized in a single reaction. Additionally, Exnase MultiS is also compatible with the endonuclease digesting reaction and the PCR reaction. Thus, the digesting products or PCR products can be directly applied in recombination reaction without purification, which greatly simplifies the experimental procedures.
Firstly, the expression vector will be linearized at the cloning site of choice. A small sequence (15-20 bp)"

Questionnaire
A questionnaire about the energy issue was designed and then distributed online. In all, 37 questions were asked, and here, we performed the core analysis on the data we collected. We had eventually collected 231 samples, 15 of which were cancelled as invalid samples due to their short answering time (less than 180 seconds). The rest of 216 samples were regarded as valid responds that qualified for further analysis.

Interview
To deeply understand the energy issue from various aspects as well as further develop our system in the real social context, our team conducted a series of interviews with experts from all walks of life. Besides the general voices heard from the public, we discovered the opinions from the relevant industrial communit, the academic researchers and the administrative authority.
Our interviewees include the following:
Professor Qixi Mi from School of physical science and technology at ShanghaiTech University;
Researcher Fei Yu from CAS Key Laboratory of Low-Carbon Conversion Science and Engineering;
Mr. Yujun Lan from Shanghai Energy Conservation Association (SECA);
Ms. Chen from Shanghai Energy Conservation Association (SECA);

Team Collaboration
This year, our team actively collaborated with two iGEM teams in China, which are the team Tsinghua-A from Tsinghua University and the JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University. The team Tsinghua-A focused on constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measuring the capacity of parallel information channels. Our team members, Lechen Qian and Haolong Zhu, helped them to gain access to a better home-built computation platform, applied their knowledge to modify and operate the algorithm, and scanned two key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant) relevant to their modeling project in use of Gillespie Algorithm."

by Pinja Hartikainen
Week 1
What will we do??? We loved the idea of enriched yogurt so we researched the different bacterial species present in yogurt and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of them. Even though we had decided on enriched yogurt, we weren’t sure what to enrich it with so we researched different vitamins and other nutrients important to humans. We chose vitamin A and we started choosing our target population for our product. We studied the vitamin A biosynthesis pathway and how we could exploit it. Our engineers discussed how to optimise biosynthesis pathways using cell sorting and how to make a cheap yogurt maker with solar components. Bravely, Katy started off our weekly cake rota with cherry cupcakes, which were equally tasty as they were cute.
Week 2
Our engineers planned an accessible yogurt maker with a solar oven (yay). They researched the optimum growth temperatures for two yogurt bacteria, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii to see how we could regulate temperature as part of the solar kettle. A thermostat controller, such as Raspberry Pi (cute, right?), and how milk pasteurisation would affect our modified bacteria were also discussed. Our wet lab team studied how to quantify intermediates from the beta-carotene biosynthesis pathway and how to re-engineer relatable aspects of previous iGEM projects. So far no actual wet lab work was done… we were all getting tired of our laptops, apart from our computer scientist, Oliver. Pinja graced us with homemade chocolate-banana bread, although it was sadly slightly"

Week Four: July 14th
This week was a clean-up.  Monday and Wednesday were our testing days.  The Algorithm Manager did not get as much feedback and the Sequence View, however, so I was left with fewer bugs.  Tuesday was spent trying to add the database connections that I talked about in my last post.  Working with Clotho Connections and the ClotoCore, it was fairly easy to exchanged data between the mySQLConnection and the AssemblyConnection.
By Thursday, I had the Algorithm Manager talking to the database.  You could export parts from the database straight into the input area of the Algorithm Manager.  I also added another method to the Algorithm class called “processDatabaseData(String)” in order to take this sort of action into account.  Now, an algorithm can take that individual input and format it in its own specified format.  This method was added to ease use as now the user does not have to remember the specific format, she can simply export and everything is done automatically in the Algorithm Manager.
Next week will be spent doing final testing as well as making sure the documentation is clear and complete.

Human Practice
“Human practice is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.” In our Human Practice section this year, we aimed to share what we know with our community as well as listen to what they think. We collected information about the current situation about our project topic and people’s current knowledge about it, and we also spread our findings and knowledge to different groups of people via various methods. It’s always worth it to step out of labs and reach out to the society around us. See what we have done!
Public Survey of Awareness of Aniline Pollution
At the beginning of our human practice efforts, we wished to acquire first-hand information regarding the public’s current knowledge of pollution causes and synthetic biology approach. So we designed a questionnaire to help us understand different age groups’ knowledge regarding different kinds of pollution, bioremediation treatment approaches, and aniline, the main cause of pollution that we are working on. To cover different age groups, we conducted the survey in schools, in Xuanwu Lake (a popular public park), and online via social media. Results showed that although people are concerned about soil and water pollution, they are generally not quite familiar with their cause or treatment, and most of the respondents didn’t know about aniline compounds. With that information on hand, we could know more specifically what to share in our subsequent HP activities.
See our questionnaire here.
Result analysis:
School Science Fair and Regular Club Activities
Our survey showed that a great portion of students in our school weren’t familiar with the concept of bioremediation and its great potential in the future. So we took advantage of the school science fair and shared our project findings to teachers as well as our fellow classmates. We also took the opportunity to familiarize them with the concepts of bioremediation"

Therefore the process of getting a legal authorization is different regarding certain aspects. For example the toxicity tests are not as standardized for ATMPs because there is a higher variation and they might be more unique, so these test may not fit the active substances. In addition the amount of patients may vary as some diseases are rare and the studies are often oriented at the medical need.
Gene therapeutics are defined as medicaments which contain an active substance which consists or is made out of a recombinant nucleic acid and is used within or is given to human beings to regulate, repair, add, delete or replace nucleic acid sequences. Its therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect also has to stand in direct connection to the recombinant nucleic acid.
Before and after the production permit is given the therapeutic substance has to be developed under the so called Good Manufacturing Production- requirements of the European Medical Agency (EMA) which consists of different formal criteria. These are not only based on the final product but also on the way of production. Once the production permit is granted by the EMA for gene therapeutics, the therapeutic substance is allowed in every country within the European Union.
HDU presentation at the NRW-Day
On Saturday the 27th and Sunday the 28th of August we presented iGEM and our scientific project aiming to fight cancer at the „Haus der Universität“ at the “Schadow-Platz” in Düsseldorf.
This was due to the whole weekend of the „NRW-Day 2016“ being a celebration of North Rhine- Westphalia’s 70th anniversary of its capital city Düsseldorf. It was well visited and successful at the same time.
On the first day we managed to convince a lot of people on the streets to listen to our presentation. We held our presentation in front of a very interested and attentive audience.         Our special guests were the Minister of science Svenja Schulze and the Minister of education Sylvia Löhrmann.
Furthermore, we were able to determine that there is a big necessity to educate the public about synthetic biology by having profound discussions after our talk. To our surprise, some (former) cancer patients visited us during the weekend after having heard from our project through local newspapers.
For the younger generation, we prepared a little experiment in the hallway. The experiment consisted of isolating DNA from pepper by using everyday utensils. Our key task in those two days was to explain the concept of the synthetic biology in a simple and intelligible way to the general public.
Fortunately, we succeeded due to the"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinase derived from the P1 bacteriophage while Dre derives from P1-like transducing phage D6 isolated from         Salmonella oranienburg. (Anastassiadis et al., 2009) (Nagy, 2000) Both of them are tyrosine family of site-specific         recombinases.
Our Design
We designed recombinase expressing genes located just downstream of our time delay module under the regulation of pPhlF.
Diagram 2. Design of recombination system for application
The application of Cre and Dre is one of our main focus in our project. Our design is to insert the lox and rox sites         into the vector plasmid that flanks the origin of replication. When there is an expression of Cre and Dre protein,         Cre and Dre will cause recombination of their corresponding target site. The Cre-lox and Dre-rox systems then induce         deletion of the origin of replication, resulting in two occasions. One is the plasmid without the origin of replication.         The other one is the plasmid with the origin of replication. The plasmid without the origin of replication cannot         carry out DNA replication. In each generation, the population will contain only half of the plasmid with the gene         of interest. After many generations, the amount of plasmid with the gene of interest will be diluted and eventually         none of the cells will contain the plasmid with the gene of interest.
The second occasion, the population will contain the plasmids with the origin of replication only (because of deletion).         However, as the cell will use its resource to replicate the plasmids with the origin of replication. The cell containing         the plasmids with the origin of replication are less competitive than the wild-type. The population containing the         plasmid flanked with origin of replication will be eventually wiped out due to selective pressure. As a result, the         population would revert to its original state before the introduction of the plasmid.
Nevertheless, lox and rox sites are not necessarily flanked around the origin of replication.

Maximizing the efficiency of our knock out switch
Our team emphasizes on the safety of construct design. That is why maximizing the efficiency of our knock out switch         is of paramount importance in our project. We have designed several measures to increase the efficiency of our knock         out switch. First"

Safety
Working in the laboratory with different organisms and reagents may cause a threat to human health and the environment by wrong disposal of waste. With this in mind, we have chosen to work with a GRAS organism and have taken precausion while working in the lab
""Safety is something that happens between your ears, not something you hold in your hands""
Jeff Cooper
Precautionary Work
""Safety is something that happens between your ears, not something you hold in your hands""
Jeff Cooper
To minimize the risks while working on the iGEM project we chose the chassis organism Yarrowia lipolytica which is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) and non-pathogenic to humans. Aside from that we worked with the Escherichia coli DH5 alpha laboratory strain which does not pose a threat to healthy humans.  We also did some growth experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, another GRAS organism.
In our choice of genetic material we considered the risks the origin organism could pose. We only used genes from safe sources such as Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Renilla reinformis and the human gene for pre-insulin codon optimised with our own codon-optimization tool for Y. lipolityca.
Laboratory Safety Measures
All work with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were performed in class 1 GMO laboratories following the required procedures. This include amongst others wearing laboratory coats, gloves and goggles, disinfecting surfaces, tools etc. with ethanol and autoclaving all waste, used tools and discarded cultures. We used laf-benches whenever possible to avoid the fire hazard of gas flames when performing sterile work. The Hamilton robot used as fermentation platform was decontaminated before and after each use with UV light.
In our work with hazardous substances we took extra safety measures and worked with utmost caution. We used laf-benches and powerful suction in the experiments performed with 2-Mercaptoethanol (BME). SYBR-Safe was always handled with gloves and caution. Containers"

Pipette 1μL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube. There will be 5 microcentrifuges that contain 1μL of DNA of different concentration.
Pipette 50μL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath so that thermometer reads 42°C.
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 1 minute. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.
Add 200μL of SOC media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. Prepare the agar plates during this time, also label them with concentration of DNA used.
Pipette 20μL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate with spreader. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates so the agar side is facing up, and the lid is facing down.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency.
Transformation efficiency = (# of colonies on one plate) / (DNA plated in ng × 1000ng/μg)
DNA plated in ng = 1μL × (DNA concentration - refer to vial) × (volume plated (20 μL) / total reaction volume(251 μL))
Note: This refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation.

Let a new collaboration begin!
Sunday, September 21th
After discovering the awesome video of the Edinburgh team on Twitter, we wanted to know more about their project. As it is clear that the three quorum sensing systems we consider are crosstalking, finding a team focused on the development on communication ways between bacteria was really interesting for us. Their topic is metabolic wiring.
We had a Skype meeting with them this week to discuss about possible opportunities of collaboration. Given the stages of our experiments, we decided that a theoretical collaboration would be more plausible. Next step will be to talk about the models and design a set-up that could fit our two projects.

Complexity in town planning and complexity in religion
In the last days Stefanie met an architect and a priest to discuss complexity in their occupational field. Both conversations were highly interesting and at the same very different. It was fascinating and inspiring to once change the point of view and to approach complexity from new positions. For the priest, Josef Fuisz, the struggle of men with complexity might be represented by the following psalm (42.5):
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why so disturbed within me?

Health Risks
Lead has no known biological function, and therefore no place in the human body.[1] The lack of any robust, evolved system to deal with lead means that when it enters the organism, it will not be filtered naturally, and instead act as a disruptive, persistent, and often unnoticed antagonist to normal function. What makes lead so insidious? As it accumulates, lead will begin to take the place of other metals in biochemical reactions, replacing zinc or calcium when it is available for chemical reactions. In fact, “Lead binds to calcium-activated proteins with much higher (105 times) affinity than calcium.”[2] As a result, 75-90% of lead body load is in mineralizing tissues such as teeth and bones.
Because of these issues, the United States’ Environmental Protection Agency, which was tasked to set safe levels of chemicals in drinking water by the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, has set 0 as the Maximum Contaminant Level Goal for lead. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the maximum allowable lead concentration at .015 mg/L (74.8 nM).[3] Any concentration above the set maximum requires additional treatment for removal of lead.  On January 4th, 2014 a new provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act requires that any pipe used for the transport of potable water must contain less than 0.25% lead--a reduction from 8% under the previous law.  Lowering levels of lead in piping will help to reduce lead in drinking water - especially since lead piping is the greatest cause of consumed lead in the US - but environmental routes of pollution still exist.
Lead is especially dangerous for children, as their porous GI tracts and the increased vulnerability and volatility of their developing body systems make them highly susceptible to the disruptive effects of even small amounts of lead. It also takes them much more time to purge it from the body: the half-life of lead in the adult human body is 1"

Conference
Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
From July 30th to Aug 3rd, we joined the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by iGEM NCHU Taichung in Chung Hsing University. More than twenty iGEM teams from Taiwan, China, and Japan gathered around and shared the incredible projects. Lively               discussion surrounds all the time after team presentations and at posters sessions, where we gained many valuable pieces of advice from professors and other overlooking.
In the evening, teams hung out, had dinner, visited night markets, while sharing funny stories and problems encountered during the preparation of Giant Jamboree. Mouth-watering chicken fillet and freshly made pearl milk tea sure brought               us closer together. We had a great time, especially with iGEM Fudan-CHINA, iGEM NAU, and iGEM XMU-China, who kindly approached us looking for the possible cooperation further in the future.
It was a precious experience and practice for us to present our project in front of so many Asia iGEMers before Giant Jamboree. Great thanks to NCHU Taichung iGEM team for hosting such a wonderful conference!!

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information,"
Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter2_-_-_TEXT.html,"AR-BRASIL Team will show the     competition an innovative project of biosensors for early     detection of breast cancer.
According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the     most frequent type of cancer among the women worldwide, both in     developing as well as developed countries. Most deaths from this     disease occur in low and middle income, because the patients are     diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease. Besides the delay     in detecting the tumor, often the resolution on the most effective     treatment is compromised by lack of technical and accurate     diagnostic system. Currently, the diagnosis occurs using image techniques such     mammography and magnetic resonance, which is very expensive     and not portable. One way out of this problem would be the use of     biosensors. This technology is capable of diagnosing infectious     diseases, genetic, metabolic and others. A biosensor is a device that     incorporates a biological element with a physical transudor to generate     a measurable signal proportional to the analyte concentration. Joining LIKA’s scientific experience with C.E.S.A.R.’s technological     skills, a the multidisciplinary team is developing a biosensor for the     detection of breast cancer with the help of robotics. The idea is to build     a system, which is able to process, and prepare small blood samples     in an automated mode through help of bacteria. This system will be     coupled to biosensors that are capable of detecting breast cancer     in its early stages. The goal is to shorten the analysis of samples     from patients that currently take 4-6 hours to less than 30 minutes.     The automation of the entire process, together with the creation of a     specific biosensor for breast cancer, will result in a future decrease in     deaths from the disease, due to a more rapid and effective treatment.

For testing the efficiency of the selection of the correct key     spores from the decoy a superfolder GFP was integrated into the     genome of the key spores. This can be seen in figure 7. Via microscopy and flow cytometry the     selection efficiency could be observed. The superfolder GFP was     integrated into the B. subtilis genome by using the pDR111 B.     subtilis shuttle vector.
Figure 7: Integration of a sfGFP ( BBa_K1930006 ) into the genomic DNA of B. subtilis.
2. NucA key deletion
Even more safety is provided by two key deletion approaches. In     this case, if the recipient doesn’t apply the correct treatment,     the key sequence will be destroyed.
For the design of a nucA key deletion we made use of the     following BioBricks: BBa_R0040 _tetR, BBa_K729004 _nuclease, BBa_B0030 _RBS and BBa_B0015 _terminator. During the cloning process     we expected to obtain the following BioBricks: RBS-nuclease,     tetR-RBS-nuclease and tetR-RBS-nuclease-terminator. The key deletion     is controlled by the constitutively on promoter PtetR. RNA     polymerase binds to the DNA sequence and leads to the expression of     the nuclease. If tetracycline is added, it functions as a     repressor, binds to the promoter and thus leads to the inhibition     of the transcription of the nuclease. If an unauthorized party     tries to grow the key-containing spores in regular growth medium     without the addition of tetracycline, the key deletion will be     active and the DNA will be digested by the nuclease. This process can be seen in figure 8.
Figure 8. If the right repressor is not added a nuclease will cut the genome and thus delete the key sequence.
3. CRISPR key deletion
Another key deletion approach makes use of the CRISPR/Cas9     system. The system can be used as a genome editing tool. The     plasmid pJOE8999 is a shuttle vector with a pUC origin of     replication for E. coli, a kanamycin resistance gene and a     temperature-sensitive"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#translational system#translation mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html,"‑tRNA/synthetase variants adapted to the amber codon and the leucine codon.
The AcF-tRNA/synthetases are integrated in pSB1C3 and are cultivated in E.coli BL21 (DE3) with the matching non canonical amino acid.
Efficiency in Incorporation of Non Canonical Amino Acids
The incorporation of a non canonical amino acid or an endogenous amino acid through an amber codon, can be tested in various ways. A safe method to prove the incorporation is the detection by the mass spectrometry, which is a very accurate, but also a complex and an expensive method. A much simpler method to detect the incorporation is the Measurement Kit, introduced by iGEM team Austen-Texas 2014 and applied by iGEM team Aachen 2016.  The Measurement Kit is based on a reporter plasmid combined with a screening plasmid that contains the tRNA and corresponding amino acyl‑synthetase (aaRS). The screening plasmid and the reporter plasmid have to be cotransformed. The reporter plasmid is constructed with a mRFP domain. This domain is connected through a linker sequence, containing a recoded amber stop codon, with a sfGFP domain.
Unfortunately the specificity of an orthogonal tRNA aminoacyl-synthetase pair and the amber stop codon is not optimal. Endogenous amino acids are also incorporated, so the screening system is not completely, towards detection of the ncAA. In addition to this problem, some orthogonal tRNA synthetases posess a low efficiency, thus fewer ncAA are incorporated. Although the screening system enables to compare the efficiency, a low sfGFP signal in some cases can be difficult to detect. For this  construct, the incorporation of ncAA is detectable throughout the fluorescence of the mRFP or sfGFP. If the ncAA is incorporated within the linker sequence, a red and green fluorescence is detectable. If the ncAA is not incorporated, mRFP is expressed, but not sfGFP, so only red fluorescence is detectable.
For our toolkit, we applied six different ncAA and therefore, six different tRNA‑aminoacyl synthetases. We characterized the efficiency of each synthetase in accordancce to the incorporation efficiency of the matching ncAA.

Our main collaboration was with University of Chicago's iGEM team. On our Skype call they offered advice on how to design our box for UV irradiation. We also sent three of our resistance genes, uvsE, Dsup, and phrAC, along with the BCP gene to U Chicago's iGEM team to transform our genes into yeast, in order to see how well the resistance translated to eukaryotic organisms. Unfortunately, the transformations were unsuccessful, but we hopefully will be able to continue the collaboration if our project continues in the future."

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Affibody-AAV was produced [link to protocol of virus production] , and used for transduction of human cancer cell line (HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line).
As the Affibody was predesigned to include 3xFLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) in its sequence, we used anti-FLAG-specific primary antibody to specifically detect the protein in human cancer cells (HT1080 fibrosarcoma) using immunofluorescence [link to staining protocol] .  We used two staining protocols, with and w/o permeabilization step, in an attempt to distinguish between extracellular membrane localization and intracellular expression. As shown in Fig. 3, transfection with Affibody-expressing vector resulted in detectable Affibody expression only when permeabilization step was applied. This could indicate the the protein construct is expressed, but it is not correctly transported and localized to the outer membrane, or FLAG sequence (the antigen for the primary Ab) is located inside the cytoplasm.

Representative images of Affibody expression in human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, using Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody (methanol fixation & permeabilization). C. Lack of staining w/o permeabilization step (fixation with 4% PFA in PBS). D. Negative control (w/o primary antibody).
Conclusion and future aspects
Affibody construct could be successfully expressed in human cancer cells. However, the design of the construct should be optimized to ensure the expression on the outer cell membrane for its subsequent use for cancer cell tagging and targeting. For detection, primary Ab against Affibody part of the construct is preferable, in order to clearly validate the expression on the outer membrane.                 In the future, the Affibody could be expressed exclusively in cancer cells using our Boomerang approach using dCas9-VP64-gRNA system under the control of cancer-specific promoters.

Of course we were more than happy to introduce those high school students to     the concepts of synthetic and cell-free biology, and hopefully pass on our     motivation for the exciting field of bioengineering. The more than 25 high     school students, in 9th grade and from the gymnasium Lerbermatt ,     Bern, would be spending half a day with us, which gave us plenty of time to     let them do fun experiments with our guidance. After discussing the matter     within the team, we made a list of several experiments and prepared everything     for their arrival; we planned on explaining to them the working of chromoproteins     and letting them perform a lysate reaction in tubes. We started with a presentation     on what the iGEM competition is, placing it within its context of synthetic biology     and explaining how this field is transforming the world we live in.
We then explained the workshop we had set up for them. Experiments included showing     the enzyme activity of beta-galactosidase, which is closely related to our project     as it is the reporter protein in our detection scheme. Another experiment was     performing an E.Coli lysate reaction, where we explained how we make the lysate     in the lab and what the advantages of a cell-free environment are. They would also     prepare a PCR reaction, after we explained to them how the PCR machine works and     that it's something we use every day in the lab, as well as prepare an agarose gel     and run the electrophoresis and check the gel under the UV illuminator at the end.     The last experiment would serve to explain how recombinant proteins, transformation     and cloning all are connected as the students would plate E.Coli cells transformed     with chromoproteins on agar plates. Beforehand a safety coordinator at EPFL had     approved this workshop, and we worked with P1 equipment and components only. In     the lab, we equipped every student with a lab coat, a pair of gloves and glasses     to ensure safety and  and divided them into groups of two. In those groups they     performed the experiments, with us explaining some select biological principles     at work (eg. protein expression, cell-free biology, transformation, cloning) and    a paper manual we wrote to resume the course of experiments.

Introduction
IGEM encourages participants to conduct human practice, to see the world, and to exchange experience with other people. We love this idea because it offers us a chance to get inspired by the society, allows us to better understand the meaning of our scientific research, and constantly reminds us how and why we should contribute back to the society. Therefore, we strived to integrate human practice activity closely into our project advancement.
We began by surveying the public knowledge of intestinal diseases and by interviewing three leading professionals (doctors and researcher) to get a vivid understanding of the severity and incidence of intestinal diseases. We realized intestinal diseases including IBD, are big threats to human health, yet without a cure and without sufficient public acquaintance. We therefore decided to tangle IBD by engineered bacteria and succeeded in proof-of-concept experiment in using bacteria produced therapeutic agent (EGF) to alleviate IBD symptoms. During the communications with other teams , we received concerns on safety issues that we must deal with. So we upgraded our biosafety strategies by not only using two types of kill switches, but also using a 'warship' (which limits bacteria spreading and still allows nutrient and chemical exchanging). In addition, in the spirit of raising public interests, we established an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI) to advertise the beauty of synthetic biology to the community. Meanwhile, we used posters and popular social media to introduce intestinal bowel disease and our work to the society.
Interviews
At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatments but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties. In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, we interviewed Professor Pengfei Lu who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester. He specializes in development and proliferation.
When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD,"

Today we digested the sac minipreps with EcoRI and XbaI. It seems clear that there was something wrong with the minipreps (such as poor procedure) as there seemed to be little or no DNA in the sample.
Did a gel fragment clean up on the sspb fragment cut from the gel, this was put in the 'fragments' box in the freezer ready for later.
50ul of ara+pSB1AT3 plasmid was cut with SpeI and PstI in order to insert the sspb fragment after the operator. Rather than doing a gel fragment prep a PCR clean up (kit) was done on the digest to save time.
We ligated the ara + sspb fragments using Chris' method:
2ul Ligase buffer
2.5ul Vector DNA
14.5ul insert DNA
1ul ligase
= 20ul
This was left in the fridge overnight to improve the ligation conditions.

We planned to make electro competent cells today but we got the required OD of 0.5 to 1 a bit late. We hoped to make cells if the meeting finishes quicker, but sadly it took longer than expected hence we had to waste the culture that was grown. Laura gave a new protocol for preparing chemically competent cells and also 6 ml of buffer required. We decided to prepare the cells tomorrow, hence I again made some 3 culture tubes of top10 cells.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Nanoparticle Researchers
Dr. Eric Lee
Before we started to conduct experiments, we emailed Dr. Eric P. Lee, senior member of technical staff at Maxim Integrated, and TAS alumnus, to ask him some general questions about our approach of our project. We told him about our two approaches, one with E. coli receptors that bind to the capping agents of nanoparticles, the other with biofilm that traps nanoparticles. Dr. Lee suggested that our membrane receptor must be specific to a particular capping agent. He also commented that the biofilm approach was a good idea since we could trap multiple types of nanoparticles regardless of their capping agent. (Interviewed by Emily C.)
Dr. Gwo-Dong Roam
We interviewed Professor Roam of National Central University and former general director of the Environmental Analysis Labs (EAL) of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency to learn more about the background and potential threat of nanoparticles. Dr. Roam informed us that the most common nanoparticles used in Taiwan include: TiO2, ZnO, Ag, Au, Fe, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Clay, and Graphene. He also told us that the toxicity of a nanoparticle is directly related to its size. With the increased use of nanoparticles in society, Dr. Roam believes that more attention should be placed on waste management, risk assessment and regulations.
After our first visit to the Dihua WWTP, we learned that the sludge removed from wastewater is either 1) sent to landfills, 2) used as fertilizer, or 3) incinerated. We asked Dr. Roam if sludge containing aggregated nanoparticles will still be harmful to the environment if disposed of using current methods. He said that all of these sludge disposal solutions were still harmful to the environment, but were better than letting the nanoparticles flow into bodies of water. He also said that there are currently no regulations or guidelines as to which sized nanoparticle are toxic to the environment or animals and that it was unclear as to which"
