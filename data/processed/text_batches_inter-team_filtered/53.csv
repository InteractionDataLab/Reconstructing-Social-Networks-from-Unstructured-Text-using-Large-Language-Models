Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," part. This construction was sent in for sequencing over the weekend.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The sequencing of the J04500 + β-lactamase with a His tag construction ( BBa_K1189007 ) from last week revealed that we had successfully completed this part. Mutagenesis primers were designed for this gene as a BsaI cut site is present in the sequence which could interfere with any Golden Gate assembly attempted with this part. Successful mutation of this part was completed and confirmed via gel electrophoresis and sequencing. A preliminary test was also attempted with this part in order to see if the leaky properties of the LacI ( BBa_J04500 ) promoter could successfully produce β-lactamase at levels large enough to allow the transformed cells to survive on plates containing ampicillin even though this part exists in a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid (pSB1C3). This test successfully displayed that active β-lactamase was being produced by our cells. Also produced this week was the plasmid switch of the β-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the C-terminus and the β-lactamase gene with a glycine linker at the N-terminus.
We setup the experimental apparatus we expect to use for the synthesis of apoferritin and magnetoferritin. The lack of equipment for real anoxic environments meant we had to Macgyver parts together to form a makeshift usable apparatus.
We also began the staining of ferritin with ferrocyanide, which will create a product that has the potential to act as a reporter, similar to horse radish peroxidase. Initially, we had concerns due to the production of hydrogen cyanide from one of our reagents, ferrocyanide. But this concern was relieved after talking to chemists that had experience with this compound, telling us our conditions were not harsh enough to evolve hydrogen cyanide. Production of prussian blue ferritin was simple and safe, producing a light blue solution.
We tried to use 280nm absorbance as a means to detect protein concentration of ferritin. The resulting absorbances are erratic and therefore this method was determined to be too unreliable to be feasible. Initial testing of the prussian blue ferritin was also done, by adding the reagents required for a colourimetric output, results look promising as we see the expected colour change (Figure 5).

The transformed cells (DH5α by Dr. MB lab) did not grow. The positive and negative control did not have any cells grown. The cell DNA control was re-done and spread on LB plates rather than LB-Chl plates. This was one mistake done: incubate cell control DNA in LB-Chl plates. The protocol done today was to add 50μL of competent cells only and proceed to steps 12, 14-16 (no heat shock, ect).

Poster Session
In September, two of our team members went to Davos, Switzerland, to attend    the Summer School on Shaping the Future of Bioengineering. There we presented    our project as well as a first poster at a poster session and got feedback from    professionals in academia and industry on key experiments and how to present    our data in a more scientific manner.
At the same time we learned about and discussed related applications and expansions   to our project (like what a 3D dignostics kit could look like, how to test for several   diseases at the same time, who would be interested in this kits, and much more),   which decidedly had a big impact on our ideas and is further explained in the   Outlook section.

We also took part in the Computational Biology Symposium 2017 hosted at EPFL    in October to present the software part of our project during a poster session.    Three team members were present to explain what our iGEM project was about and    exchange ideas on how to make our code public in the best way. At the end of the    day we were happy to have found the most suitable solution to this problem and    having gained absolutely inspiring insights into the world of computational    biology.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," residues leaking from pharmaceutical manufacturing [3],[4]. Excretion of active pharmaceutical substances after human usage is documented to be the primary source of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment [4]. From Figure 1 presented below, it becomes apparent that this route would not have been the main one if WWTPs were capable of removing pharmaceuticals adequately from sewage. In the words of Christian Baresel expert, research coordinator and project manager at IVL (Swedish Environmental Research Institute): “There are pharmaceuticals in the effluent of WWTPs. Today there is a high removal of microplastics, but not for pharmaceuticals’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
Figure 1. Entry routes of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment. (Redesigned from Boxal AB 2004 [5])
One of the most significant implications of pharmaceutical pollution in the water is the development of antibiotic resistance, posing an apparent and substantial danger to human health. The presence of antibiotics in the environment promotes acquisition or independent evolution of resistance from bacteria that normally lack innate antibiotic capacity [6].
It is worth noting that resistance in bacteria can be developed even in exposure levels lower than the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) [7]. Thus, aquatic environment contaminated with antibiotics can serve as a reservoir for resistance that can be transferred to clinically vital bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms [8]. Eventually, these resistant bacteria with clinical importance disseminate and reach humans either via food or direct exposure to animal hosts [9, 10].
Another important implication of pharmaceuticals in the water is the ecotoxic effects they have on marine organisms. Pharmaceuticals are designed to intervene in biological pathways, some of which are evolutionary conserved across different species. Hence, pharmaceuticals that were designed to have an effect on some species (including humans) may also exert significant effects on the physiological function of other organisms [11]. Due to their low but consistent concentrations, concerns arise primarily for the chronic rather than the acute ecotoxic effects, which are substantially more difficult to be defined and proved [12]. In addition, mixtures of active substances are present simultaneously in the aquatic environment and generally cause higher effects than each of their comprising components alone (synergistic effect), increasing the combined toxicity [13].
In the Baltic Sea, the effects of pharmaceutical pollution in the ecosystem are remarkably high due to the low water exchange rate, low biodiversity and the physiological stress induced by brackish water conditions. Therefore, the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly susceptible to hazardous pharmaceutical substances [14].
One of the main substances that contributes to pharmaceutical pollution and its implications in the Baltic"

Low Budget iGEM
Lab Constest
Overview
It is well known that doing science is expensive and lot of economical resources are needed, specially in Synthetic Biology.Processes like PCR, DNA extraction, miniPrep, among others, need specialized equipment and chemical compounds that have considerably high prices and only a few people can afford them. Costs in materials affect the development in Latin American researches in the Synthetic Biology field and the formation of new iGEM teams in Latin America.
Considering this we decided to organize a non-time consuming competition called Low Budget iGEM that aimed to demonstrate that most of the protocols may have a new and cheaper way go being conducted. We also wanted to know the teams before the competition.
What was the competition about?
The teams that accepted this challenge had to design a new and cheaper way to make a normal protocol in the lab. At the beginning, we proposed that the participants could choose between PCR, DNA extraction and transformation but we decided that they could do any other protocol the want to. We received excellent and very interesting results, we invite you to check out the process.
Contest notice
As soon as the idea came out we try to contact as much teams as possible trough Twitter and we had the opportunity to have Skype meeting with some of them:
Skype Meeting with Tec Monterrey Team
We talked with almost 25 Teams all around the world, some times we had to wake early in order to communicate with them. We send a pdf file with the contest's instructions to everyone that seemed interested, you can check it:

We also made this video to remind the teams about the contest and to gather more participants:

Public engagement
    We are very concerned about the public engagement in synthetic biology. We have to admit that transgene has been doubted since it came into being, and the idea of synthetic biology is heard much less, which make the public much easier to misunderstand it. Apparently, synthetic biology will not “save the world”, but it has a lot of potential to make it a better one. As iGEMers, we hope to contribute to expand the public understanding of synthetic biology, so that to save the potential from the public’s misunderstanding. From another aspect, burying ourselves in the lab is not a sensible idea, so we need the voices outside lab to help us to know what we have been engaged in better. So we organized some activities concerned public engagement to interact with people. To our satisfactory, we got positive feedbacks and were inspired in a way.
    What role should the public play in science? We have been thinking about these since the beginning of our project. In China, people are familiar with the heated debate between the media people and the biologists about transgene. We wonder if synthetic biology will become the next topic? We consider the correct knowledge is the first thing that the public should have, for misunderstanding may lead to fear and rejection. And then they could engage in the process by giving suggestions from their aspect.
 
    So we attended STEM festival in Suzhou. STEM is a concept of education that advocates students learning like scientists and engineers, which fits well with the aspects of synthetic biology in a way.
 
    We set up a stall in the exhibition hall with XJTLU. We have a poster to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and our team. What attracted people most was the room escape computer"

NADH Oxidase
This is a novel part submitted to the registry from the NCBI database, NADH oxidase/NADH dehydrogenase from Streptococcus sanguinis. Nox encodes the H2O-forming NADH oxidase enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of NADH to form water:
4 NADH + O2 → 4 NAD+ + 2 H2O + 4 e-
We also designed a Nox protein with an N-terminus His tag to purify the protein using ELISA (BBa_K2182001), and a modified RBS sequence based on the BBa_K1123010 RBS used by TU Eindhoven 2013 under the FNR promoter. Our version has been optimized to reduce homodimer formation during PCR ( BBa_K2182004 ).

Argonne National Laboratory
Our team contacted and discussed with Edward Barry, from Argonne National Laboratory. He helped us further understand how our project can be applied into the real world and how we can potentially spread our project idea. His advice on how industry level research must meet high standards to pass into implementation was insightful and eye-opening and his suggestions on how to contact other companies and laboratories to spread word of our project was crucial to helping us reach out beyond our comfort zone. Argonne itself is one of the nation's top research centers with a history dating back to the Manhattan Project in 1940, but their Oleo Sponge which was built to respond to oil spills caught our attention which spurred us to meet up and talk to them about their experiences. We aimed to contact the laboratory in order to see the greater application of our own project. Their perspective on how ideas are developed and then transformed into working products were valuable and helped us conceptualize the process of making our ideas into reality. From this discussion we were able to change our applied design section. Their suggestion was for us to have a sponge with our degrading bacteria implemented within. However, with this new idea, our design transformed into the idea of having the water w/oil being pumped into a separate factory. Sponges would then be placed into the water and oil mixture where  the former will soak up oil and the degradation process would take place inside the sponge. This method is a large improvement from before because now the oil would be controlled in one area as opposed to being ambiguously spread out.

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Schistosoma_-_-_TEXT.html," even after treatment with Praziquantel. It is caused by S. mansoni, S. japonicum and S. mekongi. Technically early inflammatory and late fibriotic hepatic disease, also called Symmers' clay-pipestem fibrosis of the liver, are two distinct conditions, in terms of morbidity, clinical practise and immunological mechanism, although they are combined here as hepatic (and hepatosplenic) schistosomiasis Cheever (1968) .
A mild inflammation is most common in young individuals especially during the early stages of infection and can be observed in around 80% of infected children. The main cause of hepatomegaly are ova which got caught in the presinusoidal periportal spaces of the liver, giving rise to sharp-edged enlargements of the left liver lobe as well as nodular splenomegaly reaching from the costal arch to the umbilicus or in extreme cases even to the pelvis. During chronic infection with Schistosoma however fibrotic or chronic hepatic schistosomiasis can arise in a small proportion of mostly young to middle aged adults in particular those with a high parasite load, although immunogenetic predispositions are thought to be the most significant risk factor (Chevillard et al. 2003) . The disease is caused by heavy deposition of diffuse collagen in the periportal space leading to a hardening of the liver and obstruction of blood flow through the portal veins, which can result in portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and others including commonly fatal bleedings in that latest stages (Bica et al. 2000) .
The liver complications caused by S. japonicum can progress much faster from early mild to chronic stages resulting in sudden onset of bleeding.
Neuroschistosomiasis
This condition is the second most common presentation of infection by S. mansoni also causing granulomatous inflammatory reaction due to schistosome eggs reaching the spinal cord or brain via the vascular system, mainly through ""arterial or retrograde venous blood flow via the valveless perivertebral plexus of Batson"", or by occasional migration of adult schistosomes. The main clinical syndromes are spinal cord neuroschistosomiasis divided into acute or subacute myelopathy and localized cerebral or cerebella neuroschistosomiasis. The later gives rise to focal CNS impairment, seizures as well as increased intracranial pressure. Presumptive diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis relies on"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html," blood production was modeled with a simplified linear age population method which provided similar accuracy to more computationally intensive PDE solvers. The red blood cell production model is then combined with the compartment and infection model to determine the effects of EPO gene doping on red blood cell count.
Comprehensive cell cycle model for RBCs in the context of EPO
The process of red blood cell formation, from stem cell to red blood cell can be modelled in time through a series of partial differential equations based on the age of the cells. Each of the cell stages (BFU-E, CFU-E, erythroblasts, marrow reticulocytes and red blood cells) is represented by a partial differential equation. The general form of the equation is shown in figure 13.
Figure 13. Breakdown of the general PDE used to model the various cell stages that occur in the process of red blood cell production.
Starting at cell age 0 days, when stem cells become BFU-E cells, the age span up until cell age 141 days. When red blood cells are recycled by macrophages, the cells can be broken up into populations of cells at a certain age. For every cell stage, the population density of cells at a given maturity and time can modelled as a population mesh. A population mesh is a numerical estimator that breaks down the process of red blood cell production into populations at a given age. A mesh point is the population of cells of a specific age. When modelled as a mesh, the following assumptions of the relation between a change in time and a change in maturity can be made.
Assumptions
For a population of cells u of age μ and at time t, a change in time Δt will result in an equal change in maturity Δμ, assuming that the maturation velocity \(vs(E(t))=1\).
The maturation velocity is 1 for every stage except the marrow reticulocytes, where the time cells stay in this stage depends on the concentration of EPO.
The commitment of stems cells to becoming red blood cells is an irreversible event ( Fuertinger et al. 2012 ). Cells cannot regress back to a previous cell type or switch to a different differentiation pathway. For this reason, assumption 1 can be made. A change in time will lead to an equal change in the age of the cell. As a result, the finer you make the population mesh the smaller the time step is. This increases the accuracy of the model as the cells react to changes in EPO concentration in time faster. Once they reach the age at which they differentiate"

Improvement of project from WHU-2014
In the project of WHU-China in iGEM 2014, they tried to absorb formaldehyde using The Street Cleaner System, which contains formate dehydrogenase ( BBa_K1334016 ) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase ( BBa_K1334017 ), but these two genes did not express.
Figure 9. The Street Cleaner System designed by WHU-2014.
This year, we redesigned the Street Cleaner System by replacing the PADH and FADH with another gene, which codes FDM (formaldehyde dismutase), BBa_K1960103 . This enzyme enjoys high catalysis activity of translating formaldehyde into carbon dioxide and methanol. In addition, their whole project still has some problems, for example, they used the formaldehyde activated promoter, BBa_K1334002 to controls the work of this system, this means than only when the system contacts with formaldehyde will the coding sequences express, and the expressed enzymes might have no activities to absorb formaldehyde because of the little amount. So we decided to replace the promoter BBa_K1334002 with a constant promoter, BBa_J23100 , and use mRFP to show whether this system works.

And we kept their Lysis System in a way, but still a little changes, replacing their e4 protein with T4 endolysin, another powerful lysozyme from enterobacteria phage T4 degrades peptidoglycan layer.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," of insignificance of knowledge represents the fact that is not the main distinction anymore : everyone can have knowledge of the life sciences, it is not a principle of distinction anymore. That point entertain the risks perception : for example, the fact that Roger Brent, Director of Molecular Science Institute of Berkeley, estimates that 100,000 people are able to create their own anthrax is a very frightening argument, encouraging critics of that democratization process. The last element we can get from that analysis is the new mythical construction of the social aspects of our protagonists, the scientist and the terrorist. I use the “mythical” word to refer to the cultural influence of sciences in the construction of the way we perceive the world and the social agent. Thus, in the theoretical perspective of philosophers such as Donna Haraway (Haraway 1988, 1991, 1997), we can draw the mythical figures that seem to embody a part of western culture frightened about the uncontrolled holder of knowledge. The social figure of the terrorist and the scientist can be considered under that light. That new cyborg figures, hybrids of promises and threats, products of our techno-scientific, post-industrial and western societies.
A. Biosafety
1. Questions
Questioning biosafety matters?
In parallel with that new cultural construction of the protagonists of knowledge, as Synbiosafe points out, an ethical perspective will have to succeed in a new challenge for risks perception.
« In traditional genetic engineering the risk assessment is based on the donor organisms. Most transgenic organisms so far contain genes from relatively few parental organisms. In synthetic biology, however, the situation changes because organisms can be created with a large number of genetic donors or even without any natural templates at all. Also instead of changing only few genes, with synthetic biology we will be able to create completely new genetic networks without known counterparts in nature. Given the absence of natural templates as a basis for solid evaluation, how can a risk assessment be carried out under such circumstances? »
Is other words, are we able to integrate the techniques and technologies that are performed in synthetic biology with our social devices of risks prevention?
What are the biosafety problems?
What are these problems? How are they formulated in our lectures? A set of problems can be drawn, we'll try to justify it in the more complete and concise way.
To introduce our point, we will refer to a question asked by the Synbiosafe report, wondering about risks in the perspective of the “rejection of novelty”. The Synbiosafe report wonders about reliance on new protocols in order to answer to the new risks"

Pakistan
We spoke to an official, who worked for WAPDA in Lahore, Pakistan, and was directly involved in water treatment. This discussion highlighted the importance of a centralised water treatment system, and the need for governance over the 'standard' level of water cleanliness. Pakistan is currently moving towards this goal, and aims to have standardised water treatment soon, however as of right now, it is often up to each local district to lay out the rules on water treatment and the budget that is allocated to this.
Survey
Before we launched our project, we conducted an online survey to gauge the public’s reaction towards the problem of water safety and to see if our project would create an impact on society. We received a total of 118 responses with survey respondents coming from all around the world such as United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore and India.
The survey results showed that our project has the ability to make an impact as many people (68.6%)  were aware of the dangers of oestrogen in water to animals.
Although our project would involved placing anti-bacterial resistance into water, our initial fears were alleviated when the survey results show that close to half of the respondents (40.7%) approved to the addition of bacteria in water while only 14.4% of them disapproved.
Overall, many felt that our team’s project have the ability to create a positive impact on the environment as there is a clear awareness of the present dangers of water.
Lee Hishamuddin Allen & Gledhill (IP Lawyer)
After some discussion with Eunice Chan, an Intellectual Property (IP) lawyer , we were told that in order to patent a product, it needs to be new or be combined in a new way. Patents cannot be applied if they have been introduced into the public domain. This prompted us to compile an intellectual property guidebook which would serve as a guide for other teams when considering which type of trademark applications they should go for.
Furthermore, in line with the recent blockchain developments, we posed the question of whether is blockchain technology the future of synthetic biology intellectual property protection. The full version of the guidebook can be found here.

Summer put Little Dot on her bed which looked like an exquisite baby’s cot. In no time, Little Dot slept soundly.
“This room is for you. Have a nice sleep.” Summer showed a Japanese style room, which located on the second floor, to the little prince.
The little prince lay on his bed, looked into the sky, and found a bright star where he thought lived his rose. Gradually, he slept peacefully.
“Everybody, get up!” Summer yelled loudly and excitedly. That was a normal morning on planet Ecoli. Once hearing the sound, the little prince woke up immediately. He rubbed his eyes. The second he looked outside, he felt freshness and vitality. In the dawn, a rainbow suspended on the sky, the dew on the flowers and grass sparkled in the sunshine, the planet woke up.

What should be noticed is that copasi also has prerequisites, including LAPACK/CLAPACK for Maths, Qwt and Qwtplot3D for plotting, expat to parser xml, raptor The latest version of this RDF parsing library, and libsbml for deal with SBML operations.
libsbml, Version 3.4.1 is required. Not only it is the dependence of copasi, but also the dependence of igame core code.
And libsbml should be built with configure option ""./configure --enable-layout=yes --enable-compression=no --with-expat""
Bison & Flex
To compile our code, bison and flex is required. They are used to build a expression parser in igame/core/str_cacu path. To get the those software and more detailed information, please visit Bison site and Flex site .
git, to download our source code by command our source code can be downloaded in github , git is helpful to download.
git clone git://github.com/jkdirac/igame.git
Build
We use cmake to manage the build progress, cmake can generate cross-platform Makefile, we intend to make our project could be built in different operating system. Until now, only Linux operating system is tested. Windows and Mac should be supported soon. Download all source code, run cmake-gui to configure the project. Pay attention to the configure information.There should be ""missing ***"" messages when Cmake fail to find the dependent libraries. To fix those messages, one need to assign the path of related libraries by Cmake GUI. When Makefiles are successfully generated, execute the Make command to build.

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge"

We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Professors&Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of resources and  Environment.he told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which is conducive to the smooth develop  ent of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in the experimrntal design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,".
People often equate genetic engineering with unnatural tampering of organisms. However, humans have actually been modifying organisms for thousands of years through selective breeding. Modern crops and farm animals are very different from their ancestors. Genetic engineering is actually just a more deliberate way of changing organisms to suit our needs.
While our genetic engineering project may be unnatural, that does not make it inherently bad. We should judge the pros and cons based on whether it will help people and improve their lives. It would be wrong to disregard a technology with a large potential for helping others simply because it is unnatural.

Taking advantage of a medical summer elective at UCC, we decided as part of our project to send one of our members to an African hospital in Malawi, in order to investigate the usefulness of our detection system in a third world hospital lab as well as to increase the awareness of synthetic biology among the Malawian people. This was an opportunity to get up close and personal to investigate the logistic potential and receive feedback regarding our novel method of DNA diagnostics in a developing countries’ hospital laboratory.
Donnchadh spent the month of June in Malawi at Nkhoma Hospital. Nkhoma Mission Hospital is a 220-bed facility and includes all major departments. The hospital's primary catchment area is the surrounding rural population of  32,000 people, but it serves patients from all over Malawi and it’s neighbouring country Mozambique. It offers inpatient and outpatient care on site and conducts mobile clinics within its catchment area. The laboratory is an essential part of patient care at Nkhoma Hospital. It analyses samples from almost every patient that comes to the hospital.
The laboratory performs the following analysis: Haemoglobin, Malaria, Full Blood Count, Blood Transfusions, Sickle cell, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Urine & Stool Analysis, Pregnancy, HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, Ascites, CSF and pleural fluid analysis, Meningococcal Antigen, and CD4 analysis.  It also has a equipment which can perform multiple analyses on blood serum for liver function tests, Lactate, Glucose, Sodium, Potassium, Bilirubin, and many other beneficial chemical analyses.
Integrating Human Practices
When Donnchadh arrived at Nkhoma Hospital, his main goal was to identify a potential application for our novel DNA detection system. He spent the                        first few days at the Hospital speaking to the doctors, nursing staff and lab technicians about the diagnostic facilities available at there as well as other hospitals and health care clinics in Malawi.
It was evident that Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused predominantly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was a serious problem and one that our project needed to target. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one-third of the world's population is thought to have been infected with M. tuberculosis and new infections occur in about"

7/17/11 – PCR temp gradient was created for ThiE solution, used New England Biolabs phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase protocol. Temp gradient ranges from 72-50 degrees Celsius. Controls of only DNA and only Primer were run with the samples. 10 ul samples were run for each temp gradient
7/18/11 - PCR results were run through a 1% agarose gel. Best results came from ‘F’ which ran at 54.3 Celsius. The DNA from this band was extracted and purified using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit
7/19/11 – PCR 50 ul of ThiE at 54.3 Celsius for backup stock. TOPO cloned ThiE that was extracted from gel yesterday. Plated TOPO cells at 100 ul, 75 ul, 50 ul and 25 ul  concentrations then placed in incubator overnight
PCR reactions only need one control, of just the primers without DNA.
7/20/11 – 5 colonies of TOPO bacteria grew overnight. Cultured all 5 for purification and confirmation of proper insert (ThiE) Ran gel to confirm that 50 ul ThiE PCR worked, nice clean band at 1 kb marker, saved the rest of the 50 ul stock in -20 C freezer for further use. PCR done on  the additional pieces (CmR, PetBD and GLF) used same temp gradient as done with ThiE. Will run a gel of these tomorrow to see what optimal temp is for each sample. If clean bands are seen, we will perform a gel purification and re-PCR those samples. Spoke with Shintani, these additional pieces should just be amplified through PCR until a clean stock is created, then this stock will be used in Gibson.
7/21/11 – Miniprep purified TOPO cultures. Sample “1” did not bloom in culture but grew on stock plate. Purified “2-5” and will save “1” as a backup if no other  colonies have the correct insert.  Ran temp gradient samples through gels.
GLF had very light bands at 67.6 and 63.5 Celsius temps, the average temp of those two is 65.5 – will try to run more DNA at this temp to see if we can get stronger bands. Maybe increase DNA concentration in solution.

Lab Open Day
Communication
Being Online
The lab open day is an annual activity in our school held in May. This year, on May 18th and 19th, we opened our lab to welcome the public from all Hefei City and even far from Xi'an City to know what we were doing and what genetic engineering and iGEM are. We organized the following activities:
1.    Introduce the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc. We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge. So we continued teaching them more about the physical knowledge in it and it felt really pretty good to share them with our lose and gain and enlighten the kids who interested in science.
2. View microscope and anatomical lens: we collected some fresh flowers and leaves as well as cell slider including our Caulobacter crescentus and our staffs taught the kids how to use a microscope to observe the micro scale world and guide them to carefully dissect the flowers with tweezers. Many kids in China still were lack of opportunity to get in touch with the real science, which they could only read and learn from books. Consequently, we hoped this activity to trigger their motivation to not only think carefully but do meticulously
3. Class for kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures. We are surprised to know that children know the name of DNA, while they almost misunderstand the essence of DNA. So we instructed them about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and research. Besides, genetic engineering was also introduced using chocolate biscuits as example. We wished kids possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us could prosper in the future. :)
4. Fold It! Well it is a game invented by Baker Lab from Washington University and introduced by 2010 Washington iGEM. We introduced the game to the public, especially high school or college students, which turned out to be a delighted success. Even the"

Parts
In the Open Access scientific community that iGEM is, the Registry of Standard Parts plays a crucial role. As teams construct new parts and devices, they make them available to anyone who might want to use or improve them. However, the current registry can be hard to navigate (see The Constructor ) and turns out to contain non-functioning and even non-existent parts. To work towards a better Open Source future, we think it is of great importance that apart from quantity, the quality of the registry should improve as well. It is up to all users to make this happen. We tried to contribute to the quality of the registry not only by sending in our bricks (standardized tools - they were all sequenced), but also by validating other bricks and improving some.

Overexpression of recombinant proteins
Large-scale purification is necessary to achieve enough protein for further experiments, e.g. crystallization or enzyme activity assays. After the evaluation of the best expression conditions with test expressions you can scale up your samples.
The Material
LB liquid medium (e.g. 1 liter per protein,)
1 M Isopropyl-D-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) stock
Washing buffer (e.g. buffer W,)
Elution buffer (e.g. buffer E,)
The Procedure
Inoculate an overnight culture in 25 - 100 ml LB medium with the desired strain(s) and antibiotics. Incubate the culture at 37°C and 220 rpm over night.
Inoculate the over day cultures (usually 500 ml - 1 l in a 2 l baffled flask with long neck) to an OD600 of 0.1 with your overnight culture and add the appropriate antibiotic. Grow the cultures at 37°C with agitation to an OD600 of 0.6 - 0.8. Then add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Now the expression of the heterologous gene is induced.
After induction, incubate the cultures for additional 2 - 3 h at 37°C with shaking (if these are the conditions of choice).
Split the cultures into two 500 ml samples and centrifuge (15 min, 5,000 rpm) at 4°C.
Discard the supernatant (in case your protein is not secreted).

Sequence was ordered from IDT as two gblocks (for each recombinase) with overlapping regions, thus they can be assembled with Gibson assembly.
 
pDG268neo was linearized in a PCR with primers, so that the native lacZ was omitted. This linearized plasmid was purified and used in a Gibson assembly reaction with two cognate gblocks.
Figure 2. Gibson assembly of the pDG268neo_GP35, the gblocks was fused to the “gp35 Gblocks fused” in the same reaction. The Gibson assembly of pDG268neo_beta was similar.
 
This resulted in two different plasmids pDG268neo_beta and pDG268neo_gp35.
 
mutS deletion
The two mutS KO plasmids was made of the following DNA fragments:
1.     About 500 bp up- and downstream from mutS was amplified, using primers with tails.
2.     Recombinase and neoR expression cassettes was amplified from the pDG268neo_recombinase
3.     Linearized pSB1C3 was used as template.
 
These fragments was assembled into two different plasmids pSB1C3_mutS::beta-neoR and pSB1C3_mutS::gp35-neoR using Gibson assembly.
 
Figure 3. Gibson assembly of the pSB1C3_beta. The feature called “mutL” corresponding mutS downstream. The Gibson assembly of pSB1C3_GP35 was similar.
All plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme digestion.
We prepared naturally competent B. subtilis 168 to be transformed. The plasmids were linearized with restriction enzymes. Then transformed into naturally competent B. subtilis 168, transformants were selected on 5ɣ neo. Transformants were verified with colony PCRs.
Methods for proof of concept
Electroporation competent cells were prepared in following the protocol: Electroporation competent Bacillus subtilis 168. Electropration was carried out according to the MAGE in Bacillus subtilis 168 protocol. The colonies from the LB plates were colonies picked onto an LB and LB + 500y streptomycin (strep) plates. Plates were incubated at 37 degC for 48 hours and CFUs were counted on both the LB and the strep plates.Results

Natural Lambda N-gene (encoding the N protein) and nutR have been inserted into the backbone plasmid pSB1C3 to construct pATN and pAT05 respectively. These parts have been submitted to the parts registry.
pAT02
pAT02 containing RFP reporter, has been constructed by inserting K374011 (lambda N-gene with its natural RBS), followed by BBa_B0034 (RBS) and BBa_E1010 (RFP) into pSB1C3. This part has also been submitted to the parts registry.

pAT03 has been constructed by inserting RBS site BBa_B0034 and K374012 (FACS optimised GFP) into the recipient plasmid pSB1C3.
pAT04, pAT06, pAT07
pAT05 with the lambda nutR insert has been used to construct pAT06, pAT07 and pAT04, also containing different terminator sites. Plasmids pAT06 and pAT07 contain a single terminator site, but with different terminator strengths. Thus, pAT06 contains BBa_B0011 with medium terminator strength, while pAT07 contains BBa_B1003, which is a strong terminator site. Plasmid pAT04 contains both BBa_B0011 and BBa_B1003.

Time and cost estimation
CryptoGErM is not a system that will replace a WhatsApp message or an email. It is meant for highly secure data which does not have to be accessed within a few seconds. We assume the message will be synthesized by a company. The company IDT, which also supported us during our project, claims the synthesis of a gBlock including shipping takes 5-8 business days depending on the size of the fragment. Costs for gBlock synthesis are starting from ~ 0.17$ per base pair [4] . Our example message consists of 572 bps and would thus cost ~ 100$. The synthesized gene will include flanking regions for integration into Bacillus subtilis. The gBlock will be amplified to a high concentration via PCR, which takes a few hours. And can directly be transformed into B. subtilis. The transformation takes one day. After transformation, sporulation will be initiated, this takes about 10 hours [5] .  From ordering of the gBlocks until the message or key containing spores are obtained a time span of maximum 10 days is needed. Many sequencing services offer an especially fast deal which would speed up the process by a few days. The shipping of the GMO samples can be carried out within a day. The receiver of the message will allow the spores to germinate. After a few hours a sufficient DNA concentration will be obtained. The treatment to recover the key will take place during the germination and is a matter of minutes. New high-throughput sequencing methods have an efficiency of ~ 1 Gb/h [6] . The Bacillus subtilis genome consists of approximately 4 million base pairs. Sequencing will thus take less than an hour. Entering the sequence into the website and decoding is only a matter of seconds. Decrypting the message after receiving it will thus take about 1 day. From designing and encryption the message by the sender, to decryption by the recipient, a maximum timespan of 12 days will pass. We assume that all steps, except the synthesis, can be carried out in the laboratories of sender and receiver. With improving techniques this will get increasingly faster.

In addition to searching for a pathogenic E. coli marker, we also started working on the TALE sequence and its construction. The TALE sequence chosen has a truncation in both N- and C-terminus. The truncated N-terminus has 111 residues and the C-terminus has 42 residues (Meckler et al., 2013). The sequence was codon optimized for E.coli. NEBCutter 2.0 was used to screen restriction sites for PstI, EcoRI, NotI, XbaI, SpeI, NgoMIV and AgeI, all present in the RFC 25. Cut sites for BsaI and Esp3I were also removed to pave the road for Golden Gate Assembly method. The original TALE sequence has 11 cut sites: BsaI (3), PstI (1), EcoRI (1), Esp3I (4), AgeI (2). The restriction sites were then eliminated with silent mutations, based on a E. coli codon usage table (San Diego State University, 2012 modified from Maloy, Stewart & Taylor, 1996).
The large size of the TALE prevents simple cloning, therefore we looked to Golden Gate Assembly. Golden Gate Assembly is a subcloning strategy that uses type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence allowing ligation into a final product that lacks any specific scar sites (Engler, Kandzia & Marillonnet, 2008).
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
This week also mostly spent on literature research.
The next step after optimization of TALEs and their target sequence is to locate this system’s niche in the beef industry. Many of the current high fidelity methods for pathogenic E. coli detection require cell cultures, which increases turnaround time up to 4 days (Blais et al., 2012 & Gill et al., 2013).
A 2013 paper by Jeon et al. explores the genetic and physiological effects of the cattle on the amount of the O157 it excretes. According to this paper, 90% of the bacteria excreted from the cattle comes from the super-shedders. Super-shedders are cattle that excrete more than more than 10 000 CFU/g and have long term recto anal junction colonization. Higher excretion is detected in bulls, pen raised cattle, and certain breeds with a seasonal peak between late spring and early fall. Preharvest detection of pathogenic E. coli"

Bootcamp
This is how it begins. The iGEM bootcamp at UCL is intended to prepare us for the roles we are going to play this summer. We get to talk to some of the founding members of iGEM and meet two other iGEM teams from London, from the Biohackspace in Hackney and Birkbeck College.
Monday 15th
We met at 09:30 in the lab. It is the first time we could all meet each other after our exams. The team members from the Biohackspace and Birkbeck were there as well. After the briefing on lab safety and other things we started with a SpeI and PstI digestion using the backbones from the InterlabStudy 2015: J23101 , J23106 , J23117 . As an insert we used an RFP containing vector from the iGEM 2014 distribution. We confirmed the digestions through an agarose gel electrophoresis and went for a break in the sun. Afterwards we performed the ligation of the insert and the backbone.
In the afternoon we had a skype meeting with Randy Rettberg from the iGEM foundation and learned something about the spirit and history of iGEM.

Figure 10: Particle filter results for 300, 30, and 15 data points. Mutation frequency of the DNA is shown in the top plot, while parameter estimates of k-bind, k-rbind, and k-pop are shown in the bottom three. Estimates remained within 5% for 300 data points, and 10% for 30.
Particle Filter Results:
Once the particle filter had been shown to correctly converge on given parameters, it was time to test with information from actual experiments. Data on mutation frequency over time was taken the David Lu lab’s CAMERA paper. The 8 time points were interpolated using a spline fit to get a total of 16 steps. This was then fed into the particle filter using 100,000 particles (~5 min runtime). One important improvement that was made at this stage was calling the predict function at time intervals between experimental data points, in order to reduce the error of our numerical ODE solver. Simulation results are shown below:
Figure 10: Particle Filter simulation run with 100,000 particles. DNA mutation frequency is shown in the top plot. And K-bind, K-rbind, and K-pop values are depicted in the subsequent three.
Even with initial parameter guesses an order of magnitude different (shown in blue), the particle filter quickly converges on new parameter estimates within a few data points. Tracking of the DNA mutation frequency (shown in the top plot) is illustrated in the top plot, with experimental data shown as blue points and particle filter estimates shown in black. Taking an average of the last 10 estimates, K-bind was calculated to be 0.0041 M-1*min-1, k-rbind was calculated to be 0.051 min-1, and k-pop was found to be 2.3102e-4 min-1.

Will the system produce an identifiable readout?
Once the base-editor equations and their associated parameters were defined, we could then move on to predicting the behavior of our recording plasmid. Ideally, we hoped that the base editor would shift our “reading frame” in a predictable fashion. The figure below depicts this idealized behavior in the form of logic gates. In the optimal scenario we would induce the production of base editor, which would make mutations to our DNA at a constant rate (symbolized by delay elements). Consequently, this editing would allow the next DNA frame to be written to (symbolized with AND gates) after a set"

In the gel on the top right, lane 2 & 3 correspond to the isolated plasmid restricted with respectively EcorI and a combination of EcorI and PstI. The sizes correspond to the linearized (6,2 kb) and the separate backbone (2 kb) and dCas9 part (4,2 kb).
Since the chances of mutations in restriction-ligation cloning are negligible we did not fully sequence the part again. We did use pJet_Fwd and pJet-Rev to be absolutely certain that the correct part was cloned into the backbone. These results are shown in figure 3.
This part is considered as an improvement of a previously submitted dCas9 BBa_K1026001 since our part has been made biobrick compatible. Also, we sequence confirmed and experimentally validated our part, which was not done by the 2016 Warwick team, who also improved this part.

Construction
This part was made from the pSB1C3:dCas9QC plasmid (see dCas9) which was completely sequenced. We replaced the final part of the dCas9QC with a gBlock containing the VRER mutations. The new construct was analyzed by sequencing the last part containing the gblock (figure 4). Also, a restriction analysis with EcoRI and PstI was performed (see the gel in dCas9 lane 4,figure 1).
Based on the validation (see below) we cannot conclude yet whether the VRER mutations have the desired effect. If we would have mixed up the
Experimental validation
This part was validated experimentally in the same experiment as dCas9. For this experiment, we have designed four gRNA's that target GFP. Two of this gRNA's bind to sequences flanked by NGG (1&2) and two bind to a sequence flanked by NGCG (3&4). These gRNA's were inserted into the plasmid pSB3C5 containing a pLacGFP construct as well. For dCas9 and dCas9VRER expression those parts were put into a pBad vector in which they are expressed behind an Arabinose inducible promoter.

Overview
The Tongji 2016 iGEM team has been focusing on nowadays treatments of tumor worldwide and how to improve the current photothermal therapy using synthetic biology. IGEM was a fabulous stage and we did a lot of human practices. For us, it was a beginning and we are going to do more in the future.
Public Education and Engagement
Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
On Aug 16, 2016, with 3 other iGEM teams, we made an exhibition at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. During summer vocation, there are many kids visiting the museum with their parents. We introduced the iGEM competition by playing some both interesting and scientific videos to the people who visited the museum that day.
A grade 9 student even asked us some questions about synthetic biology. It’s a great opportunity to popularize scientific knowledge. More than 5000 people have seen our project, what’s more, we had a good communication with other teams about our projects! All 4 teams introduced their own projects, received some suggestions from others, and our friendship has been improved.
Teams include: NYU Shanghai, Tongji, SJTU, XJTLU

Outside of science, one of of his biggest interests is taekwondo, which he started his freshman year at Cal and has involved himself extensively with ever since.  He believes that the discipline and physical training has improved his life, and he just loves getting a chance to compete - win or lose, there's always something to learn.
This summer was one of his first major research efforts.  He'd had experience programming in Java many years before, but had to learn it again from the ground-up for iGEM, though familiarity with Perl and programming in general helped considerably.  Due to a martial arts-related injury, he was gone for the last third of the summer, but he continued to code from his home in Bakersfield, CA while he recuperated.  He hopes to help in the future development of Clotho in his spare time, to create an even more useful and functional tool to aid synthetic biologists in their research.

CARE tool's updated code
This year’s Edinburgh OG iGEM team has worked on a program that allows the evaluation of curated secondary metabolites’ toxicity produced by a range of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). The program is intended to complement the current risk assessment practices by constituting an additional precautionary step that is to be followed before any work in the laboratory with the reviewed host strain begins. Furthermore, it is intended to be accessible to a wide constituency of experts in the field, trainees, DIY biologists, other stakeholders and the general public.
This tool, named “CARE” – Chassis Assessment & Risk Evaluation
includes information about 30 microorganisms:
● The microorganisms from the Edinburgh OG 2016 iGEM team: the cyanobacterium Synechosistis sp. PCC 6803, the bacterium Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and the fungus Penicillium roquefortii.
● The non-model organisms used by iGEM teams based in North America in 2014 and 2015 (as documented by the Yale 2015 iGEM team): Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella kessleri, Chlorella vulgaris, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Gilliamella apicola, Lactococcus lactis, Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899, Snodgrassella alvi and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.
● The industrially relevant Shewanella oneidensis, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, Myxococcus xanthus, Cupriavidus necator, Chromobacterium violaceum, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Sorangium cellulosum and Pseudomonas fluorescens.
● The model and non-model microorganisms with an annotated genome from a selection of this year’s iGEM teams (as seen in the Outreach section): E. coli BL21DE3, E. coli C41, E"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," specialized governmental entity related to this area. As we have previously received different recommendations to speak with SENASICA’s (National Service of Sanitation, Innocuousness, and Agri-food Quality) chief department, we took advantage of this great opportunity and indeed contacted MVZ Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa to present him our project and discuss new insights and considerations. He is a bee specialist, but also owns a great panorama about legal implications in the agri-food sector! The meeting took place by a video call and the legal framework consultant conducted this reunion that lasted approximately 35 minutes.
First, in the meeting, we presented our project and the scope that synthetic biology can have in the beekeeping area. Regarding the theme of foulbrood distribution, the MVZ Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa commented us that in Chihuahua two cases of American foulbrood had been registered last year. By this time in the development of our project, we had found many ambiguities with the data of presence of foulbrood in Mexico, and we were able to conclude that many times beekeepers do not report that they own infected hives because they look forward to saving money and preserving the stability of their business.
As the reunion flowed, we were also able to discuss some technical factors of our project. Sr. Juan Diego told us that AMPs were perfect for what we wanted and for keeping the innocuousness of honey. We also consulted with him a question that had been asked to us previously: When it comes to increasing the concentration of AMP’s, is it possible that a negative overaccumulation results in the bee? The MVZ analyzed and suggested that bees are exposed to many pathogens, with our product they could become more resistant; the treatment was perceived by him like a supplement that will help bees defend themselves. With so many pathogens attacking bees, we can hardly create an adverse problem, instead would fortify hives in hard times.
The MVZ was very interested in the alternative we propose and said we could consider later on, the possibility of nanoencapsulating our peptides with his help. “The approach is excellent and it is a work of great quality.” He was astonished when we talked about the physiology of the bee regarding our project and he kindly also mentored us on how we should use fewer technicalities when we attended the IV State’s Beekeeping Forum, as it was approaching.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.
A2: Nowadays, treating Inflammatory intestinal diseases is still a difficult problem over the whole world, mainly in terms of poor response to drug therapy for some patients, recurrence after treatment and serious adverse reactions after a long-term drug therapy. Of course, some patients still have to undergo an operation because of the bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal fistula, hemorrhoea, etc. And some patients die from various complications.
Q: We hope to understand the common methods of treating intestinal diseases, especially the inflammatory intestinal diseases
A: Now the methods of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases mainly include drug therapy (5-aminosalicylic acid, hormone, immunization drug, antibiotics, biologics), operative treatment, stool transplantation, stem cell transplantation and leukocyte elution adsorption treatment.
Q: Now the cure rate of inflammatory intestinal diseases, especially chronic diseases and severe diseases, is still low. We hope to know the disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases, from the perspective of a clinical doctor.
A1: Treatment is mainly based on the drug therapy, because 5-ASA preparation has poor tolerance and glucocorticoid has several side effects (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc.). Chinese people have a case of a certain proportion of metabolic enzyme deficiency that may cause the bone marrow depression. And biologics has a high risk of infection and may exists the probability of drug resistance.
A2: Disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases is mainly about: 1. lack of effective drugs for all patients, even if the biological agents which is researched and developed in recent years and whose efficacy is only about 50%. 2. There are concerns about the drug for long term use existing serious adverse reactions. 3. Some drugs have problems with secondary failure. 4. Expenses.
Q: The leading edge of biological sciences is about the direction of the intestinal ecosystem. However, there is a big gap between the theoretical research and practice. So what’s your opinion about this current situation?
A1: Intestinal micro ecosystem (intestinal flora) is a hot topic in recent years. Actually, inflammatory intestinal disease is a pathogenesis with genetic background, which involves environment, immunity and infection.
Maybe it is not because of a certain bacteria, instead, because of the change of the proportion of some bacteria or the change of metabolites. These factors can initiate or accelerate diseases, but they are not the determinants.
For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But"
TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," replicate in the Coxiella Containing Vacuole (CCV). Eventually, the metabolically active large variants will undergo sporogenic differentiation to produce the resistant Small Cell Variants. Upon cell lysis, these are released into the environment where they can survive for longer periods and infect other organisms [5] .
C. burnetii enters the cell through phagocytosis. The bacterium is internalized in the nascent Coxiella Containing Vacuole (CCV), which rapidly merges with auto phagosomes and lysosomes. Normally, the acidification of the phagosome results in degradation of bacteria. C. burnetii, however, is very resistant to numerous harsh environmental conditions. Acidification therefore does not degrade the bacterium: it even triggers the bacterium to become metabolically active. As a result, the CCV can grow out to a mature vacuole. This image was adapted from Nature Reviews
Transmission of the pathogen to mammals can occur in a number of ways. The most important route of transmission to humans is formed by contaminated aerosols. Important sources of these aerosols are goat feces, contaminated wool and a placenta shed by an infected animal [6] . Due to C. burnetii’s high infectivity, inhalation of a single infected particle can be enough to be infected by the pathogen (Figure 3).
Figure 3: The most important source of Q fever infection during the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands was goat manure. Goats are a perfect reservoir for C. burnetii and if they are infected, their manure contains the small cell variant of the pathogen. In windy conditions, aerosols of the manure can form which can infect humans once breathed in.
Pathology
The main challenge of diagnosis of Q fever is its atypicality. Contact with C. burnetii is followed by a 2-3 week incubation period. After the incubation period symptoms may occur, even though most cases of Q fever remain asymptomatic (60%) [7] . Even if the patient shows symptoms, these symptoms are often very atypical. The infection is characterized by the unpredictability and diversity of its symptoms. Examples of symptoms which may or may not occur within a single patient are fever, headaches, hepatitis and meningoencephalitis. This clinical polymorphism impedes an early and accurate detection of Q fever. This is very problematic, as failure to diagnose Q fever early and accurately can lead to the manifestation of chronic Q fever (see Figure 4).

The most valid way to attract people to focus on dealing with safety issues is to remind them of the significance of maintaining safe experimental and living environment, and to warn them of the potential hazard if biochemical crisis become out of control. As undergraduates, we should spare no effort to broadcast the opinion that bio-safety is not far from daily life, no matter whom you are and where you live. It truly exists in each drop of water we drink, and each breath of air we take in. It will be too late to stop it from spreading once contaminants flow into the public, yet it is never too late to prevent the crisis in advance.
Energy, serving as the indispensable impetus of social and economic development, concerns the crucial factor of national security. The oil crisis that broke out in the 70s still left a deeply imprinted scar in people’s mind about the impact brought by the energy shortage. Oil prices rose from merely $3.011/barrel to $10.651, which led to the largest recession after World War II. In this crisis, the industrial production in the United States declined 14%, and in Japan, 20%. All the industrialized countries showed an evident slowdown in their economies. However, developed countries did not just sit there, waiting for the destruction; instead, they began to engage in a technological evolution that tend to increase energy efficiency and decrease dependence on oil.
History does repeat itself. In the first decade of the new millennium, oil prices have risen drastically for 391%, reaching the peak of $147/barrel in July 2008. Although the price fell to as low as $32 in December 2008, governments and observers realized that petroleum simply is not cheap anymore. No doubt that the oil prices will continue rising once economy recovers itself. Concentrating on how to save energy alone will not be sufficient to tackle the energy issue. In the meantime, societies can no longer neglect the frequent catastrophic weathers that are attributed to the global warming and pollutions that are brought by the mass consume of oils. People are demanding a more clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly energy that can end our concerns for our development and society.
Facing these two challenges, we have to call for another revolution in the energy industry. Because of its convenience of acquisition, the cheap cost of the material, economic benefits, and contribution to the environment, biofuel began to earn its place on the energy market.

Inspired by swappable promoter construct BBa_J61002 similar construct with J23101 in place of swappable promoter element was derived from pSB3K3, the BBa_K359201.

RFP (BBa_E1010) will be used instead of GFP due to consistent failure to express GFP (BBa_E0040) reported by Waterloo iGEM teams from previous years. The ﬂuorimetric assay can be performed on a ﬂuorescent protein with the use of ﬂow cytometer or microplate reader. The two approaches focus on different aspects of the retrievable data. Flow cytometry acquires data on individual cells, however each new concentration of input and time point requires individual assay. Incubating ﬂuorescence-capable plate reader allows to acquire many time and concentration points overnight or even several nights, and is thus preferable. Checking back on the QC sequencing data for I0500 it was discovered that the integrity of the part in the distribution available was not succesfully confirmed by sequencing, which explains failure of RFP expression with this part.  The alternative approach of assembling complete the pBAD sequence in two halves to the forward and reverse PCR primers used to amplify the vector, such that when the vector is religated the correct promoter sequence is formed. The AraC repressor can be provided on another plasmid.
4.0 FUTURE PLANS
The AIP molecule utilized by S. aureus as part of its quorum sensing mechanism is part of a group of 4 classes of signaling molecules, all with the ability to cross inhibit each other’s activity. It could be speculated that, if present at the same time, they would slowly inhibit the signal transmission between members of the same infection site, and thus prevent infection. Thus, it would be recommended that, after the construction of the StaphiScope, an extension be added to the project, where within Escherichia coli is integrated the function to produce a signal molecule of the cross-inhibitory group (Atkinson and Williams, 2009)

Mix the immune/non-immune cells with the colicin extract, in different proportions (cells/colicin extract 9:1 and 5:5). For controls, mix immune/non-immune cells with the B-PER buffer, in same proportions
Put the cells into a 96 well plate for Tecan, 2 wells per each of the cultures
Put the plate into Tecan, and make OD measurements each 10mins
Results
Growth curves of cells with or without protein extract of colicin producing cells. We compare the growth of cells that have immunity protein or not. Colicin-containing protein extract significantly impedes the growth of cells that do not have immunity (green curve), whereas it does not affect cells expressing immunity (blue curve), and they grow as well as positive controls (red and purple lines, respectively).
Remarks: Immune cells grow even better in the presence of the colicin extract than in the presence of the buffer. This can be explained by the fact that the buffer used for protein extraction leads to cell lysis. In future, we will use the extract of cells that do not produce colicin, as a positive control. Also, in this setup, the step-like trend of the growth curve for the sensitive cells in the presence of colicin extract (blue) can be explained by the degradation of the colicin, and/or by the fact that it all colicin present could be used up at some point, and not affect further growth of cells.
In conclusion, these results show that colicin produced by cells prevents the growth or even kills sensitive cells, whereas the cells expressing the immunity protein survive.
Persperctives
We suggest in the future we could give stronger stress to the Colicin to induce more the SOS promoter; such as UV light.
Discussion
Cloning the colicin E2 activity protein, given its lethal nature, is a great challenge for us. We took several approaches. We established immune strains expressing excess immunity protein in which we could transform the toxin plasmid. We tried cloning the toxin without a promoter and finally tried various vectors with and with out promoters. Although the immune strains are viable, transformable, and prove immune to wild type colicin E2 cells, we have yet to successfully transform a single toxin plasmid.
However, developing and characterizing the immune strains was not as straight forward as we imagined. Whether in NEB turbo or MG1655 Z1 cells, the immune strains grew incredibly slowly. Despite being under the control of pLac, their immunity"

In Prof. Simmels group there are more people we would like to thank in person. Especially Helene Budjarek for her endless patience in the lab, showing us everything, introducing us to everything, caring for everything...
Maximilian Weitz and Korbinian Kapsner for their help with in vitro transcription and PAGE, for supplying us with enzymes if we run out of them again and for nice company during measurements.
Ralf Jungmann for organizing an internal wiki and for responding to emails even on weekends and also for being a very nice person in general.
Andreas Müller and Stephan Renner for being such nice roommates in the ZNN.
Special thanks also to Erika Bischofs for organizing everything for us and Dagmar Meier for managing our bank account.
Furthermore we would like to thank the E22 group who also helped us a lot by sharing their instruments and lab space with us. Our gratitude especially goes to PD Dr. Woehlke , where all our S1 work took place as well as the in vivo measurements.  Sorry, we blew an Erlenmeyer flask in your shaker...
...and Prof. Dietz who provided excellent help all the time, no matter if we asked for supply or help with our simulations or crititical feedback concerning our project itself. Thank you very much for the willingness to help us and the support which can not be taken for granted.
We would also like to thank our former advisor Christoph Klingner, who left us (and the Simmel group) in spring. Christoph, you're missing the trip to boston...
We would also like to thank Melissa Poynor from Prof. Groll's chair for our cutest little mascot, the one and only E. coli. Thank you very much also for many agarose plates, cloning into pSB1C3 would have been a lot harder without!
Furthermore we would like to thank Andra Jebelean, a student at the University of Erlangen in Padagogy for translating our abstract into Rumanian and French and for proof-reading our flyers if they fit for non-biochemists. Thank you so much for your effort! Our gratitude to Carina Mann, Rudi Wachtel, fellow Biochemists at the TU Munich, Manuel Martinortiz, Elena Formato, Daniela Korthöwer, Ala El Din Samara and Kristine Steen Jensen for helping us translating our abstract.

SU8 Training for Lilia, Vincent, and Douglas. We made one complete flow wafer.
Work done, initially on four blank wafers:
O2 plasma stripped
SU8 spin-coated + baked. Most wafers had defects (bubbles, or even comets).
UV exposure of flow pattern
The best wafer was post-expose baked. The others were left unpolymerised
Developed in PGMEA. The three non-baked wafers are now stripped and blank again.
Valid wafer verified by optical microscopy and contact profilometry. Some dust contamination, will need to be blow-cleaned before PDMS moulding.
The three other wafers can be cleaned and re-used (SRD, Piranha solution, 02 plasma strip).

Moyo Festival
Moyo festival is an annual Sumbawa citizen festival held every year. This year the festival held from September 27th - October 6th, 2014 at Pahlawan Square of Sumbawa Besar and Moyo Island. This festival is eagerly awaited by the people of Sumbawa and even attract domestic and international tourist. People gather to get some fun and to learn about Sumbawa culture.
On the third night (September 29 2014) we got the opportunity to introduce synthetic biology and Sumbawagen project to the society because our project is related to Sumbawa honey. We also present some photos of Sumbawagen team activities and introduce some of the tools that we have such as PCR, micropipette, microscope, etc. Visitors were taking turn asking questions in the middle of the crowd that night. We hope that after this event the public will have better understand of synthetic biology and tools related to synthetic biology, to improve knowledge of Sumbawa society.

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"Javier is a doctor in Agronomic engineering who works at Coplaca, the largest banana cooperative in the Canary Islands, where bananas represent a large part of agriculture, although Tropical race 4 is not present. As a professional in the industry, he gave us his perspective on the threat of Panama disease and the possible solution of BananaGuard.
Tropical race 4 is not present in the Canary islands, but could it be a menace to the banana industry there?
""I think climatic conditions play an important role in this. It seems that our climatic conditions are not the same as in countries affected by Panama disease. On the other side there is an order than bans the import of plant materials,including banana plants; all the material we use is our own. But after all, we can't really shrug it off, because it seems here we get a new plague each year (chuckles).""
What if tropical race 4 appeared in the Canary islands? What would be done about it?
""I don't have the solution to it (laughs), but I think the solution would come from physical measures, more than chemical. Usually good soil management beats applying phytosanitary products. I also think it would have a more difficult time getting established here, because in our soils it would face a lot of competition.""
Race 1, however, is present in the Canary Islands. What kind of problems does it create?
""Well, outbreaks here are sporadic. When it does appear, which is usually after rainy, cold winters,  it affects patches of the plantation, which vary in size according to climatic and agronomic conditions. The farmer has already gotten used to living with it, and they try to control tightly nitrogen fertilization, which is usually too careless, and irrigation. Nonetheless, although he haven't managed to eliminate it, it's not that big of a problem for us.""
How long do you think it will take for Fusarium to get to South America?
""I don’t dare to make a prediction. Anyone could, for example, import something illegally, but I think it would take time for it to get settled.""
Do you think there are promising solutions being developed?
I don’t know of any promising novel solutions, although I think your project may have a future. Suppressive soils in which Fusarium can't grow could also help.
What do you think the future is for banana farming under this threat?
""I think we will end up finding a balance after this crisis, that no pathogen today will manage to wipe out an entire crop, as with potato blight in Ireland, with the knowledge we have"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

The same protocol was followed for the MC1061 and the MG1655 non-integrant strains, which were grown in M9 without antibiotic.
Data analysis: the absorbance measurements were normalized by subtracting the absorbance of the M9, while the fluorescence measurements were normalized by subtracting the fluorescence of the non-integrant strains over time. For each well, the Scell signal (proportional to the reporter protein synthesis rate per cell) was computed as (1/OD600*dXFP/dt), where OD600 is the normalized absorbance and XFP is the normalized fluorescence. The Scell signal was then averaged over time to obtain a single value for each well. Results are presented as the average Scell with their 95% confidence intervals of the mean.

FimH_sfGFP expression
The literature has shown that the terminal pili protein FimH (Le Trong et al 2010) can be modified by inserting heterologous sequences at position 225 and 258 (Pallesen et al 1995, Shembri et al 1999). This part produces a FimH adhesin protein fused with sfGFP (Pedelaq et al 2005) at its 225th amino acid residue, after signal peptide cleavage. Expression is under the control of an IPTG-inducible, T7 promoter (BBa_K1614000), with BBa_B0034 RBS and BBa_B0015 terminator. The part, when induced, produces a fluorescent FimH protein that should initiate pilus biosynthesis when co-transformed with a plasmid containing the fim operon.The T7 promoter should give very strong expression and sfGFP should both give a visual indication of successful expression and folding. As a large protein, sfGFP would push the chaperone-usher pathway to its steric limits.
We have expressed this construct in BL21(DE3). Fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (Tecan) and an Amnis ImageStream ISX. Protein expression was determined via Western Blot and TEM with Immunogold labelling.
Figure 3: Data from the plate reader showing fluorescence intensity for WT-BL21(DE3) and T7_FimH_225_sfGFP, average from n=3 and error bars show standard deviation of the mean.These results show that fluorescence from cultures containing T7_FimH_225_sfGFP is higher than WT-BL21(DE3). This shows that FimH_225_sfGFP is expressed and does give rise to fluorescence. According to standard curves made in the lab on the same equipment and settings, we produced a"
CPU_CHINA,2017,Team:CPU CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families.
In China, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is 0.2% -0.4%, so with a population of 1.3 billion, China's rheumatoid arthritis patients are expected to be around 5 million. If they cannot be given effective treatment, their mobility will be limited due to joint pain, and will eventually lead to disability. Statistically, disability rate in patients with two years of rheumatoid arthritis is up to 50% while those with three years can be 70%.
Field Studies
To further understand a patient's conditions and the clinical status of treatment, we decided to go to Nanjing Gulou Hospital and Nanjing First Hospital to perform a questionnaire survey in the department of rheumatology immunology after beforehand investigation and contact. First is our preparation:
Respondents: patients with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient in rheumatology department
Sample Size: 80 people
Procedure:
1. The production of questionnaire (Avoid sensitive issues and patients’ personal information, and respect patients for their personal privacy).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Determine the procedure and the time.
With our planned scheduled, we went to the hospital for a two-day survey (Figure 1). We ensured the authenticity of the answers to our questionnaires. For patients with reduced mobility, our members completed the questionnaire according to their oral narration (Figure 2). We tried to gain more insights in the treatment they expected to receive, as well as the treatment they received in real life, which enabled us to feel more about the pain and suffering this disease could bring.

Figure 2. Our teamer was talking with the patient carefully
Questionnaire analysis
The following conclusions can be drawn by analyzing the data collected from the questionnaire statistically (Figure 3-5 are part of the questionnaire data) together with some supporting materials:
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease most commonly seen in women aged 40-60 years old, so it is a typical middle-aged and old-aged disease, which seriously affects patients' life quality. Most patients choose drug treatments to alleviate the pain, but in actual clinical practice all currently available drugs fail to show any very significant therapeutic effect, which is why patients crave for new treatment methods. They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain. In addition, rheumat"

Team: CCU-Taiwan
Date: Aug. 18, 2018 Location: Mingdao Bio Lab
Mingdao iGEM first gave a brief introduction on our mosquito and HIV experiments. Then CCU explained their project about a novel plastic material with natural lignin. During the meeting, both teams would pause at each slide to discuss the questions and share ideas. We then exchanged surveys and gave some opinions to each other. Before leaving, team CCU visited our laboratory and Fab Lab where we will create our prototype.
They gave us tough questions and we need time to figure out. Some questions are listed below: 1. How much does your prototype cost? 2. How can we transfer DNA into the mosquito? What techniques does it require? 3. Can you quantify the amount of DNA you inserted into the mosquito? 4. How long does the DNA exist in the mosquito if transiently injected? 5. Is their difference between African mosquitos and others? 6. How long is a life cycle of a mosquito?

Basic Part
 Parts Used:
 Melanin
melA
The gene melA is from the organism Rhizobium etli and was added to the registry by the Tokyo 2009 iGEM team. Part BBa_K193600 . This protein is a tyrosinase and converts the molecule L-tyrosine into dopaquinone, which will then polymerize into Melanin.
 Anthocyanin
3gt
The gene 3gt is from the anthocyanin synthesis pathway and converts the initial molecule Pelargonidin into Anthocyanin. This gene is from the organism Petunia hybrid. We have added this parts sequence to the registry for use in our composite part BBa_K2481105 . The basic part is BBa_K2481002
yadH
This Gene is an Escherichia coli gene that has been shown to increase the yields of anthocyanin when paired with the genes in our anthocyanin construct. We have added the sequence to the registry for use in our composite part BBa_K2481105 . The basic part is BBa_K2481004
f3h
We will be useing the gene f3h as the first gene in our anthocyanin synthesis pathway, it comes from the organism Petroselinum crispum. We have added this sequence to the registry as part BBa_K2481111 . This gene will code for a protein that converts the initial molecule flavanone into dihydroflavonol.
dfr
The gene dfr is the second one in our anthocyanin synthesis pathway. We are using the biobrick part BBa_K2481110 . We have added the sequence to the registry as our gene is from a different organism than the existing part in the registry.
ans
This gene is the third gene in our pathway, it converts the molecule created by dfr into pelargonidin. It is from the organism Malus domestica and we have added it to the registry. It is an engineered anthocyanidin synthase. Part BBa_K2481112"
FJNU-China,2018,Team:FJNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and 2-PE will be released to inhibit the growth in the experimental garbage and release roselike aroma at the same time.
    Taking biosafety into account, we added mazEF to our circuit, which is a toxin-antitoxin module located on the Escherichia coli chromosome and some of other bacteria, including pathogens. mazF specifies for a stable toxin protein, and mazE specifies for a labile antitoxin, which antagonizes toxin protein[1]. mazF is a toxic nuclease arresting cell growth through the mechanism of RNA cleavage and mazE inhibits the RNase activity of mazF by forming a complex.[2]. In our project We used mazF toxin protein as our killer to ensure biosafety.
    mazF, as a suicide gene, is linked with light-control promoter to prevent our engineered bacteria revealing to the outer environment than the garbage lid.
    We completed the experimental collaboration with ECUST on the LightOn Switch. Upon light exposure, the light-switchable repressor LEVI is induced to form homodimers, which then bind to the operator sequence and repress the activity of promoter by blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promote, represses the expression of CI repressor and initiates target gene. Upon light illumination, LEVI homodimerizes data were normalized to the mCherry expression level in dark conditions. Wavelength of activating light is 587nm, and the wavelength of emitted light is 610nm.(Details can be found on our Result page.)
    We linked mazF and LightOn Switch together. Once the bacteria is revealed from the container, in other words, LightOn Switch is open, mazF will be expressed to cleavage the mRNA. And this is the reason why we use light-proof ingredient to the 3D-printed garbage lid. (Details can be found on our Application page.)     Within the laboratory, we demonstrated the efficiency of PLA sterilization. And we also obtain the most suitable concentration of 2-PE according to the data of our human practice.(Details can be found on our Human Practices page.)
Bromidrosis
    Aiming at another stink caused by bacteria, the bromidrosis is also an unpleasant smell which bothers people around. Two new circuits are applyied to the goal of controlling bromidrosis.     When people sweat, there is specific salt concentration and temperature on the skin. We choose this feature as a starting point, designed and construced an engineered E.coli"
