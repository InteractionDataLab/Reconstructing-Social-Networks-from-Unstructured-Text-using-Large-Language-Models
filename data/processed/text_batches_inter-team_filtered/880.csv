Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
PCRs of genomic DNA on bhal from B. halodurans C-125 we ordered from DSMZ before. We handled the cells in the same way we did with T. thermophilus before and soluted the lyophlized cells in water and boiled them before PCR. After PCR we cleaned up the product with gel electrophoresis and PCR clean-up kit . However the DNA amount was so low that we had to do the PCRs again.

- Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4–6 times to mix. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
- Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and invert the tube immediately and gently 4–6 times. To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution gently but thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer N3. The solution should become cloudy.
- Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. A white pellet will form.
- Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
- Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through. (Optional): Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
This step is necessary to remove trace nuclease activity when using endA+ strains such as the JM series, HB101 and its derivatives, or any wild-type strain, which have high levels of nuclease activity or high carbohydrate content. Host strains such as XL-1 Blue and DH5α™ do not require this additional wash step.
- (Although they call this step optional, it does not really hurt your yield and you may think you are working with an endA- strain when in reality you are not. Again for this step, spinning for 60 seconds produces good results)

Spinning for 60 seconds produces good results.
- Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
IMPORTANT: Residual wash buffer will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. Residual ethanol from Buffer PE may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions. They are right about this.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," both possess MnSOD (46, 52). Previously, our group has identified, characterized, and cloned the gene (sodA) encoding the manganese-containing SOD from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 (1, 12). Unlike most sodA genes, S. thermophilus sodA is expressed under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions and is not induced by the redox cycling compound, paraquat (12). This antioxidant enzyme was shown to be essential for the growth of S. thermophilus under aerobic conditions (1). However, most lactobacilli lack this general defense system (SODs). Lactobacillus plantarum developed an alternative nonenzymatic defense system that involves the accumulation of high intracellular concentrations of manganese ions, which can scavenge O2 ·� (2). The lack of endogenous SODs (49) and catalase may account for the high sensitivity of most species of Lactobacillus to oxidative stress. In this study, we report the expression of the sodA from S. thermophilus in four lactobacilli: L. gasseri NCK334, L. johnsonii NCK89, L. acidophilus NCK56, and L. reuteri NCK932. Under the conditions used in this study, the enzyme provided a clear protection against the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on the growth of L. gasseri and L. acidophilus."" - Expression of a Heterologous Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Gene in Intestinal Lactobacilli Provides Protection against Hydrogen Peroxide Toxicity

Outlook
To help future iGEM teams to control gene expression, we developed siRCon, a bioinformatic application to generate high-fidelity siRNA sequences in prokaryotic organisms. We introduce this method as an alternative to CRISPR/Cas, since it is open source and free of charge. In the future, further improvements and extensions of this applications are intended. On the one side, eukaryotic siRNAs will also be constructed. This is how we want to provide a universal tool for siRNAs. On the other side, we want to improve the already existing features, especially the check siRNA functionality.

Signal Output
the detection circuit
To measure the sweetness of sweeteners, we designed the detection device consisting of the promoter Pfus, the reporter gene mRFP, and the terminator CYC1t.
Fig.1 The detection circuit
The upstream signal will be produced when the human sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 detects sweeteners, the signal can be transmitted to detection device through the MAPK pathway which exists in yeast naturally. And this signal will activate the promoter Pfus specificity, thereby initiating the expression of the mRFP reporter gene.
In order to construct the detection circuit, firstly, we connected the three parts Pfus , mRFP, and CYC1t by OE-PCR. However, the results were not as good as we expected. So we changed the method to Gibson assembly to connect this device with the linear plasmid pRS42K.
Fig.2 construction of detection circuit by Gibson assembly
pRS42K is a kind of shuttle vector which can be used both in E.coli and yeast. After finishing the construction in E.coli, we transformed the plasmid into competent cell CEN.PK2-1C by LiAc transformation.
In order to make sure the detection circuit works, we cultivated two types of haploids S.cerevisiae, CEN.PK2-1D(α type) and CEN.PK2-1C(a type) together and observed them by fluorescence microscopy. The CEN.PK2-1D(α type) can excrete a pheromone which can be detected by the pheromone receptor Ste2 positioning on the membrane of CEN.PK2-1C(a type). After detecting the signal, our reporter device will express mRFP. Besides, we also used purified α pheromone to test the function of our device.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#MDC#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html,"s however, the use of electrochemically active proteins, like seen in the Shewanella and Geobacter genera has removed the need for mediators and led to improved efficiency and net positive energy production.
Additionally, whereas other energy sources (sustainable or not) tend to require some degree of complex oversight (consider the litany of redundant protocols involved in nuclear power production) MFCs are largely passive, with even the most “high-maintenance” models requiring little more than a continuous inflow of fuel (think wastewater piping).
In terms of raw power output, MFC power production values have been cited to range from  15.5 to 51.0 W/m3 based on fuel source, and are capable of efficiencies higher than those seen in typical combustion processes.
Building on the Past
In 2013, Bielefeld’s iGEM team conducted a project on MFCs, also looking at their efficiency and the lack of engineering on the biological side to the technology. They had originally intended to look at nanowires but ultimately decided to focus on the other numerous, monumental tasks they were exploring. They did work on increasing E. coli digestive efficiency though, which would be a great addition to our final prototype. Additionally, they designed (but did not test) one of the cytochrome complexes required for nanowire development. TU Delft-Leiden improved and characterized this part for use in landmine detection, but we plan to characterize and improve the part by looking at its function and structure in MFCs/MDCs. To test our system, we will use Bielefeld’s 3-D printable MFC design and will attempt to improve upon the design if necessary. We will also use Bielefeld’s results as one of the benchmarks by which we will measure the success of our engineered E. coli."

Wear eye protection and ensure that there is unobstructed access to an eyewash/shower unit in the work area.
As with any chemical, to avoid ingestion do not eat or drink where EtBr is handled, processed, or stored.
Always wash hands thoroughly after handling EtBr, even when gloves are used.
Wear UV-blocking eyewear or work behind a UV shielding glass when using ultraviolet light to visualize EtBr.
Spills and Decontamination
Use soap and water mixture (detergent solution) or 70% ethanol to wipe clean laboratory work surfaces contaminated with EtBr.
Use a UV light to survey work surfaces in the laboratory to ensure that the EtBr has been removed.
Emergency Exposures
Eye care - If EtBr comes in contact with the eyes, immediately flush them with copious amounts of cold or cool water for at least 15 minutes, preferably in emergency eyewash.
Skin care - In the event of skin exposure, remove contaminated clothing and immediately wash the affected area with soap and copious amounts of cold or cool water for 15 minutes.
If swallowed or inhaled - In the case of EtBr ingestion, obtain medical attention immediately. If EtBr dust is inhaled, move the victim to a source of fresh air.

Our team used transient transformation techniques, allowing the inserted vector to remain into the host cell as an extrachromosomic fragment. In other words the vector does not integrate into the cellular genome. In this case the properties inducted  by the transformation last about 72 hours.

MORE ON NEU COLLABORATION
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
NONA Partnership
Nona is a nonprofit organization established to help document, maintain, and increase community access to open source synthetic biology software tools. The motivation behind Nona stems from the observation that a large portion of synthetic biology software tools that are created, despite being incredibly useful for their purpose, often see only limited support, development, and often they never come to full fruition. Too often, a large proportion of software tools made in academia will only see a limited amount of updates and support before the original creators of the tool move onto different project; when this happens, the software tool loses all use, documentation ends, and old or new issues don’t get resolved. To many synthetic biology software tools do not receive enough support and community attention to reach fruition.
Nona gives support to synthetic biology software by providing a platform to archive, document, host and distribute these tools. More so, Nona has a goal of culturing a community of researchers and developers around these tools: Nona aims to have a form where members of the synthetic biology community can discuss, ask and answer questions, and provide feedback about these software tools. And because the tools that Nona supports are all open source, there is a goal of fostering the growth of a developer community around these synthetic biology tools. Nona is a home for open source synthetic biology software tools, and we are proud to have partnered with Nona this summer as just a small part of our human practices ventures.
What did we do? Well, to start off, Neptune is already under the Nona umbrella of software tools. This summer our team met with members of the Nona board to discuss the future of Neptune and Nona, as well other ways in which our team could contribute to the Nona community. We had a total of 3 main meetings, with a couple smaller correspondences in between. The following conclusions"

Step 8.  Safety, Responsibility and Risks
Responsibility
Manufacturers will not have full control on the use of the Mantis device. It could be, for example, disposed of incorrectly, causing damage to the environment. Furthermore, it could be used in unintended ways, such as for discriminatory purposes within a village. It is the responsibility of both the producer and end-user to avoid any misuse(s) of the device. To that end, the labels should include instructions on how to operate it, how to dispose of it and what kind of behaviour is not accepted (e.g. obligate people to submit to a diagnostic test). This is something we discovered during our ethics research .
Risks
As Mantis is based on genetically modified bacteria, it is of the utmost importance to take measures that will avoid an accidental release of the bacteria into nature. How can this be done, when the developers are not the ones using the diagnostic in the field? Firstly, the healthcare personnel will be trained to correctly dispose the vials containing the bacteria. Secondly, a biocontainment mechanism will be implemented in the genetic material of the bacteria, which will prevent the uncontrolled spread of the bacteria in case of an accidental release. Finally, the risk of the bacteria affecting the environment in a detrimental way will be assessed beforehand, to determine that it fulfills the recommended standards. To learn more about biocontainment mechanisms and risk assessment, look on our biosafety page .
Autonomy of the patient
Even though we aim to keep all wishes of the patients into account when designing Mantis, we cannot influence whether they will use it or not. This is partly due to choices by health institutes that choose a specific diagnostic and due to the patient who can decide on being diagnosed or not. However, to what extent does this freedom of the patient go? Should the patient be in control, even if though they might carry a highly contagious disease?
After consulting safety experts, we came to the following conclusions:
Decision should always be made by the patient, even though in developing regions there currently is a system where the health authorities decide.
In normal conditions there is no need to inform the patient about the"

MIT Collaboration
Our most significant collaboration was that with the MIT iGEM team. In this collaboration, the MIT team had the opportunity to explore the possibility of using microfluidic chips to culture mammalian cells. In return, we had the the opportunity to validate the performance of our microfluidic chips with mammalian cell cultures.
The goal in our collaboration was to feed mammalian cells into a cell trap on a microfluidic chip, and then to culture those mammalian cells with an nutrient solution that we could control the input of. The design idea is simple: we would have a single fluid input, and a single output. This fluid would be gated by a valve, after which it would pass over a cell trap bank, and then be gated by another valve. After the valve the fluid is allowed to exit. The design would look something as follows:
The red portion is the control layer, in other words, the valves that block or allow fluid to pass. The blue part is the flow layer, where our actual fluid is allowed to flow, and where our experiment is run. And the purple portion is the cell trap, where the mamalian cells will be cultured. To validate our workflow, we used Neptune to create the chip design schematic. The LFR code to create the chip is included below.
With this LFR file, we generated the below design schematic. Note that this is a to-scale design schematic that we fed directly into the CNC mill for fabrication. You may also notice that in this design schematic, the cell traps are much smaller than in the design above. This is because this design schematic is to scale, and the real chip has small traps, appropriate for the size of the mammalian cells. We milled this chip out using the OtherMill, following the MakerFluidics protocol. In brief, this entails milling that channels of the flow and control layer out of a thermoplastic substrate, and then bonding the layers with a inner layer of PDMS. Our final chip looked as follows:
Now, our first visit to the MIT iGEM team’s lab space was to give the newly fabricated chip a initial test run just to see how the mammalian cells would fare. Since our chip is very simple, with only one port, we ran the experiment without Neptunes control interface, instead manually generating flow with a syringe pump. We were able to successfully insert mammalian cells into the microfluidic chip. We were able to verify this by visualizing the cells through a microscope, we included the results below, in"
KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html,".       For B type cells the cellular motility depends explicitly on AHL due to the       synthetic genetic circuit we have built into them. On the other hand,       in our model the motility of A type cells should not depend on AHL directly,       but since high concentrations of AHL are caused by high densities of       aggregated A type cells, the bacteria typically will not be motile       in high AHL       concentrations because they stick to neighboring cells.
The agent-based module is                         now fully defined but one crucial issue was skipped: AHL and leucine                         concentrations are calculated using PDEs and are therefore only known at grid                         points. Agents on the other hand reside in the space between grid points and                         require local concentrations as inputs to calculate their next step. This                         problem is part of the coupling aspect in our hybrid modeling framework and is                         discussed below.
Coupling
At this point, both the PDE module and agent-based module have been established,   but the issue remains that the individual modules take inputs and return outputs which are not   directly compatible. In the framework of PDEs, entities are described by   density/concentration fields.    In the agent-based module however, entities are represented by discrete   objects with exact spatial locations. The key challenge posed by the hybrid model   is to integrate these different approaches by bidirectionally converting and   exchanging information between the modules. Coupling the modules is the essential component   that makes the hybrid model hybrid. It allows us to leverage the advantages   of both modeling approaches, while circumventing their drawbacks. But although   hybrid modeling opens up many new avenues for novel modeling methods,   it comes with its own diverse set of issues and peculiarities that need to be   addressed before it can be successfully applied.
In the following paragraphs the basic scheme for coupling   the PDE and agent-based modules in our model is introduced, after which the theoretical   treatment of our hybrid model is complete. The difficulties that arise from linking the   modules together are discussed further below in the subsection on matching.
Agent-Based to PDE
As described above, the agents’ effect in the PDE is modeled as a source term                         that is proportional to the agent density. This approach is essentially the same                         approach taken in the colony level model for the bacterial production of AHL and                         leucine. However, in the colony level model the bacteria density is explicitly                         calculated at the grid points, while the agent-based model essentially considers       a set of points scattered in space.       A simple first-order approach would be to determine                         the closest grid point to any agent and simply increment a counter"

Meetups
During the course of the project we formed collaborative links with a number of different iGEM teams to further integrate Sheffield into the iGEM community and establish potential associations for future iGEM teams from Sheffield. We attended the Oxford iGEM Meet Up on Thursday, 19th June 2014 to meet with other iGEM teams from the UK and Ireland. This was a great day with interesting talks from guest speakers giving us insight into the project. Over a poster session we established links with other iGEM teams with whom we later collaborated. As it was early on in the project timeline, it was useful to see where projects were heading and also the variety of issues being tackled using synthetic biology.
We hosted our own meet up on Friday, 18th July 2014, a month after the previous meet up. We felt that this would be a great time for us to solidify and identify specific areas and ideas on which we could collaborate with other teams, as other teams had started their lab work by this point. We met with the teams from Kent , NRP-UEA-Norwich , Oxford and York . Firstly, we had presentations from two guest speakers from the University of Sheffield: Professor Phillip C. Wright  (Head of Chemical and Biological Engineering) who spoke about the development of synthetic biology from an engineering perspective, and Robert Meckin (Doctoral Researcher, Science and Technology Studies) who gave an insight into human practices surrounding synthetic biology. An networking activity involving human bingo allowed us to find out more about each other before a poster session and followed by a more relaxed evening on the town. We had a great time hosting the teams and hope they did too! Below is a video to show a summary of the"

Rutgers,2013,Team:Rutgers#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to become a major therapeutically relevant process. Quorum quenching primary focus is to turn off virulence expression in pathogenic bacteria when certain requirements are met.  The main requirement is that cell density of the bacteria needs to high enough that enough N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) is present to activate quorum sensing. This would mean that quorum quenching can stop the expression of virulent factors at a critical point as well as allow the immune system to deal with the problem by itself before interfering. This method of treatment is different from conventional methods of treatment in that it does not interfere with DNA, RNA or protein synthesis.
Quorum quenching can be achieved through the use of qsdA, a protein found in Rhodococcus erythropolis W2. qsdA belongs to phosphotriesterase family that harbors phosphotriesterase, lactonase or amidohydrolase activities. qsdA has the ability to inactivate AHLs with a carbon chain ranging from six carbons to fourteen. It has also been shown that bacteria that have the qsdA gene interfere efficiently with quorum sensing functions. It should be noted that qsdA has a low sequence similarity with that of other lactonases; for example, AiiA is a well-studied lactonase that shows significant similarities with other lactonases, except for qsdA. This prompted us to examine qsdA in detail and try to find and add to the known array of information about qsdA and its functions in quorum quenching.

GS LINKER
The fusion of two proteins and its ability to still function correctly is facilitated by the glycine serine linker. The fusion of two proteins, and therefore the expression, requires that the folding and attributes of one protein not affected by the other. This is usually not the case, an extreme example being when the last amino acid of a particular protein is near some sort of active site.

Restriction  with S/P, SAMS2 P (was already cut with E/X) and EF3 with E/S
Another attempt at electroporating EFT using EFT ligation from last week
Gel electroforesis of 5 μl from the restriction sample (30 μl)
Nothing in EF lane (no DNA???)
Promotor showed again two results of 900bp and 2k bp (wut is going on?)
An attempt was made to seperate the restriction enzymes by PCR purification on the remaining restriction sample, however nanodrop showed very confusing results, conclusion: let's not try this again. Next time heat inactivation of restriction enzymes to make sure they are inactive.
Made mother plate of SAMS
[ edit ] Tuesday
Restriction SAMS1 1 X/P,  S/P, EF1 and EF2 E/S, COMT4 2 and COMT1 1 E/X
SAMS and EF show expected results, promotor shows the same result as yesterday (1 part of 900bp and 1 of 2k bp) and COMT looks good.
Ligation of EF + TER, EF was not purified from gel, instead the enzymes were heat inactivated on 65C for 15 min, TER was an older vector which was purified
Promotor  transfered from glycerol (-80) to a plate and liquid culture.
At this point we realised the promotor was not in a standard vector but rather in  which contains an additional RFP after the Spe restriction site, thus a part of 900bp and one of 2k bp is expect when digesting with P
Restriction COMT2, 3 overnight.

Future Direction
While our models and equations give a good representation of the affect of different parameters on the buoyancy of E. coli, it will be beneficial to check the accuracy of this model experimentally in the near future. To do so, we intend to use different methods to see how the flotation of GVP’s changes with time. We will use several approaches to do this: we will take high-resolutions picture at 1 hour intervals and build a macro to trace the distance of a single layer of bacteria. This seems feasible using java-based image processing program, ImageJ. Secondly, we intend to measure the absorbance at different levels of the culture tube over time and compare these absorbances. Depending on the amount of GVP’s in the bacteria, we expect their to be an uneven distribution among the gradient of the culture in the tube. Finally, we will do one more test where we will be pellet different portions of the tube and statistically analyze the amount of colonies present in each layer. After performing these tests, we will go back to our model and determine its accuracy. If we find that the model does not completely represent the experimented observations, then we will go back and start eliminating our assumptions until the model has been modified to a near-perfect accuracy.

1.1 Process Overview
1.2 Detailed Protocol
Microfluidic Chips Production
Work done by Yu Zhenming (sophomore) with the help of Chen Rifei (junior). Assistant professor Jaewon Park, docter Wang Yao and docter Zhang Rui have offered their advices.
After reading existing papers about the processing technology typically used in microfluidic chips production and endless trial experiment, we have formed our own processing protocol based on our equipment.
The microfluidic chips used in our project were all produced using this protocol.
Process Overview
Fig. 1 Process Overview
SU-8 Photoresist can cross-link to a network of polymer when exposed to short wavelength light. If the cross-linked network has formed, it cannot be dissolved by the SU-8 developer. So if we place a photo mask to shade the light shine on the photoresist, we can make a copy of the pattern on the photo mask.
Both PDMS and glass contains silicon element. When they were treated by oxygen plasma, unstable hydroxyl group will form on the treated surface. When they get close enough, two hydroxyl group will dehydrate and bond together covalently.
Detailed Protocol
Wash the glass mask holder by socking it in dilute ammonia water for over 1 hour, and refresh it with deionized water.
Wash the glass mask holder by socking it in dilute hydrochloric acid for over 1 hour, and refresh it with deionized water.
Wash the glass mask holder by socking it in positive photoresist remover for over 1 hour, and refresh it with deionized water.
Dry the glass mask holder in the drying oven.
Clean the mask film by wiping the two sides carefully on one direction with a clean paper socked in acetone.
Clean the mask for the second time film by wiping the two sides carefully on one direction with a clean paper socked in alcohol or isopropyl alcohol.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," former one can be well utilized, we mainly focus on the residue of algae containing cellulose and hemicellulose majorly. For a higher reaction efficiency and better utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose, we treat the residue with H2O2 to remove the lignin.[5] H2O2 is clean pollution free and low cost, which makes it a perfect reagent for pretreatment. After that, the lignin is mostly removed and the microstructure of cellulose will break down, exposing more binding site, which makes it easier to use.
As for the utilization of cellulose there are three main stages: dense fiber with a high content of lignin, cellodextrin, monosaccharide. Since the process from dense fiber to cellodextrin has been a proven technique, we use enzymes to treat cellulose and hemicellulose into cellobios and xylose. And our major work will be based on these two substrates.
As for cellobiose and xylose, we designed two recombinant yeast strains. For yeast A, we subcloned cellobiose transporter and β-glucosidase genes into a plasmid and introduced it to S.cerevisiae. The cellobiose transporter can help transport cellobiose from the environment into the cell and β-glucosidase will turn cellobiose into glucose, which can then be transformed into ethanol through its own pathway.[6] In the same way, we introduced xylitol dehydrogenase and xylose reductase gene to yeast B. S.cerevisiae naturally has the ability to transport xylose. With xylosereductase (XR), xylose can be reduced to xylitol, which will then be oxidized to xylulose in present of xylitol dehydrogenase. Xylulokinase of wild type S.cerevisiae can then phosphorylate xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate. Finally, it will join Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) and produce ethanol.[7]
Now we have two strains that can live on either cellobiose or xylose and can produce ethanol through their own metabolic pathways, which means they can ferment cellobiose and xylose synergistically.
Adhesion platform
Through a Adhesion platform between heterogeneous cells, we make E.coli the surface display system of S.cerevisiae to enrich its biofunctions and enhance their synergistic effect.
We select the biotin-streptavidin system"

This summer, we went to Fuzhou, a city located in the south of China to attend the CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community). Nearly 50 iGEM teams and many synthetic biology professors attended this meeting. We shared our experience about the team’s history in our university as well as our project this year. Also, we communicated with other teams during the poster time.
Many suggestions that we received from other teams are of value, so we further improved our design after coming back. Besides, we built close cooperation with UESTC-China since we both used the tobacco.
All in all, it's a pleasant, unforgettable and meaningful meetup!

At the same time, we verified the function of FimE and Bxb1 device through fluorescence respectively. We ligated the mRFP and K137058 together, aiming to evidently verify that the promoter pTetR has been inverted rather than be silenced. We chose pTetR as the promoter which could be induced by tetracycline in K907004.

Meanwhile we also proved the function of FimE and Bxb1 gf35."
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Synthetic TKL_-_-_TEXT.html,"S genes. These genes encode large   enzymes consisting of modules of domains, forming an ""assembly line""   to extend the ketide units to form polyketides. Among the known PKS   genes, the genes coding for erythromycin producing polyketide   synthethase have been extensively and deeply studied, and there are   numerous information sources. Therefore, we chose a truncated   erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase which has been proved to   produce a simple triketide lactone 1B.[2]
Standardization of domains
Figuring Out the Boundary
With the idea of engineering PKS genes to be interchangeable domains,   we firstly develop certain design principles for the engineering of   PKS genes. Although many PKSs are highly modular proteins consisting   of modules of domains, figuring out the boundary of each domain should   be carefully considered because slight changes may result in lost of   function.To achieve this goal, we searched for more information from two   database ASMPKS (Analysis System for Modular Polyketide Synthases:( http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks/pks_prediction.pl ) and MAPSI (Management and Analysis for Polyketide Synthase type I: ( http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/pks/ ). According to the resource   provided by these websites, we separated the sequences of DEBS1 with   centering on domains.
Standardization of Interchangeable Domains
Once the boundaries of the domains have been defined, standard prefix   or suffix should be assigned to each end of the domains to make them   interchangeable. The standardization of sufficient numbers of domains   from numerous organisms would allow customized replacement,   rearrangement, and/or recombining of different domains to produce   novel polyketides. In this project, we tested customized synthesis of   triketide lactones by replacing the loading domain and swapping KR+ACP   domains between modules to test the compatibility of the standardized   domains.
The “proof-of-concept” product--triketide lactone 1B
Assemble standardized domains
To validate our proposal we attempted to express the varient --  DEBS1+TE in E.coli. [3] Initially, we tried to amplify the coding   sequences for each individual domain from Saccharopolyspora erythraea genomic DNA by PCR using primers consisting of RFC 23. However, after   laborious work of weeks, we had failed to obtain proper PCR products   due to the high G+C content (≥70%) of"

Using the example iGEM's first SynBio Beer our team tried to bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general public by hosting a variety of “Human Practice” events. To inform younger members of our society about genetic engineering we visited a class of 10th and a class of 11th graders. An interview at the local student radio station gave us the opportunity to present our team and our mission to fellow students. In addition a comic was designed that illustrates our project in a playful way. Two versions of this comic were drawn: one for children and one for grown-ups. Our team never encouraged under-age alcohol consumption. The presented content was always adapted according to the respective audience.
Our team also addressed the general public with a multitude of events. Laborwelt.de was our most important media partner. Moreover, other newspapers and websites reported about our team and project and a movie presented our project and explained the basic ideas of synthetic biology. A nationwide information day was organized in cooperation with other German iGEM teams. Our team also invited politicians and scientists to discuss the impact of genetic engineering in groceries.
GMO in Food
Genetic Engineering or Genetic Modification of food is an issue that is present in the media all over the world [3] . There are a lot of people who are critical and skeptical about genetically modified (GM) food. The opponents of genetic engineering are wondering if food produced from genetically engineered organisms is safe. They are afraid of eating GM food because they think that the food can interfere their normal bodily functions.  Yet a lot of food that we eat every day contains genetically modified ingredients and we do not know about it [3 ]. Consequently labeling GM food is another important issue that is often raised in controversies over genetic engineering of food. Especially in Germany these controversies are omnipresent and have led to many disputes, protests and restrictions.
Unfortunately many people who debate about genetic engineering have only little background knowledge. Consequently the content of the discussion is often unobjective and emotional. A negative effect of GM food on humans is not approved sufficiently yet. Supporters of GM food say that genetic engineering of crops for example is needed to address the world’s food needs. In this case the sustainability of food security and availability is an important topic because the population increases [3 ]. Biotechnological methods could help increase food production since generating genetically modified crops can provide protection from pathogens. Besides fewer insecticides and other chemicals are needed. Another aspect in generating GM food is"

WHU-China,2014,Team:WHU-China#Footages#practice_-_-_TEXT.html," early April, HZAU-China, HUST-China and WHU-China ,WHU-Pharm worked together to prepare for this great meeting, and CCiC finally began at 23rd August successfully in Huazhong Agriculture University. Almost 20 universities from all over the China came to Wuhan to attend the meeting. We made friends with students from these universities and at the same time we communicated and exchanged our great ideas with each other.
Besides CCiC, we also communicated with a lot of teams. Here is a list that notes the wonderful experience:
Our leader went to Jilin University and had a nice communication with them, besides exchanged our ideas, he invited Jilin_China to join in CCiC and have a visit to Wuhan University.
Our advisor Jia Hangxing was invited by friends from SCU to visit SiChuan University and they had a wonderful talk in May.
Friends from OUC-China, SCUT and SCAU-China visited Wuhan University after CCiC. Students from WHU-China and WHU-Pharm welcomed them and guided them a wonderful trip.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," up the gray day we drew some colorful signs, quoting the famous scientist Rick Sanchez or other scientific phrases. In Bonn we met up with the iGem teams from Aachen , Bielefeld-CeBiTec and UBonn_HBRS .
Arriving on time gave us an opportunity to get some refreshments and talk to the other teams about iGEM-related topics before the beginning of the ceremony. Unfortunately there was no actual “March” for Science in Bonn but rather a “Stand” for Science. On the other hand this offered the possibility for several speakers to give talks on science, freedom of thinking and researching, and education. At least 850  fellow scientists showed for the cause of   facts and evidence-based research [ Sciencemag ].     After standing in the rain for a good cause, we - roughly 30 people - invaded a pizza-place for a little snack sharing one chair with two people helped breaking the ice. Lots of pizza makes for a sore throat so next we headed for a bar. Among playing charades and engaging in thought-provoking political discussions,  we had a great time socializing with the other teams. Alas, all good days eventually come to an end.

 INTERLAB
Overview
This is the third edition of iGEM for Université catholique de Louvain team and for the second time in a row we decided to take part in the InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.           The InterLab is an essential part of the iGEM competition and is an interesting challenge for our team. We estimate that this experience will allow us to increase our awareness about scientific reproducibility. The reproducibility allows           to           determine the trustworthiness of the results of the same experience carried out in different conditions (different laboratories, equipment, operators). Therefore, iGEM is the perfect opportunity to test the reproducibility of a protocol.           Since           we are more than 300 teams from all over the world, we namely represent this concept of “different conditions” in terms of places, equipment and operators.
Moreover, we used this experience to “train” the members of our team which had little experience of laboratory work. Even if they were well supervised, this resulted in some manipulation mistakes. Thanks to this experience we became more           familiar with the laboratory activities before focusing completely on our own project. In spite of not being directly related to our project, the InterLab allowed us to further develop our skills and to acquire a precise and reliable working
The Team
Those are the team members which took care of the interlab. As you can see, we could all be top-models. Fun fact: Antoine (in the middle) cut his hair for the occasion.
All three boys (Luca -left-, Antoine -you already know him- and Mathieu -right-) took care of the cell measurement protocol.           Meanwhile, Nina (left) and Fiona (right) took care of all the rest.

We have thought of this project by ourselves, so it was not an assignment from one of our supervisors. The supervisors and advisors main role was providing consultancy. All the design, labwork and modeling was done by the team itself and started in June. We also took care of the sponsoring, other organizational issues and made our own presentations and poster.
The silk that we have developed was based on the article of Brooks et al. [1], but the codon optimization was executed by the team itself using software written by one of the team members. We improved the backbone made by the iGEM team from Munich in 2012 and used this backbone for our constructs. Also, we validated that biobrick BBa_E0840 works in Bacillus subtilis (Figure 1).
The coating mechanism was developed by the team using article [2][3][4]. The knockout strains were shipped from the university of Illinois and Buenos Aires .
Figure 1: The intensity in of ~40 cells in the GFP-channel, were analyzed from two pictures. The average intensity (AU) from the cells are plotted above with the standard deviation. A GFP from our group is shown and in a biobricked GFP (BBa_E0840) is shown in a plot. wt=wildtype, T0= before induction, T1,2,3=#h of induction with IPTG.

After 16h of incubation at 37°C with agitation at 200rpm, each sample was subcultured into 5 ml of fresh, equally supplemented LB and cells were grown for 2 hours more. 1 ml of the subculture was then retrieved and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. 100 µl of these samples was mixed with 100 µl laemmli buffer, and the sample boiled for 10 min. The indicated volume of each sample was loaded on a SDS gel (12% acrylamide). pSB1C3, and pUniprom were included as a negative control, and PmanA-gfp as a positive control. The blot against 6-His – ChrB was without success and is not shown. No chromate of any kind was added to the medium previous to this blot, hence no expression of GFP was expected.

Newsletter n°1
from July 28th to August 10th 2014
Hi, all the iGEMers. I am happy to announce the first issue of our newsletter. This biweekly newsletter is cofounded by Paris Bettencourt iGEM team and Xiamen University iGEM team. Currently, we have 9 teams participating and are expecting more for the later issues. The newsletter has two major parts: project update and team member introduction. The teams should be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. We hope that through this activity, the teams will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists. There will also be special issues with interviews of iGEM alumni and past advisors from college teams.
This first issue covers the general information of both the project and the introduction of each team. It also includes a question component, which includes the topics that each team wants to get feedback on from other teams. We highly encourage everyone to think about the questions and provide insights. Please send your thoughts to one member of the team and we will collect them a week from today.
We wish the best luck to everyone competing in iGEM and hope this newsletter can be a valuable resource.

Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is"

Week 2
The whole iGEM 2015 NTU team finally met and have introduced ourselves to each other. We proceed immediately to our project outline and decideded on how our works are going to be done. A wiki team has been set up, Kean Hean and Hao Ting will be responsible on designing our wiki's layout. On the other hand, we are introduced to our mentor, Zhang Lei, who will be supervising and mentoring us during out wet lab experiments.
Wet Lab:
Zhang Lei guided us on the process of carrying out error prone PCR on a lactate dehydrogenase and a lactate permease gene to see whether any mutant protein with higher efficiency than the wild type protein can be produced when the products are expressed. This served as our training for general techniques required for carrying out our experiments like PCR, digestions, ligations and transformations.
Dry Lab:
Kean Hean and Hao Ting have decided and came out with a template on how our contents will be presented on our wiki. Moreover, they also have drafted few logos for our team.
Week 3
Wet Lab:
We will be working on two projects currently:
1. Carrying out medium and low level random mutagensesis of the LDH and LDP gene.
2. Make single base pair substitutions on the RBS part BBa_R0043 and charecterise it in our chasis, Shewanella oneidensis MR1.
For this week we will start with carrying our error prone PCR assays on the LDH and LDP gene. We carried out low and medium mutation frequency for LDH and LDP. Have a look at the protocols of our mutagenesis assay in our Experiments and Protocols page."

Outreach
As a team, we presented at many of our school events such as schedule pick up day, various club days, and parent-teacher conferences. We had a poster station and actively passed out flyers at these events to spread the word about our team. These events are an effective way to reach an audience that is interested in the work we are doing. These flyers are also a way to raise interest in next year's team so that we can continue the team in future years. We also reach parents this way, and we get to address many of their with the superstitions of genetically modified organisms. These types of open-ended conversation give the public a better understanding of the benefits of using our engineered microbe and synthetic biology in general.
First year member Chris Guptil talking to a student at our high school about Synthetic Biology!
Advanced BioFuels USA
Along with educating students at our high school and local grade schools, we also made an effort to educate the public as a whole about synthetic biology and iGEM. Thanks to Advanced Biofuels USA, we were able to do this by publishing an article on their website. Additionally, we made a music video about synthetic biology and iGEM to further raise public awareness of synthetic biology. We posted this on our social media, and Advanced Biofuels USA also linked to the video on their website.

Starting a new iGEM team
Virginia Tech contacted our team about trying to start a team of their own. We discussed what iGEM is, how to create a successful team, the difficulties we faced as a first year team, and how we overcame those issues last year. We also talked about Virginia Tech's reasons for starting an iGEM team, one of them being that their science department emphasizes the team aspect of science in their courses, making iGEM a natural fit for their school. Finally, we told them about our current project and our project from last year, and explained how working on those projects in the context of iGEM affected their final outcome.

Week1 20180325-20180331
Moving in our new lab! The first week Huang Tianze, Shen Yunhao, Wang Tingxuan, Zhou Manxuan, Wu Yan, Ge Xiaofei and Zhou Liqun worked on the biobrick part transformations and sequencing. Also we received some help from our PI， Professor Chen’s lab. They provided us with sfGFP and RFP reporters. We prepared the necessary equipment and materials, like LB medium and plates. For the first batch of plates we used agarose instead of agar. The plates turned to stone afterwards hahaha.
Week2 20180401-20180407
The parts we intended to use were amplified and sent for sequencing by Huang Tianze, Shen Yunhao, Li Yibo and Wang Tingxuan. We started the pilot studies for Neon Coli and divided the work. Three groups of people started working on characterization of the quorum sensing system Lux and Las, the red light sensing system and the CRISPRi system.
Week3 20180408-20180414
Still doing transformation…Some parts are just unbelievable. Some sequencing results were inconsistent so we had to find another copy. Huang Tianze, Shen Yunhao, Li Yibo and Wang Tingxuan, Zhou Manxuan, Wu Yan and Zhou Liqun started designing the pilot test plans. We decided to use InFusion ligation technique because it sounds much faster than restriction cloning. (We were so wrong…)
Week4 20180415-20180421
Primers were flying in! Tsinghua iGEM lab is on full capacity. Huang Tianze, Wang Tingxuan, Zhou Manxuan, Wu Yan and Shen Yunhao were doing PCRs and gel recovery, building the pilot plasmids. The Phusion polymerase we were using was quite fickle. We spent half of the time debugging the PCRs.
Week5 20180422-20180428

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

GBB Symposium
On the 6th of september the annual Groningen Biomolecular Science and Biotechnology symposium was organized at the Hamilton hotel in Groningen. During this event, many speakers were invited to present their work. As a special, we were invited to talk about our project. The GBB takes pride in the yearly success of the University of Groningen in the iGEM competition. For us, this symposium was an opportunity to practice our presentation on the way to Lyon. This was a success, we were able to see whether we could communicate our message well to a professional audience. The feedback was positive and useful, allowing for further progress.
Symposium KU Leuven
This symposium was for non-biologists, bachelor and master students.

Characterization of lldR-operator promoter collection
In exchange, Stockholm agreed to characterize a part of our synthetically designed LldR-operator promoter collection for us. They probed our engineered bacteria, carying a green fluorescent protein under the control of lldR along with constantly expressed lldR with or without lldP, for their reaction to different levels of L-Lactate. Thereby they actively contributed to the characterization of our promoter collection .
Amoy
We collaborated with the Amoy team by contributing to their newsletter. We have written about the selection process for iGEM in the issue No1 and participated in the questionnaire about the most useful software for us in issue No6 . We also published a description of our project in issue No3 , an update in issue No5 and an article about our human practices in issue No7 .  Finally, we wrote short essays about the situation of synthetic biology in Switzerland for the Special issue and about the ethical dilemmas of editing a human embryo for the issue No2 . Next to the Amoy team itself we were the only participating team that contributed to every issue of the newsletter.
Darmstadt
On their Southern Germany tour, representatives of the TU_Darmstadt iGEM team visited several German, Swiss, and Italian teams. We were happy to host them for a weekend in Zurich and Basel, where we showed them our lab and our city. We were talking a lot about our projects which was a great opportunity to find out how someone completely unrelated to our idea would react to it, and vice versa.
Next to this, TU_Darmstadt also introduced us to their Lab Surfing platform, which we tested for them. We came up with many inputs to improve the user interface and general usability of the platform. The result of the TU_Darmstadt Lab Surfing project can be found here .
EPFL
Since both Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne, are hosting an iGEM team in 2015, we were of course eager to find out what our colleagues in Lausanne were working on. We invited their team to our lab where we were able to test our presentations on each other and get useful inputs on how to improve them.
We found also that for both our teams it is important to spread public awareness on the rapidly rising field of synthetic biology to which we have become so used. EPFL invited us to take part in their survey on the public awareness of and opinion on synthetic biology, which they had planned to conduct in Lausanne. Together we then went out to"

At first we want to use MySQL to manage our database, later we find Berkeley DBXML is a better tool, so I studied on how to use DBXML. Kun Jiang quickly write an interface using DBXML API and a small PDF instruction, code genius! Finish database format v3.0 – the 3rd version of database, now there are 4 lists, the global, the module, the species, the reactions. Global list stores data that must be pre-defined. Specify database format and give detailed examples on each list. In order to realize the real species, we add substituent in module and chain in species(special thanks to Hao Jiang).

Public
No study specifically regarding the perception of synthetic biology by the public has been conducted in Korea. It is therefore hard to judge how prevalent the concept of synthetic biology is to the general public. Sections of the Bio-Vision 2016 plan mention that efforts will be put into promoting the safe application of biotechnology. Meanwhile other events that help the general public understand synthetic biology include the 4th Bio-safety and Bio-industry Debate Competition for high school students in Korea, held by the Korea Biosafety Clearing House on April 15th of this year. One of the debates discussed the topic of synthetic biology being used to further the efforts of biotechnology. 436 high school students all around Korea participated in the competition (KBCH, 2013)
A 26-item questionnaire survey conducted in 2010 designed to measure high school students’ perception in biotechnology revealed that students had a generally positive toward the use of biotechnology on crops, and microbes, but were wary about the use of biotechnology products on animals and humans. This study also revealed that male students were more accepting biotechnology than female students (Song & Shim, 2010)
Research, People & Organizations
Research
208 projects related to synthetic biology are currently registered in National Science and Technology Service website, representing a great increase considering that only 2 entries were found in 2008. The two largest contributors to synthetic biology research are the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) with 41 projects and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) with 17 project entries. Most of the projects are related to protein engineering and bioenergy technologies (""National science and,"" )
People
According to the National Science and Technology Service website, the most active researchers in synthetic biology are Seung Goo Lee and Sung Kuk Lee, with 13 and 12 projects respectively. The following table is the personal profile of these two researchers and other scientists in the field of synthetic biology.
Organizations, Research Institutes, and Companies
There are few organizations, research institutes, and companies that are specifically established for synthetic biology. Also, Korean Society for Synthetic Biology exists, though it has no official identity or web presence. In addition, there are five institutes directly related to synthetic biology and are listed in the SynBio map. (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ).
Some organizations, research institutes, and companies are not listed in the SynBio map. This is probably because they have a synthetic biology department under a larger biotechnology institute. For example, under the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology"

Each day has a data section with numbers or pictures divided into the PUF and PHAT projects. Can also have tabs and drop down menus. Also uploaded most recent minutes. Will also add Sarstedt to the sponsors page.  - Anthony, PUF - did all steps from PCR to transformation of WT PUF. The transformation didnt work so have started redoing it.  - Asha, PUF - working on re-doing the eYFP in protet constructs (both the control binding site and the PUF binding site.) Did PCR today, and needs to run the gel later. Then will religate, transform, grow, do colony PCR, send to sequencing and begin characterization. Eventually, will clone in the WT PUF in pBAD to the cells. Also making plate (10 LB, 25 Amp, 25 Amp and Cm) and making more pBAD. Will contact local science camps about presentations/assisting in lab for outreach.  - Angela - after doing digestion, you don’t always have to do gel purification, can just do PCR cleanup. Because alot of these runs are low copy number, so gel purification yields low numbers. Did tons of PCR for PUF and most worked. No pBAD worked in the digestion, so got more pBAD from Asha and will hopefully have finished digestion/ligation/transformation by tomorrow. Will then send in for sequencing.  - Uros - trying to get the pETDUET to work with split GFP, but hasn’t really worked. the pETDUET plasmid is low copy number and so we have low yield and have a really faint band with split GFP. If we sent the split GFP tethered to PUF to sequencing on Friday, we would get it at the end of July. It’s expensive and takes a while but we know that we would have it. If we did it by ourselves it would be difficult, and take an undetermined amount of time.
Tuesday, 7/10/12  - Divya, washington characterization - still waiting for the stuff to grow, will email Isiah about further updates, need to talk to Jin about GCMS on Thursday. helped Asha plate some stuff, will make plates tomorrow.  - Anthony - looked a PCR gel. only 1 of 3 worked, but it was a lot of yield, so it will last a couple of rounds of digestion/ligation. So the digest/ligate will occur"

The crude enzyme solution was obtained from the supernatant of fermentation broth of the Bacillus subtilis including the original strain WB800 and the recombinant WB800_ CsoS3. Since the fact that CA can also catalyze the hydration reaction of ester, which can be used to assay the activity of CA, we conducted measurement on CsoS3 according to a method from Verpoorte JA(1967), and the result(Fig.21) certified that the CsoS3 has high esterase activity.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," defending the cell from unknown substances. Event cards teach students how viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens impact the cell.
We also talked to elementary school teachers and inquired about their feedback. Mrs. Manju Goyal, curriculum coordinator at Golden Oak Montessori, had the following statement: “The team initially approached me to understand what the core curriculum includes for early education in science and technology in hopes of creating an informative game for students. Since the purpose of the game was to provide students with an overview of molecular biology, I recommended they tailor the content towards an age range slightly more mature than K-3 since younger students wouldn’t be able to grasp biology beyond a surface level. As a result, the team pivoted their game to focus on students between grades 3-6 where concepts such as a cell, viruses, and cell organelles could be introduced. I am thoroughly impressed with how the team presents these complex topics through a simple game that shows the interactions behind various biological components in the cell. The game also enhances student understanding of how these different pieces work together to maintain overall body health. Since the game requires students to build their own cells using property and event cards, students must exercise creative thinking which is a key component of the Montessori philosophy. I believe a further reviewed and productized version of this game could greatly enable students interested in learning more about the underlying concepts in STEM.
Reflection: Our cellular processes and organelles game provided an interactive experience that included trading in macromolecules and ATP energy to build organelles and exploit their functions, as well as exploring the potential threats to a cell and emphasizing how its phospholipid bilayer membrane serves as its first line of defense.
From designing and testing this game, we learned that schoolchildren respond most enthusiastically when there is an end goal, as well as a competitive aspect to the activity. This encourages them to make the most strategic decisions when applying the abilities of their organelles and deciding which macromolecules to trade in. The children also suggested providing an easily accessible key, along with a short biological explanation of the actual function of each component to facilitate learning of the real life biological roles. Additionally, we learned that it would be helpful to provide a video tutorial for the instructions of the game, as younger children responded better to demonstration and visuals rather than merely reading the manual.
In future developments of the game, we hope to incorporate, in greater detail, the processes of the central dogma by including the roles of transcription and translation, as well as RNAs as a piece of the game. We also hope to expand the diversity of the cells,"

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," it appears the second reviewer assessed the level of difficulty of the “Quantitative Assay” practical only, which was only included as extension for schools that had the capability to perform it. We realised that this confusion could have stemmed from the confusing way that the documents were organised in the drive, therefore we rearranged the drive to make things clearer to future users (Figure 1).
Figure 1: (Left) The original layout of the distribution of our educational package. (Right) The updated layout of the distribution of our educational package.
Despite this, the constructive feedback did cause us to consider how we could adapt our package to be more accessible to public school classrooms. Research on strategies employed in low socio-economic status (SES) schools shows that an emphasis on student engagement in technology related areas shouldn’t be constrained by the funding and resources available to teachers5. The way to achieve such goals is by supporting activities using accessible resources to engage and excite students. In this way, our package does start to address this, providing experiments for teachers to run with their students. But improvements can be made by developing easier and simpler experiments like the “Lipase Experiment”.
We hope to continue to monitor the use and reception of this package, and gather more feedback especially from teachers who have had then chance to trial it in their class rooms.
Looking Forward
The aim was to set up this package as the foundation for developments and contributions to the upper high school Biology community in years to come. By setting up the groundwork for a comprehensive educational package within an Australian context, we hope that other Australian teams and interested parties can develop the package to continue to be part of the movement of universities incubating the scientists and engineers of the future.
In reviewing the package and the feedback received, we propose the following improvements that could be made upon the package:
Expanding on the experiments that are provided, with a focus on accessibility for all schools.
Developing similar resources (PowerPoints, experiments and handouts) for different syllabus modules, such as Genetics of Medicine, as these were the topics highlighted by the girls from the school workshop.
Working with a specific teacher or class group to get inspiration from those who the package will be used by. This sort of interaction would be beneficial for both parties and result in the development of a highly effective package.
The creation of documents or actives that relate to current topics or technologies in the synthetic biology space (this could include brainstorming issues the students would like to fix).
The scope for future work is endless, with a vast choice of inspiration to draw from other iGEM teams. We hope that this package will continue"

TraI Assay
Introduction
Quorum sensing is the cell-to-cell communication system used by a variety of bacteria to detect the population of cells around them. The system consists of three procedure: production of signal molecules, sensing the molecules, and responding to the signals. 3OC6HSL (C6), derived from Vibrio fischeri, and 3OC8HSL (C8), derived from Agrobacterium fumigatus, are the most used signal molecules in the system and produced by LuxI and TraI proteins, respectively. C6 and C8 are the compounds called acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and chemical structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 Chemical structures of AHL-type signal molecules
The production of C6 by LuxI is constitutive and C6 can be sensed by an intracellular receptor, LuxR, in other cells. The complex of LuxR and C6 forms the homodimer and promotes the activation of corresponding promoter, lux promoter, and the transcription of downstream genes. It should be noted that LuxI is encoded by one of those genes, meaning that the production of C6 molecules is promoted by receiving C6 molecules. Therefore, as the population of bacteria grows, the production of C6 is amplified and the expression of the target genes will increase exponentially. As a consequence, bacterial cells can sense their population density and carry out cell-density specific behaviors such as luminescence emission and pathogenicity exerting.
A similar mechanism presents for C8 molecule, and in this case, the TraR protein is the receptor of the molecule.
In a previous study, an AHL-inducible eukaryotic gene expression system was developed based on TraR (1). In this system, expression from the eukaryotic promoter (CMV minimal promoter) is induced only"

EtnR1: ProtParam – What does the primary structure tell us?
  
The ExPaSy ProtParam tool was used to derive basic information concerning EtnR1 based on its amino acid sequence.
It was calculated that:
      • Number of amino acids: 580
      • Molecular weight: 63306.7
      • Theoretical pI: 5.64
It was also found that EtnR1 has an instability index of 38.13, classifying the protein as stable.
EtnR1: BLAST analysis – Are there any known close homologues?
The NCBI BLAST tool was used to conduct a protein BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to identify proteins with close sequence similarity to the EtnR1 sequence. The SmartBLAST feature selects ‘the three best matches in the sequence database together with the two best matches from well-studied reference species, showing phylogenetic relationships based on multiple sequence alignment and conserved protein domains.’
In the case of EtnR1, the top hits were Mycobacterium CdaR family transcriptional regulators, though EtnR1 also showed minimal relationship to the E. Coli. CdaR which has been more thoroughly characterised. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed based on sequence similarities and conserved domains. The individual alignments can be found at the bottom of the page.  >

Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
That’s exactly what we have done! This summer has taught us so much, not only on the laboratory techniques but also on how to work and get along as a team. We can’t wait to fly to Boston the 27th of October to present the fruits of our long hours of PCR-ing, cloning and coding.
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page.
We were on time for all the deadlines imposed by iGEM, even for the Wiki Freeze! We created a poster and rehearsed a lot to give the best possible presentation in Boston. We also filled the safety and judging forms and sent our parts on schedule.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
You can read all about who did what by clicking on this link . We would again like to thank everybody that contributed to every part of our project, all of this wouldn’t have been possible without their help!
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We have submitted 9 new parts to the iGEM registry ( BBa_K1941000 to BBa_K1941008 ) all of them playing an important role in our final achievements. We have documented most of those new BioBricks! Take a look at them by clicking link here.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 10_-_-_TEXT.html," electrophoresis directly with the Gibson products from yesterday night, unfortunately there are no bands. It might be because there were too little DNA, or it might just be the Gibson not working. We tried the 2 two-piece Gibsons again from yesterday for the luciferase construct, one half has came out very nicely but not the other- probably wrong primers. Will have to do it again tomorrow, as always.
We have devised a new strategy to tackle the problem with Gibsoning Ratiometrica. We planned to together the smaller fragments later tonight, and then attempting a three-piece Gibson with the new fragment and also the 2 backbone fragments. Unfortunately no band of the right size came out from PCR of the Gibson product of the two smaller fragments so we can't do the three-piece Gibson yet afterall. It is not much of a surprise: the fluorescent proteins primers are very similar to each other, and since our desired product has the 2 fluorescent proteins at the beginning and end, it is very likely to have misprimed. We will need to figure out some way around this problem. We also PCR-ed up some more of the smaller fragments as we are running out of DNA.
Also, we are ordering primers to ligate the vector fragments into a closed circle, to be used as a better positive control compared to the sfGFP-pSB4K5 that we have been using. Furthermore we will be looking into standard assembly as a plan B to get Ratiometrica out.
Lastly, Oli began PCRing up the fragments for the construction of the Mg2+ riboswitch construct again, with the new master mix. Unfortunately, the PCR of the vector failed, so he will try that again tomorrow.
And we booked hostel for Amsterdam! (Thanks Charlie!)
Friday
Well, we now have the construct development cycle down to a single day, so long as we have the primers. Oli managed to PCR out the vector DNA, extract it, Gibson it with the fragments from yesterday and transform it into some e.coli.
Tom also began running some verification gels to check that we have the fragments that we thought we had. Turns out, we do. He'll check with PJ tomorrow what he thinks the problem with our Gibson reactions is.
It was Kat's second to last day, so she introduced us to Silvano's (other coffee shops are available). Bizarrely (but kindly), she bought the coffees.

One precious colony from the entire Gibson reaction! We're growing it up to test it tomorrow with IPTG and the MG2+"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Supporting Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," some of the teams were not aware of their product’s advantage until later in iGEM and many had no idea about the market characteristics until they sought out industry/entrepreneurship consulting. Overall, the storyline seems that the iGEM teams found a useful idea, developed it during iGEM with quality mentorship, came to find that they required more funding and business advising to make the product viable and worked hard to secure resources to found a startup.
The Founders also gave their thoughts in regards to entrepreneurship in biotech, suggesting that 1) today it is easier than ever before to found a biotech company, because funding and resources are much more accessible and 2) iGEM is definitely an enabling factor. These suggestions will be discussed later on in the “Suggestions and Conclusion” section.
It is important to have both sides of the story. Therefore, the next section is a list of the interviews with non-Founders and the reasons they did not found a business from their iGEM projects.

I.BACKGROUND
We must ask ourselves and think about what is ""Human Practices"" and why it is included in the iGEM competition. We know that is common that many students participating on iGEM dont know about this category or appreciation If they are not told about it and possibly they may not include it in their iGEM projects. For instance,many teams do this as a requirement of the contest or just outreach activity, without engaging in a deeper analysis in what may be ""Human Practices."" In our search for a Human to Practices Project, we had found the need to reflect on, what is Human Practices?, and why it has to be done?, and we met with some definitions and models developed and planned by SynBerc [1] and by Dr. Paul Ravinov [2], which we present a ""Human Practices"" broader and deeper than a Outreach.
Here are 2 examples that we found in our investigation about the understanding of Human Practices:
a). Based on the guidelines of SYNBERC:
The Human Practices Thrust encompasses three interdependent research clusters. The first cluster, Biosecurity, the second Ethics & the third Infrastructure.[1]
b). Quote of Paul Ravinov, from Ravinov lab:
We see developments in synthetic biology as an opportunity to invent new forms of collaborative practice. Standard approaches have sought to anticipate how new scientific developments will impact “society,” positioning themselves external to, and “downstream” of, the scientific work per se. This positioning, for example, was mandated by the Human Genome Initiative and the so-called ELSI project (ethical, legal, and social implications). By contrast, we are committed to an approach that fosters a co-production among disciplines and perspectives from the outset. The value of collaboration is that its goal is to build a synergistic and recursive structure within which significant challenges, problems, and achievements are more likely to be clearly formulated and successfully evaluated. Synthetic biology already represents a highly innovative assemblage of multiple scientific sub-disc"

Figure 1: Plasmid map of uirS after ligating into pCR 2.1 TOPO vector reversed. Generated by ApE (A Plasmid Editor).
The final step prior to beginning mutagenesis was performing polyacrylamide gel purification of the primer oligonucleotides and quantifying them with a spectrophotometer (See protocols).
The first illegal site modified using the Quikchange protocol was a1792c, followed by t1641c, then finally a573c. In order to track our samples the initial uirS.TOPO colonies were numbered 1 to 5, and DNA from colony 1 was used in the mutagenesis of a1792c. Following each mutagenesis several transformant colonies were given letter designations e.g. A-D and checked by diagnostic digest to confirm successful silencing of the incompatible site, then the DNA of one correct colony was chosen to move to the next step.
Interestingly, it transpired that the XbaI site of a573c was protected by Dam methylation; E. coli Dam-methylase methylates the Adenines of GATC sequences. XbaI sequence is TCTAGA, and at this position in uirS was flanked by TC, leading to methylation in the centre of the restriction site and inability for XbaI to bind and cut at the location. In practice this would also have meant that uirS would be biobrick compatible without removing this XbaI site, as there would not be interference with use of XbaI for plasmid assembly, however the Parts Registry would still reject the part as  BioBrick incompatible under the RFC10 standard as it does not consider methylation when processing part DNA sequence. Additionally, in order to visualise the silencing of a573c by restriction digest the use of a Dam Methylase knockout (Dam-) strain of E. coli (NEB: ER2925) was required. Plasmid DNA that is purified by miniprep from ER2925 E. coli lacks Dam methylation and thus the XbaI site can be cut and the fragments visualised. The other option to confirm successful mutagenesis of the site would have been DNA sequencing, but we had a sample of ER2925 available to use. We used the program Ap"

Conclusion:  Since the gene block won’t come for another two weeks, the next few days will be focused on preparing for protein expression.  The main PCquad papers will be revisited, with special attention to the methods.  Once the protocols have been established, the PCquad clone from Yeates will be used to begin the initial protein expression.  Perhaps if another part of the team needs assistance, protein expression can be practiced with them."

Worldwide Connections - A UCSC Tradition
The iGEM Competition challenges teams to improve quality of life using synthetic biology. Creating change requires an understanding of what the world is asking for, and as the 6th UCSC iGEM team, we uphold the reputation of UCSC investing heavily in worldwide outreach to not only spread the word about our project, but to understand the impact of our project on a personal level. Through these personal connections, we evaluated and continue to evaluate potential issues related to our project, including stigma, price, ethics, safety, security, and sustainability. We created a brochure as a means to address common rumors and expand current knowledge about contraception.
Our map below details all countries we've contacted for input. Our questionnaire we used to gather information was approved by the Institutional Review Board and we changed names to assure anonymity of participants.
Inspiration
Before choosing a project, our team emailed over 50 World Health Organization representatives around the globe to determine the most pressing issues. The recent resurgence of the women’s rights movement in the United States prompted our team to open the discussion of women’s health at this year’s competition. We determined that many resource-constrained countries struggle with access to contraception because of stigma, location, and cost. Our goal was to focus on those countries to determine if they’d be interested in our new contraception method and willing to speak with us about their personal experiences.
Execution
Our outreach team contacted several organizations, associations, and foundations for help finding locals willing to speak to us. Not many of them got back to us, so we went an alternative route. We searched GoFundMe and found a group of women in Uganda called the Joy Women’s Group asking for money to help buy condoms for their community. They were funded through the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI), and we contacted the BBI who put us into contact with three local women’s groups in Uganda. Read More >> Through word of mouth, we reached 7 additional women’s groups. We created a questionnaire for locals to fill out to have a consistent question format. Their response to our efforts prompted us to reach out to other groups"
HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,". We don't believe any tool can substitute your thinking originality, but still, we wish to make this process a little bit easier, so more ethical issues could be accessed by more teams, and our understanding towards synthetic biology will expand more quickly. That's why we have produced this framework; it aims at helping future iGEMers more easily find an anchor when needing to address ethical concerns of their project, hopefully.
     Third, the model is aimed at origin digging but weaker at solution finding or future predicting; it's more aimed at deepening the understanding of a topic than actually providing a suggestion when it comes to ethical problems in synthetic biology. But it is the same with evolution and time: we can see where they come from by tracing back and recover their footsteps, but we can hardly see where they are going, so there is only one universal advice offered: better safe than sorry.
     Have fun!

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," we also measured GFP expression of cells that were incubated in the dark and cells with the constuction J23101 promoter + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040.
For the experiment, cells were incubated overnight in M9 medium with glycerol (0.4%) as carbon source, in the morning OD600 was measured and cells diluted to 0.07 nm. After dilutions, we started irradiation with blue leds. Temperature is a very important factor in the function of the YcgF/YcgE system; it is reported that at 25ºC the ratio between the YcgE repressor and YcgF activator allows a good repression unless there is blue ligh irradiation, so we incubated cells with this promoter at 25ºC. Cells with the constitutive promoter BBa_J23101 were also incubated overnight at 37ºC.
Results
A graph showing GFP expression of our Minimum Blue Promoter compared with a constitutive promoter is shown here:
Next graph shows GFP expression in presence and absence ob blue light:
According to the graphs we have shown that our Minimum Blue Light Receptor Promoter works as expected but the response is weak compared to a standard, constitutive promoter BBa_J23101. This results are consistent with previously reported data by the K.U. Leuven 2009 Team.
In order to increase GFP expression in response to blue light, an amplifier could be used. This means to ligate a T7 polymerase downstream the Minimum Blue Promoter and the GFP downstream a T7 promoter. Additionally, we can increment irradiation time and observe response of our blue light-induced promoter.
Emission module: Red Firefly Luciferase
The red light emitter system that we decided to use is the firefly luciferase, this luciferase usually emits green light but with a punctual mutation we can shift the emission spectrum from green to red.
OBJECTIVES
The final aim was the construction of the red light emission  device,  using the promoter region regulated by LovTAP with the red light emitting luciferase coupled to the Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme (LRE). The structure of the device is designed as follows:
Design LRE biobrick and transfer the plasmid with the synthesised gene from Mr. Gene Plasmid to pSB1C3 DNA submission backbone and assemble it to a constitutive promoter.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html,"ided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The"

The Device
Microfluidcs Advantage
Some may feel that biodetection systems are a recent technology, where its full potential still relies on the future. In some sense, one may be right thinking that way, but there are many biodetection systems that already are so commom nowadays that falled in the commom perception of ordinary things of everyday life. Although, those biodetection devices, like disposable HIV, pregnancy, or diabetes [1] tests hide a very interesting working principle: all they use microchannels that conduct the sample flow - in most cases, passively, by capillarity [2] - for chemical detection reaction. The great advantages of such systems relies on [3]:
easy operation,
low sample volume usage,
more accurate and reproducible methodologies,
less dependency of costly detection instruments,
and, of course, cheaper detection devices.
It was discussed on previous sections about the economical potential and social health benefit of early detection systems on disease treatments. Making solutions that reduce costs are critical to democratize access to efficient early disease detection systems, like the well known biodetection devices aforementioned. This is the aim of the concept design proposed on this section: turn complex biodetection systems on ordinary esay-to-use devices.
The Problem, Specifications and Limitations
Alike in vitro (or actually ""in silico"", since most microfluidic chips are made in silicon-based polymers) biochemical or inorganic detection reactions commonly used on microfluidic chips, our microchip design is centered on the problem regarding the GMO that will do the"

What did you work on during the project?
I was involved in planning events, dinners and activities for the team to help get to know each other and promote team spirit and teamwork. I helped promote our project to the general public, plan and execute the BioBrick tutorial, being in contact with industry and mentoring high school students in the lab. Finally, I worked the entire summer in the lab on different approaches for testing our Y. lipolytica expression system.

What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
It is my dream to combine Biotechnological and Environmental Engineering disciplines to combat pollution in water and soil, potentially using synthetic biology to create cells capable of biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). As such, this feels like a logical start.
How would you prank someone on April fool's day?
I'm not quite sure... Not so much into pranking. I suppose that's why I never see it coming when people try to prank me...
What did you work on during the project?
Through my role in the adminstrative group, I helped organize the team and our weekly meetings. As the teams only Environmental engineering students, I was naturally involved in the environmental aspect of our project and provided insight into waste management in Denmark and Europe.

What is your motivation for joining the IGEM team?
I'm thrilled to experience being a part of a long-term research project, as this will be my first and hopefully not my last. I hope it will be an educational experience as well as an opportunity to meet new people and learn more about my personal interests within science.
What is your favorite piece of furniture? Why?
Going to have to go with my bean bag chair. Not because I actually sit in it that much, but I like how it looks in my room and it is surprisingly good for placing items on. It molds to the shape of anything I put on"
