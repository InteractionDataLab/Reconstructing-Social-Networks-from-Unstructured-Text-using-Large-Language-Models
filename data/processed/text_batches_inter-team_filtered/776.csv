Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," in high sugar foods are not only sugar but also much chemical addition or a large amount of oil. As a result, the product can merely solve the problem of sugar content, but it still makes users ingest even more harmful substances by changing their attitude. 
Leona Sun :
I do not agree with it. The above referred preventing sugar as the clearest solution to avoiding obesity, so there are two ways to reach this goal--not to eat sugar or utilizing the transgenic bacteria. Why do we have to spend so much time on creating special bacteria when we already have a direct and easy way, which is to consume less sugar? Isn't this holding a candle to the sun and what we got eventually is the same outcome as the former?
   
 Next, if we no longer suffer from obesity due to consuming sugar, then everyone will consume sugar unrestrained. Think about this, we may be able to eat a lot of sugar without gaining weight, but what is the benefit for human beings on general? Isn't embracing our own desires without any negative effects going to facilitate more desires?  We all know that smoking may lead to lung cancer, and drinking too much can lead to Gastric Ulcer. So does it mean that we are going to fulfill all our desires blindly by creating more transgenic bacteria? 
             
  Furthermore, the ones who are now wealthy enough to eat sugar will as a matter of course consume huge amount of sugar without worry after the commercialization of this bacteria. It indeed will boost the dessert and food industry, becoming a great benefit for countries producing sugar. However, we should also be aware of the labors that might be exploited under the progression of sugar industry. I mean stories of child labors at Ivory Coast being exploited aren't uncommon. Plus that erecting laws and restrainments to stop these sad stories from happening takes long time. It will inevitably cause great impact on these labors.
                  
  To conclude, I reckon that the transgenic bacteria may be useful on medical perspective, but it may not act the same way when it comes to the cultural side, suffice to say that there are a few nomadic people who view being plump as beauty. I would like to share a story with you  related to what I've just said: When expertises from Taiwan come to aid of several african countries in order to improve their  agricultural condition, it doesn't really help much, because most meetings are for men only owing to their tradition, but the ones that do agricultural work are actually women.

uOttawa,2013,Team:uOttawa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," any range of the molecular cofactors upon stimulus of production of X (rtTA). This was explained by the Alon paper – in conditions of independent binding, as such in the case of our pTRELX promoter , fold-change detection is only possible if the activity of the X activator on the Z promoter is linear.
Click on the graph to expand
The way the network is designed, the activity of the X activator on the Z promoter is sigmoidal, as is the case of most situations of activation. To combat this problem, we needed to find a way to linearize the activity of X on the Z promoter.
How can we linearize the X activity?
A 2009 paper by Balázsi illustrated how negative autoregulation can linearize the dose-response curve of a downstream promoter. We decided to attempt to incorporate negative autoregulation into our network by changing the promoter driving X (rtTA) production. By changing the promoter to pGalLX, which contains a lac operator site downstream of the TATA box. The downstream Y (LacI) is able to feedback to negatively regulate the production of rtTA. Since rtTA is what leads to production of LacI, any spikes in rtTA acvitity – as would be the case in a sigmoidal response – are dampened by increased presence of LacI.
Upon testing these strains in a similar IPTG and ATc gradient, we were able to show a range of cofactor concentrations that allow for a temporal spike in Z (sfGFP) production, as expected from a fold-change response. The results of this experiment are shown below:
Click on the graph to expand
Can we also use an activator to negatively regulate and linearize X activity?
Although we were able to show that the downstream LacI is able to negatively regulate and linearize rtTA activity, we wanted to determine whether this would be possible with rtTA itself. Such a situation would theoretically allow for tighter regulation of rtTA activity, since no downstream transcription factors would be involved. To test this, we replaced the pGal1 promoter in the original network with pGalTX, which contains two tet operators downstream of the TATA box. Although rtTA is an activator, binding of the activator downstream of the TATA box should theoretically prevent transcription via steric hindrance. Again, spikes in rtTA activity should be dampened by binding of rtTA itself to its own promoter.
When we tested these strains in the IPTG and ATc gradient, we observed a very small range of cofactor concentrations that allowed for the temporal spike"
Guanajuato_Mx,2016,Team:Guanajuato Mx#ResultsAndDiscussions_-_-_TEXT.html," indicate that although we might have positive results, the use of nisin in a biopatch should be analyzed carefully, mainly because nisin is accepted by the FDA to be used as food preservative. Additionally, we decided to include in our design the signal peptide sequences of the enzyme ChiA74 (spchiA74) and USP45, to secrete the alginate lyase and the microcin in E. coli and the alginate lyase in L. lactis, respectively. Although the spchiA74 is obtained from an enzyme produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, it is useful to secrete ChiA74 in E. coli (Barboza-Corona et al., 2014). In addition, it has been previously reported that the USP45 allows the translocation of proteins in L. lactis ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Groningen ).
Biosensor construction
    Unfortunately, we did not received our Biobricks kit, so we decided to ask for support from the Biosint_Mexico team of the “Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Querétaro”, who provided us with the Biobricks Bba_K1365997, BBa_K649000, Bba_K565004, and Bba_K1365000, for the lasR gene, lasI promoter, microcin and nisin genes, respectively. Because our modules harbor genetic elements not available in the Biobricks collection, i.e. the chiA74p (or BtI-BtIIp), the alginate lyase gene and spchiA74, our efforts are focused on the amplification, cloning and test the functionality of those devices in E. coli previous to the module construction.
Cloning of chiA74 and BtI-BtII promoters (chiA74p, BtI-BtIIp)
    Promoters chiA74p and BtI-BtIIp were amplified obtaining amplicons of ~600 bp and 400 bp, respectively (Figure 1A). Both promoters were cloned into the plasmid pHT3101, which is a shuttle vector with two replication origins, functional in both E. coli and B. thuringiensis (Lereclus et al.). In figure 1B (lane 3)  and 1C (lane 4) we show the release of the chiA74p (~0.6 kbp ) and BtI-BtII (~ 0.4 kbp) from the pHT"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," protein can be attached to other proteins to form a fusion protein. This way the fusion protein can be immobilized on the SpyTag. By attaching the SpyTag to the CsgA protein, the SpyCatcher can indirectly bind to the nanowires formed by CsgA. This way fusion proteins can be immobilized on the nanowires and a functionalized biofilm can be created. (Nguyen et al., 2014)
To prove that this mechanism works, we envisioned to make a fusion protein of SpyCatcher and amylase, a protein that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch. Amylase is actively transported out of the cell and thereby a biofilm could be created that produces both the nanowires and the enzymes that will be immobilized on these nanowires. However, shortly after coming up with this idea, a paper was published on exactly this system. (Botyanszki, Tay, Nguyen, Nussbaumer, & Joshi, 2015). This showed us that using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system to immobilize enzymes on the nanowires was indeed deemed interesting.
To at least prove that this idea could work with our biobricks, we created a fusion protein of Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP) with SpyCatcher (BBa_K1583113). The BFP could be easily assessed on its fluorescent properties to see whether it could still properly function and fold when attached to SpyCatcher. However, we experienced difficulties with the construction of both the CsgA_SpyTag biobrick and the BFP_SpyCatcher_His biobricks. Unfortunately CsgA_SpyTag contained a frameshift, that proved to be hard to remove and the arabinose induction of BFP_SpyCatcher_His also did not work as expected. Still, since we do very much like the idea of creating functionalized biofilms in this manner, we still wanted to explain this idea here and hope that future iGEM teams can successfully conduct this experiment.
Conclusions and Future Directions
These experiments represent a big step in biofilm customization, allowing researchers to create biofilm structures that bind specifically to certain surfaces. Nevertheless, this could be only used as an extra for 3D biofilm printing, as linking cells between them seems to be the limiting step for printing with our hardware prototype.
We have tested that the strains producing CsgA with the different affinity tags can still form biofilms despite having a peptidic modification in the CsgA structure. However, the affinity test has been"

We have achieved following experiment results as our PROOF OF CONCEPT.
We have constructed a signal pathway in bacteria for sensing the indicating-molecule Nitric Oxide of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and secreting Epidermal Growth Factors which contribute to the recovery of IBD. The pathway, which is illustrated in Figure A, consists of two sections: Nitric oxide sensing and Epidermal Growth Factor expression.

Figure 5 C12 and C6 when (β2,km2)=(120,0.1)
Figure 6 C12 and C6 when (β2,km2)=(60,0.3)
After simulating the system at different parameters, we recorded several critical points for oscillation and made a table as follows.
Table 3 Critical points (β2,km2) for oscillation
Depicting those critical points on an axis, we immediately got the bifurcation line of parameters (β2,km2), which indicates the parameters’ value range when our system can oscillate stably, being marked in ‘bistable’.
Figure 7 Bifurcation Analysis on (β2,km2)
Proportion of cell volume
In actual vivo experiment, volumes of two separate cells might not be the same. We simulate the system by changing the proportion of two types of cells. What we know from the simulation is that cell proportions only affect the amplitude of signal molecules’ oscillation, but no influence to the period or stability of oscillation. The following graphics are drawn under cell proportion 1 and 0.7.
Figure 8 oscillations under different cell proportions
We can find that under different cell proportions, our system can oscillate at different amplitude, and varying in cell proportions may also lead to the change of oscillation period.
Period adjustment
As figure 2 indicates, we expected to adjust oscillation period by adding signal molecule aTc into our system. A small molecule as aTc is, it can easily bind to protein TetR and quickly depletes TetR in cell 2, which results in reduction of TetR net production rate, and indirectly, the protein’s inhibition on promoter5 is crippled. Thus, it would take a longer time for our system to reach each threshold, which is equivalent to prolonging the time delay τ2 in our simplified model. So we can deduce that changing the amount of aTc added into the system in precise model is equivalent to varying the time delay τ2 in simplified model.
Simulation results under distinct τ2 are presented as follows.
Figure 9 Oscillation cycle’s regulation
The result is exactly what we expected, which clearly demonstrates our system can truly be controlled by adding in external signal molecules.
Phase adjustment
In cell 2’s gene circuit, we designed a promoter induced by arabinose, marked by promoter 6 (see in figure 2). Promoter 6 is in a suppressed state until"

Transformation of electrocompetent cells for reproduction of Dickinson-Experiments
In order to gain the three strains which are required for the reproduction of the first seven days of the “Evolution of a split RNA polymerase as a versatile biosensor platform” (Pu et al., 2017), transformation of electrocompetent cells with different strains was performed. S1030 electrocompetent cells were thawed and DNA of the appropriate plasmids were added. The amount of DNA of each plasmid was adjusted at equivalent amounts. First, the recovery medium was cooled on ice and thawed. The electroporation cuvettes were also refrigerated on ice. Following this, the 40 µl of S1030 cells were added to the DNA in a separate tube and mixed carefully. Next, the mixture was transferred to the cuvettes and electroporation was performed using 2500 V. Cells were immediately recovered using 1 ml SOC medium and grown at 37 °C for 1 h and 275 rpm. The resulting cell culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 2 min and the cell pellet was resuspended using 200 µl SOC medium. After this, 200 µl of the cell culture were applied on the related LB-Agar plates, displaying the corresponding antibiotic resistance and 10 mM Glucose concentration. At last, the plates were incubated at 37 °C over night. For further information about the detailed transformation: awesome_sheet/Trafos/ ID 66-69
Transformation of electrocompetent cells for reproduction of Dickinson-Experiments
Due to the non-functionality of the first transformations on the day before, the transformations were repeated. The general procedure was implemented following the instructions of Wednesday 07/05/2017. Several changes were made in order to complete the transformation successfully. All DNA amounts were adjusted at 100 ng to improve the efficiency. Beyond that, 25 mM Glucose instead of 10 mM Glucose were added to the LB-agar plates, following the instructions of the information supplied by addgene.

The 2017 WPI iGEM Team would like to thank many people, and acknowledge everyone involved in making our project possible. The team started working in C term, or late March, of 2017. Goals for the team's project and specific roles for each student were decided by the end of May. The work continued into the summer and fall as an internship and a class. Many experiments were conducted from May to October.
Team Members
This is an outline of all of the work that was done by each team member throughout the project.
Aylin Padir:
In the lab, Aylin worked a lot with the development of the lead assay, and later worked with the Lead Test Kit from Hach, and was responsible for the majority of the data analysis for each of these two parts. She made plates, did mini preps, and helped with the final cloning efforts. In addition to lab work, Aylin was in charge of integrated human practices. She helped to organize the Touch Tomorrow activity in which students were asked to guess where lead contamination in drinking water was a problem, in order to get them involved with the WPI 2017 iGEM project. She also communicated with the Department of Environmental Protection, which helped shaped the focus of the probiotic to a prophylactic. Finally, she was heavily involved in writing the Case Study that was taught to WPI's Introduction to Biotechnology class.
Catherine Sherman:
In the lab, Cat worked a lot with the development of the lead assay, and later worked with the Lead Test Kit from Hach. She made plates, did mini preps, and helped with cloning. In addition to lab work, Cat was in charge of public engagement. She helped organize what activities would be completed during each event, and helped figure out which events the team would be participating in for public engagement. She worked closely with Aylin to help with Human Practices, and learned HTML to help with Wiki development.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Introduction
Catalase (also named as peroxidase) is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, which is commonly found in nearly all living organisms that interact with oxygen.1 The reaction catalyzed by catalase is as follows:
2H2O2 ---> 2H2O + O2 + heat2
This decomposition reaction produces significant levels of heat during the breakdown.3 Also, the importance of this reaction is that it occurs in all oxidative organisms, making catalase an abundant enzyme and readily present in many targeted organisms.4
The aforementioned features of catalase make it suited for the needs of our project as an effective enzyme to stimulate an enzymatic heating process. The reason behind the selection of catalase as the enzyme for such the exothermic process was the inspiration drawn from the bombardier beetle.
The Bombardier Beetle and Catalase
The Bombardier Beetle (Brachinini) is a group of species that utilizes a explosive-induced spray pulsation system as a defense mechanism. As a response to external threat, the bombardier beetle sprays a chemically active liquid vapor from its abdomen. This vapor shows its function through the flammatory reaction of hydrogen peroxide.5
The dorsal structure of the bombardier beetle's abdomen allows several chambers to be found in its response system.6 The reaction that our project focuses on occurs in the reaction chamber which is directly connected to the exit channel. In this channel, peroxidases which catalase the enzymatic reaction enter the liquid vapor.
The liquid that travels to the reaction chamber contains hydroquinine and high levels of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxidases that join the vapor in the reaction chamber prior to the pulsation initiate a flammatory reaction that continues after the pulsation and on the target. The bombardment of the bombardier beetle is hence a result of the mechanical excretion of a liquid vapor of catalase and hydrogen peroxide.7 This method of flammation will also be utilized for our project.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", this model requires further fitting to get more accurate results. Not only by using more accurate coefficients, but with improving the system itself.
Future development
We would like to improve the model and design new ones based on it. First, develop            models for the different coefficients in the Keller-Segal equation: bacteria diffusion            coefficient, chemotactic coefficient and bacteria life and death. Theoretically,                                         those coefficients can be controlled by changing some parameters like                   the number of flagella            or receptors a cell has, or even manipulating the biological tracks of the bacteria.            This will enable us to get even more accurate results. Secondly, to build a library of            different receptors and ligands. Thirdly, expanding our            model so it could predict movement of bacteria in different geometric constructs such            as funnels or U bends. This research can be the basis of a prototype commercial device.
As for the first part, we worked with iGEM Freiburg (2) in developing a function for the           chemotactic coefficient. Also, we designed a new assay for experimentally measuring it.
This assay, named Trap & Track, is a novel way to detect chemotaxis on the nanometric level.            By using it we can measure the exact repellent concentration that induces chemotaxis and            calculate the chemotactic coefficient accurately for every material. A detailed explanation            about the assay can be found here .
As for the second part, the S.Tar system enables us to change the receptors a bacterium            has and by that, change the materials it repels from. In the future, this system can be            expanded to control the efficiency of these receptors and even control other aspects of            the chemotaxis pathway such as the flagella.
The third and final part is to improve the device itself. We designed a new fluidic chip            and fabricated it in different methods .            This new design will give us a more controlled diffusion by cancelling out most of the            flow and fixing the diffusion source. Also, by changing the geometry of the channel,            the bacteria concentration will increase and cause a more noticeable signal. This will improve            the accuracy of the experiments we run, and in turn, our overall model.

Microbiome Analysis
From the literature review (link back to literature review), we discovered that no sequencing approach had been used to assess the types of pathogens in ambulances. As such, to get a comprehensive picture of what is contained within these vehicles we decided on a sequencing approach. Specifically, we chose the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. This sequencing platform is well suited for our project as it routinely allows for long sequencing reads of up to 10kbp. The completed reads were then mapped to a database, allowing for the identification of different types of pathogens within a sample obtained from the EMS vehicles. Since this technology is relatively new there were no established protocols for obtaining and preparing environmental samples for Nanopore sequencing. This allowed us to develop our own novel sampling pipeline and methodology to amplify and prepare DNA.
Sample locations were chosen based on information obtained from the literature, our observations during ride-alongs and areas of high concern indicated by first responders (link back to sampling protocol). We chose to sample the bottom of soft kits, the interior door handle, and SPO2 finger monitor. As well, we included a field control (i.e. a sample that did not physically swipe a surface). All four samples were acquired weekly from 3 ambulances over one deep clean cycle for a total of 48 samples to be sequenced (link to sampling protocol).
The acquired samples were then prepared for the MinION, which included DNA amplification, barcoding and adapter ligation (link to sample prep protocol). We chose to amplify and isolate ribosomal RNA from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes using universal gene primers [1,2]. Using this approach, we identified several pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria.
Additionally, we identified species that were not readily culturable. This highlighted the benefit of our approach over more conventional cell culturing techniques which could not identify these species. The results of the sequencing analysis provided a comprehensive picture of pathogens contained within EMS vehicles. This information could be used to provide a baseline measurement of the vehicle microbiome,"

Workshop Practice Presentation
We gave a workshop practice presentation to members of the school of bioinformatics. It was decided that we shouldn't talk about the subtilin two-components system model, because it might be too complex for our workshop. It was suggested that our workshop needed to be a little less like a presentation, with more interaction for the participants.
Starch test
Aim and Methods:
Please refer to July 3rd
Results: The starch plates were checked and a lawn of bacteria was found. The starch test was done anyway using vaporised iodine. The test showed a positive result for pGFP as it turned black (Figure 1: left plate) showing no amylase was present and there for it had transformed. The B.subtilis (positive control) did not go black because the starch was consumed by the bacteria as expected (Figure 1: white plate). Also E.coli was left with the Groningen plasmid in 10ml of LB over the weekend for purification. This was done because stocks of the Groningen plasmid were running low.

Après une médaille d'argent obtenue par l'équipe INSA-Lyon en 2010, l'INSA-Lyon et l'Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon se lancent conjointement dans la compétition avec les meilleures universités du monde en participant au prestigieux concours estudiantin iGEM ou « International Genetically Engineered Machine » organisé par le Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aux Etats-Unis.
Il s'agit d'un concours en biologie de synthèse , nouveau domaine de la recherche en biologie qui combine Science et Ingénierie par différentes disciplines (biologie, physique, chimie, informatique) dans trois grands domaines: Environnement, Médecine et Recherche Fondamentale.
Au-delà du défi scientifique et humain de cette grande compétition (163 équipes d’étudiants « undergraduate » épaulés par quelques « instructors » et « advisors »  plus expérimentés), le concours vise à promouvoir le développement transparent et ouvert d’outils d’ingénierie biologique et à construire une société qui puisse utiliser les biotechnologies de façon éthique et productive.
L’équipe Lyon-INSA-ENS a choisi de concourir dans la catégorie « Environnement » en proposant de construire un biofiltre épurateur de cobalt destiné au traitement des effluents nucléaires. Ce dispositif innovant permettrait de réduire la quantité de déchets produits en augmentant la durée de vie des résines échangeuses d’ions utilisées pour le traitement de l’eau contaminée, mais permettrait aussi d’anticiper de futures restrictions réglementaires en visant le rejet ""zéro cobalt"" en sortie de   centrale.
Notre objectif est de gagner le prix ""Environnement"" et de montrer que Lyon et la région Rhône-Alpes possèdent, outre un large parc industriel et nucléaire, un vivier de futurs ingénieurs et chercheurs à même de relever les grands défis environnementaux .

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO STEP
Troubling the world for years, cancer has long been a major threat to people's health. The rapidly developing cell therapy has proved its potential for cancer treatment, but all of the current biosensors, from CAR to SynNotch, lack either programmability or orthogonality, which could significantly restrict its clinical application.
We provide our own solution to the problem, the Synthetic Transducer Engineering Platform (STEP). Consisting of two transmembrane chains with ligand receptor on the extracellular domain and protease/transcription factor pair on the intracellular domain, it can achieve high modularity as well as orthogonality in both upstream and downstream. Through our experiments and models, we've successfully proved the reliability and tunability of STEP, and are trying to find the best condition for its real application.
By using STEP in clinical researches and practices, treatment best suited for cancer patients can be developed. With further researches and optimisation, we believe it will reveal its full potential.

Video call with MVZ Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa
June 27th
Meeting with MVZ Ernesto Tanús Sánchez, MVZ Adolfo Arroyo, and Ing. José Luis González Miranda
Counseling about some parts of bee anatomy.
Discussion of aspects like:
Search of precise statistics on the presence of foulbrood around the world.
Important national and international normative and regulations to be considered regarding the design and execution of our project.
Difficulties and impediments regarding governmental legislations related to bees
How to ensure the peptides have arrived at the larva?
Detailed Description
For us, it was very important to receive feedback from specialists and be able to exchange opinions about our project. After the video call we had with Ernesto Tanús, we were able to keep in contact with him, since he was visiting the city of Chihuahua we took advantage of the opportunity and we scheduled a meeting that was also attended by the President of the National Association of Veterinary Doctors Specialists in Bees (ANMVEA) (MVZ Adolfo Arroyo) and a beekeeping technician from the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing and Food (SAGARPA) (Ing. José Luis González Miranda). The legal framework consultant accompanied by two active members of
human practices attended this meeting that lasted approximately 1h 30. We were looking forward to presenting our project, for them to the give us their general insights, discuss the considerations of legal aspects that involve our project, and receive counseling of the bee's anatomy.
For this date, we were in search of precise statistics on the presence of foulbrood around the world. Mr. Tanús recommended us to consult the OIE (International Office of Epizootics) where the countries report the presence of different diseases. After this meeting, we were able to consult and obtain specific data of each country to better track Fouldbrood distribution ( Consult the distribution map in the detailed project description ). The specialists also shared with us that the last time AFB was diagnosed in Mexico, was in 2015 and that the infected apiary was eliminated. We considered very important the fact that the causal agent was a strain with resistance to many antibiotics, reinforcing the previously mentioned need for an effective treatment alternative for these pockets of infection.
The three specialists oriented us on the several regulations and normative that we"

We also helped the Imperial College iGEM team by sequencing a construct related to our university’s project from last year. At the end of the day, we ran another gel to see if we could get the correct amplified product. Both of the PCR reactions with new melting temperatures at 70º C and 80º C seemed to not work and had irregular bands around 400 bp long. We saw these same bands in the our first Golden Gate PCR reaction.
7/31/13
In lieu of what has happened in the past two days, we decided to try seven different melting temperatures in an interval between 55º C and 75º C. We hope this will help us find the ideal melting temperature at which to amplify these Golden Gate products. We ran out of time towards the end of the day to run a gel and check the different PCR reactions. We plan on doing this tomorrow. We also spoke to a fellow UC Davis student about starting a synthetic biology club on campus. We brainstormed different ideas about how we would gain interest from the student body about such a club and believed that this could be great for human outreach.
8/1/13
Today we started off by running a large gel to check all 21 of our PCR products from yesterday. The two TAL repressors were not correctly amplified, which makes us question the design of our primers. In the majority of the lanes, the presence of aberrant bands at the 400 bp length may be evidence of mispriming. To mitigate this, we decided to redesign new primers. In the case regarding pSB1C3 , the PCR amplification step was successful. We performed gel extraction and purification on the two GFP and the pSB1C3 PCR products in order to isolate our desired products from any side products or remaining template.
8/2/13
After obtaining very low DNA concentrations from the gel extraction of the pSB1C3 PCR product from yesterday, we decided to just simply do a PCR clean up on the remaining PCR products to get a better yield. So far, we have amplified product of pSB1C3 and two different GFP products with different flanking ends. We ordered new primers for the two TAL repressors and made sure there was no overlapping homology in the primers with the repeat domains of the TAL repressors. We received primers for our site-directed mutagenesis involving pSB3K3. We began the PCR reaction and hope to do a restriction digest next week"

About our office
Our office has been our meeting point and our dry-lab zone during the project. Here, amazing talks about biology, engineering and philosophy took place. And here we debated about science and lab topics. To sum up, the office that you can see in the picture in the left has been our home this summer: the place where we built the project, but also where we built our team spirit.

Microscopy training
ML-1 safety test completion
Chemical safety training
General safety information, regarding contact persons and locations
Computer infrastructure
The safety of our experiments was supervised by Susanne Hage (Safety Manager of the TNW faculty) and Marinka Almering (Safety officer of the TU Delft). The research has been conducted with respect to the regulations of biosafety for The Netherlands, that can be found here
Safety in our Project
Our harmless bacteria produces curli subunits in order to make an inducible biofilm. The curli is natively produced by several safe strains, like the TOP10 used for transformations. Our strain contains a CsgA deletion and can only produce the curli when transformed with the designed plasmid and induced. This part of the project is based on sufficient scientific publications and previous iGEM information and parts. Also, one assay is designed to test the efficiency of the biofilm created carrying a specific affinity tag. For the assay teeth pieces were used, taking care of all the existing regulations and safety recommendations.
The chassis organism used for our project is a modified strain of the lab organism Escherichia coli K-12. It is called E. coli K-12 MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234.
In addition to our chassis organism, Escherichia coli Top 10 cells were used for cloning procedures
A pig tooth is used for testing our affinity application to hydroxyapatite. This will be arranged following the lab regulations, and the tooth will be provided following all the existing regulations. We will handle the part in the ML1 lab, and using gloves while working with the part. Furthermore, the teeth are cleaned properly before"

Ligation: after digestion and clean-up: 50 - 200 ng of vector, 3 - 10 fold molar access of insert, 20 µL ligation volume, 2 µL T4-Ligase-Buffer, 1 µL T4-Ligase . Incubate for 20 - 30 min at room temperature, afterwards inactivation for 5 min at 70 °C. Then: store at -20 °C or transform.
Variations
A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µL restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Sometimes some BioBricks are hard to assemble. Then you have to clean up the vector by gel electrophoresis as well.
Standard Freiburg BioBrick Assembly
Modified from Silver lab and Assembly standard 25 :
This assembly method can be used for fusion protein assemblies with BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, which is called vector and needs to be available in the BioBrick Assembly standard 25 . You have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.
Suffix Insertion
Digestion of insert: at least 700 ng DNA / 10 µL volume, 1 µL 10x NEB buffer 4 + 0.1 µL 100x BSA, 0.5 µL NgoMIV (NEB) , 1 µL PstI . Digest for 2 h at 37 °C, afterwards inactivation for 20 min at 80 °C. Clean up the insert via gel electrophoresis. When cutting the insert out of the gel try to avoid staining or exposure to ultraviolet light of the insert.

Both of this membrane receptor phosphorylate the transcription factors respectively associated to the promoters, pompC and FixK2, when they are not in the presence of a light stimuli.
ho1 and pcyA are essential coding sequences involved in the biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin (PCB), which is involved in the creation of cph8 fusion protein.
AmilGFP and spisPink are proteins isolated from coral-reef that act as reporter proteins due to its colorimetric properties.
When the bacteria is irradiated with an specific wavelength of 660nm, amilGFP´s expression is repressed. The same  thing  happens with a wavelight of 470 nm and the  production of the chromoprotein spisPink is repressed. When the system is in total darkness both proteins are expressed and a third color is formed.
Color Coliroid
Our project uses E. coli strain k-12 as chassis and a gene circuit that allow the bacteria to sense specific light waves. Two photoreceptor cph8 and YF1, that had to be cloned and expressed in a constitutively manner, are sensitive to red and blue light 660 and 470 nm respectively.
ho1 produce biliverdin IXalpha (BV) that is converted to  phycocyanobilin (PCB) by phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA), PCB is the immediate precursor for chromophore formation and essential  for the assembly of cph8.
ho1 is a gene from cyanobacteria that produces a heme oxygenase . Biliverdin IXα is produced when heme undergoes reductive ring cleavage at the α-methene bridge catalyzed by heme oxygenase.
PcyA and is a member of the ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase family. After the ho1 activity PcyA reduces D-ring (exo) and A-ring (endo) vinyl groups of biliverdin IXα (BV) to yield phycocyanobilin.
cph8 change ompR to its phosphorylated state. ompR is a endogenous transcription factor in E. coli and constitutively expressed. When this happens, production mediated by pompC promoter is stop. YF1 works in a similar manner that cph8 with the difference that the respective transcription factor to be phosphorylated is not naturally expressed in E. coli and had to be added with a constitutive promoter.

Forum calculates the popularity of bricks in real time. The most popular ones will be displayed on the home page:
Plenty of data will be generated in Forum every day, and Biohub will use them to correct the deviation of bricks ranking. For every 30 minutes, the system will recalculate quality of the bricks with the help of data such as star numbers or popularity.
Plugin System
From the very beginning, Biohub 2.0 is designed as a plugin system. Such idea is originated from the project of USTC-Software 2016, which had a defective plugin system. Compared with theirs, the plugin system of Biohub 2.0 has these new features:
Hot Reloadable All components of Biohub 2.0 are designed to be self-reloadable, which means servers need not to be restarted while installing or uninstalling plugins.
More Utilities Biohub 2.0 encapsulates varieties of modules to simplify plugin development, including URL routing, background tasks, websocket dispatching, file handling, and so on.
Full Access to the System Biohub 2.0 doesn't have sand-box mechanism, which means plugins can take all advantages of th operating system. But uploaded plugins should be checked manually by us as a consideration of security.
By default, Biohub 2.0 carries 3 plugins, you can find them in the ""Plugins"" page.
BioMap
As a demonstration of how to use bricks data in plugins, we build BioMap. BioMap is a gadget to analyze the relationship between different bricks. Simply type the brick name you want to analyze and click the corresponding button, a graph will be shown to visualize the relationship:
Since the result set may be very large in reversed relationship querying, we will compress them by only displaying a portion of them as you can see.
You can select the nodes inside to perform further analysis:
BioMap have preprocessed and cached the relationship network while deploying, so it will not consume much time to accomplish the analysis.
ABACUS
ABACUS is a tool to design amino acid sequence from a given protein. Proteins are specified in Protein Data Bank format. The uploaded .pdb will be evaludated by simulated annealing algorithm, and another .pdb file representing the result will be returned. To upload a sample, simply click the ""Upload and Compute"" button and choose the file:
The computation will take several minutes to accomplish. You may browse other pages during this time, and an notification will be sent after the task done. ABACUS"

ANALYSIS
General Analysis
Most of the base literature and reference model for all of the kinetics, be it DT and HB-EGF, Tar-agent, or autophosphorylation process, are based on the fundamental understanding of macro and micro mass-transfer in accordance of engineering’s perspective, in which:
Which means that the rate of mass transfer (in this case): toxin/agent transport to be bound by the receptor, is affected by the agent’s own mass constituent (for example: concentration, or mass ratio) times its multiplier constant (sometimes called rate-limiting step), therefore, if one seeks to model the equation above, the first step to do is to linearize the differential equation by integrating it.
The resulting graph, if it is in linear progression, will result in f(x) = ln(x) graph, like below:
Figure 26.The graph of f(x) = ln(x).
The resulting shape signifies that mass transportation will progress quickly in the early stage and decline slowly in the later stage, which can be explained by basic science and engineering, in which a group of mass will transport faster when there are bulk of them, signifying a push force between them, causing them to move faster, and then will gradually decline when the mass is mostly transferred, since there"

The elution peak recorded by the continuous measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm indicated a good yield of recombinant protein (Fig. 29). As a second purification step after the streptavidin affinity chromatography we concentrated the protein in centrifugal filter units in order to apply it to a size exclusion chromatography. During the concentration process there were clear signal for precipitated protein which appeared as white flakes in the concentration filter unit. This effect was by far the most drastic precipitation of recombinant that was detected during this iGEM project. Anyhow the concentrated protein was centrifuged for 5 min at 13 200 RPM to remove particles of precipitated protein and was then applied to an ÄKTA purified with a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Fig. 30). There were four different peaks present in the chromatogramm which most probably correspond to (1) a peak created by aggregated protein which runs in the voit volume of the size exclusion colum, (2) a diffuse peak which might correspond to multimeric PP1, (3) a sharp peak at the elution volume where the recombinant PP1 was expected and (4) a peak which is most probably caused by low molecular buffer substances. The general signal intensity obtained in the size exclusion was very low indicating low protein concentrations. The maximal peak obtained for PP1 had an absorbance of 50 milli Absorption Units whereas this was for example for the NanoLuc in the range of 1000 for a comparable experiment. The fact that this protein does not tolerate the concentration procedure gives an indication that it is fragile and tends to aggregation when stress is applied. Finally recombinant PP1 protein was prepared although the yield was very low compared with other effector proteins.
Possible reasons for the instability of PP1 in vitro
The high aggregation and denaturation tendency of the protein phosphatase 1 which was observed in the analytical preparation motivated the search for a possible explanation. As a first hint the amino acid composition calculated by the AutoAnnotator was examined and it can be seen that 13 cysteine residues are present in the sequence of the protein phosphatase. This corresponds to 4% of the total number of amino acid residues comapred to 2.8% cystein residues in an average protein. This information taken together with the molecular function of the protein phosphatase 1 clearly shows that this BioBrick is a cytoplasmatic protein which fulfills its function in the reducing milieu of the cytopl"

The second pathway utilizes the “Formate” plasmid, which takes. We designed the plasmid with the same MDH2 gene as the Fructose plasmid, but incorporated formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), genes previously characterized by Team UESTC-China 2014. These enzymes together make a pathway that converts methanol to carbon dioxide by first using MDH2 to convert methanol to formaldehyde, using FALDH to convert formaldehyde to formate, and using FDH to convert formate to the final product. At each step in the pathway, energy is released in the form of reduction of NAD+ into NADH, serving as a source of energy for the cell.
The engineered bacteria will be co-cultured to provide the complete pathway of methane metabolism.This co-culture can be applied to the piping of landfills, where methane gas may escape.
Construction
sMMO
We attempted to recreate this plasmid using several different methods. The plasmid consists of a lac pL promoter, inducible by IPTG, six sMMO subunits, a ribosome binding site before each subunit, and a double terminator. The subunits are MMOB, MMOC, MMOD, MMOX, MMOY, and MMOZ. MMOB, MMOC, MMOD, and MMOX were all ordered from the registry. The lac + pL promoter and ribosome binding site were obtained from the kit. An RBS, MMOY,  another RBS, MMOZ, and the double terminator were designed into a G-Block provided by IDT. We designed the G-Block to have an overhang on both ends that corresponded to the ends of a linearized backbone and then performed a gibson assembly to insert that set of genes into a chloramphenicol resistant backbone provided by iGEM. We then attempted to combine a ribosome binding site with each subunit using 3A assembly.  The plan was then to sequentially combine the subunits together, combine them with the G-Block part, and then combine the promoter with that using more 3A assemblies. Unfortunately, we were not able to find success in this strategy and the length of the process proved to be a major setback so we looked to try a new method.
For this new method, we hoped to take advantage of the ease of gibson assemblies. We designed primers for each subunit. The forward primer would contain an overhang to correspond to the"

During our first brainstorming sessions, all our members were truly excited about what our project will be.      Will we cure patient from a growing infectious disease that is spreading and devastating the world?       Will we contribute to the cheap production of a medicine for a third-world country?       Or maybe will we create an engineered organism that would allow to reduce carbon footprint worldwide?
By going through the many projects from the previous iGEM competitors we realized something: all those ideas were truly brilliant however, almost none of them could be implemented in the real world, and therefore could solve the problems mentioned above.       Why? Why can’t these works be used now that they have been developed?
Unfortunately, there is still a long way to go until synthetic engineered organisms could be used due to two main restrictions: the first one is the real risk related to the technology while the second is based on people’s beliefs and fears which are often more based on some propaganda than on facts.
As scientists, we are aware that the technology we are using and developing may be deviated from its original purpose or could be misused. Our aim is not to force people into thinking that synthetic biology may solve all our problems, we want people to have a real understanding of the many possibilities and innovations that can come with this field, both good and bad. Which lead us to the following statement:
How and why should the synthetic biology research take advantages of new digital trends for its popularization and for the education of citizens from all background?
Okay, there may be an issue… but how big is it?
In order to identify how close to reality our first impression was, we used Google Trends as an analytical tool for our investigations.       Using key words and research request archives from the famous searching engine, this tool generates time line graphs by representing the amount of request in which the given key word has been used on different period of time.       The reference used as 100 is the highest volume of request recorded for a defined keyword.       We first evaluated the use of the key word “Synthetic Biology"".
The largest volume of request including “Synthetic Biology” was reach in May 2010, which seems quite normal as headlines all over the world were dedicated to J.Craig Venter’s latest achievement, with attracting titles such as “and man created life”.       The normal amount of research therefore seems to be around ¼ of this highest performance.       About the geographical repartition of the volume of request, UK owns the first step of the podium, followed closely by the US and further by Canada, Germany, India, France and Japan.

Since this was now the second time that this happened, we are thinking that maybe the two epindorfs were mislabled. In order to check this, we will take some of each with our amplification primers and see which ones give PCR products. This hasn't been done yet, but will be done next week.  The plasmid backbones were cut from the gel and frozen in epindorfs, to be purified and phosphatase treated next week.   A colony PCR was done on the UV+pSB1C3 coloines 2, 4, and 6 using VF2 and VR primers and program 500. these were then purified and nanodropped. Colony 2: 63.9ng/uL, colony 4: 74.9ng/uL, and colony 6: 64.4ng/uL. A 1 in 30 dilution of each was made, 10uL of that taken, along with 2.5uL water, and 2.5uL 10uM primer to send out for sequencing by GeneWiz.
6/30/14:  Designed primers for various promoters and reporters found in the 2014 iGem plates.   I took 1uL of UV+pACYC184 and 1uL GFP+pBR322 and put each into 200uL of water. This was vortexed and then 20uL of it used for PCR. Each one was set up in two PCR tubes, one which got the pBR322 sequencing primers and one which got the pACYC184 sequencing primers. This was to check if the two epindorfs had been mislabeled. PCR program #130 was run, and then 5uL of product was run on a gel which showed that they had indeed been mislabeled. They were put into new epindorfs with the correct labels.  With that PCR program, I also did two colony PCRs of HSP+pACYC184 colonies 1 and 3. This was to send out for sequencing. We ran 5uL of the product on the gel, because last time we PCRed them, we got a lot of different bands, so we wanted to run it on a gel and gel purify the band that contained our desired piece. This time, again we saw a lot of bands, but I threw out the gel"

Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.
Bidirectional Promoters
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
Before we can make a protein, we need an mRNA to carry the information about the order of the amino acids.  But before we can make mRNA we need to know where the genes are in the DNA of a cell. Before RNA polymerase can  make a copy it needs to bind to the DNA. This is assisted by a variety of factors, other proteins, that look for  a specific sequence in the DNA. This sequence is called a promoter because it promotes the transcription of the  DNA into RNA by the RNA polymerase. These sequences are generally upstream, or ahead, of a gene's coding sequence.
The Problem
Not all promoters cause RNA polymerase to transcribe downstream in the expected ""forward direction"". Some promoters can cause RNA polymerase to go in the opposite direction from what is expected, or go in both directions. This is what we are trying to find out; do different promoters go in different directions, and what is the directional preference of different promoters.

To conclude，he is a  man with kindness，conscience and public spirits，and he dares to face any challenge and tries his best to overcame them uitimately.
2. Academic career
The present goal of Han is to become a researcher of Beijing Life Science Research Center.And he had already done researches in the labs of Jilin University for 2 years and a half as an exchange student of Joint training of Life Science College of Jilin University. During that time, he not only achieved many challenging academic studies, but also joined substantial practical activities. In Dec. 2011, he became a researcher of the Key Laboratory of Ministry of education Jilin University molecular enzyme engineering, and joined the ""Jilin University undergraduate innovation experiment research"" as a project leader. Then he studied in Zhang Zuoming’ project called Molecular cloning and characterization of cellulose CpCel9 and its mutants in Enzyme engineering 204 which then enriched his knowledge about Enzyme engineering. He is also a cure researcher of the academic department of the College of life science as well as the school committee of science and technology association propaganda department director who helped to hold ""Jilin University"" Challenge Cup ""Gold Award"", ""team six campus cup"" Impulse Cup ""campus marketing competition"" and ""Jilin University"" top ten students selection”. What’s more he also managed to hold the “meeting of exchange of learning in School of Biology”, “meeting of exchange of learning between Research and Undergraduates” and many other academic activities.
After his exchange experience, he went back to Shenyang Pharmaceutical University to continue to do other science researches. And he joined in the Lab of Xi Huanzhang to study Joint related technology transfer gene transfer method and the research of gene function, which grew his interest in Aminoglycoside antibiotics combinatorial biosynthesis related with microbial agents and synthetic biology research.

Mr Han told us that it is the movie"" there we were"" arouse his interest in Peking university and the school life there. Then he started going through lots of videos about there. By chance, he found the video about the iGEM team in Peking university. From then, the little seed was growing in his heart , which bring him the dream that one"

DNA Degradation Switch
Introduction
We aim to provide a novel chassis with improved bio-safety capabilities. This will take the form of a Maxicell - achromosomal E. coli - which is incapable of reproducing or of performing horizontal gene transfer. In order to prevent horizontal gene transfer we intend to take a two pronged approach; Semantic Containment will mean that other organisms should not be able to 'read' the DNA of the Maxicell if they should take it up and a DNA degrading killswitch will break up the Maxicell plasmid(s) after a given time span.
DNA Degradation Switch Concept
The implementation of our DNA degradation system requires 2 constructs:
Colicin E2 plasmid (pCol) -  Colicin E2 is a nicking endonuclease which acts without specificity to cut both single and double stranded DNA. This plasmid will contain Constitutive Anderson Promoter, RBS, Colicin E2 coding sequence and T1 Terminator.
Immunity Plasmid - Imm2 is the immunity protein for Colicin E2. Imm2 binds to Colicin E2 with high affinity and when present in equimolar concentration prevents its DNase activity. This plasmid will contain Constitutive Anderson Promoter, RBS, Imm2 Coding Sequence and T1 Terminator. In addition a site for the homing endonuclease I-SceI will be present that when cut turns off imm2 expression.
Prior to Maxicell formation our E. coli will be transformed with pImm, this will cause a build up of Imm2 within the cell. At this phase of the model only equations for Imm2 synthesis are evaluated.
Once Imm2 concentration has reached equilibrium the E. coli can then be transformed with pCol. Colicin E2 will be expressed within the cell however the build-up of Imm2 and its continued expression ensure it remains inactive. At this phase in the model all equations are evaluated.
In order to break up the chromosome of our E. coli and form Maxicells we have obtained a strain from the Leach Lab containing a number of I-Sce"

PROJECT DESIGN
Antibiotic discovery may continue to wane in the coming decades because antibiotics aimed for the easiest bacterial targets have already been developed. Considering that bacteria are unlikely to similarly slow in the development of resistance, decreased discovery could be disastrous, resulting in significantly more deaths caused by infectious disease. An alternative approach is needed.
Scientists have discovered a way to utilize CRISPR-Cas9, a system that allows direct modifications to an organism’s genome, to cut genes coding for antibiotic resistance in pathogens 1 . Used in conjunction with antibiotics, CRISPR could defeat resistant pathogens; however, effective in vivo delivery of the CRISPR system to pathogens has yet to be developed.
Northwestern iGEM has designed CRISPR Capsules to fill this gap. CRISPR Capsules would take advantage of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), a natural bacterial delivery system for proteins and nucleic acids 2 . This dual capability is crucial as the CRISPR system consists of Cas9, a protein capable of cutting DNA, and guide RNA (gRNA) which directs Cas9 to cut specific DNA sites. Two crucial steps toward realizing the vision of delivering CRISPR via OMV are:
Experimentally determining the most effective method for moving functional Cas9 from the cytoplasm of E. coli, where it is produced, to the periplasm of the same cell, where it must be located in order to become encapsulated in an OMV.
Demonstrating the efficacy of this method in generating OMVs containing functional Cas9 in a vesicle-overproducing strain of E. coli, a partial proof-of-concept in terms of the production of CRISPR Capsules.
Why Use Outer Membrane Vesicles?
Figure 1: Enterotoxic E. coli exhibiting induced vesiculation 4 .
Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli naturally release outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) when placed under environmental stress. These vesicles range between 20 and 250 nm in diameter 2 . A unique characteristic of OMV secretion is the ability of a bacterium to deliver a high concentration of proteins to a remote site 2 . NU iGEM has explored this property of Gram-negative bacteria to deliver Cas9 and gRNA"

Secretion control
In Gram-positive bacteria, proteins can be sorted to at least four different destinations: the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic membrane, the cell wall and the extracellular medium.
By far the largest number of translocated and membrane proteins in Gram-positive bacteria are predicted to follow the general protein secretion (Sec) pathway, which involves SecA, SecY, SecE, SecG and a number of accessory proteins.
Sec secretion system in the rod-shaped bacterium Bacillus subtilis have been shown to localise in spirals along the cytoplasmic membrane.
The Tat secretion system, which is used for the transport of folded proteins, probably localises in the cytoplasmic membrane and at the cell poles of B. subtilis.
B. subtilis contains two Oxa1p (acts as a general membrane insertion machinery for proteins) homologues that involved in membrane protein biogenesis and in protein secretion, namely SpoIIIJ and YqjG . Both proteins are randomly distributed throughout the membrane and are thus not enriched in the vicinity of the Sec machinery.

Caulobacter Crescentus Glue vs. Calcium Carbonate and Spider Silk
ULB-Brussels developed BioBricks for production of Caulobacter crescentus glue, and won the Best New BioBrick Part, Natural award in 2009. Caulobacter crescentus is a Gram-negative bacterium, and the parts are optimised for E. coli. Unclear whether they will work in B. subtilis.
Genes: hfsE, hfsF, hfsG, hfsH, (hfsC), hfsI, hfsD, (hfsA, hfsB).
The inner membrane HfsE protein initiates glycosyltransferase by transferring N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) from UDP−NAG to a lipid carrier. HfsG, a second glycosyltransferase protein, transfers NAG subunits to the growing polysaccharide chain. HfsH deacetylates one or more NAG residues. The HfsF protein translocates the polysaccharide chain linked to the lipid carrier across the inner membrane. The polymerases HfsC and HfsI proteins link the NAG repeat units together. The holdfast polysaccharide is transferred across the outer membrane by HfsA, HfsB and Hfs"

Design of the single parts
YcgZ promoter with multiple BluR (YcgE) operator sites
One of our approaches was to make use of the Blue light sensitive protein BluF (YcgF) which is activation upon blue light radiation, then dimerizes and inactivates BluR (YcgE), a transcriptional repressor which binds to the YcgZ promoter. We cloned the lacZ downstream to the YcgZ promoter and tested the beta-galactosidase activity making use of the Miller Assay. As we could not see"

Thus, long exposure times might be necessary for the circuit to react to the light, which would be undesirable for drawing with a laser pointer. We may have to search for mutations that stabilize the light state, and thus allow LovTAP to remain in the light state for a longer time after being activated.

Peking Bi-stable Switch
Overview
The Peking 2007 iGEM team designed a genetic switch that can be flipped between two stable states (on and off), a so-called bi-stable switch. Such a switch would be desirable in the Etch-a-Sketch circuit because it would allow the bacteria to “remember” if it had been exposed to light, so that only a short exposure to light would be necessary to draw on our bacteria (rather than keeping the light on the bacteria until color appeared).
However, the switch design was not ideal because one state was not completely stable; once the switch was flipped on, it slowly decayed back to the off state. We would like our drawings to be permanent (to some degree), so we would need the activated state to be stable. We therefore redesigned the Peking bi-stable switch for this purpose.
Original Design
The Peking 2007 switch uses the pR and pRM promoters and the cI and cI434 transcriptional regulatory proteins. The cI protein activates pRM and represses pR; cI434 represses pRM; pR has high basal transcription; and pRM has low basal transcription.
Deactivated State
Figure 6.
 
In the first state, cI434 levels are high and cI levels are low. This leads to high transcription from pR and low transcription from pRM, which, in this particular circuit, results in GFP production. The switch can be flipped by increasing cI levels.
 
Activated State
Figure 7.
 
In the second state, cI levels are high and cI434 levels are low. This leads to high transcription from pR and low transcription from pRM, and therefore RFP is produced. Empirical evidence shows the switch will spontaneously decay back to the deactivated state. This is probably due to the high basal transcription levels of pR.
 
 
Our Design: Locking Switch
For our switch, we desired a simple circuit with a stable on state. The parts we used are ptrpL, cI434,"

Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli
SCU_China
      Nowadays, insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders are increasingly plaguing                                     individuals' daily life. The circadian rhythm in human is predominantly under the                                     regulation of melatonin, a hormone produced by pineal gland periodically in                                     accordance with day-and-night photoperiod. This year we wanted to use engineered E.coli to mimic this process in human as a promising dosing machine. We proposed to construct the melatonin biosynthesis pathway in E.coli to produce melatonin, and                                     simultaneously couple this process with optimized repressilator, a synthetic genetic                                     oscillator with higher precision and stability, to magnify the function of repressilator and render melatonin production resemble mammalian periodicity in E.coli.
1. Our human practices were integrated to the whole process, which made us                                         complete                                         the project better.
2. We improved two previous part BBa_I13521 and BBa_E2050 and our BioBrick work                                         well                                         in lab condition.
3. Our experimental design based on modelling results, such as the optimal                                         proportioning of synthetase.
4. Engineered E.coli is cultured with artificial gastrointestinal juices and gut                                         flora to validate the substantial integration and survival condition based on                                         the                                         consideration for better safety and higher efficiency.
1. There are 4 new BioBrick parts in our project as follow, BBa_K2276001,                                         BBa_K2276003, BBa_K2276004 and BBa_K2206005.
2. We collaborated with SCU-WestChina and SiCAU-China in experiments and human                                         practice, received key assists from Peking University and offered wiki design                                         suggestions to team Purdue.
3. We consulted experts of China Food and Drug Administration and West China                                         Sleeping Centre for both experimental designs and safety problems. Also, we                                         collected and analyzed convincing datas from our survey.
1. We constructed a team successfully, sharing not only academic knowledge but                                        "

The team researched tiresomely throughout the day to ensure a foundation for the project and it’s experiments were set for the coming weeks.
Meetings started with various lecturers in order to start planning the first outreach event.
More research!
Told last night after going to see X-men that we need to have a poster completed and ready for use by Friday. Spent the day writing poster drafts and designing the layout, as well as attempting to copy the logo we designed onto the computer. We also updated the Wiki and gave it a new navigation bar, and looked into flight and hotel prices for Amsterdam!
Spent the day preparing for a brief presentation to the staff of the JIC so that we could prove we've actually done something! Researched more deeply into possible methods of ensuring light production only in the dark. We decided finally on three model organisms, Moss, Algae and E. coli, and divided the team into three sub-teams to work semi-independently on each project. Ben, Gurdeep and Mark are on team E.coli, Kimberley, Mario and Jazz are on team algae and finally Alistair, Ben Hardy and Abbie are on team moss.

In the meantime, we took forms of posters publicity and leaflets distribution to exert more profound and durable influence on the masses; we interviewed passersby to directly learn about the level of people’s understanding of synthetic biology and change their wrong views. In order to increase the scope of publicity and improve the credibility of the results of the interviews, our footsteps are around every corner in Chengdu. As the communities we interviewed are shown in the picture following.
Fig.3.The places we interviewed.
In addition to conducting interviews and introductions, we had to do focused and targeted propaganda. As we believed that students in primary and middle school are the most people in need to receive some basic education about biology and synthetic biology we paid attention to holding the lecture and activity to arouse their interest in science. In the lecture, we showed synthetic biology and iGEM with stories and videos to more than 200 students in Puyang Junior High School. We built plasmids with functions we wanted together.
As we all know, putting theory into practice is very important. Students in Grades 6 and 7 accompanied by their parents took part in our activity, “To Be Scientist Tomorrow”. We led them to do a little experiment that extracting DNA from banana, but all equipment was used in our daily life (such as dishwashing, storage bags, etc.). All of the kids successfully accomplished the lab driven by interest.

STEP 02, Edutainment
For many people, biology is a subject that they are unfamiliar with. In society, People lack the mediums to contact with biology. Biology is separate from ordinary people’s life. We decided to adopt a more acceptable way to make more people touch it directly. So, we combined the conceptions of biology with the well-known game-2048.
Fig.5.The attitude of people to learn biology.
We created a new mobile phone game called Bio2048, which encouraged people to learn more about biology in an entertaining way. Not only did we put it onto the Tencent Application of Treasure for ordinary people to download and play, but also pushed its information in our sina microblog and Qzone to collect feedback. Combining it with the education of biology, we aroused students’ interests of study.

PART Two, hospice care: to cure and to care
(1)what is hospice care
Definition
Hospice care or hospice is a type of care and philosophy of care that focuses on the palliation of a chronically ill, terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. It often gives up the pursuit of aggressive treatment and focus on the feeling of the patients.
History
In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century which means a place of concentrative areas for the sick, injuries, or dying, as well as those for travellers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice care which not only includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes was pioneered in the 1950s by Dame Cicely Saunders.
There was no hospice care service in China until 1988 that the first modern free-standing hospice opened in Shanghai. Nowadays, there are hospitals or organizations providing hospice service in many cities in China.
Status quo
hospice care is quite controversy in China nowadays. Although there are voices calling for better hospice service and there is growing need of it as the society ages ,few people in China have a proper awareness about hospice care. There is such little information of that and the taboo of death still exists. Many people find it unacceptable to give up aggressive treatment of their lover which is often painful but might extend the life of the patients and let them “wait to die”. Also, many people can’t accept a hospice that is “full of dying people” appear near where they live and work because it means “bad luck” according to Chinese customs. What’s more, hospice care is still uncovered by social insurance system in China which means patients have to pay for the care themselves. There is lack of hospital beds in public hospitals and it causes more than 1000 yuan per day in private hospitals. There is still a long way to"

DNA Concentration Determines Phage Titer
Bacteriophage Titers Correlate With DNA Concentration
To prove the influence of the DNA concentration on the bacteriophage titer, cell extract reactions were prepared with varying T4 DNA concentrations. The bacteriophage production was performed. The titer of the bacteriophages was measured with the top agar method and the formed plaques were counted. The increase in DNA concentration results in an increase in the bacteriophage concentration. This increase is nonlinear as our model predicted. This finding is probably due to a critical concentration of phage proteins, which have to be reached for capsid head assembly (similar to a critical micelle concentration).
Assembly of the T4 phage depending on the DNA concentration.
Assembly of the T7 phage depending on the DNA concentration.
Cell-Free Systems Replicate Phage Genomes
The DNA sequence added to the cell-free system serves as the template for the required phage. We saw, that DNA-Polymerases can amplify the DNA segment, multiplying the amount of DNA in the cell-free reaction. 4
To assess this effect and its dependence on deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), we performed an absolute quantification of T7 DNA in the cell-free reaction by quantitative PCR (qPCR). A standard curve with a serial dilution of T7 DNA. We used the TXTL qPCR protocol (add link).   We used two selected cell extracts (P15 and E10), which reached similar phage titers"

Bba_K1334002 (HxlR+P-formaldehyde) Induction
To design a formaldehyde sensor, initially Bba_K1334002 part, registered by iGEM14_WHU-China team in 2014, is tested. We tried induction with 0.5 mM and 1 mM formaldehyde and uninduced by using three biological replicas.
Figure 1 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 16 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. Voc: formaldehyde.
The overnight measurement indicates that the error bars are almost equal or more than the fold change of the each induction. This inconsistency can also be seen from the uninduced and 0.5 mM bars. Uninduced bar is almost 5 times more than the induced one. In conclusion, induction of the part Bba_K1334002 with formaldehyde is inconsistent which prompts us to improve this part.
HxlR/pFor Sensor Gradient aTc Induction
In order to control the expression level of HxlR protein, gradient aTc concentrations are utilized since HxlR gene expression is regulated by the promoter pL(tetO) within the HxlR/pFor sensor. Thus, HxlR protein is produced upon the addition of aTc and the amount of HxlR protein produced is positively correlated with the aTc concentration.
Figure 2 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 2 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. “(-)” denotes no addition of formaldehyde and “(+)” denotes 1 mM formaldehyde addition.

There are some practicalities in getting hold of RF emitters but they should be available from the communications group in engineering.
Random Number Generator ( Slides ) - First method to use inteins/exteins (self-excising proteins). There is very little data on the probability of a protein excising and they are thought to be highly efficient. For this reason the method has been dropped. Second approach was to create an area of DNA that would naturally mutate at a high rate. This again was dropped, however, due to problems is getting a high probability of mutation and the issues in how to use the result for further processes. The final approach was to use 2 reporters on a single plasmid with an RNA polymerase transcription site which could initiate in either direction in the middle of the reporters. This should give a 50/50 chance of either reporter being produced which then will repress the other reporter. This should ensure a single steady state is reached eventually. It would also be possible to chain plasmids to create random outputs of a larger length. The difficulty is in designing the plasmid such that events take similar time to complete such that no bias is present.
GRN Interaction ( Slides ) - This would be a project along similar lines to the Ljubljana team. Research was carried out on possible areas in biology that could be optimised, however, a great deal of area specific knowledge would need to be known to find such cases. Also, many of the diseases present today are due to single point mutations where GRN interaction is probably not the most effective form of cure. Instead, one possible direction is looking at ways that GRNs could be used to replace drugs. They can be made more specific which would hopefully reduce side-effects and allowed for a much more finally controlled process than currently possible. Another possible direction would be an anti-virus tool for cells. Using influences form computer networking where routing nodes slow down there transmission rate when they think they may be infected, a similar principle could be used in cells. A general indicator for inflection would need to be found such that on being sensed, metabolism could be slowed down to give the immune system a greater length of time to find and neutralise the cell. There are many outstanding questions, however, as this would require working with mammalian cells and with complex pathways.
Co-operative Movement ( Slides ) - This would be attempting to use co-operation in a bacterial population to perform a task none could on their own. In this case moving particles larger than"

The “1J1U.pdb”-file contains the tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase, which is labeld under “Chain A”, the orthogonol tRNA under “Chain B”         and the natural ligand tyrosyl. For our project, we deleted the natural ligand and “Chain B”, because it was not necessary to         change their structure or sequence and it was a way to save compute time.        We designed the ligands manually via Avogadro based on a default matching algorithm for both        amino acids, thus creating useful .cst-files.
Design Step
The design step applies an algorithm such that the binding pocket and the near environment are mutated and the remaining scaffold is         repacked. Additionally, a badness-of-fit score is generated which indicates how well the mutation fits the amino acid. For every file from the          matching step, a model with a score and a “.pdb-file” was generated, specifying where the sequence can be located. Additionally, the "".pdb-file""         makes visual analysis of the 3D-structure possible. Notably, the amino acid structure can be extracted separately.        The following section describes the structure of the design step. Further details on each step can be obtaind by showing the Technical Details Section. 1. Optimizing the catalytic interactions For the first alternative, the file can be generated either by the Rosetta standard or a manually created .”res”- file. For more details, we refer to the Rosetta documentation . For the latter alternative, residues are automatically categorized by their location of the Cα;lpha;. SHOW TECHNICAL DETAILS
Residues are catagorized as follows:
residues that have their Cα within a distance cut1 angstroms of any ligand heavyatom will be set to designable
res that have Cα within a distance cut2 of any ligand heavyatom and the Cβ closer to that ligand atom than the Calpha will be set to designable. cut2 has to be larger than cut1

In our simulation of metabolism with and without phase separation, we inevitably need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in our pathway to produce β-carotene. Only if we have relatively accurate enzyme kinetic data, can we make tenable predictions based on our models.

Summit meeting of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition at Nankai University
On July 6th, we gladly accepted the invitation from NKU_CHINA and took part in the summit meeting of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition hosted by NKU_CHINA in Tianjin with eight other universities.
While it was just the beginning of summer vacation and most teams did not have many experimental results yet, we exchanged our ideas about the total design, modelling and human practice. A short afternoon as it may be, we nevertheless obtained valuable ideas on polishing the slides, taking more variables into consideration and optimizing the experimental design.
We were a little nervous when we made the presentation, partly because it was the first time for us to do it. However, we learned that practice makes perfect and the better acquainted we became with our system, the more confident we will be. Since then, we worked ever harder and gradually had our own taste of doing scientific research.

friday 25/7
We ran a PCR on PCR1,2,3 and part A, B, C & BC to check if they had the correct lenghts.
After running a gel, the bands were blurry so the PCR was repeated, only this time using a Tm=51 degrees, and for parts with a length of 1000 bp or fewer got at step 4 15 sec. and parts over 1000 bp got 30 sec.
After running a gel, it was indicated that PCR2,"

1 Overview
1.1 Microfluidics
1.2 Audible Sound Experiment
Overview
In the whole experiment, we tested one mechanosensitive channel, Piezo1, with different mechanical forces using various devices. Surprisingly, there seems to be the interdependences and associations among these results.
Microfluidics
Different magnitude orders of shear force fields were generated in microfluidic channels controlled by the pumped-inflow rate. We quantify the cell responses in different levels of shear stress.
1. The fluorescence intensity emitted by Piezo1+R-GECO cells was much higher than the R-GECO cells after applying shear force. It reflected the Piezo1’s role of sensing mechanical force.
2. Wave patterns shows divergence between the Piezo1+R-GECO cell group and R-GECO cell group. The response of R-GECO is directly associated with the accumulation of Ca2+ in cytoplasm, with a steep increase ascend and a decline by degrees( see Fig.1b). The response level of cells with MS channel Piezo1 shows oscillation and a feed back, with a doublet peek in each response period( Fig.1 a).
3. Comparing the fluorescence intensity amplitudes corresponded to the shear stress ranged from 0 Pa to 5 Pa, we found a best response at around 0.01-0.1 Pa.
4. No response has been observed when the shear stress is larger than 2 Pa.
Fig. 1 The activation level of Piezo1+R-GECO cells(a), R-GECO(b) cells, and Piezo1(not induced)+R-GECO cells(c) when the pumped rate is 50μL/min from 10s to 120s.
Fig. 2 (a)When the pumped rate is 6.25μL/min from 10s to 120s and 190s to 240s, the activation levels increase with the shear stress increases (0.0Pa, 0.03Pa, 0.27Pa ). (b)When the"
