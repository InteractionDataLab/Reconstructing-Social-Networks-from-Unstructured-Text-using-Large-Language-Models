In-Depth Results
Experiment One: Is iLOV fluorescent when expressed in E. coli?
Figure 4
The fluorescence of WT-cultures, as well as cultures expressing GFP and iLOV. The fluorescence of iLOV (at excitation = 440 nm, emission = 520 nm) reaches a 4400 at 20h, while WT-Top10 cultures at 20h have a fluorescence of 880.
Figure 4 shows the fluorescence of iLOV in E. coli can clearly be seen in this experiment. There is clearly a huge increase in fluorescence compared to WT-Top10. It can also be seen that under regular conditions maximal iLOV fluorescence is reached between 20-25 hours. This information was used when selecting a time point for the comparison of fluorescence to optical density. The relative fluorescence of GFP and iLOV are not comparable in this experiment as they are under the control of different promoters, although it is suspected that the fluorescence of GFP is greater.
Experiment Two: Are our promoters functional with and/or without TNT?
Figure 5
Figure 5 shows the fluorescence of each cell culture in comparison to its optical density. As the concentration of TNT increases the Flu:OD of 004-Top10 stays fairly consistent, varying between 900 and 1120, while the Flu:OD of 007-Top10 increases as TNT concentration increases, from 380 at 0ul to 1020 at 10ul. The values for fluorescence and optical density were taken at 24 h.
Figure 6
Figure 6 shows the Flu:OD of each culture at each level of TNT in comparison to the Flu:OD at TNT = 0ul. This figure makes it clear that 007 increases in relative fluorescence as TNT concentration increases; eventually reaching 2.7x its original value. The values for fluorescence and optical density were taken at 24 h.
As shown in ""E. coli’s response to Xenobiotic Compounds” cell growth decreases in response to increasing concentrations of TNT. As cell growth decreases protein expression also decreases, proportionally. Therefore it is difficult to associate an increased promoter response with an increased level of TNT. The easiest way to show this data is to present fluorescence relative to the optical density of the culture, which is roughly proportional to growth.
The expression of 004 remains fairly constant relative to growth, while 007 increases in relative activity as the concentration of TNT increases, indicating that it is responding to the increased levels.
004 appears to be a general constitutive promoter, but 007"

DNA binding domains -  which one to choose?
Arrangement of different functional proteins on DNA molecule is required for implementation of our ideas. Because enzymes and other functional polypeptides usually do not have specific affinity for DNA molecule, we decided to fuse them with specific DNA binding domains. These DNA binding domains should have strong affinity for DNA molecule, but interaction should also be sequence specific. Several classes of DNA binding proteins exist in nature, e.g. zinc finger family of proteins, TAL effectors, different transcription factors (TetR, CI, Gal4, ToxR, CinR, RhlR, LuxR) and endo/exonucleases with wrecked cutting activity. Unfortunately, most of them proved to be unusable due to multimerization nature, low affinity and low sequence specificity. Zinc fingers and TAL effectors were on the top of our list since the beginning, because they are modular in nature and can be programed into practically unlimited number of different sequence specific DNA binding domains.
TAL effectors
TAL family of proteins consists of transcription activator like effectors from plant pathogenic bacteria of Xanthomonas spp. TAL effectors are proteins that are secreted into eukaryotic cells by type III secretion system. In host, they are translocated to the nucleus where they modulate transcription of different genes. TAL protein consists of signal N-terminal, C-terminal domain with transcription activator activity and central region of tandem repeats. It was shown that hypervariable pair of amino acids in every tandem repeat of TAL protein defines its binding properties (Boch et al., 2009). As such TAL proteins can be programed to bind any desired nucleotide sequence.
Our aim was to design synthetic TAL DNA-binding proteins and use them in our project. As described in literature, designing of TAL proteins with specificity to any given nucleotide sequence should be an easy task (Boch et al., 2009). Central region of TAL protein generally consists of 10 – 18 highly similar tandem repeats. Each repeat is"

9:02: Team 3 explains the situation. We are keeping the toggle switch as a backup but we will also be trying to make a histamine receptor. We explain the Hellinga paper.
9:12: Gary likes the idea because it opens a new area for the team, adds more to the project, and our scientific approach is good. Do we have a plan B? We need to plan another backup.
9:17: Adrian’s concerns: How are we going to put the sequence from the computer into the cell? How are we going to assay the binding affinity of these mutants?
9:19: Ashley expresses our concern that we have no idea how to start. Gary says we can get the ribose sensor and associate that with the reporting pathway. For the computing part, ask experts. We can ask Washington State to send us the chimeric protein.
9:24: Diana suggests mutagenesis v. synthesizing. But lets just wait to see what the computer spits out. She is concerned downstream as to how we are going to test this. Mutagenesis technology? Gary says its just a small hurdle.
9:28: Team 2 reports. We got our S. epidermidis. Hopefully primers will arrive today to PCR the quorum sensing genes.
9:29: How do you find the promoter sequences on NCBI? Gary suggests looking at the original paper for a sequence that it minimally required for the promoter. “It may just be the nature of the beast” – Gary. Adrian has an answer: Ecocyc.org is a giant database for promoters.

Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis for all the model                         parameters. First and total order sensitivity indices is displayed for                         every parameter, as well as their confidence intervals.
Thus, we see that First-order indices have too low values, which we                     expected because of the complexity of the model. This shows, that each                     parameter alone does not affect the result. However, summarizing first and                     higher order interactions in Total-order indices, we observe the overall                     sensitivity of the model in changing each parameter. Parameter values                     ​​with a small Total-order index can be considered as constant at any value                     within the range given to them without affecting the output variance. As                     can be seen, the variables that most affect output, with Total-order                     indices above 0.2 is the degradation of sfGFP, dG followed by the binding                     rate kon, aT, bT and bG. The high influence of degradation on sfGFP is due                     to the direct relationship to output of about 0.8 with confidence interval                     (0.17).
Bibliography based estimation
Transcription and translation rates
Transcription and translation rates of TALE and sfGFP were                                 calculated by using the average transcription rate of 45 nt / s                                 and an average translation rate of 15 aa / s, respectively [7].                                 Also, the RBS Calculator from Salis Lab [7] was used and the                                 translation rates of mRNA in the system were also estimated. To                                 obtain the mRNA translation rate from each sequence, we had to                                 calculate the ratio as described by                                 [6], based on total Gibbs                                 free energy between the ribosome and mRNA. In order to find the                                 translation rate of sfGFP, we found its bibliographic rate and                                 based on it and the corresponding sequence, in relationship                                 with our’s, starting at another codon the fold-change was                                 calculated between them and hence the rate.
In order to approximate the translation rate, we put weight in                                 both the RBS calculator results and the bibliography, which                                 provided the average translation rate of sequences with only                                 criterion, it’s length. In order to include both translation rates from the two approaches, we used a weight function with a                                 weight factor for each.

Collaborations
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. With characterization of the production strain Vibrio natriegens we participated in an InterLab study and supported iGEM Team Marburg . Additionally, we recieved BioBricks from iGEM Team TU Darmstadt . Besides providing us the BioBricks, they gave us useful information about how to produce chitosan.
Vibrigens InterLab Study
Introduction
The iGEM Team in Marburg is focussing on a new potential host for synthetic biology: Vibrio natriegens. V. natriegens can reach higher maximum specific growth rates than the current standard organism Escherichia coli. For the collaboration study our team performed the InterLab Study Vibrigens. This method ensures reproducibility of the experiments in different laboratories. The procedure of this experiment is comparable with the iGEM InterLab Study.
The aim of the experiment was measuring fluorescence and OD600 of V. natriegens cells transformed with different devices.
Results and Discussion
First, electrocompetent V. natriegens cells were prepared, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. The competent cells were used for transformation of six different devices, additionally one positive and one negative control (table 1).
Table 1: Devices and corresponding Part Number used in the experiment.
First colonies on the plates appeared 7 to 8 hours after plating. For further measurements two transformed colonies of each device were picked and inoculated for overnight culture.  The next day, OD600 was measured. The cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 and incubated for another 3 hours. Samples were taken at 0 and 3 hours. OD600 (figure 1) and fluorescence (figure 2) were measured afterwards. All measurements were performed with BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader with a 96-well black flat bottom plate with clear bottom.

She talked to us and offered us some fruit and even play jokes to us. She told us she only had a sister as her family, and now her sister was also quite old and had her own family, so granny didn’t want to bother her sister too much. Since her sister couldn’t visit her too often she always felt lonely in the hospital so she was very glad to have volunteers like us to visit her and talk to her. She said she will look forward to our visit . The nice meeting had to come to an end as the nice granny didn’t feel well with her leg. The granny made us feel that we were needed and what we did was meaningful. We decided to come and visit the nice granny more often, hoping bring her happiness and peace at the end of her life.
Sixthly we couraged our school to set up a volunteers team for hospice care.
While we were working in the hospital as hospice care volunteers we seldom see the families of the patients come to visit them. Even some people didn’t visit until the death of the patients. So many patients were lonely and suffered because of their illness. This wasn’t the aim of hospice care, and it can’t give the patients relief and peace of mind which hospice care promise to give them . So we need more people to devote themselves to this good cause and show their kindness and care to the patients, letting them pass away with less suffer, both physically and mentally. During the interview with Dr Xie we learnt that many universities have had their own team for hospice volunteer. School of Bioscience and Bioengineering of SCUT has a volunteer team which has a regular project in Guangdong Science Centre. But as biological major students we want something more connected with our specialty. So we want to set up a team for hospice care volunteering. We wrote a plan and discussed with our teachers. Finally we gained the approval of our school. Then we could start to recruit our volunteers.
Finally we recruited hospice volunteers in our school.
As what I’ve mentioned above, hospice volunteer is so special that it require well training. So we wanted to invite Dr Xie to come to our school to give a lecture about hospice volunteering. The application to invite an outside-school professor to hold a lecture in our school was complicated.We discussed with different teachers, telling them the necessity of this lecture to our volunteer team. With our effort, we finally gain the approval from school for the lecture. Then we began our preparation for recruiting volunteers and hold"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

When these two parts neturalize after diffusion, the concentration of H+ decreases rapidly.

Part 2 The Aggregation Circuit of Quorum-sensing
Basic Concepts and the Aggregation Circuit
The ODE formalism models the concentrations of RNAs, proteins, and other molecules by time-dependent variables with values contained in the set of nonnegative real numbers. Regulatory interactions take the form of functional and differential relations between the concentration variables.  The regulatory network:

Equations and Parameters
Based on the fundamental assumptions above, we use ODEs to stimulate the circuit above. Taking both time and space into account, we can get all the equations as followed: (r represents the radical distance of one point in this environment from the pole.)  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[H^+]}{dt}=\frac{\delta C(r,t)}{\delta t} \end{equation}  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[r_1]}{dt}=\frac{m_1}{1+\left(\frac{[H^+]}{K_1}\right)^n}-\gamma[r_1] \end{equation}  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[LuxI]}{dt}=k[r_1]\delta_1[LuxI] \end{equation}  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[AHL]}{dt}=\frac{V_1[LuxI]}{K_2+[LuxI]}-k_1[LuxR][AHL]-\delta _2[AHL] \end{equation}  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[LuxR]}{dt}=k[r_1]-k_1[LuxR][AHL]-\delta_3[LuxR] \end{equation}  \begin{equation}     \frac{d[A]}{dt}=k_1[LuxR][AHL]-\frac{m_2}{1+\left(\frac{[A]}{K_3}\right)^n}-\delta_4[A] \end{"

In this expression, D is the diffusion coefficient and dc/dx is the slope of the molar concentration. We can obtain NO's diffusion coefficient in water either by experiments or by calculations. Finally we choose to do the calculations.
For dilute non-electrolyte A, its diffusion coefficient in solvent B (also called the infinite-dilute diffusion coefficient) can be estimated by Wilke-Chang equation:$${D}_{AB}=7.4\times {10}^{-15}\frac{{(\Phi {M}_{B})}^{T}T}{\mu {{V}_{A}}^{0.6}}\mathrm{{m}^{2}/s}$$
In the equation,
DAB — The inter-diffusion coefficient in an infinitely-dilute solution, m2/s.
T — The temperature of the solution, K. In our case, it is 0.5.
μ — The viscosity of B, Pa·s.
MB — The molar mass of B, kg/mol.
Φ — The parameter of association of solvent. (Introduction of the association parameter into the formula is brought about by the fact that associated molecules behave like large-size molecules and diffuse at a lower rate; the degree of association varying with mixture composition and with molecule types. Therefore, Wilke and Chang presented the values for most widespread solvents: for water φ=2.6; methanol, 1.9; ethanol, 1.5; benzene, ester, heptane and non-associated solvents, 1.)
VA — The molar volume of solute A at a boiling point under normal conditions, cm3. It can be estimated by Tyn-Calus Method: V=0.285V1.048, while Vc is the critical volume of a substance and measures 57.7 for NO.

Figure 3. NO concentration distribution with time around the wound.
The six pictures demonstrate the NO concentration distribution with time (with the 1 s interval) around the wound caused by IBD. The concentration is shown along the Z-axis (unit: D). The intestinal lies along the X-axis (unit: 5 mm, Y-axis the same) with intestinal walls surrounding it.  To simplify the situation, we assume that the dissipative NO molecules gathered altogether as a dot at time 0 which is located on the lower part of the intestinal walls, and the walls consume all the NO"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

In the last method, we have used UV-sterilization to sterilize biolenses. It appears that the cells do not grow after the UV-sterilization and therefore it is useful to sterilize the biolenses. The cells were not viable after the treatment, while the shape remained intact. However, it appeared to be important that the surface that is exposed to the UV-radiation, is relatively large compared to the volume. Otherwise not all the cells are sufficiently irradiated. Since for most potential applications a microlens array is required, where the surface/volume ratio is extremely high, this is considered not to be a problem.
Another advantage of UV sterilization is the fact that the UV lamps are, compared to other sterilization devices, relatively inexpensive. Furthermore, UV lamps may be found in lightweight models that are highly portable, hence convenient to use. All in all, UV-sterilization is particularly suitable for the sterilization of the biolenses.
Comparison
In this section we have discussed three different possibilities to sterilize the biolenses. The methods were compared on multiple aspects. Table 1 summarizes the results of this comparison.

Based on the table it appears that the biolenses are most sufficient sterilized when the autoclave is used. However, since the shape of the microlenses does not remain, this is not considered to be an option. A growth study has shown that the cells normally do not survive with a polysilicate layer. Therefore, this would be the most optimal sterilization method, because no extra materials, proceedings or time is required. However, as described before, there are multiple possible scenarios in which the micro-organisms could survive. More research is required in the chance of survival of the micro-organisms before we would advise this type of sterilization. In"

We compare the expression dynamics of Cre in either case at different level of input signal $x$. This comparison reveals that the riboregulator ensures lower leakage but doesn't affect the expression at a high input level. We also design experiments to validate the model, the results are consistent with this model.

Figure 2. Experimental result.
3.2 The mutated Cre/loxP system determines the inversion direction
Secondly, once the engineered cells receive a sure signal, they will process information as we designed but not the other way around. So we must ensure the direction of the DNA invertion. In other words, the site-specific recombination can be regarded as a unidirectional one. To this end, we choose Cre recombinase and a pair of mutant lox sites, lox66 and lox71 to rearrange DNA sequence. Here, we explain why the forward reaction rate is higher than the reverse one. The mutant site will have a lower affinity for Cre. The binding event mainly depends on the rate of  free diffusion, but the dissociation rate will be high if the binding strength is weak. According to the equation \begin{equation} r_c(2Cre\cdot lox)=\frac{k_8k_9\cdot [lox]\cdot [Cre]^2}{k_{-8}k_{-9}+k_9k_{-9}\cdot [Cre]}, \end{equation} we know that the second dissociation event is more significant than the first one. So mutant lox site like lox66 and lox71 can choose a wise way to benefit the formation of dimer. Here we assume that lox66 and lox71 will have higher $k_{-8}$. However, double mutant loxP site like lox72 will have high dissociation rate at both steps. For simplicity, we assume that the affected dissociation rate is $\epsilon$ ($\epsilon>1$) times the original one.
After binding event, the two loxP-bound dimers associate to form a tetramer, and recombination proceeds via a Holiday Junction intermediate. Therefore, we can compare $r_c("

1 Downstream promoter selection
1.1 Method
Downstream promoter selection
Since we constructed first two plasmids contain selected promoters for AWA and AWB, downstream neurons also need promoters to express indicator to discover the neuron circuit being built, which means the new circuit is built for the new behaviour of C.eegans. The purpose of this model is to select promoters used in downstream neurons which have greatest possibility to be lighted on when AWA and AWB are actived.
Firstly, we assume that the strength of a connection is positively correlated with the number of synapses, including synaptic outputs from any group of presynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the total synaptic outputs of the presynaptic neurons and synaptic inputs to any group of postsynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the synaptic inputs of the postsynaptic neurons.
Depend on this assumption, we need to find downstream promoters which can lead to expressing of indicator in several neurons. Meanwhile, there should have some distance between these neurons for us to distinguish each of them under microscope. What’s more, it is better that these neurons may have some relationship in our pathway according to papers.
Method

2. Make a table recording the neurons that cannot use same promoter for they are close to each other. Data source:

Introducing new students to synthetic biology
To approach the next generation of chemical biologists, we presented about iGEM on the matchings-days of the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e). Therefore we prepared a talk about first of all synthetic biology, but also about what the iGEM-competition encompasses. We presented several projects that have been done in the iGEM-competition the last couple of years (Groningen 2012, Münich 2013 and Wageningen 2014). Also we introduced them to last year’s project of the TU/e and described to them how we will take this project as a starting point for our own project.
Ethics forms an important aspect of our project and therefore we encouraged the students to take part in a discussion about the use of GMOs in the human body. Therefore we posed them several questions, for example: ‘Should it be possible to tamper life, with the help of synthetic biology?’, ‘Would you like to have a GMO in your body, if it’s for a good purpose?’ and ‘Would you mind if a GMO gets into the environment?’. The students had to respond to these questions with red or green cards. After every question we asked if they could argue their choice and discussed these arguments with each other.
The days were successful and it was nice to hear the ideas and arguments from future students."

Note there’s just one LED - if you solder both the optical density and fluorescence LEDs seperately and use pin headers you can very quickly swap between them.
If you want to be able to switch quickly (and for increased durability) you could implement a toggle switch into the design. We decided against this due to the added cost, however the if you want to do this click here to view the circuit diagram.

In the cuvette holder the LEDs should be laid out as they were in the Aachen design; the fluorescence LED in the bottom, the optical density LED on one side and the light sensor opposite the optical density LED.
Once it’s all soldered, you’ll need to upload the code to the Digispark (you can actually do this before you solder, it doesn’t matter when). Follow the instructions on the Digistump wiki to get set up. We didn’t write them here too as it’s likely to go out of date quickly. In the unlikely event that the wiki does go down, we’ve made a save on the Wayback Machine here .
Do make sure you follow the steps exactly, don’t just skim them and assume it’ll be alright! Although Digisparks are generally pretty hardy, messing up could still fry them, making it harder to troubleshoot and wasting your time and money.
Once you’ve got your environment set up, simply copy our code into the Arduino window, click upload and plug in the Digispark when prompted. It’s just a one time set up, if you’re uploading to multiple chips at once it’s very quick - just repeat the upload step for each Digispark.
Now you should be able to use it on any device. Simply open the hardware interpreter page on your computer, laptop or phone and plug the Digispark in. It will take at least 5 seconds to start - up to 15 seconds on some devices.
Some devices might require adapters to connect to the Digispark, especially phones and tablets. If you’re not sure where to start, try searching for an 'OTG' (on the go) female USB adapter for the port"

Collaboration
with University of Freiburg, Germany
Introduction
As our team aims to mutate the antibody genes specifically and team Freiburg standardizes the TAL proteins that bind DNA specifically, we thought it would be a great idea to combine our efforts.
We are helping the University Freiburg team to test their Transactivator-like (TAL) proteins by sending one of our modified AID enzymes for ligation to the TAL domain. Team Freiburg, on the other hand, plans to send us back the TAL sequence ligated to the AID. Afterwards, we intend to check the mutation rate of the antibody sequence after directing the AID specifically (with help of TAL protein) to it. A TAL domain is a DNA-binding protein which can bind specifically to a 14 base pair long target DNA sequence. In case of our project, this sequence is located close to the CDR3 region (framework) of the antibody fragment and enables binding of the TAL protein to our construct. Due to the conservation of this region in antibodies, the TAL protein created by team Freiburg should bind to common antibody sequences. By linking the N-terminus of the AID to the TAL domain by a glycine-serine linker the enzyme AID can easily be brought in close proximity to the sequence that needs to be mutated. In this way we plan to obtain a more targeted directing of the enzyme and a higher mutation rate. Having ligated the TAL protein sequence with AID sequence in one ORF, together we are creating AID protein that specifically binds to the antibody sequence and enables to mutate it.

The treated upper and lower slides were assembled face to face, and the slides were separated                             by                             Mylar polyester sheets (intermediate open convex cavity), and the other three sides were                             fixed                             with small clips except for the opening direction. A small amount of liquid crystal is                             injected                             into the liquid crystal cell from the opening by capillary action, and the liquid crystal is                             filled with the entire cavity, and then observed by a polarizing microscope.

20 July: Antibody concentration 50ng/ml. Antibody concentration 200ng/ml.
21 July: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml. Antibody concentration 1000ng/ml.
30 July: Antibody concentration 1ng/ml. Antibody concentration 10ng/ml. Antibody                                 concentration 50ng/ml.
Since the antibody itself has a corresponding perturbation effect on the liquid crystal, in                             order                             to avoid the influence of the nano-antibody perturbation effect on the experimental results,                             we                             carried out an experiment to determine the appropriate concentration of the antibody, and we                             selected 50 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 2000 ng/mL antibody respectively. The                             concentration                             was tested and three parallel experimental groups were set for each concentration. Parallel                             light and conical light were used for observation. The parallel light observation results                             (Fig.                             1) were all black, indicating that the liquid crystal remained vertical.

Experiments were performed at 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL to obtain                             the                             results of parallel light.

We assume that the interconversion between active and inactive forms of a node is reversible. Thus if a node <math>i</math> has only positive incoming links, it is assumed that there is a background (constitutive) deactivating enzyme Fi of a constant concentration (set to be <math>0.5</math>) to catalyze the reverse reaction. Similarly, a background activating enzyme <math>E_{i}=0.5</math> is added for the nodes that have only negative incoming links. The rate equation for a node (e.g., node <math>B</math>) takes the form:

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Figure 2:  Fluorescein Standard Curve
With the LUDOX measurement we were able to convert the measured Abs600 to OD600 with a reference OD600. With the Monodisperse Silica Microspheres measurement we were able to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells. With the fluorescence of fluorescein we were able to create a standard curve to be able to convert the fluorescence of the cells into a concentration of GFP.
After that, we measured six different test device, a negative and a positive control.
We transformed the eight different plasmids into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The positive control is a plasmid that consists of a promoter and GFP (BBa_I20270) in the pSB1C3 backbone, and the negative control a plasmid that consists of a TetR repressible promoter (Bba_R0040) in the pSB1C3 backbone.The plasmids of the six test devices in the pSB1C3 backbone consist of a constitutive GFP expressing promoter with different intensities of expression effects. These plasmid were delivered to us with the iGEM distribution kit.
From the transformation plates we picked nine colonies of every plate and did a colony PCR and gel electrophoresis.
We then picked two colonies of each plate that had the insert, and incubate them in liquid LB at 37℃ and 220rpm for 16-18 hours.(16 tubes totally)
Dilute and smear plate of negative and positive colonies.（36 plates totally)
Culture them at 44℃ for one night.
After diluting we took 500µL samples out of every tube into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes, and placed the samples on ice.
After that, we incubated the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
Then, we measured the Abs600 and fluorescence of these samples.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," immediate access to clean water. Their mission is to “build a socially-conscious generation of young people who END the global water crisis by educating students..."" about it and activating them to rock the clean water cause and build real water projects all over the world”. The Thirst Project collects money and builds self-sustaining wells all across the continent of Africa. The Thirst Project has served for over 13 countries and 330,863 people. They have held projects in 13 countries; however, they are currently active in five: India, Uganda, El Salvador, Kenya.
An integral aspect of the 2018 Lambert iGEM project was to inform the public about the water crisis, the propelling force underlying our project and to empower others to take action. In order to accomplish this, we partnered with the Thirst Project and planned a Thirst Project rally for Lambert High School students. We invited other organizations at Lambert High School such as HOSA, Beta Club, Science National Honors Society, Medical Science Academy, and Key Club International to reach a wider audience.
Women and children walk, on average, 3.75 miles to fetch water. Hearing this, Lambert iGEM strived to inform the public and raise awareness. In addition, hauling water in a jerry can that weighs 44 pounds 3.75 miles can cause countless women's’ health issues. The Thirst Project came to speak to Lambert iGEM students earlier this spring. Aware of the impact that a lack of drinking water can have on women and children, Lambert iGEM addressed the gender gap in STEM fields by creating a doll kit for a local girl scouts troop and running a synthetic biology summer camp for 40 rising 8th and 9th graders.
Lambert iGEM scheduled a video call with Evan Wesley, the Vice President for Student Activation for Thirst Project. “Gathering data is crucial for alleviating the water crisis”. These are the exact words of Evan Wesley. We spoke to Evan about our plans for the future, including our plan to distribute portable kits to non-profits working in targeted areas. He confirmed the practicality of our project goals and our future plans.  On October 15, 2018, two Thirst Project road warriors, Erin and Kyle, came to speak to Lambert students about the water crisis and how we can take action to alleviate its devastating effects on a community.
Key Points from the Thirst Project Presentation
Waterborne diseases kill more children every single year than AIDS, Malaria, and all world violence combined.

1. R0040.A 2. R0040.B 3. R2000.B 4. R2000.D 5. J23100.C 6. R20000.A
While doing this preps we noticed that the J23100 constitutive promoter had a red liquid culture.  This was very exciting as this part did have RFP and should be red.  Also during the mini prep the red pellets were also a good indicator that we grew the correct gene.  When we finished the mini prep we did a nanodrop quantification and got great values for the Anderson Constitutive promoter J23100.

I performed RD this week for various parts. As we still haven't gotten a continuously successful ligation, but have been using a lot of our cut parts we decided to restock.  I performed a RD on:
1. BBa_E0240 GFPc 2. BBa_E1010 RFP 3. BBa_I14033 Pcat 4. BBa_K156010 BFP 5. BBa_J52028 GFP
After running the gel it could be seen that the right parts were cut for each RD however the bands were very dull.  After doing a gel extraction, I received very low DNA quantification values.  All were below 10ng/ul.  As the values were so low I reran the samples to make sure that there was in fact DNA.  After doing the checks, I verified that there was DNA.  However, my values were still very low so I decided to do some more RD with the same parts and to add a larger volume to each well when running the gel.  I doubled the amount hoping for a higher concentration value.  Unfortunately, doubling the volume did not affect the concentration values.  The next day as ligation were still not working I worked on perfecting RD.  For our restriction digest various buffers allowed for the cutting of the desired part.  However, the buffers we were given were not consistent and as BFP did not cut completely when Buffer 2 was used for 1 hour I"

That used screen he would pass to a colleague, while another handed him a fresh screen from one of the crates. He always thought they smelled unpleasant. They also had to wear gloves and protective clothing, in order to remain from touching the array on top of the screen. That array was full of genetically modified bacteria, or “oil munchers” as he and his unit preferred to call them. “They eat oil and poop oxygen. It’s like reverse greenhouse effect!” His friend Bob always said. He doubted Bob was completely correct in that, but it was a neat way of explaining it. The oil munchers ate the oil for about 12 hours and then they died, so the screen was useless after that time.
It was his unit’s job to extract the ‘empty’ screens and put in the new ones. Then they would transport the empty screens to the lab, where those people in white coats would wash the dead munchers off and fill them up with new ones. It wasn’t what his younger self expected to do as a fireman.
De barriers with oil muncher screens did a good job cleaning away most of the oil, but it didn’t get rid of everything. He was reminded of that on the way back to shore. The red boat encountered an smaller oil slick. Nothing to be done once the oil somehow passes the barriers: it was forbidden to release lose oil munchers into the sea. They had to be stuck on those screens, otherwise they’d risk disrupting the environmental balance. Well, that wasn’t completely true. Some claimed bacterial waste and huge amounts of mutated living munchers were the cause of disappearing fish kinds. He himself believed that partly true, but at the same time he believed that whatever trouble the munchers caused, it wasn’t as severe as the consequences of an untreated oil spill.
A screeching bird not far away reminded him of that. It sat on top of the slick, trying to fly away, but the stricky goo on his wings restrained him. Whatever imbalance the oil munchers caused, he was happy that those sights became rarer and rarer. Even though his younger self might’ve thought differently, being part of an oil specialized firemen unit felt like an honor. He liked his job.

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html,":
Assuming we have no control over the diffusion and extinction coefficients of our chemicals, we only have control over passive and active signal production rates, as well as the signal threshold, in order to make our bacteria exhibit our desired effect.
These parameters will likely have to be extensively experimented with - just as they were in this model - to find a set that works.
An active signal production that is 10x the passive signal production produces good results. Too much lower, and there’s not enough of a difference between active and passive bacteria; too much higher, and a signal active bacterium can activate others (again, we want populations to work together, not just one influential individual). If the wet lab can achieve solid passive and active signal production rates at around this level, then it may be possible to reduce the free parameters to just the signal threshold.
Reducing the number of free parameters in this way dramatically increases the speed of testing. Leaving too many parameters free to experiment with results in an impossibly large number of trials to test. Finding just one parameter to adjust, keeping others constant, is really, really important; by investigating too many parameters, it is very easy to create an experiment that will take longer than the life of the universe to carry out in a wet lab.
In the wet lab, if we can indeed resort to only adjusting the signal threshold, we will adjust it according to how dense the bacteria are on the tumour. The denser they are on the tumour, relative to their density elsewhere, the higher the signal threshold can be. The signal threshold must be above the signal concentration in non-tumour regions, so that no factor (IL-2) is produced there.
As the project continues, we’ll continue to play around with this model, learning new insights to guide the wet lab! The code can be found in our Github repository .

Event at the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen
Together with The DTU team we have been participating in the “Culture night” in Copenhagen at an event held by the Tycho Brahe Planetarium.
The Culture Night
The Culture Night in copenhagen is an annual event taking place on the night when the schools begin their autumn break. On the culture night all the museums, governmental buildings, institutions, stores and much more is open for the public until midnight offering different events, talks, concerts etc. You can read more about the culture night here .
The Tycho Brahe Planetarium
The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is Denmark’s most advanced center for popularizing astronomy and space research and promoting knowledge on natural science. On the Culture Night, the planetarium is open until midnight and has 4000-6000 visitors in total. You can read more about the Tycho Brahe Planetarium here .
Our stand on the culture night
We participated in the culture night at the Tycho brahe Planetarium by having a stand on the museum together with DTU. The aim of our participation in the event was to talk with “normal” people and get their input, as well as telling about our projects and inspire people to consider the question of Colonizing Mars or not.
In order to facilitate quality conversation about the role of biotech in Mars colonization and the question of colonizing or not, we brought some different materials for activities.
Our activities:
Since we work mostly with GMO bacteria, we decided to bring some bacterial cultures in petri dishes coming from different places at our University. The petri dishes with bacteria facilitated conversations with both children and adults about how bacteria like to live, and why they’re not always dangerous and how the can be used for different purposes.
We also brought some tobacco plants grown at the university, and showed people how we could inject agrobacterium into the leaves and thereby change the plants DNA. We did of course only inject water at the event, but it lead to many interesting conversations about DNA and how bacteria acts.
Besides from the Petri dishes with bacteria and the tobacco plants, we also brought petri dishes only with agar so the kids could try and spread a liquid on them, and we also brought a lot of clay for building Mars colonies on round tables with orange background. While the petri dishes with agar helped facilitate conversation about how we work in the laboratorium, the clay helped inspire to"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", and I definitely struggled a lot with writing this, but it's made me realize that this could help us later when we are pulling together everything for the summer abstracts and posters next week.
We've managed to get half a dozen Wellesley students with BISC 110 (intro Cell Bio) or AP Biology experience to come and test our software tomorrow!  It should be a crazy day tomorrow, setting up the demos in room 160 across the hall while also the Upward Bound Demos are happening.
Tuesday, 7/24: The first day of the user studies testing begins!  We had three sessions for Wellesley students, each of which consisted of a pair of students.  Consuelo and I sat in for usability studies for most of the day, but also Nahum and Kara helped out.
Wednesday, 7/25: Today two things were happening:  Kara, Nahum, and Veronica worked on fixing bugs from yesterday's usability studies, which were quite a few.  In the meanwhile, with every testing I updated the scenario and started editing the questions to make them more clear and intuitive for the users.  Also, because the summer poster session is coming up, we started designing the poster and also pulling together text for the poster.  I think having a poster design inspired by the MoClo planner (shutter and element menus) and colors inspired by it might be useful.
Thursday, 7/26:Round #2 of the user studies at Wellesley started today! We had some bugs from Tuesday's study that were fixed yesterday, but today we are hoping to catch more bugs.  Also, we attended a grad school panel today that informed our understanding of the grad school process.  Even though there weren't any synthetic biologists (evolutionary biologists and computer scientists were present, as well as a biochemist), their experiences informed me greatly.
Friday, 7/27: MIT user study day!  Nahum, Consuelo, and I went to go visit the iGEM team at MIT this week and tested out the MoClo Planner with four pairs of students.  It was definitely still a challenge moving Uppy, but significantly easier than doing the studies with the BU teams last year with the bulky old surfaces!

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

Within work areas of the facility, all activities are confined to Class III biological safety cabinets, or Class II biological safety cabinets used with one-piece positive pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life support system. The BSL4 laboratory has special engineering and design features to prevent microorganisms from being disseminated into the environment. The laboratory is kept at negative air pressure, so that air flows into the room if the barrier is penetrated or breached. Furthermore, an airlock is used during personnel entry and exit.

Biosafety in our project
In order to lower the risk of causing damages to health, and to protect the environment, our team enforced a sound laboratory practice. Every protocol was characterized by a risk index for researcher's, public and environmental safety. A higher index indicates more hazard and the need for specific precautions to be adopted during the execution of the protocol.
Our most dangerous practices concern the use of Ethidium Bromide, UV rays and genetically modified bacteria.
Ethidium Bromide and UV Rays
Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) is commonly used as a non-radioactive marker for identifying and visualizing nucleic acid bands in electrophoresis and in other methods of gel-based nucleic acid separation. EtBr is dark red, crystalline, non-volatile solid, moderately soluble in water, which fluoresces readily with a reddish-brown color when exposed to ultraviolet light (UV). Although it is an effective tool, its hazardous properties require special safe handling and disposal procedures.
Fifure 1.Ethidium Bromide
Figure 2. The process of intercalation
Safety Precautions
EtBr is a mutagen and is moderately toxic after an acute exposure. It can be absorbed through skin, so it is important to avoid any contact with the chemical. It is also an irritant to the skin, eyes, mouth and upper respiratory tract. Good work practices can help to reduce hazardous exposure.
To prevent inhalation exposure, work with EtBr powder or crystals in a fume hood. It is better to work with premixed EtBr solutions or tablets to avoid the direct handling of the powder.
To prevent skin contact when working with liquid solutions, wear nitrile gloves, a laboratory coat, and safety goggles. Change gloves frequently.
Review an EtBr Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) fact sheet before handling the material.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair_-_-_TEXT.html," also developed the software M.A.X. that  suggests a set of restriction enzymes based on the neighboring DNA sequence of the UBP. With these restriction enzymes,  a simple approach for retention or loss of the UBP in vitro is available. Furthermore,   we developed a two-plasmid-system for UBP retention in vivo.  These plasmids encode for the nucleotide transporter PtNTT2 ,   Cas9 and a set of sgRNAs. PtNTT2, taken from the algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum,   ensures the uptake of the unnatural triphosphates from the media. Plasmids that lose the UBP get cut by Cas9, because the sgRNAs bind to   every DNA sequences that carries a mutation instead of the UBP. This results in the preservation of the UBP in vivo.       We also made a step towards an autonomous semisynthetic organism.  From literature, we identified a natural source of the ""unnatural"" base isoG, the plant Croton tiglium .   We conducted a transcriptome-based investigation to identify potential enzyme candidates responsible for the biosynthesis of isoG,   which we then heterologously expressed in E. coli and characterized in vitro."

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview#project wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," peptides in different samples. The sequences encoding the peptides were introduced into an over-expression vector for E. coli; thereby, we were able to get large amounts of our peptides which we called PepTags from then on. In the last step for the time being, we tested the fungi A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and C. glabrata with peptides, which are supposed to interact specific with one of their surface proteins in vivo using fluorescence microscopy.
With the in vivo experiments we want to proof that the identified PepTags not only bind to their surface proteins in an Y2H screen, but also to living fungi. To visualize the fungal surface itself, we stained structures containing chitin and cellulose in the fungal cell wall with calcofluor (figure 1C and 2C). The first organism with whom the functionality of our system was tested was A. fumigatus and the PepTag No.13.  Binding of this PepTag to the fungi was visualized with an antibody fused to a fluorescent molecule (Chromeo 488, figure 1A and 2A).
Figure 1| Fluorescence microscopy of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae. This figure shows an A. fumigatus hyphae incubated with PepTag13, antibody and stained with calcofluor. Under light with a wavelength of 488 nm, the complexes containing PepTag13 and antibody show fluorescence. The excitation of calcofluor at a wavelength of 358 nm allows the identification of the hyphal surface (blue light).  The second picture shows the hyphae in a bright field, while the merged picture demonstrates that the green fluorescence is located in the same area as the blue one.
We were able to show that our peptide binds specifically to the surface of A. fumigatus, which is visualized by the green dots along the outer surface of the fungal cells. We also tested PepTag No.13 with A. nidulans (figure 2) but could not see any fluorescent signal. That means that our PepTag No.13 binds not only specific to the fungal surface, but also specific to the surface protein Sun1 of A. fumigatus. Moreover, we could show that the antibody cannot bind unspecific to the fungal surface when the PepTag is missing . For further information have a look at our lab-book.

WITS-South_Africa,2010,Team:WITS-South Africa#The Machine_-_-_TEXT.html,"proxy” for infection. Once this was achieved, it would be possible to investigate how to make the machine specific for HPV.
The nature of the response – How will the machine alert an individual that she has been exposed to the virus?
Traditional whole cell biosensors have been engineered to respond to one or more stimuli with the expression of fluorescent proteins such as firefly luciferase or GFP. When these biosensors are added to an environmental sample, such as potentially contaminated water, and then the sample is viewed under a fluorescent microscope, a positive response can easily be detected. However, if the biosensor is part of a population of commensal bacteria in the vaginal mucosa, this would not be appropriate or useful! Thus, we wanted our machine to respond by producing an output easily visible to the naked eye. Preferably, an individual could monitor the response by herself, with no need to go to a doctor for examination or undergo a complicated procedure. Thus, we decided to experiment with Cambridge’s winning iGEM 09 project – E.chromi biobricks which cause bacteria to produce easily visible chromogenic reporter molecules. Simultaneous production of a reporter molecule and one which blocks, contains or neutralises the viral particle would be ideal, but for the purposes of this project, we decided to focus on the reporting mechanism, with the option to add in a neutralising molecule at a later stage.
The strength of the response needed for detection
If a viral particle is present in the vaginal mucosa, and one, or even a few local bacterial biosensors detects it, the colour change in those cells will not be sufficient for detection by the host. In order for our machine to be of practical use, infection needs to trigger a coordinated response from the entire population, switching every biosensor on. For this we explored the use of quorum sensing molecules, which are a method of bacterial communication which can directly activate gene expression. Gram-positive bacteria, such as L. gasseri, produce species specific quorum peptides which can be used to create a positive feedback loop to propagate an initial infection signal amongst an entire bacterial population.
How to switch the machine off again after infection has been reported
A continuous “on” state is obviously not desirable, given that the eventual effect of machine activation would be an entire bacterial population in the vaginal mucosa that is producing a bright, visible colour. Once infection has been noted by the host, allowing them to seek medical treatment, the population needs to return to an off, non visible state – Firstly to avoid discomfort or embarrassment for the host and secondly to ensure that the machine can be used"

a. Recombinant techniques consisting of the formation of new combinations of genetic material by the insertion of nucleic acid molecules, produced by whatever the means outside an organism, into any virus, bacterial plasmid or other vector system and their incorporation into a host organism in which they do not naturally occur but in which they are capable of continued propagation;
b. Techniques involving the direct introduction into an organism of heritable material prepared outside the organism including micro-injection, macro-injection and micro-encapsulation;
c. Cell fusion or hybridisation techniques where live cells with new combinations of heritable genetic material are formed through the fusion of two or more cells by means of methods that do not occur naturally.
This University deem other procedures to be classed as Genetic Modification projects. These include:
i. Use of an organism with modified DNA, even though the organism has not been created at this University; ii. The generation of transgenic animals/plants using modified DNA as defined by the ACGM (in (a));  iii. Site directed mutagenesis.
Techniques not considered to result in genetic modification include:
a. in vitro  fertilisation; b. Natural processes including conjugation, transduction, or transformation; c. Polyploidy induction.
Techniques for which the Genetic Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 do not apply are:
a. Random mutagenesis (e.g. by chemicals like methyl nitroso-urea); b. Cell fusion (including protoplast fusion) or prokaryote species which can exchange genetic material through homologous recombination; c. Cell fusion (including protoplast fusion) of cells of any eukaryotic species, including production of hybridomas and plant cell fusions.
Background to Project
NOTE: You should include a detailed background to the project here (e.g. using the Abstract from the original grant application). It is important to provide as much background as reasonably practicable so that the University’s Chemical and Biological Hazards Sub-committee (which acts as the University’s Genetic Modification Safety Committee) can have an informed judgement of the project.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

Transformation plating results
We got no growth on any of the plated transformed bacteria for either the ElectroComp or ChemComp bacteria.  To check whether the isothermal assembly itself was the problem, we ran a junction PCR using our previous protocol on the isothermal assembly mix, along with a positive control (Myc981):
No bands visible for the isothermal assembly
As observed, there were no bands in the isothermal mix lanes while the positive control worked.  Thus, we can conclude that our isothermal assembly did not work, and we will need to repeat it again (currently waiting for more isothermal mix to arrive from Wyss).
Amplification and purification of practice plate oligos
In preparation for our swap reactions (switching the oligo F1s into our expression plasmid), we mapped out the following two experiments that we will need to perform:
Testing the selection system by preparing our expression plasmids in parallel (i.e. creating 18 plasmids in separate reactions), and then combining them all at the end and transforming them into the selection strains.  This will allow us to cut and ligate the plasmids without much concern, but test whether we will be able to pick out the binder amongst the rest of the non-binders.
Testing the cutting/ligation by combining all of the oligos first, and then carrying out the construction of the different expression plasmids all in the same tube.
Note that the results for both will ultimately yield DNA libraries if they work (except that the first experiment is much more foolproof in terms of actually yielding a library than the second experiment).

Q1: This chart above shows that over 90% of the respondents of this survey where of age 18-29.  This shows a limitation of our survey in that it did not reach a wide range of public. However, the survey got opinions of young people who are the active creators and makers in our current world and their opinion is very important to the future of the scientific world.
Q2: The aim of asking people this question was to get a sense of how educated people are and find out how their level of education connects to their general opinion on UAVs. As it is obvious from the graph, around 80% of the respondents were college students, and some had just recently graduated from college. It is interesting to know what college students think since they represent the youthful part of the society that is very creative and innovative and very influential to the society.
Q3: Around 70% of the total respondents reported to have first heard of UAVs through television and through local and national newspapers. 6.84% of the respondents did not know what drones were. Around 10% of respondents reported to have first heard of drones in other ways that the question did not specify and these responses included the Internet, family members, high school courses and through online articles. In general, the media has been the main source of information on UAVs and their uses. This response shows us that we can utilize the media, especially various types of social media to educate people on good uses of UAVs.
Q4: This question was probably one of the most interesting in the survey. Around 70% of the respondents reported that the first thing that comes to mind when they think of UAVs os UAVs for military uses. Even though most of the respondents were college students and they presumably have heard of other uses of UAVs, they still relate UAVs tp their military uses. However, around 10% of the respondents did appreciate that UAVs are a great technology that can be used constructively in other areas of life.
Q5: Even though 70% of respondents related UAVs to military uses, around 45% thought that using drones for civilian uses is a good idea. Although this number is not too low, around half of the respondents (around 55%) either were not interested in the UAV technology or did not think it was a good idea to introduce drones as a tool to use for societal functions.  This indicated a window of opportunity for us to educate more"

What’s                                         more, we also discovered that the older the more likely that one would go for                                         night shifts (see Supplementary Material); the adjusting capability of circadian                                         rhythm declines as aging, which enforced the negative effects of night                                         shifts.
      There are people who uses sleeping pills to                                         regulate their sleep, and most of                                         them uses traditional tablets like Barbital and Diazepam.

The people having night shifts accept melatonin more, and many                                         are willing to try it. This inspires us that we still have to publicize                                         melatonin more so more people could get known of its positive effects and                                         benefit from it.

PowerLeaf - A Bacterial Solar Battery
ENERGY MADE BEAUTIFUL
Abstract
With the PowerLeaf, iGEM SDU is introducing a novel solution for long-term storage of solar energy, thus becoming an alternative to solar cells, without using environmentally harmful resources. We aim to accomplish this through the creation of a device visually shaped to resemble a plant leaf, thereby providing a nature-in-city ambience. The team invested heavily in public engagement and collaborations to investigate how the device hypothetically could be implemented into an urban environment. From a technical perspective, the bacterial solar battery is composed of an energy storing unit and an energy converting unit. The energy storing unit is defined by a genetically engineered Escherichia coli, that fixates carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose, while the energy converting unit uses genetically engineered Escherichia coli to consume the stored cellulose. Electrons retrieved from this process, are transferred to an anode by optimised nanowires, thereby creating an electrical current. Last but not least, the energy storing unit has a light-dependent system, which activates dormancy during nighttime to reduce energy lost by metabolism.
A green project, a green wiki, and a great performance in the iGEM Goes Green initiative! Green just got greener.

Determination of Noise Levels
For these experiments, the promoters controlling an RFP reporter system were cloned into E. coli strain MG1655 on pSB1A2. The cultures were grown in LB medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin and examined by fluorescence microscopy, using an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera and 200 ms exposure time, when cultures were at OD600=0.3-0.5. For flow cytometry, both LB medium with 50 µg/mL ampicillin and M9 medium with 100 µg/mL ampicillin were used. Excitation of RFP was at 561 nm, and emission was measured around 580 nm.

From plastics to the power line
Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic and arguably one of the most versatile materials to ever be synthesized. Its practicality and convenience however, have come at a great environmental cost. Polyethylene takes millennia to decompose, leaching harmful microplastics into the environment. We approached this pressing issue from a synthetic biology perspective, making use of E. coli engineered with genes encoding for laccase to degrade polyethylene into smaller alkane chains. Our team recognizes the opportunity to further advance this project by addressing another key issue – energy. Using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism in tandem with genes responsible for alkane metabolism derived from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, we will generate electricity from the metabolism of degraded polyethylene, hoping that it will one day help in solving the world’s growing energy needs. Thus, our project serves as an integrated effort to simultaneously solve two crucial problems.
To achieve our goal of electricity generation from plastic degradation, we separated our project into three independent but interconnected modules. The first stage, the PE degradation module, focused on creating a genetic construct that would readily synthesize and secrete Laccase in order to degrade the polyethylene into smaller alkanes. Once fragmented, the alkanes would be processed by our second stage - the alkane metabolism module. This module plans to introduce alkane uptake and metabolism pathways into Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 so that it can process alkanes and channel the electrons obtained from its cellular respiration. The third and final module was the physical construct of the microbial fuel cell. We housed the Shewanella within a microbial fuel cell of our design to characterise and optimise the electricity generated. The following is a schematic to describe the flow of the project.

Discription
Leukemia is a serious disease and its remedy has been never found yet. People are afraid of it not only because it is incurable but also it is unpredictable what will happen and when it will happen. Patients have to put up with both of them.
Here we propose the convenient testing kit for leukemia which makes its symptom visible. To accomplish this we are developing leukemia disease models in Drosophila. The usefulness of this kit will be evaluated by characterizing the Drosophila model. This kit may provide a guideline to overcome fear and pain which have not been immeasurable and relieve the fear for leukemia.
Abstract
Mr.D -who will cure leukemia-
Our team, KIT-Kyoto challenges making a leukemia disease model in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is being used as many hereditary disease model because over 70% of known human disease genes have similarities to Drosophila genes.
This year, we focus on a leukemia in which the etiology and the therapy have not been established. We therefore decided to make a leukemia disease model in Drosophila. We insert human leukemia genes into Drosophila genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in E. coli or Drosophila. We expect that establishing a leukemia disease model in Drosophila will be a first step to determine the etiology and to establish the method of therapy in the future.
Results
We have constructed a Biobrick part, BBa_K579000. This part is useful to make GFP-fusion with various proteins to monitor their expressions. Functional assays to monitor GFP expression in E. coli and Drosophila are ongoing.
We have succeeded to amplify API2-MALT1 cDNA and DIAP2 cDNA. Molecular cloning of these amplified DNA fragments into the P-element plasmid, pUAST-Flag are still underway. After construction of these plasmids, we are going to microinject them into Drosophila embryos to make transgenic flies.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,"\Delta C = 0.25, \Delta I = 2.5$). For crRNA 3 and 4, the off-target cleavage probability on the
Bos taurus<\it> is highest, which we could have expected as it has the most basepairs and therefore most sites for potential off-target activity. Despite the size of the genomes, ranging from 2.5 to 45 million basepairs, even the cumulative off-target effects do not result in a high probability of a false positives output.
The simulations so far indicate the detection system to be reliable, i.e. have a low probability of yielding a false-positive output. However, insufficient data are available to accurately determine the model fit parameters. In addition, experimental validation is lacking. As such, it is possible that experimental work proves Cas13a to have increased off-target activity. We investigated what the effect of this would be on the reliability of the system, and subsequently propose methods to experimentally reduce the off-target probability.
We repeated the simulation for a higher energy gain for matches ($\Delta C=0.30$) and lower energy penalty for mismatches ($\Delta I=0.80$). In this situation, we find the off-target probability to be much higher than in our original simulations: $P_{FP}$ is 10 to 800 (Figure 7). It is now more intuitive to interpret $P_{FP}$ as the total number of false positives per true positive. Given a positive output, the probability of it being false is higher than 90% in all simulations. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions.
Figure 7: Number of false positive outputs (per true positive) for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. $P_{FP}$, now more intuitively interpreted as the total number of false positives per true positive, or relative signal strength, for crRNA 1-4 for the E. coli, S. aureus and S. epidermis genome and the Bos Taurus chromosome 27 ($\Delta C=0.30$, $\Delta I=0.85$). The large values indicate a false positive probability higher than 90% in all simulations (given a positive output).
In our simulations, we assume equal representation of all genomic sequences. In reality, only part of the sequences are transcribed and available in RNA, and of course in different quantities. We can correct for these effects by applying a mask over the genome which takes into account the amount of RNA"

1 erlenmeyer with light exposition, room temperature
Measurement of the OD600 every hour
3 culture on 5have shown a bacterial development
Colony - A6
Colony - A8
Colony - F1
All colonies exhibits same profile under same condition of light exposition and temperature. When the temperature is favorable for a bacterial development, the light activation of pDawn leading to the production of toxin is weak and do not impact a lot the growth of the population of bacteria.      But at room temperature (RT°), the induction for protein synthesis is high enough to stop bacterial development
Two things lack to this experiment:
A longer time to measure if the population of bacteria could really decrease
A control at room temperature without light exposition to compare it evolution of OD 600 to the grey curve

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html,". First, we wanted to design a full prosthesis. We realized that it wasn’t the core of the problem. Indeed, the technology missing in this field was the actual interface between the prosthesis and the osseointegrated steel/titanium/ceramic stem inside the human body, limiting the field of bionic prosthesis. We decided to focus on this interface and started to talk with Dr. Benjamin Bouyer, a Lumbar rachis surgeon, on how we could deposit the biofilm on or in the osseointegrated stem. We realized that the stem would be in direct contact with the surgeon meaning that if we coated the whole structure with our biofilm, it would probably be stripped off, and get deposited on the gloves and contaminate other areas. We also spoke with one member of the board of directors of ADEPA, “Association de Défense et d’Etude des Personnes Amputés », which translates to « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated Persons” who is himself an amputee. He gave us great advice on the designing phase of this interface and raised the issue of the socket causing excessive sudation and discomfort for the patient. After meeting with experts from I-CERAM (Ceramic medical devices company, Limoges, France) and the CERAH (Center for Studies and Research on the Equipment for the Handicapped), we learned more and more about the different materials used in the making of prostheses. At this point, we realized that doing a full stainless-steel interface would stimulate the growth of bacteria in a biofilm structure. Therefore, we decided to switch and do the part in direct contact with the patient in ceramic, knowing that we still have the same problem that I-CERAM and the CERAH were facing currently. Indeed, steel doesn’t last as much as ceramic, which could be a problem when creating an interface composed of both materials. We knew then that the patient would probably need corrective surgeries to fix his osseointegrated stem. Having considered these parameters, we then decided to start modeling our prototype by integrating those different aspects as much as possible. Because we wanted it to be cost-effective and injection-moldable, we built our current prototype in ABS, a thermoplastic polymer that could be 3D-printed. We ordered the electronic parts composed of a charger, battery, and amplifier, and assembled it into its current state as our POC.

At last, the ligations were confirmed on gel on September 16th. The measurements of fluorescence and optic density weren’t made until September 27th because the microplate lector was being used by another researcher.
Section II: Protocol
Sample preparation
The following parts from the distribution kits were transformed in E. coli TOP10 cells according to the electrotransformation protocol:
D1= 17F, plate 2, 2012 (Kn)
D2= 20k, plate 1, 2013 (CAM)
D3=20K, plate 1, 2012 (Amp)
GFP= 12M, plate 1, 2012 (Amp)
RFP= 9K, plate 1, 2014 (CAM)
*A D3 part of the Ampicillin cassette was used because the one in pSB1C3 caused many problems.
After transformation, a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic. These were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Later, the tubes were centrifuged at 4,000rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL of LB media. Of the total volume, 425uL were used for a glycerol stock, which was stored at -80°C. The remaining volume was used to make minipreps. The DNA concentration and purity were measured with the nanodrop machine.

To regulate the humidity content in the spore core, B. subtilis have adapted by changing the shape of its wrinkled spore cortex with various degrees of humidity. As the air becomes dryer, the spores shrinks, and vice versa. Suddenly, we have a folding mechanism. Thus, we sought to improve on the work of Chen et al. (Columbia University) and their HYDRA technology (Fig. 2), which is able to scale up the nano scale contractions of spores to the macro scale. We wanted to create fully biological HYDRAs, using cellulose and cellulose binding domains on the spore coat.
Fig. 1 Scanning Electron Microscope picture of spores from our lab
Fig. 2 HYDRAs in parallel (Chen et al.) [1]
Experiment
From synthetic to biological
There were two experiments, recreating HYDRAs from the Chen et al. publication, and creating bioHYDRAS, which are fully biological versions of HYDRAs.
Fig. 3 Spores on one of our HYDRA samples
Recreating HYDRAs: By expanding on the protocol by Chen et al. [1] to create HYDRAs, we then used desiccant and wet paper towels in separate chambers to create humidity variance for these HYDRAs to expand and contract, and recorded our results using a ruler and a humidity sensor.
BioHYDRAs: The goal of BioHYDRA was to replace all the parts of HYDRAs by biologically produced substances. We sought out to replace polyamide tape by bacterially cellulose, and the glue by cellulose binding domains on the surface of the spore coat.        Thus, the first step involved cloning a Bacillus construct in Escherichia coli of a fusion protein consisting of a spore coat protein, cotZ (building off work done on Sporobeads by the LMU Munich 2012 iGEM team), and a cellulose binding domain (CIPA). Additionally, we decided to add aeBlue, a chromogenic protein, between cotZ and CIPA to be able to see with the naked eye whether Bacillus is in a vegetative or a spore state. The plasmid would thereafter need to be transformed and expressed in Bacillus . Here is a link to our part: BBa_K1692028 .
We then needed to produce bacterial cellulose. For more details, refer to our Cellulose page.
Finally, our project would consist of testing for the binding affinity of the"

Cellulase
Cellulose is a polymer of β-linked glucose produced by plants, and can be broken down into its subunits by cellulase. Cellulose is not usable by most organisms because of the beta-linked glucose of  which it is made up. Mammals use α-linked glucose to store their energy as glycogen while plants  create starch the same way; cellulose is produced only for structural support. However, some organisms  can enzymatically change beta links to alpha links, after breaking down a chain of cellulose. Our  produced enzyme is only the enzyme that helps breakdown cellulose chains into smaller units called  cellobiose, two glucose molecules linked by a β 1-->4 bond (Part:BBa_K118023). These smaller units  of the large cellulose chain are more soluble in water, helping to remove the components of a plant  stain on clothing.
Amylase
Starch is a polymer of α-linked glucose, and is the primary energy storage in plants. This polymer can be broken down by amylase, an enzyme produced in our mouths to help break down food  as soon as it enters our body. These long chains of glucose are broken down into single glucose  molecules. Any organism that consumes starch produces amylase, including E. coli. The gene we used to  produce our amylase is native to E. coli (Part:BBa_K523001). The breakdown of starch helps remove  common food stains.
Bioplastic
What is bioplastic?
Bioplastics-as the name entails, means plastic that is biological in origin. One focus of Utah State’s 2014 iGEM team was to study polyhydroxybutyrates (PHBs), which are biodegradable  polymers belonging to the group polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHAs are naturally produced  by some microorganisms in nature as a storage intermediate for energy and carbon. It has  been reported that PHAs can accumulate up to 90% of dry cell weight under ideal conditions.  PHAs are interesting plastics as they have similar physical and mechanical properties to their  petroleum based counterparts such as polypropylene and polystyrene. PHB has a melting  temperature of 179℃, a young’s modulus of 3.5 GPa, and a tens"

Pay attention to the configure information.There should be ""missing ***"" messages when Cmake fail to find the dependent libraries. To fix those messages, one need to assign the path of related libraries by Cmake GUI. When Makefiles are successfully generated, execute the Make command to build.

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge"

ECUST,2017,Team:ECUST#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.
We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Professors&Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of resources and  Environment.he told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which is conducive to the smooth develop  ent of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in the experimrntal design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Hi, meet 16 iGEMers behind our project from NPU-2018 here! We come from different majors and levels of scientific    careers, but passion and ardent love for biology gathered us together to develop and present an ideal work. As the    Chinese proverb goes that if two people are of the same mind，their sharpness can cut through metal, it’s amazing and    adorable that we’ve formed a strong mutual trust and effective communication. In short, there are 16 members in our    team this year，and everyone have their own role，accordingly supporting each other. Meanwhile, we have 5 advisors,    who have helped us a lot in different fields of biotechnology . The introductions of our members and advisors are    listed as follows.
Weifeng Lin
Hi！I am a junior student, majoring in biotechnology. It’s my second time to join iGEM. I’m glad to be student      leader this year. To be honest, this work is not easy as I thought before.I like spending time on eating good food      and discovering new things. My favorite role is Shelden Lee Copper in the big bang theory.
Meixuan Lee
I'm a sophomore from NPU-2018, mainly responsible for experiments and materials. While I'm majoring in biology,      becoming an ice-cream seller is actually my ultimate goal. Learning a lot in our project, it's both challenging      and enjoyable to be an iGEMer. By the way, I love britpop and Márquez, trying to learn guitar and español now.
Yuan Ma
Hello! I am a junior student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, majoring in materials science and      engineering, and minoring in biotechnology. To be honest, I really like biology. I am trying to apply the      knowledge of materials science to biology. I think iGEM is a very good platform, where I meet great teammates and      also have a great time.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," waterway would more effectively drive community engagement and potentially move residents to action. It occurred to us after the meeting that perhaps if we had engaged a group that was not dedicated to political action and remediation around the canal we might have gotten a different answer.
When the second part of our project, mining the microbiome of the canal for organisms and pathways that might help with remediation efforts, they were both interested and positive.
Exploring the potential Impact of our project on the Biosecurity Community: Meeting with FBI Special Agent Martin Maag
Because New York is the city that experienced the 911 attacks, we engaged with the biosecurity community soon after the founding of Genspace. During our work on the Gowanus project we realized that New York waterways are potential terrorist targets, and that deployment of sensors might impact the work of the biosecurity community.We wanted to cooperate with Homeland Security, so we contacted FBI Special Agent Sara Wood, who has a long-standing cordial relationship with Genspace, and asked for a meeting with her or one of her team members. FBI Special Agent Martin Maag agreed to meet with us at Genspace. Agent Maag has spent 30 years in the FBI, worked on cases including Unabomber, Whitewater (Arkansas), Oklahoma City Bombing, and currently works in NYC (the biggest of the 56 FBI field offices in the US)
What would happen if we built our sensor devices and hung them in the Gowanus Canal? The canal provides access to Brooklyn via Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, and is spanned by several traffic bridges, and so has strategic importance. We had heard a story about an artist who supposedly got into hot water with the police around some kind of devices in the water around New York. We asked Mr. Maag what a likely scenario would be if we deployed our biosensors. He told us that even with our best efforts to inform the community living and commuting through the canal area, we could not expect to be able to get the information about our biosensors out to every member of the public. And since 911, New Yorkers have lived by the motto “If You See Something, Say Something”. In his professional opinion, it was highly likely that some concerned citizen would call the police when they noticed unfamiliar devices in the canal.
In that case, New York has an alliance of the New York City Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, and the New York office of the FBI that make up the Homeland Security team responsible for dealing with potential threats. They are bound by law to investigate every call, and so it was likely"
Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," mutations into genes more easily and cheaply......... This is the dream of all iGEMers. Our experiments often lead to dead end this summer, and we continued to explore other possibilities. We encountered with the SLiCE method in such a situation. (Please refer to the link for detailed protocols. special methods ) As a result of introducing SLiCE this time, we succeeded in cloning in some of the genes that were difficult with other cloning methods.
We thought that such a low-cost cloning method would be beneficial for a student in iGEM. We would like to disseminate the SLiCE method to other teams of iGEM. We already talked about the SLiCE method when we interacted with the Gifu team. Since we are introducing it on our wiki (link), please try SLiCE methods for other iGEM teams as well.
3-4 boil method
When we started the yeast project that absorbs salt, the past iGEM project that we referred to most was Aachen 2017. In this project, the possibility of absorbing salt into yeast was clearly introduced, but there was no clear information about how much salt could actually be absorbed by yeast.
In order to create a yeast that absorbs Na+ ions from the outside, measuring Na+ ion concentration accurately and rapidly is most important. From the beginning of the project, finding a method to measure ion has always been a concern of our team.
We send an email to all possible researchers and finally, we succeeded in obtaining cooperation from Dr.Kobayashi and Dr. Ochiai of Kyoto University, which is the biggest factor that made this research possible. This two expert devised a boil method as a method of measuring Na+ in yeast, and with the advent of boil method and measuring instrument, it became possible to accurately measure the concentration of sodium ions in a cell. It would not have been possible to do an experimental assay without the cooperation of the two.
Add-up
As introduced above, our project of this year has been achieved with the cooperation of many people. Thanks to the expert interview which summarized in the item on salt damage section, we were able to greatly extend the scope of our intended purpose of use from in-vitro use to future application with salt damage. Also, thanks to many experts introduced in the ""Project"" section, we were able to construct many plasmids and evaluate the performance of actual device prototypes. Furthermore, last but not least, the serious interest in biosafety drawn from many experts, high school students and the general public changed our thoughts radically and add a new concept to our device.

Safety in iGEM
Our classroom worked as our lab this year, we had 23 members in our team but usually 10 will show up to our meeting everyday.  This system really worked for us and kept our space safe!.   We had two projects this year but we only focused on the ""Bacteria mimic"" or ""Living bacteria""  Our chassis for both projects is DH5-alpha bacterial cells.
Safety risk level assessment for vaccine platform project
We are going to use 4 structural proteins from Lyme:  OspB: Level 2 OspC: Level 2 DbpB: Level 2 DbpA: Level 2  One protein from Bacteria Ftsz: Level 1  Based on this data, we have assessed that we require a lab with a biosafety level 2.
Safety risk level assessment for ""Bacteria mimic"" or ""Living Vaccine"" project
Wolbachia Bacteria: WSP:Level 1 Jelly Fish  GFP: Level 1 Coral RFP: Level 1  Based on this data, we have assessed that we require a lab with a biosafety level 1.
Safety Precautions
Since we cannot experiment with ticks, not only because of school regulations but mainly because of the difficulty of working with them and their reproductive cycle. We decided to test the vertical transmission of our bacteria in flightless Drosophila melanogaster. To minimize the chance of this organism escaping the lab. We confined the flightless-flies in a separate room right next to our lab and they were inside an incubator. We are also planing on adding an inducible kill switch as our project progress since we cannot precisely anticipate its how it will behave once it is released into nature.
Other safety precautions
We viewed the safety videos available through iGEM
We used good house keeping techniques
Such as wearing gloves, keeping the lab space clean,           using new pippet tips and autoclaving/bleaching samples, and sanatizing the work environment with 70% ethanol"

Collaborations
The European Experience
For the first time since the end of the iGEM Regional Jamborees, two teams collaborated to organize the European Experience, a meeting where all the Europeans iGEM teams were invited in Paris to exchange, discuss, and celebrate. iGEM IONIS and iGEM Evry decided to organize such an event in order to tighten the relations existing between all European iGEMers.
We started organizing this event in late January, and reached out for iGEM Evry to help us organizing it given its importance. We also wanted to team up with another iGEM team to collaborate on a big scale common project. Our goal was to create an event that people would remember, and needed help in order to do so.  As time went by, the teams discussed and agreed on the type of event we wanted to do. There was a lot of discussion about what kind of event we wanted to do, but eventually we stated that we had mainly 3 mains goals in mind for the European Experience: train for the Giant Jamboree, learn more about Synthetic Biology, and exchange with other teams.
We then decided to organize 2 roundtables, focused around two main themes: “Challenges and Risks of Synthetic Biology” and “Synthetic Biology: a new economic world”. The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic Biology straight from professionals,"

Signaling Module
The signaling module is based on the interaction of the two fragments of an intein derived protease. Each of the split intein fragments was designed to be inserted in a different Cas9 domain. Thus, when the Cas9 conformational change occurs the distance between the split intein fragments is reduced and the reaction takes place. As a result of the cleavage, a split TEV protease joined to a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein is released as a signal. To test the intein reaction we designed two BioBricks with histags on them in order to recover the excised fragments by protein extraction.
Advantageous Signaling
Our signaling strategy uses the cleavage properties of a cis-splicing split intein to release an insertion when a conformational change occurs. The specifity of the intein derived protease recognition makes it suitable for proteolytic reactions in E.coli and S.cerevisae. Therefore, this module gives a precise approach for protein excision and so provides a mechanism useful for signaling and protein regulation.
Background
1. Intein derived protease
We thought that the best way to indicate that the dCas9 conformational change had occurred was through the release of a signal molecule. For that reason, our signaling module is based on the interaction of two insertions in the dCas9 protein that allows the release of a split TEV protease when the conformational change occurs. To release one of the insertions we decided to use the Ssp DnaB S1 split-intein. This intein derived protease (IP) consists of a 144 aa C-terminal intein fragment that recognices and cleaves the peptide bond between the Gly and Cys residues of the 16 aa N-terminal fragment (Volkmann et al., 2011), thus resulting in a cis-splicing reaction as shown in Figure 1.

Introduction
As in all of the natural sciences, repeatability and comparability of experiments and data are essential to future development. The same holds true for synthetic biology, where it is especially important, as labs require research from other labs to build off of. However, it is not uncommon for different labs to report measurements in different units, resulting in an inconvenient variability between labs. As a result, our team has decided to participate in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study, which aims to reduce systematic variability between labs. Specifically, we will be aiming to reduce variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of using optical density (OD).

"
Nanjing-China,2014,Team:Nanjing-China#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," some result that can evaluate             the efficiency of our riboswitch.
       Some important equations:
The η is the difference between high and low RFP level. The EC50 is the effective ligand concentration             at which a half maximal response is achieved. The P(L=0) is basal RFP level. The P(L∞)             is ligand-saturating RFP level. They are all measurements of the efficiency of the riboswitch.             We often expect a riboswitch with higher η, lower EC50, lower P(L=0), higher P(L→∞).
From the table, we know MC10 has a very obvious change with the combination of the ligand, while MC31,             MC7, MC3 all has a low EC50, a good symbol for low concentration toxin detection.
We also get some similar results by modeling the circuit.[ Details of circuit will be listed in the attachments.]
The result of circuit model is in accordance with results from the formula in the paper.
Using model and formula, we can test the efficiency of designed riboswitches and offer data for the model of detection system.
Using pattern formation mentioned in reference [27], we can realize quantitative measurement of toxins.
From modeling[ The concentration of ligand here is 0.01mol/L.] in the riboswitch section,             we know luxI will become stable in about 2×104>s and the stable concentration is about 1.05×10-4mol/L.             AHL will turn stable in about 8 hours, and the stable concentration is 0.0165mol/L. As we didn’t             consider the influence of diffusion when handling sender cells, these values may be a just little             different form the actual situation. However, the difference will be really little as the diffusion             process is really slow. It is a reasonable estimation that speed of the AHL losing in diffusion is             about 1.0×10-10mol/L.
Then we can create a model made of a large circle with a radius of 5cm and a small circle with a             radius of 0.1cm. The two circles are concentric with their center on (0 , 0).             The small circle stands for the cells that produce AHL, while the large circle stands             for the plate we use. AHL will continuously come out from the small circle. The space             between two circles are what we will do research in.
