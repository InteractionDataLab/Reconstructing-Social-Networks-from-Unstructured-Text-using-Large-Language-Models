The video seen above display a considerably slowed droplet generation procedure. The reaction mixture comes from the side and stable droplets are made by cutting the water phase with inert carrier oil. The collected emulsion is incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. 10 µL of the emulsion is stained with SyBr green to and imaged at 488 nM to validate the amplification of DNA inside droplets in a digital PCR manner. ADisplays the emulsion off the chip and the fluorescence of droplets stained with Sybr Green. The occupancy of droplet is kept at 1 template per 10 droplets (Poisson distribution lambda = 0.1) in order to remove the chance of partitioning two templates in a single droplet.
Figure 11. Droplet MDA reaction product comparison to analogous in bulk reaction product. Circulized DNA templates were encapsulated into 50 pL droplets together with MDA reaction reagents (Droplet). The same reaction reagent concentrations were used for 20 µL in bulk MDA reaction (In bulk). Both of the reaction were incubated 30oC for 6 hours. The amplified DNA was analyzed using agarose gel.
Additionally, amplified DNA product is analysed in agarose gel. As seen from the figure 11, the set reaction conditions work perfectly with droplet MDA reaction. The droplet reaction produces a much sharper and cleaner DNA band as opposed to in bulk reaction smeared DNA. These results arise from the fact that each single DNA template is compartmentalized in separate water in oil droplets (Rhee et al., 2016). therefore there is no template switching between different templates and each droplet has a fixed population of reagents for the amplification. Based on these results it could be concluded that single DNA template is amplified in picoliter droplets and produces cleaner DNA fragments compared to analogous in bulk reaction.

Droplet MDA reaction with standard cytidines or 5-methylcytdines amplified product agarose gel analysis.MDA reaction were performed with standard (dCTP) and 5-methylated (5mC) cytidines in 50 pL droplets.

""The use of Cyano Fuel could change our relation to basic materials from an industrial matter into a personal one.""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
Do you have lakes near your home that are choked green with algal bloom? If so, you need Cyano Fuel Pump!  Our product not only allows you to control ugly and poisonous contamination by algae and cyanobacteria, it also converts these green pests into fuel. Based on natural jellyfish technologies, Cyano Fuel Pump is a green way of dealing with algal bloom.
Technical Description
The technology of this product is based on the symbiotic relationship seen between some species of jellyfish and algae. We conceived the product as containing millions of spinning cells that filter the algae from the water, trapping them and converting their photosynthesized sugars into fuel.

Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry. Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. (Insert examples here...)
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterized the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the biobrick registry because they do not conform to the Biobrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

Safe project design
The safety aspect of our project was always in our minds while working, since the primary goal of the sun badge is to be used outside of the lab. We decided to design it in a way that would prevent our modified bacteria from escaping into the environment. The badge includes a ring filled with bleach which is mixed with the bacteria contained into the capsule once it has been used. The bleach will rapidly kill the bacteria and ensure that no one of them can escape.
Although it ensures that no bacteria will leave the badge alive when discarding it, another biosafety mechanism could be used in case of a capsule leak or even a break upon a hit. One way to prevent this kind of escape road is the introduction of a kill switch inside our bacteria. Several kill switches have been designed and registered as biobricks by multiple iGEM teams during the past years. The implementation of one of them would add another barrier and lower even more the risk of our bacteria escaping.
Environment concern
We decided to make our badge in a way that limits its impact on the environment. The badge is mostly made out of Polylactic Acid, which is a biodegradable polymer. The badge is also fully reusable. The support can be kept by the user and the two other parts can be easily cleaned and replenished. The badge is also fully manufacturable using only 3D printers and polymers that are easily accessible.
Public Commitment
We noticed that synthetic biology is not yet a common topic among students. In order to explain our project in front of a large audience and at the same time introduce what synthetic biology actually consists in, we decided to collaborate with ""Café Numérique"" . The concept is to attend a presentation and then participate in a debate with a good Belgian beer in your hands. We started the conference with the presentation of our IGEM project and then we had the pleasure to discuss with Gauthier Chapelle. He is a scientist who worked as scientist officer for the International Polar Foundation, he promoted Biomimicry in Europe and he is now a co-founder of a sustainability consultancy firm."

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," our liquid cell cultures with 1% xylose solution until an absorbance reading of 1.0 at A600 was achieved. We made several replicates of these cultures and generated a reference curve involving change in absorbance reading as a function of 1% xylose added. This way, future cultures can be diluted more efficiently.
Finally, our team was happy to receive the B. subtilis parts we ordered from iGEM HQ. These were in the form of a liquid culture, so we incubated them shortly after. We also received the custom primers we requested from the University of Calgary synthesis lab the week prior. These were diluted immediately and stored safely for future use. Now that we have the B. subtilis parts, the custom primers, and ample B. subtilis glycerol stocks, we will transform our B. subtilis with the Detective team’s genetic circuit as soon as possible.
Week 8: June 16 - 20
By the beginning of this week, we had in our possession a sufficient supply of B. subtilis integration vectors (SacA, thrC, amyE) and began tinkering with them. However, the iGEM registry stated that the integration vectors needed to be linearized with the ScaI restriction enzyme before any transformations could take place. Upon a closer look at the ScaI enzyme, we soon discovered that it had two cut sites, although we required only one. We carried out restriction digests on our vectors of interest to confirm that ScaI cuts them only once and refrains from cutting in unwanted places. The restriction digest of our SacA vector met our expectations, but we decided to conduct a second set of digests for the other vectors.
Our team also continued with the ligations from last week, attempting to combine GFP with the Pveg+RBS ligation product we had created earlier. Both the first and second attempts failed, but we decided to try a third time towards the end of the week. Samples of DNA from previous weeks were also sent to the sequencing centre and the results came in quickly.
We prepared for the transformation of B. subtilis - a major milestone of our project - by preparing M9 minimal media, inducing supercompetency in our B. subtilis, and linearizing the integration vectors. With our B. subtilis colonies almost ready to be transformed, we worked together to gather as quickly as possible the parts necessary to build our reporter system (i.e., the genetic circuit). Although we were busy in the lab this week, we also kept the"

3.College Professor
In the afternoon of July 24th, we interviewed Mr. Wu (Wu Weixing) from the law school, Nanjing University. Mr. Wu is a scholar studying the environmental law and environmental administration.
We introduced our project briefly to him firstly, and then we consulted some of the legal issues related to our project. What we consulted was divided into three aspects:
the policies of heavy metal pollution and  water pollution;
the government's supports for the  development of the relevant technology;
the legal basis for the application of  biotechnology.
In the first aspect, we focused on two problems. One problem is that the regulations on the heavy metal pollution are vague with weak enforcement; another problem is about the necessity for the further legislation and regulation of the heavy metal pollution.
As to the first problem, Mr. Wu told us that the current standard is actually a relatively early one, and the latest one is only a judicial interpretation. Because of the serious pollution caused by heavy metals in these years, it is hard to make more detailed and revised laws in a short time, but the judicial interpretation has been able to greatly strengthen the enforcement of the standard.
On the second problem about the further legislation, the attitude of Mr. Wu is negative. He explained that the heavy metal pollution is a cross-field pollution, so it can be cataloged into atmosphere, water or soil pollution so as to have a hierarchical supervision. What’s more, relevant laws have been or are about to be implemented. So there is no need or trend to have the heavy metal pollution in a more detailed or specific legislation.
In the second aspect, we questioned the supportive policies on new environmental technologies from the national and local government. We put forward that the time of the policies’ issuing is early and the incentive is not obvious, so is it necessary to have a further promotion of the policies? However, Mr. Wu held a different view. He believed that the support from the government is important but not indispensable because of two reasons. Firstly, the fund for environment technology comes from various sources such as the provincial research fund and Nanjing local government’s investment. Secondly, with the growing concern towards the pollution, the amendment and the government’s implement of laws have been launched. And it offers an optimistic background to the development of new environmental technologies.
In view of the fact that our project’s target is pollution control and recycling, Mr. Wu gave us more advice on how to use policies and funds to"

Motivation
This year the Imperial College iGEM team has developed an innovative, self-contained drug fabrication and delivery system. In our 'E.ncapsulator', Escherichia coli will be engineered not only to efficiently manufacture important biopharmaceuticals, but also to coat and protect protein based drugs until release in the small intestine.
Modularity
We have divided the manufacturing process into 3 modules. The first module involves engineering E. coli to synthesise the protein drug of interest. In the second module, the E. coli coats itself in a layer of colanic acid. The third module, genome deletion, is where genetic material of the bacteria is cut.
Manufacturing novelty
The self-encapsulation of a synthetic biology chassis represents a completely novel and innovative approach to biopharmaceutics. Throughout the project we have followed an engineering approach that incorporates modular design, detailed modelling and simulation as well as systematic integration.

Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html," then be able to drop off the ER and travel into nuclear to execute its recombinase activity. Bi-activity is indeed an interesting feature, and we managed to make use of it by designing two different backbones applying loxPs with different direction to them, named “excision model” and “inversion model” correspondingly.
In “excision model”, two loxPs face the same direction, intermediate sequences will be excised, which makes repression lines of TM relatively easy to draw --- you only need to put the repressed elements into the excised sequence. When we refer to activation lines, things start to be a little difficult: in traditional TM expression system, a barricading sequence is inserted into the intermediate sequence to prevent target protein from expression, but in our “excision model”, there would be a lot of things lie within the intermediate sequence, such as promoters and expression cassetes, which make it better not to transcribe the entire intermediate sequence. How to achieve TM-on when transcription have to be stopped somewhere between two loxP? Our solution is to use self-cleave ribozyme.
Ribozyme is a RNA sequence that can execute enzymatic activity, mostly endo-nuclease activity. There are many examples where scientists successfully use and modify drug-inducible ribozyme to perform boolean calculation. The ribozyme we use is a hammerhead self-cleave ribozyme, derived from 3’UTR of mouse Clec2 gene. If a mRNA strand contain a ribozyme, it will undergo degradation before it can be translated. Based on that, we plan to put this ribozyme into the intermediate sequence between two loxPs to degrade C&D. When TM is added, sequence between two loxPs will then be excised, along side with ribozymes. Thus C&D transcripts will be able to survive and translate.
Compare to “excision model”, things are less straight forward in “inversion model”, so we skip to show how we carry it out step by step, but give our answer to this puzzle directly later in next paragraph. 
By the way, Cre recombinase actually recognizes not only loxP sequence, but also some of its variant, like lox2272. To be honest, circuit design would be a lot easier if we use several pairs of orthogonal loxP variants. Yet we challenged a tougher brainstorming that only one kind of loxP is allowed to use in both of our models.

As a team interested in building a good wiki we liked to know which iGEM team pages were the most popular. To get     the best data for inspiration, we made a web application for ranking all teampages by views. Using this application     we can search for the current best pages. There is even an option to filter for a certain team and/or subpage. Of     course, this application is now publically available on our wiki! We find this application helpful and we hope     other iGEM teams will use it to better their own wiki.

Colonies from the transformation of Pxyl and BBa_K081005 with dspB optimized + rsaA in pMR10 were picked, freeze-thawed, and PCR amplified using M13F and M13R.  These were run on a gel ( Figure ).  PrsaA + dspB optimized + rsaA appears to have been transformed and BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA may have been.  A conjugation was performed on PrsaA + dspB optimized + rsaA.  To check BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA, the transformation product was Miniprepped and digested and run on a gel again but the digestion did not appear to have worked.  More colonies of BBa_K081005 + dspB optimized + rsaA were checked through colony PCR ( Figure ) and a miniprep of colony 1 was PCR amplified but showed the wrong size fragment ( Figure ). The transformation of Pxyl + dspB optimized + rsaA was redone with a fresh digest of Pxyl with SpeI and PstI from a new miniprep. 6 colonies from this transformation plate were picked, freeze-thawed, PCR amplified and run on a gel but showed no desired fragment ( Figure ).  8 more colonies were colony PCR amplified and run on a gel ( Figure ).  Colony 12 showed the correct band size and was digested with EcoRI and PstI and then transformed into pMR10.  Colonies from the transformation of Pxyl + dspB optimized + rsaA into pMR10 were colony PCR amplified and run on a gel ( Figure ).

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Justin Dole
Biological Sciences (2nd Year)
Heading into my second undergraduate year, I can undoubtedly say that the past few months have helped put my academic knowledge into context. I held various roles this summer, but was ultimately in charge of qualitative modelling using Autodesk Maya. This has been my first year with iGEM; the exposure to various disciplines has allowed me to see the interconnectivity between synthetic biology, engineering, and business. Besides waiting for the lab computer to process 22GB of RAM, I take pride in eating well, exercising regularly, sleeping in, and picking flowers for my Mom. I two-strap my backpack, have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and medicine, and love anything with an engine to the point that I consider myself obsessed.
Su Wang
Chemical Engineering (4th Year)
I am a chemical engineering student with a specialization in biomedical engineering. Prior to join iGEM I have been doing researches in chemical engineering labs for thermodynamics or in-situ oil upgrading. Those were professor-driven research projects where even though I had good experiences, there was little I could do to test my own hypothesis. That's why I came for iGEM; for the student driven research aspect. Here I wish to combine with what I have learned from system biology class, with my training in modelling, to work on things that interest me!

This summer was my first year being involved in iGEM and a wet lab setting. I was fortunate to be a member of the TALEs team where I have learned so much about synthetic biology, bacterial genetics, and general lab practices.

Squalene Epoxide and Lanosterol Synthase Binding Model
Aim
The aim of a model describing the binding between squalene epoxide and lanosterol synthase is to find the optimum concentration and binding rates that we require for visual detection of squalene epoxide in the fingermark sample from the crime scene. The more squalene epoxide and lanosterol synthase that bind the more likely it will be that squalene epoxide will be visually detected.
Results
Squalene epoxide is an intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Squalene epoxide is degraded into lanosterol, a precursor for cholesterol by lanosterol synthase. These reactions can be described by the schematic:
$$   \ce{LS + SE<=>[K_{1}][K_{2}] PC ->[K_{3}] La}.  $$
Where \(LS\) is the concentration of lanosterol synthase, \(SE\) is the concentration of squalene epoxide, \(PC\) is the concentration of the 1st intermediate, protosterol cation, and \(La\) is the concentration of lanosterol, the full complex. \(K_{1}\), \(K_{3}\) are the forward reaction rates, and \(K_{2}\) is the reverse reaction rate.
The initial concentration of squalene epoxide was defined to be \(SE_{0}\) and two parameters of the system were defined as:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation*} \lambda=\frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}} SE_{0}, \qquad \gamma=\frac{K_{3}}{K_{2}}. \end{equation*} } $$
The initial concentration of lanosterol synthase was defined to be \(LS_{0}\) and the ratio between initial concentrations was defined as:
$$ \large{ \begin{equation*} v_{0}=\frac{LS_{0}}{SE_{0}}. \end{equation*} } $$ Sensitivity analysis was performed to find the optimum values for the two parameters, \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\), and the ratio, \(v_{0}\) which give the highest concentration of the final complex, lanosterol. Consider \(\lambda\) and \(\gamma\) first by setting \(v_{0}\) as the suggested value from (Eq 7) and setting a range of values for \(\gamma"

Workshop and Lecture
To educate students at a variety of levels, a 2nd year university lecture and a workshop at two different high schools for senior students was conducted.
• In the university lecture, students with prior knowledge of genetic engineering were introduced to the field of synthetic biology. The  concept of the ‘BioBrick’ and the importance of the Gibson Assembly technique was highlighted.
• A question based on the lecture content was designed and integrated into the students mid-term exam .
• In the school workshops, the fundamentals of molecular biology and a basic introduction into synthetic biology were given.
• Theory was supported with hands-on activities which allowed students and iGEM mentors to communicate effectively and answer any questions asked.
Open Day
Macquarie University Open Day
• Macquarie University Open Day attracts a broad audience, ranging from children of all ages to potential students and adults of all ages.
• We found this platform to be an ideal opportunity to further extend awareness and education of synthetic biology and the importance of our project.
• We conducted a range of laboratory activities for people to actively engage in and a record-high turnout resulted.
Public Conference
Organisation of First Synthetic Biology Workshop in Australia
• Australian universities participation in the international iGEM project has significantly decreased over time. However, Macquarie University’s participation has remained consistent since 2010.
• We aim to highlight the importance of Synthetic Biology to the Australian Academic community and, more importantly, educate other Australian Universities as to how they also can participate in the iGEM competition. Our long term  hopes are to  increase the participation of Australian University teams in iGEM and eventually host an Oceania iGEM Jamboree event.
Collaboration Project
Strange Nature- SydneyUni_Australia iGEM team
• Our collaborative approach involved providing mentoring assistance for Sydney University iGEM team who were participating for the first time in iGEM. We provided mentoring to them during the initial stages of this competition.
• Macquarie University also cooperated with Sydney University by contacting potential judges for the ‘Strange Nature’ creative writing competition. We also publicised this initiative to English and Science Departments at Australian High Schools to provide as many high school students as possible with the opportunity to participate.

French iGEMers discussion
Summer 2014 – the Parisian teams (Bettencourt, Evry and Saclay) decided to organize a French meetup at Paris-Sud University. They were joined by Bordeaux and Lyon.
During the event, our team suggested to raise some ethical issues about synthetic biology and Bio-Art as our project is based on ethical reflection. We thought that having the points of view of teams in other tracks would be interesting.
Bio-art
To begin the discussion, we asked what Bio-art meant to the participants. This question provoked a heated debate, as it is very difficult to obtain a specific definition. Indeed, Bio-art can include many things because there are no exact boundaries for what constitutes ""art."" A simple modification of a bacterium could be seen as Bio-art, as well as a ""modification"" of a human body. Behind the meaning of art, there is much human thought and interpretation. Science and art are similar when they look for something new.  Since Bio-art involves biology and art, an important question was raised: what aspect should be more represented? Is one of these two aspects more visible than the other? For instance, if the scientific aspect is more visible, we may miss the artistic trait"

Dev, Jeremy, and Chris's spread plates of the Ampicillin and Kanamycin plasmid backbones from the Parts Registry.
Alex's and Patrick's spread plates. Photograph taken at 8:48am June 8th, 2010.
Today, we spent most of the day making overnight cultures from the transformed plates that were made yesterday. As a group, we began getting fundraising underway by finding contacts, dividng them among each person and setting a tentative goal of $20 000 to fundraise from corporate sponsors. We also organized how the money given from Alberta Innovates would be used
Chris, Jeremy, and Dev
Most of the growth on the plates were red, indicating that the placeholder gene was being transcribed and successfully produced. Our group spent today making overnight cultures so plasmid transfers could be done tomorrow. We made the cultures for plasmids pSB1A3, pSB1K2, pSB1AC3 and pSB1AK3 as well as restreaking the colonies that were used  to innoculate the overnight cultures. Jeremy also transformed I732005 (lacZ gene for B-galactosidase) into competent cells so they could be used.
Alex and Patrick
The ampicillin spread plates of the R0040 and E0430 parts grew successfully. We prepared an overnight culture of two colonies from each plate, totalling 8 Falcon tubes. Each colony innoculated was also restreaked on new ampicillin plates in the event that we require them again. We also helped Himika help Emily miniprep her parts.
Himika
I made overnight cultures from B0034 (the RBS that we all need) and B0015 (the double terminator for the end of all our circuits).

We also tested DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid as well as the ester mixture with no cells as controls. Figure 2 Shows the results from this experiment.
Figure 2: The top row shows centrifuge tubes containing the 4-nitrophenol ester reaction mixture for the palmitate (a) and octanoate (b) esters with no cells added. The middle row shows the response for a negative control where DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid were added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrophenyl-palmitate (c) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (d). The bottom row shows the response for the BBa_K2694000 circuit transformed into DH5⍺ cells when added to reaction mixtures containing 4-nitrophenyl-palmitate (e) or 4-nitrophenyl-octanoate (f). All reaction mixtures were 1mM of the nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer.
From these results, we concluded that our bacteria was indeed cleaving the substrates, resulting in the green color. The clear control remained in the controls, showing that it was our part specifically that was inducing this change.
Quantitative Testing
Once we had shown that our bacteria could cleave the substrates to some extent, we wanted to try to show this more quantitatively. In collaboration with the University of Calgary’s iGEM team, we designed an experiment to test our reaction in a time course, using their spectrophotometer, in order to more accurately determine the color change.
Graph 1 shows all our data for the absorbance values (measured at 400nm) for BBa_K2694000 breaking down 4-nitrophenyl octanoate with and without IPTG. Our control started at 0 and ended at 0.002. All other samples increased for about 660 seconds and then started to level out. This graph shows that our part, BBa_k2694000 in E.coli was producing the EstA protein because the solution got progressively more green with the introduction of our bacteria, but without the bacteria the control did not change colour.

maybe exchange domains with domains from other pathways
Müller Plasmid -> new problem of 11 restriction sites
How do we want to assemble NRPS modules in our project?
maybe Berkeley RFC21 standard because it works very good for our gene clusters
compatible with linkers
allows fusion protein

mix and match domains not using biobrick standard but another strategy
it is too much work to get our parts conform to RFC10 and the NRPS-pathways are not realy compatible with RFC10 at all
after first experiments consider codon optimized synthesis for part submission
other NRPS not standardised, but propose a new standard
few characterized parts are of more value than a hundret useless ones
conclusion
why not omit RFC and start with Gibson at the first point
get expertise in Gibson cloning (read papers)
Hanna and Julia (TA) should try Gibson assembly together

Engineering a Novel Synthetic System for Cancer Therapy & Diagnostics
The rapidly evolving field of synthetic biology holds tremendous therapeutic potential. Synthetic biology aims to design and construct facilities or biological systems with useful purposes, by using tools from biology, biotechnology, biochemistry and engineering. We are developing applications for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.         Despite the huge investment in research and the development of a variety of treatment methods, cancer is still a major cause of death in the world. Today, both surgical and pharmacological treatments against most types of cancer are not accurate enough to identify and treat the disease on a cellular level. On the other hand, novel biological treatments being developed were only found effective for a relatively small number of patients.
In cancer, many cellular and molecular processes take place, enabling the tumor to develop and spread in the body. We believe that it is possible to take advantage of the many typical biological mechanisms of cancer cells, by developing a synthetic biology-based system for identifying and treating cancer on a cellular level. Together as a team, we developed a modular system which identifies numerous genetic changes in cancer cells and responds by activating a synthetic machine that executes a cell suicide program or enables color-based ""tagging"" of the cells"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Health_-_-_TEXT.html," wonderful chemical compounds. Methods by which bacteria become resistant to antimicrobial agents include, 1) an alteration in permeability of bacterial cell wall to the antibiotic, 2) an alteration in the target binding sites on the bacteria, 3) use of an alternative metabolic pathway, 4) mutation on a gene  coding for antibiotic-destroying enzyme and 5) acquiring a new gene for an antibiotic-destroying enzyme. The genes that mediate antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between organisms of the same species (intra-transfer) and species of different genera (inter-transfer). As a result resistance to commonly used antibiotics can become widespread in previously susceptibility organisms. These genes (DNA) are transmitted by 4 mechanisms: transformation, transduction, conjugation and transposons. Some Gram-negative bacteria may acquire multiple resistance determinants gathered together on one of these transmissible elements thereby making the organisms difficult to treat and eradicate from hospital environment. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii containing these types of elements are good example of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens circulating in many hospitals, including our hospital here in Kuwait.
Question: How could the risk of future (infectious) outbreaks be reduced? Could we prevent this from happening?
Answer: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics help to exert selective pressure for these MDR bacteria. To eradicate the existing MDR organisms from the hospital environment all possible selective pressures must be avoided by judicious prescription and use of antibiotics and excluding the antibiotics to which the bacteria are resistant from susceptibility reports. The Hospital Infection Control (ICC) Unit of any hospital has an important role to play in the prevention of outbreaks. For successful prevention and control the infection control doctor/nurses must be very active and liaise regularly with the microbiology laboratory so as to be able to identify any potential outbreak early before it festers. We have an ICC in the hospital that meets every month or every 2 months and an infection control team (ICT) charged with the tasks of carrying out the day-to-day duties of the ICC. Education of healthcare providers on antibiotic stewardship, resistance surveillance and periodic publication of local antibiogram by the microbiology laboratory are also important.
Question: Are there any other therapeutic options except new or higher potency antibiotics to help in the battle against MDR organisms?
Answer: We have limited options for the treatment of infections caused by MDR bacteria. Unfortunately, the prospects of developing new anti-infective agents is very dim. The pipe-line is dry, as they say. The cost of production of antibiotics is extremely high and very few pharmaceutical companies are"

Ruth:
Modeller
I study mathematics and my role in the team is as a modeller. I wanted to take part in iGEM to have the opportunity to work with students from other disciplines and see how we inspire and learn from each other. In my spare time, I love playing sport, with my biggest achievement being playing basketball for the England u17 squad. As the basketball season is over for the summer, I am now focussing all my competitive spirit on iGEM and am determined to bring the BioBrick trophy to Nottingham! An interesting fact about me is that I am a test tube baby. I started life in the lab, so long as I’m not kidnapped by the wet lab team for in vivo experiments, I hope I won’t end it there…
Varun:
Human Practices & Outreach
I study History and American studies and my role in the team is Human Practices and Finance. I wanted to join iGEM to broaden my experience and work on a large global project, just like iGEM! My interests are in marketing and brand, which fits well with helping to manage our team’s social media pages. In my spare time, I love cooking (and eating!) as well as reading up on American politics and spending time with my friends. A fun fact about me is that I have lived my whole life in Nottingham- University of Nottingham was so great it made me want to stay in this amazing city for another 3 years!
Fatima
Glorious leader
I study Human Genetics and I work in the lab and help with finance/fundraising. iGEM was particularly appealing to me because anything that allows me to disassemble and reassemble things instantly has my attention (not to mention, I get to scare my family with not-so-scary biology). In my spare time, I spontaneously go on long walks without any real aim. Often times, I walk for more than 5"

iGEM CC
The iGEM China Community
With the motivation of better communication between teams in China, USTC and SYSU initiated an online community among teams from China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We named it iGEM China Community (iGEMCC).
Our goal
Our goal is to build an online community with all the Chinese teams. We all know that the number of teams from China is very large, which take up around a quarter of all the teams this year. That means one quarter of the iGEMers are speaking Chinese and we didn’t have an online community widely used by all Chinese iGEMers. We think that if all the team can participate in the construction processes of the community, it can become a more popular platform among all the Chinese iGEMers, and more students can benefit from this platform.
Progress
We started to contact other teams at the beginning of April and got many feedback from other teams. At first, we send an invitation letter to other teams’ contacts, inviting them to build this online community together. Many teams who joint us are very kind to contact more teams for us. Only with all the teams working together, can us able to build a QQ group for discussion with many representative from around 30 teams. So far, we have a QQ group with more than 150 iGEMers in it and the number is still growing.
Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Liu Minsheng (from HSAAHNU_Anhui), built a website ( http://igemcc.org/ ) introducing some basic information of this iGEM China Community. Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Han Jia (from JLU), are in charge of collecting contact information. Wu Yifan (from HIT) wrote a proposal for raising donations.
It is our honor to have many former iGEMers to give us advice. Many teams also have great ideas and very activate on the QQ group.

     First of our cloning process, we did PCR to acquire the product of GS Linker-αS1 casein DNA fragment. (Fig. 2) Next, we digested the fragment and ligated it to pET30a vector. Finally, we transformed the plasmid with GS Linker-αS1 casein to E. coli. BL21 DE3 and made protein expression.
Figure 2: PCR product of αS1-casein
Chip Production
1. Dip the gold chips in 10mM Mua, RT for 4hrs.
2. Wash the chips with 95% EtOH three times and dry.
3. Add EDC+NHS mixture (100+100mM in DDW) on chips, RT for 1hrs.
4. DDW rinse the chips and dry.
5. Add αS1-casein on chips, RT for 1hrs
6. Wash with PBS three times and dry.
7. Dip the chips in blocking solution, RT for 1.5hrs.
8. Wash with PBS three times and dry.
Detection Method
Electrochemistry Introduction
     After choosing αS1-casein as our bio-sensor, we used Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) method to detect curcumin containment.
Differential Pulse Voltammetry
     DPV uses the difference between before and after the pulse application in order to solve the influence of background noise. Thus, the sensitivity and stability of DPV is better than the common method of CV(cyclic voltammetry). We hope we can use this method to observe the obvious current change when detecting curcumin and create more accurate standard curve in advance.
Measurement Protocol of Curcumin Bio-sensor
1. Add the diluted curcumin samples on our bio-sensor to react for 30min.
2. Rinse with wash buffer and dry the chips.
3. Wash the reference and counter electrodes with DDW, and dry them.
4. Set up the three electrodes system within electrochemical cell. (Fig. 3, left)
5. Use the prototype of electrochemical machine to measure the DPV method. (Fig.3, right)

Discovery Festival
28-29 September 2012, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Rotterdam - link
Discovery festival is an annual science and arts festival that takes place at the night of 28 September.         Previous years, the festival was only held in Amsterdam, this year it was extra huge with a festival in         Eindhoven, Rotterdam and Amsterdam at the same time! Together with iGEM Amsterdam, iGEM Eindhoven and         iGEM Wageningen we represented iGEM at all three locations. Visitors could experience how synthetic biology works        in our improvised laboratory, explore the possibilities and give suggestions for cool synthetic        biology projects themselves.
We had a great time with the iGEM team from Amsterdam. The visitors were very enthousiastic to see what we do on a regular day in the lab. They were provided with insight on what you can do with bacteria. Most of the audience did not know the existence of synthetic biology so we hope that we gave them a bit more insight in this topic.
Transnatural
17-18 September 2012, Amsterdam - link
Of the European iGEM teams who applied, we were selected to speak at the conference of the  Transnatural Festival in Nemo, Amsterdam!         This festival is held every two years and aims to highlight art, science and technology in which state-of-the-art technology goes together with nature.         This year’s theme was “smart as matter”. You can find some pictures on the presentation page!

For the human practices component of our project, we first investigated the practical and ethical challenges of deploying our balloon into space.  The most important challenge we ran into was the problem of planetary protection: making sure that our balloon would not contaminate the areas we explored.  We met with several experts in space exploration at NASA who helped us think about how we might design our balloon to be most useful to planetary scientists while also taking precautions against contamination.  These conversations framed our project design. To learn more please visit our main project page here
• Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected (see BBa_K2027001 ). Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
• Collaborate with another registered iGEM team in a significant way. Learn about our collaboration with Exeter here.
• Identify, investigate, and address human practices issues in the context of our project. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project (see the Human Practices Hub for more information). Learn about our sustainability work on our practices page.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Also our sister team METU_TURKEY is our main collaborator.     They have provided feedback BioGUIDE at different stages of the development.     And they had the chance to analyze their constructs input/output relations     throughout this collaboration.
ALL TEAMS: The Parts Registry Survey that has been     developed by METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE got response from 253 of participant     from 94 teams. Analysis of the survey results we have received so far     indicates that we were able outreach to the iGEM community and help     them verbalize their concerns and suggestions for the parts registry     standards and the maintenance of the database.
WARSAW: Our team members have participated in their     survey abour iGEM participants profile.
METU_TURKEY: Beta testing of the algorithm developed     and the BioGUIDE software has been performed by METU_TURKEY on few case     studies. Additionally they have tested their construct for 2010 competition     with our algorithm.
Material
Our main data source for BIO Guide Software Program was the available     background information of parts distributed in 2010 iGEM plates (Total     of three384-well plates of dried DNA) to the wetlab teams. This data     was available through both the parts registry main website ( http://partsregistry.org/Main_Page )     in XML format and parts registry libraries (http://partsregistry.org/assembly/libraries.cgi?id=31)     in Excel format. Data from parts with specific part IDs have been parsed     with a custom code developed to modify SAX Parser. Then, the rest of     the data which needs to be standardized according to biological importance     have been extracted from the Registry of Parts Page manually. The chemical     (IPTG, galactose etc.) or physical (UV irradiation, temperature etc)     external inputs and proteins synthesized from a biobrick coding sequence     can affect promoters on the parts. These effectors are identified under     the title “Input”. And the “Output” s of these effectors are classified     as inducers (a molecule that starts gene expression), repressors (blocker     of attachment of RNA polymerase to promoter), activators (increasing     the rate of transcription) and inhibitor s(decreasing the rate of transcription).     These standardizations on the database helped us to build the algorithm     based on input/output relationships. MySQL Server is used for Database     development and organization.

Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#Team#Array_-_-_TEXT.html," assemble and prohibit the expression of ydaO. Without c-di-AMP the riboswitch cannot be established and ydaO will be expressed. Therefore, ydaO was a perfect candidate for us to build another reporter around it. As the microarray analysis revealed, the expression of ydaO was indeed affected by c-di-AMP levels. To further analyze these results, we did some qRT-PCR analysis back in Göttingen (Fig. 2).
Fig.2: qRT-PCR analysis of c-di-AMP affected ydaO and a of control gene. The analysis revealed that in comparison to the wild type ydaO is upregulated with low c-di-AMP levels.
Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that ydaO is upregulated with low c-di-AMP levels. This means that the expression of ydaO is supposedly linked to the c-di-AMP levels inside the cell.

Virginia,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Internal#Papers_-_-_TEXT.html," output and fuel consumption of the engine will be about the same.  Also, if we change another part of the car, such as the steering wheel than the performance of the engine will not be effected.  I think that refinement of devices is a major step for this industry and should be a major part of our goals this summer.  Refinement of these devices will eventually lead to abstraction. - Bussingkm 14:51, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Refinement refers to taking a natural part and making it compatible with some specific assembly standard.  For instance, in terms of the BioBrick assembly standard, a natural part must have the BioBrick restriction endonuclease sites removed to produce a synthetic part that can be used in BioBrick assembly. - Albergca 15:27, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
To refine a part is to find out more information about it, and organize it in a way that makes it more likely that the part, when used in conjunction with something else, will still have the desired function. It wants to get away from the “ad hoc” method so results can be more predictable. This article suggested datasheets with compatibility information on it. - Trentay 15:01, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Also, I found the signaling device that they used as an example rather confusing.  Just thought you should know. - Bussingkm 14:56, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard
Is the method of measuring/characterizing promoters presented in this paper the method we should use in our work? - GMcArthurIV 11:28, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
This is a clear winner for the method of measuring and characterizing promoters.  This method reduces irregularities due to different lab conditions and tools. An added bonus to using this method is that iGEM has built and distributed a kit for this method which is designed for undergraduate researchers. I think that this method is an excellent step toward standardization of practice in the field.  - Bussingkm 14:38, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
This can be helpful. I do remember the article saying that the promoters that were tested and compared to the reference standard, had to be “standardized” first (p.9 under Standard promoter definition). Would we have to do something like this before we can use the RPU measurement talked about in this paper? Is that what the"

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," C end of the Gα subunit that originally interact with GPCR to be expressed in human body could increase the coupling efficiency. It’s also been suggested that interruption of the endogenous pheromone receptor ste2 in yeast of a mating type, as well as two modulators in wild type yeast, would increase the strength and signal/noise ratio of the reporting signal, as showed in fig 2. Modulator far1 can be activated by pheromone in wild type yeast, and traps the cell cycle; sst2 is another modulator, which catalyzes GTP that binds to Gpa1 to transform into GDP, thus negatively regulates the activity of Gpa1.
fig 2. Modified a-typed Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ste2, far1 and sst2 are knockout, five amino acids at C terminal are replaced with their counterparts in human G protein.
Four kind of histamine receptors have been described in human, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3 and HRH4, all of which are GPCRs. HRH3 and HRH4 has relatively higher affinity to histamine. In our project, as showed in fig 3, we try to equip Gpa1 modified yeasts with human histamine receptor HRH4 and EGFP reporter gene under control of Fus1 promoter, to give out dosage dependent signal output when incubated in solution containing histamine. A simple hardware was also developed to provide real time monitoring of yeast concentration and the strength of signal output in a quantitative manner. The hardware also contains a vibration module to prevent yeast cells from precipitation during incubation.
fig 3. Design of yeast whole cell histamine sensor.
Preliminary experiments suggested that yeast could grow well in human serum. The ultimate goal of our project is to implement a novel allergen test method (fig 4): the tester collects blood sample, directly adds certain allergen into whole blood, separates serum by centrifugation, incubates engineered yeast cells in serum with and without serum treatment respectively, measures the signal strength with our hardware, then the test results can be read of from the screen.

Their bioreactor holds 3.4 million litres, and retention time in the bioreactor is 9 days, way longer than most literature states keratinase activity should take, which leads us to assume that our construct could potentially very well be implemented into their system. Before the water leaves the plant, it gets treated to remove all of this bacteria and eukaryotes by using sand and anthracite filtration, as well as UV radiation to ensure that any remaining “bugs” were dead.
Because we know that most plants utilize a bacterial treatment, as well as have additional treatment measures to get rid of the bacteria later, we know that it is definitely a possibility to add our construct into the existing treatment systems, but incorporating it in a place where keratin waste is an issue, as well as implementing it into numerous plants, each with its unique system would prove challenging. When we visited Banff’s treatment plant, they told us that our construct would be extremely useful to them, but would be hard to implement into the existing systems. From this we decided to design a stand alone bioreactor prototype for use in testing within our lab, as well as potential implementation into the poultry industry, where there is less variation of their systems, rather than trying to incorporate our bioreactor into a pre-existing system.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!

Bio-electric Interface:
Background
Part of our project involves focusing on designing, constructing and testing a user-friendly bio-electric interface. Our idea was to create a standardised and regulated electron export system that would work in Escherichia coli as well as other bacteria. As a result, this system would create an output measurable by simple electronic methods, making the whole process easy and reliable. The bio-electric interface would connect the biological and electronic systems and allow integration of biological devices with computers via the generation of electrons.
Our ultimate is to achieve a non-toxic, portable and user-friendly device. We've decided to use the molecular electron export machinery genes from the organism Shewanella oneidensis and half fuel cells to measure the change in potential over time, reflecting the export of electrons outside the cell.
Shewanella oneidensis is one of the organisms known to produce electricity. It gives it an evolutionary advantage over its competitors by allowing S. oneidensis to utilise a multitude of extracellular electron acceptors. Even though the S. oneidensis electron export system is a complicated, multi-component molecular machinery, Jensen et al [1] demonstrated that the mtrCAB gene cluster is sufficient to engineer an efficient extracellular electron transport system. As such, we've decided to research and model"

Genes: XYL1: XR (NAD(P)H-linked xylose reductase), XYL2: XDH (NAD+ linked xylitol dehydrogenase), XYL3: XK (xylulose kinase)
Function: Creates xylose assimilation pathway
Organism: E. coli
Genes: adhE (NADH-consuming acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ￼(AADH))
Function: Acetate reduction pathway to reduce acetate to ethanol. Also couples to XR-XDH pathway to use surplus NADH to reduce acetate and produce NAD+ for xylose assimilation pathway.
Combined genes: Yeast strain EJ3
Origins: Yeast strain SR8 (Constructed in lab by optimizing strain D452-2)
Optimized Genes: XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3. ALD6 (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) was deleted to minimize acetate accumulation
EJ4
Yeast Strain EJ4-a was produced by serial subcultures of EJ3. EJ4 consumed cellobiose by a rate of  200% more than EJ3. Strain EJ4 had higher copies of gh1-1 (18) and cdt-1 (4) than strain EJ3 (6 copies of gh1-1 and 2 copies of cdt-1). Compared to the the control strain, EJ4-c, EJ4-a produced substantially more ethanol and lower accumulation of byproducts. EJ4-a and EJ4-c also had similar growth curves even though EJ4-a used ATP for the acetate reduction pathway.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," established a dialogue and encouraged discussion. Attending the N8 Crop and Agriculture Innovation Conference made us aware of the barriers which must be overcome to increase uptake of biosensors (find out more about N8 on our gold human practices page ). Alongside other factors which we have identified and tackled through experimental and design adaptation, communication between scientists and the public is an aspect which we have considered in our aim of addressing uptake of biosensors and synthetic biology. In our work, we used different perspectives and methods to investigate science communication. By gaining advice from academics working in the humanities and social sciences, and completing our own engagement and research, we have taken a journey through science communication and considered how this can help the success of our project.
Science Communication
The main output detailing our research into Science Communication can be found here . This report describes findings from investigating how synthetic biology is currently communicated to the public.
Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines
As a culmination of our research into science communication, we have complied a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology to the public. These guidelines can be used for different purposes, including: to advise scientists when communicating about their work to the press; to guide in how to present to the public; and to help iGEM teams writing up their work! The guidelines start with some more general points to consider when you start to communicate synthetic biology. They also make use of the information we gained during the science communication research to suggest some more specific linguistic features to consider when communicating synthetic biology. Read the guidlines here: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?
Legislation
As well as tackling legislative issues affecting biosensors, which were brought up by Dr Chris French (read more about this on our gold human practices page ), by creating an optimised cell free system in the lab, we also looked at the process of getting authorisation for the use of GMO in the environment, here in the UK. We contacted the Advisory Committee for Release into the Environment (ACRE), as all GMO approvals go through this committee, to inquire about the process we would need to take to get a GMO-based biosensor approved for use. We spoke to Ivy Wellman, who works for the committee as part of Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and she was able to shed light on the situation with the following email: “Hi Declan   No worries, and thanks for confirming your position. I thought that it might be useful to pen something to you for your future reference so here’s what’s required for an application to deliberately release (DR) a (non-plant) GMO"

DTU
Our initial plan was to both create and test microfluidic devices and the tools not only in E.coli, but also to manufacture and test it for yeast.  However, as we lacked some necessary  components in order to work with yeast we asked the iGEM team of the Technological University of Denmark (DTU) for assistance, which we knew after the Nordic iGEM Conference worked with yeasts. They supplied us with both a strain and required shuttle vectors, which we would have used if we had been able to perform the Yeast tests.   DTU later contacted us back regarding help with their shuttle vector between E. coli and Y. lipolitica. They were trying to insert chromoproteins into the shuttle vector, but had so far been unsuccessful. As we had chromoproteins in stock from prior iGEM Uppsala teams, we moved one of the chromoproteins from the psB1A3 backbone into the shuttle vector. To simplify the assemblies we first moved the standard RFP producing insert into the previously empty insert site of the shuttle vector. Visual analysis was done in order to compare overnight production of the chromoprotein and RFP in the shuttle vector to the production of the proteins in the standard psB1A3 backbone. The comparison was done with E. coli cells transformed with the empty shuttle vector as control. These tests showed no observable difference in the production of chromoproteins in the shuttle vector compared to psB1A3.
Aalto-Helsinki
The Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team helped us by supplying us with protocols for working with yeast.
Stockholm
To try their linker between spiderweb and a protein the Stockholm iGEM team asked for the UnaG protein. As UnaG requires the cofactor bilirubin to fluoresce, which can both be added and washed away, it is a good protein for characterization. We therefore assembled a plasmid with RBS and UnaG under the control of the specifically requested T7 promoter"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Equations for gene networks
In this paragraph, mathematical modeling for gene and protein interactions will be described.
Binding of a ligand to a molecule: Hill equation
The fraction of a molecule saturated by a ligand ( = the probability that the molecule is bound to a ligand) can be expressed as a function of ligand concentration using Hill equation:
Prob: the probability that the molecule is bound to the ligand
[L]: concentration of the ligand
K50: dissociation constant. It is the concentration producing a probability of 0.5
n: Hill coefficient. It describes binding cooperativity
Regulated transcription
Transcription of a mRNA molecule can be regulated by transcription factors in active form. These factors can be activators or inhibitors: they respectively increase and decrease the probability that RNA polymerase binds the promoter. This probability must be function of active transcription factor concentration and can be modeled using Hill equation. If factor in active form activates transcription, we can write:
Prob: probability that the gene is transcripted
[T]: concentration of the transcription activator in active form
K50: dissociation constant. It is the concentration producing a probability of 0.5
n: Hill coefficient (n>0)
while, if factor in active form inhibits transcription, we are interested in unbound promoter and so we can write:
Prob: probability that the gene is transcripted
[T]: concentration of the transcription inhibitor in active form
K50: dissociation constant. It is the concentration producing a probability of 0.5
n: Hill coefficient (n>0)
The equations show that:
In activation formula, if [T]=0 the trascription probability is Prob=0, while the maximum probability, Prob=1, is reached asymptotically for [T]->Inf
In inhibition formula, if [T]=0 the trascription probability is Prob=1, while the minimum probability, Prob=0, is reached asymptotically for [T]->Inf
These formulas can be included in a differential equation that can describe the dynamic behavior of a mRNA molecule as a function of the factor that regulates its transcription.
ODE for activated transcription
Vmax: maximum transcription rate
[m]: concentration of mRNA molecule
[T]: concentration of the transcription activator in active form
K50: dissociation constant
n: Hill coefficient (n>0)
delta: mRNA degradation constant
a: leakage factor that can modellize promoter basic activity. It is a percentage of Vmax
ODE for inhibited transcription
Vmax: maximum transcription rate
[m]: concentration of mRNA molecule

Hong_Kong_UCCKE,2016,Team:Hong Kong UCCKE#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," around the respondent's opinion on the Innovation and Technology Bureau, the general impression on the government support for scientific research and their own level of interest for scientific research. There are are overlapping questions to check whether the respondents are self contradicting.
Discussion
After we have invited people to fill the questionnaire, we have received 47 responses from different people. Since the very majority of the respondent is student, 95.7% of the respondent is student, the results is mostly showing the student’s opinion. The rate of student’s  parent working in the research field is also low, at only 6.4%. This is expected since being a researcher as occupation in Hong Kong receive a generally low salary,which translate to the difficulties to sustain the family.
As for student’s cognition for the new Innovation and Technology Bureau, nearly 75 % of respondent did know what it is. For the 75% respondent who recognize what it is, 40%of people think that the Bureau has fulfilled its aim to Strengthen support for the innovation and technology sector where Strengthen support for the innovation and technology sector come in next, at  23.4%. We are honestly very surprised by this as the bureau is not too famous in hong Kong as it is too new and that not much policy has been made.
However, the response for Hong Kong government financial support to scientific research is more mixed as the the the data collected shows that about 55%of respondent does think the financial support for scientific research is enough. Respondents did not show a strong tendency in agree or disagree. We also ask for their reason to choose for the option. The response is mainly about the vast number of project that the government is subsidising will share the capital that  the government has invested.
We also ask the respondent to suggest some possible ways to promote scientific research. For providing economic support for research projects, it shows that there are no significant difference between the the the points that people comment. However we can still conclude that most people think this strategy is moderately to highly effective. For the holding talks and forum, most people think it is moderately effective. For promotion in public area, most people think it is moderately effective. For the promotion on social media, most people think it is highly effective.
Lastly, we ask respondent whether they will support local research by donating, more than one third of people feel comfortable with donating money to scientific research. It seems very promising as the general  public seem to accept scientific research in a fashion that they will donate money. In addition to that we ask respondent how likely they are going to participate in a future scientific research."

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree.

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," 12 display boards in total, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section.
Figure 1. we are explaining synthetic biology.
II DNA model building
     In this section, we taught the children to build a paper DNA double-helix model, provided by China Science and Technology Museum. Before starting to make the model, we introduced the knowledge of DNA to let them make sense of what DNA is and what function it has. Children participated in the activity in great passion and enjoyed the process. Everyone involved took home a wonderful model and our exquisite souvenirs.
Figure 2. children are building their DNA models.
III E.coli DIY workshop
     The purpose of this section was to develop ideas of synthetic biology in children’s mind using their imagination. We introduced how the scientists manipulate the gene in microbes to help them solve problems. Then we let the children design bacteria with a possible application using color pens in their hands. In the workshop, we were surprised by children’s creative thoughts from time to time. Some of their fascinating ideas are listed below:
    “My bacteria can produce enormous ozones so that it can repair the damaged ozone layer for us.”
    “My bacteria can absorb PM2.5 and refresh our air without sunlight!”
    “I want to creat a group of bacterium that can sing songs for me when I go to sleep!”
——“I will design a kind of bacteria that can make me sick if I wanted it to…”
——“Why? Because I can stay at home when my friends go to school and have exams.”

IV The war of E.coli
     As we mentioned in our project, we created a game based on liquid and solid culture medium. In this section, we presented our games on iPad. The games attracted a large amount of both children and adult players, who not only enjoyed the game, but also learned the way bacteria talks. What's more, they even give us more possibility in considering spatial effects on results of population interactions. See more at Game Discovery .

Abstract
Synthetic biology has led to the production of novel biosystems that are functionally beneficial.  Many bacterial systems currently rely on external stimuli to induce transcription. Such induced transcription protocols often require constant monitoring of applied chemical concentrations, for example if a strain uses a T7 promoter system that is controlled by LacI and a rhamnose expression vector , IPTG and rhamnose (both costly chemicals) will need to be monitored simultaneously. Additionally interactions and toxicity will need to be known and accounted for. Such complications lead to such chemical controls becoming undesirable for more complex systems.  A triplet of NOT gated photoreceptors in Escherichia coli, will be used to create a system which is finely controlled using only light. This will be showcased using magenta, cyan and yellow pigments as outputs. Varying the intensity and wavelength of light projected onto E. coli will control the shade and colour produced, respectively. This will show the versatility of the optical control by creating a full colour bio-camera. Additionally, using bacteria to produce an image vastly increases the resolution when compared to conventional cameras, due to the micrometre scale of bacteria.
Project Description
Our project aims to produce a group of BioBricks organised into three modules; one each for red, green and blue ( RGB ) light. To demonstrate the system we will control the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments, but we will also be inputting a system where future teams could have any gene as their ""output"" gene. We are using the CMY pigments, however RGB light could potentially be used to control the transcription of anything.
The ultimate aim of our project is to use ( CMY ) pigments to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph or coliroid . To achieve this we will be building upon the work done by previous iGEM teams, most notably Texas/Austin 2004, Edinburgh 2010 and Uppsala 2011.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," the biologist and popularizer Jean Rostand was also done with frogs. By inflicting an appropriate trauma on a non-fecundated egg, one can obtain the cellular division of this egg. Thousands of toads, frogs and tadpoles were submitted to these experiments:
“We can study all the problems on frogs. People think that frog is a small subject but it isn’t. All biology is in a frog. We can study cells, sperm, eggs, parthenogenesis, etc. Lastly, even the mutation and the heredity. We can study everything on a frog”, it constitutes a “privileged fragment of the living world”.
A new form of reproduction without male, the cloning, was realized for the first time in 1962 on a frog, before the ewe Dolly, by the introduction of the nucleus of an intestinal cell in a nucleus-free egg.
We can let George Canghilem, philosopher and historian of life science, conclude that:
“The frog was, so to speak, a good girl for physiologist; they used it a lot and it was very useful to them”.
We can add that if the frog finds a good place here, it’s because it was also a good girl for “electricians”. ""

Auxotrophe approach
Photocaged ONB-tyr
Our aim is to create a rapid UV-response system, so people can be rapidly warned of an UV-exposure.  For this reason, we’ve decided to work with a photocaged amino acid. One of our PIs, Professor Patrice Soumillon, has already worked with those compounds during his doctoral thesis and knows how efficiently they work. We’ve used the ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr) for its relatively low price compared with other photocaged amino acids. The cage, the ONB molecule, is cleaved when exposed to UV rays, and releases the tyrosine for protein synthesis (Fig 1).
We placed the ONB-Tyr inside a liquid cell culture. Our cell culture is a tyrosine auxotroph (TyrA-) E. coli culture. Those cells contain a plasmid with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene. We used the RFP gene from the BBa_K577882 Biobrick, developed by Boston University and Wellensly College for iGEM 2011 (Fig 2). It consists of a pBad promoter, a RBS, a RFP, and a terminator. The RFP originally comes from a coral, Discosoma striata and gives a red color.
We used a pBad promoter to induce the RFP expression when the biomass is sufficient to produce a good signal.
We worked with a liquid M9 minimal medium, adding ONB-Tyr. As our chassis is Tyr auxotroph, it can’t produce the RFP, except when exposed to UV rays, as the uncaged tyrosine is free for protein synthesis.
Finally, when the badge is exposed to UV rays, the tyrosine is uncaged, making it available for RFP synthesis, and the solution turns red!

In contrast the smaller BAP-NanoLuc (19 kDa for the NanoLuc) or the eMA (15 kDa) both can be efficiently presented on the surface. The enzymatic biotinylation of the Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP) using recombinant BirA biotin ligase is well established but could not be show before the wiki freeze. In Summary the whole device works great but there seems to be a limitation concerning the size of proteindomains that can be presented with the EspP autotransporter. We are curious to see what future iGEM teams will use the EspP Autotransporter in the future.
