Again, the plasmid appears to not have cut completely; otherwise, the results look fairly nice. Purified DNA appears to have roughly the same concentration as the unpurified DNA, which is rather dissapointing, as it indicates almost half the DNA was lost in the column. Still, ~40µL remain, and I will attempt a ligation.
⇒ Ligation proceeds as follows. The remaining 3µL is taken up by 2µL T4 ligase buffer and 1µL T4 Ligase:
∴L1(1:1), 5µL pSB1K3, 5µL J04500, 7µL H2O
∴L2(3:1), 3µL pSB1K3, 9µL J04500, 5µL H2O
∴L3(6:1), 2µL pSB1K3, 12µL J04500, 3µL H2O
∴L4(8:1), 1µL pSB1K3, 8µL J04500, 8µL H2O
Unfortunately, a possibility exists that the concentration of used DNA will be too high, as NEB recommends keeping concentrations at 1-10ng/µL; DNA from the purification is estimated at 30-50ng/µL. It remains to be seen if this will have an effect, but seeing as how the stocks were used almost entirely for this procedure, this may be unfortunate. Dilution of the remaining stocks may be necessary if this is to be attempted again, both to increase efficiency and stretch the remaining materials.
The T4 ligase buffer is old, but expires in 2013. The amount of ATP left in the buffer is unknown, since to my knowledge no reactions with this buffer have been attempted since September or October '10. Transformation will be attempted with Heat Shock 2.00 protocol.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"As function as posttranscriptional regulators which have distinguished features compared to transcriptional regulators, intervening late in gene expression process, with the capability to counteract variation from the upstream processes (Margaret et al., 2012). Research shows that while conducting experiment on an incoherent feedforward motif in mammalian cells, posttranscriptional regulation results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels and lower intrinsic fluctuations (Bleris et al., 2011). miRNAs can serve as buffers against variation during gene expression; transient increases in transcription factor activity would propagate to increases in target miRNA transcription while would be counteracted by increased miRNA and vice versa. Therefore, under the miRNA posttranscriptional regulation, protein output can be uncoupled from fluctuations in transcription factor concentration or activity (Margaret et al., 2012). miRNAs also possess good stability which, consistent with theoretical constraints, meets the need for enough molecules of a regulator to achieve a small reduction in the noise of a target gene (Lestas et al., 2010).
Experimental Characterization
We took advantage of another fluorescent protein(mkate ) as reference gene, which has no influence in our design. Published literature generally supports the view that in transient transfections, fluorescence depends linearly on the copy number of transfected plasmids (Tseng et al, 1997; Pollard et al, 1998;Cohenet al,2009; Schwakeet al, 2010). While strictly speaking, this reporter level also depends on many other potentially fluctuating parameters such as global synthesis and degradation rates(Leonidas Bleris et al,2011),it is more legitimately use the normalized quotient to instead of the value of EYFP.
Apparently, the output of circuit C is lower than circuit B .Having the negative feedback compared with circuit B, the expression of EYFP in circuit A is strongest. Then we analysed the output of constructed designs varies with the DNA copy number. Facing with the difficulty of counting the copy number directly, we employed the reference gene to reflect .We think the copy number is high when the expression intensity of mkate is strong. One hundred thousand positive Hela cells was collected to obtain the relationship between EYFP and make.
From the figure 2, we learned that in circuit A, with the increase of the expression intensity of makte, the value of EYFP gradually reaches saturation. In another word, the circuit A’s output reaches saturation fast with the increase of copy number. We came to a conclusion circuit A’s adaptation to DNA"

If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. (这里已修改)This is based on the assumption that the writer of template is always sure about the structure, he won't write a two-chain template if the parts are actually on one chain. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above."

Amil CP, AmajLime and eforRed were codon-optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana because of other teams have tried to demonstrate that they work. In addition, we intend to endow iGEM teams with renewed functional reported proteins with the aim of finding new purposes for them in plant chassis.

Use of a split-luciferase reporter to indicate interaction of PhyB and PIF3. I propose that for our system, we tag the PIF3 and PhyB with luciferase to form a split luciferase reporter system. When PhyB is stimulated with red photons, it undergoes a conformational change which gives it the ability to bind to PIF3 (phytochrome interacting factor 3). In order to reduce the amount of time between “writing” and “erasing” our theoretical blackboard, we had initially considered using a destabilized luciferase, but that did not solve the problem of  The theory behind a split-luciferase reporter. This technique was developed to help study protein-protein interactions in vitro, in vivo in cell culture, and in vivo in animals (like mice). The basis of a split luciferase reporter system is that when luciferase (like many other proteins, including GFP and ubiquitin) is cut in half, and each half fused to a protein of interest, the two halves lack enzymatic activity. However, when they are brought into close enough proximity to one another they reconstitute the functional enzyme. The split luciferin has been engineered to have minimal nonspecific affinity between the two halves, so it should only associate upon interaction of the two proteins the halves are fused to. Thus, upon photoactivation of PhyB, the binding of Pif3 and PhyB should facilitate the reconstitution of the functional luciferase, in the presence of the correct luciferin, result in a fluorescent signal.  Timing of luciferase reconstitution. Use of a split-luciferase system will allow us to turn on and off fluorescence in basically real time, without the delay of transcription to turn on the luciferase and degradation to turn it off. Studies have shown that association and dissociation occur within minutes. The split-luciferase reporter system has the distinct advantage over split-GFP systems that reconstitutiton of the luciferase is reversible, while reconstitution of the GFP fluorphore is irreversible. The GFP system is also disfavorable because GFP requires a high amount of excitation energy, and has high background"

Protein Purification - MonoQ Chromatography
The fusion protein was further purified with MonoQ chromatography. The 1mL MonoQ 5/50 GL column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃.  16mL of sample (4x diluted heparin chromatography elution fraction 16-23 of fusion protein) was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.

In order to analyse monoQ of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Detect and Destroy: Data Page
Figure 1. The Calgary team has developed a dual system for the detection of toxic components in tailing ponds and the remediation of these compounds.  Tailings ponds are large bodies of water containing waste products produced from the extraction of bitumen in the oil sands.  Our biosensor included the identification of a toxin promoter through a transposon screen.  An electrochemical detector was implemented with a multiple output system allowing for the detection of multiple compounds simultaneously.  This promoter/detector system was then complemented with the production of a biosensor prototype involving both a physical device and a software program for easy data analysis.  Rather than just sensing toxins in the tailings ponds, a major objective was to detoxify the tailings through the reduction of toxins such as carboxylic acids (mainly naphthenic acids) and catechol,"

In this clip, half of the Kilobots were programmed with code 1 and the other half were programmed with code 2, this time with a few modifications such that they all started at the lowest level of expression (blue for NONE). Again, the robots ultimately produced a bimodal response, with half of the robots emitting white light for medium expression and the other half emitting red light for maximum expression.
This diverging response may model what happens when two strains of yeast with the same initial response but different secondary responses are mixed together and induced with mating factor alpha.

Plasmid Confirmation and Functional Assay
1. The digests of Mg-chelatase plasmid reveal the correct band sizes of the insert (approx 11 kbp). ChlH protein (approx. 150kDa) is also highly expressed and visible on SDS-PAGE.
2. Mass spectrometry confirms the presence of magnesium chelatase subunits

Fig 3. All bands the size of the proteins of interest expressed from the induced magnesium chelatase plasmid were extracted from the SDS PAGE. MALDI TOF analysis of these proteins revealed that ChlH and ChlI2 were expressed successfully according to GPM.
Fig 4. We observe the increase in MgPPIX concentration at day 3 in the figure above. According to graphs produced on the modelling page , that is when PPIX is starting to be generated. We therefore conclude that we only get accumulation of MgPPIX when PPIX increases within the cell and when we induce with IPTG.
3. Mg-protoporphyrin is not produced in DH5-alpha E.coli containing this plasmid even when induced with IPTG. However, the deltahemH strain created via CRISPR accumulates protoporphyrin IX within the cell.

Warwick,2016,Team:Warwick#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," investigating epidemiology, novel targets for diagnosis, and new treatments, as well as several patients who had recently finished their course of antibiotics following diagnosis. We were very fortunate to speak to Dr Tim Brooks – the current director of Public Health England’s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL). The RIPL act as the governmental body for acute diagnostic facilities for a wide range of diseases in the UK, including zoonotic vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease. After discussing the advantages and limitations of the current serology and PCR diagnostic tests, we proposed our paper-based sensor and explained the testing procedure. He acknowledged the usefulness of a more robust, faster detection system, but shared some reservations concerning our intended method for sample testing – Borrelia bacteria are very rarely present in the blood at a high enough concentration for detection through traditional techniques. As we discussed this issue and how we could overcome this, we mentioned our plans for alternative applications. Dr Brooks emphasised how useful our sensor would be for detection of leptospirosis – a bacteria commonly detected in the blood samples RIPL test, with the paper-based aspect making it very well-suited to the developing countries where this disease prevails. We arranged a future consultation with Dr Brooks to discuss our technology further, and after conferring with the rest of the team, made the executive decision to alter the primary target of our sensor.
Conclusion
The project initially aimed to provide an effective detection system for Borrelia burgdorferi, also known as Lyme disease, however, after extensive collaboration with researchers and the public, our focus changed to Leptospirosis.
By incorporating the opinions of members of FredSense, we have improved our understanding of economic and scientific issues associated with our project, enabling us to develop a more effective, user-friendly product that has the potential to be widely available, over a large demographic.
Primary data, in the form of questionnaires, was gathered to predict the usefulness and acceptance of a final product on the public market, allowing us to determine the optimal target audience. As a result of this research, we decided that our sensor will be administered by medical practitioners as a clinical test, rather than a home self-test kit, and were able to formulate an improved design that maximises the beneficial influence of our project.
Collaborating with members of Public Health England combined with the analysis of collected data led us to conclude that when detecting for Lyme disease, an in vivo form of our sensor would be most appropriate. The advantages of using paper-based sensing over in vivo are the ease of use, stability and cost, however, if our system is used in clinics in"

Safety of Laboratory
All lab work and experiments were done according to laboratory safety policies at Macquarie University. The lab team was trained and escorted by instructors for the entire duration of our work to ensure the safety and health of team members and alike.
The main safety aspects of our daily routine in the lab included:
Personal protective equipment: In order to work in the lab, it was ensured that all students were wearing a lab coat and closed leather shoes. Upon arrival to the work station, safety glasses and gloves were provided. Before and after the lab work, team members cleaned their hands.
Safe practices: The work benches were sterilized using ethanol at the end of every day. Waste was disposed appropriately using  biological waste bins and regular waste bins. This was important as E. coli should not get into waterways, and correct disposal methods were followed.
Safety of Project Design
In our project, we used non-pathogenic K-12 E. coli strains are labelled biosafety level 1 organisms (BSL-1), as it is considered consistently harmless to healthy adults and was used under standard microbiological practices/aseptic technique. Contact with E. coli may cause irritation to skin or eyes in susceptible individuals. It would be harmful if ingested. To reduce these risks, all students have undergone a biosafety briefing which included a review of general lab safety. This outlined proper safe and efficient machine operation techniques and laboratory processes. Correct and safe laboratory wear was also addressed in this briefing. Correct waste disposal was also addressed in this briefing.
Gene Patenting and Australian Law
Gene patents have been a central topic of debate by the Australian legal scholarship for the past 10 years. The U.S Myriad decision declared that genes are not patentable in the U.S due to the natural occurrence of the isolated base pairs. The High Court in October 2015 unanimously confirmed that you cannot patent genetic material in Australia. However, Australia did allow the domestic patenting of isolated genes that are recognizably different to genes in DNA. As a result, we are able to provide iGEM participants and researchers with an overview of how this decision applies to Australia, while considering Australian"

US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2017,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," back to an ecstatic Dr. Goodson informing them that the gel had turned out as planned and that they could proceed with the mini-prep before sending in the DNA for sequencing. Everyone shared ""elbow-fives"" and were relieved that all their hard work had not gone to waste!
Packaging: The cellulose tubes were removed from the -80༠ freezer. The tubes were then put into a beaker that would be attached to a lyophilizer overnight at -105༠ in a vacuum.
Thursday (06/29/17)
Sense/Respond: Today the students began to mini-prep the samples from the previous day. Right from the start, the students noticed fluorescent green coming from one of the tubes. This would foreshadow what they would see later in the day. They began the mini-prep full of hope and concentrated on following the protocol exactly to achieve the best possible results. They decided to first put the tubes over the light and observed a lot of fluorescence (see picture). After about 2 hours, they were finally done. They nano dropped the sample and observed an incredible amount of DNA. Everyone cheered as they realized that the ""response"" component of the project was successful.
Packaging: Sequencing results for dCBD and CsgA DNA were reviewed using the program Blast. Each of the six dCBD in TOPO plasmid samples contained no errors on either the SP6 or the T7 primer sequences; however, some samples contained the gene in the reverse orientation. Chia's CsgA in TOPO plasmid samples were also entirely correct.
Friday (06/30/17)
Sense/Respond: Since all the lab work is currently done until the DNA sample is sent to Ohio State University for DNA sequencing, the students had the whole day to make website improvements and wiki renovations. New logos were also created as well as graphics. The students will continue to add content to the wiki weekly.

CCA-San_Diego iGEM Video Series
We created a video series that can be useful for any iGEM team. Whether you just started an iGEM team or you're a team with more experience, these videos can help you learn more about our iGEM team dynamics here at CCA San Diego, how your team can get involved with the community, or how we publicize our outreach events. The purpose is to articulate various facets of our iGEM team this year in an interesting and engaging manner. We also made these videos in order to clarify questions individuals in the public and iGEM judges may have on our iGEM team, discussing how to publicize, what our team feels we learned from our iGEM this year, what various roles in iGEM entail, what iGEM is, a day in our lab, and how we've facilitated Inegrated Human Practices in our iGEM team this year. Furthermore, we were able to collaborate with a local team, the Torrey Pines High School team, and they created a video to help us in our series for lab safety.

CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Application_-_-_TEXT.html," on engineering bacteria or external enzymes for the direct degradation of atherosclerotic plaques[23][24]. No team has ever exploited disease-specific promoters or RNAi technology for treating this disease.
LOX1 encodes for a scavenger receptor which binds oxidized low-density lipoprotein and is expressed by activated endothelial cells (EC), smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, which are all major cell types involved in atherosclerosis. Its promoter (LOX1pr) indeed proved to be a useful disease-specific promoter for expression of therapeutic genes to counteract atherogenesis[25]. Levin et al. found that the exclusive introduction of the 150-bp proximal part of the CD68 promoter improves the efficiency and specificity of this well-known macrophage-specific promoter[26]. Kang et al. successfully developed an artificial promoter SP146-C1, combined with a p47phox promoter element to also target macrophage[27].
MAP4K4 is also a key signalling node that promotes immune cell recruitment in atherosclerosis[28][29]. Reduction or loss of endothelial MAP4K4 expression profoundly ameliorates atherosclerotic lesion development in mice. Ath29 is a major atherosclerosis susceptibility locus affecting both early and advanced lesion formation in mice[30]. Knockdown of Rcn2 on this locus appeared to be an appropriate approach for pharmacological interventions of atherosclerosis.

Practical Outline
Mathew about to pipette 50ml LB solution into flasks for overnights
These are the steps that the Metal Sensing Team want to have completed by the end of the day:
Innoculate three tubes (each with 3ml of LB) with three of the E.coli cultures containing BBa_J33206 - morning
Start preparing for a test PCR for the pGFP-rrnb plasmid in Bacillus subtilis.
Should the E.coli cultures (containing BBa_J33206) have grown sufficiently in the LB tubes, further inoculate 3 flasks (containing 50ml of LB) with these bacteria – afternoon.
Observations and Procedure
The three preparations of LB + E. coli appeared cloudy indicating successful inoculations
Mathew preparing to inoculate 50ml LB with 50ml LB + E. coli
When looking at the plate following an overnight incubation it could be seen that the transformation rate for the DH5α E.coli containing BBa_J33206 DNA was very low – only five colonies were spotted on the plate.  Nevertheless three colonies were removed from the plate and, under aseptic conditions, used to inoculate 3 tubes containing 3ml LB each. These tubes were then placed in the shaking incubator at 37°C for the rest of the day. This step was done first thing in the morning. The bacteria which grow in these LB tubes will be used for a mini-prep of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick tomorrow
In the afternoon, the team returned to the lab to observe the progress of the E.coli bacterial growth in the three LB tubes. The appearance of the three tubes was noted as cloudy which indicated the presence of sufficient numbers of E.coli bacteria. To save time in the labs, it was decided to inoculate 3 flasks (each containing 50ml LB) with these three samples – these 50ml flasks will then be used for midi-preps tomorrow should the mini-preps indicate that the E.coli have been successfully transformed.
To inoculate the 3 flasks containing 50ml LB each, the team took 0.5ml from each of the 3ml of cultures and pipette them into the separate flasks. These flasks were then placed into the orbital shaking incubator at 37°C overnight.

The simulation generates random moves and calculates the energy difference between the new and old chain conformation. As stated earlier, only nearest neighbour interactions are taken into account for this.
We employ the metropolis monte carlo algorithm in the simulation, accepting and rejecting moves with a probability of:
This prevents the system from falling into a local energy minimum, because it allows moves with unfavourable interactions. The probability of accepting unfavourable interactions decreases exponentially for interaction energies higher than the system’s energy. The value of
represents the energy present in the system and was chosen to be 1/20 for our simulation, after several trial runs.
Results
With our lattice model, we wanted to study the interactions between TDPs and Cas13a upon drying. For this purpose, we first had to assess if the model we were using was suitable for modelling protein interactions. Afterwards, we investigated which TDP would confer desiccation tolerance to Cas13a the best, and at which concentration we should use our TDPs.
Modelling General Protein Interactions
In our lattice model, we convert the hydrophobicity and charge compatibility indices established by Biro 2006 . We tested if the generated energy values had the expected impact on the protein behaviour, by running the model without any favourable interactions, by generating only positive energy values (0-20), and with exclusively favourable interactions, by generating only negative energy values (-20-0) between the chains. By observing the behaviour of the chains after a given number of iterations, we confirmed that the model can provide information on the behaviour of polymers in solution.
In Figure 7 below, the polymer arrangement does not change significantly over 50000 iterations. While the chains have changed positions and it is clear that movements were generated, the conformations and the localization over the environment are similar. On the other hand, Figure 8 clearly shows a clustering of chains after the same amount of iterations, which would be expected if all chain interactions are favourable. As the energy input in both cases yields the expected results, we can conclude that the lattice model can be used to simulate the phase separation of polymers in solution and that it can be used to model the interactions between Cas13a and TDPs.

RBS: B0034 from the Registry ""B0034"" (sequence copied into our primers)
TetR: ""TetR sequence"" (623 bp)- The sequence lacks a stop codon, so we added one (TAA) with our primers.
Our TetR plasmid contains a p15A replication origin, the same medium-copy number as in J61002 to ensure that during co-transformations the 2 different plasmids are present in same amounts. The plasmid carries a Kanamycin resistance marker, since co-transformations with J61002 means we need a different selection antibiotic for each plasmid to confirm both are present (J61002 = Ampicillin resistance).
Cutting out RFP
We were surprised to see that the colonies recovered after Gibson assembly were red, indicating that the pSB3K1 plasmid contains RFP. By looking at it more carefully, we discovered that we had included the Biobrick region with our primers, which explains why RFP was present in our pSB3K1 backbone. Taking advantage of the BioBrick format, we digested our pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR plasmid with SpeI and XbaI and then successfully religated.
Now we have the expected TetR plasmid that is used in combination with the J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid into our first readout system . The complete sequence of the plasmid is available here .
Second plasmid - pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI
For the second readout system, we added LacI under Ptet promoter to pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR (after RFP had been cut out).

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied"
UNBC-Canada,2017,Team:UNBC-Canada#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Design
Our project has been divided into a two-year plan. This year encompassed identification of vital pathways for MRSA survival, including resistance and virulence, as well what is necessary for sRNA silencing in Staphylococcus species. We identified the following genes as targets for gene silencing via sRNA:
secA, a critical ATPase protein in the bacterial secretion system. This system is responsible for secreting toxins and glycoproteins responsible for virulence, as well as membrane proteins essential in the organisms survival.
mecA, a genetic element exclusive to MRSA, which gives the organism resistance to beta-lactams through multiple pathways. This element includes PBP2A, or penicillin binding protein, which binds and inhibits beta-lactams.
Ddl, short for d-alanine—d-alanine ligase, catalyzes the formation of d-alanine cross linkages within peptidoglycan in the cell wall.
An important consideration made when identifying the above genes is that there are no so-called “back-up” pathways or genes that can take over the function of the gene of interest, should it be shut down fully. After finding the genes of interest, we then created sequences directly complimentary to the mRNA we wished to target, and had our sRNAs synthesized and 5’ FAM labelled by IDT for measurement purposes.
Literature review of dsRNA binding protein showed Hfq to be essential in sRNA mediated gene silencing in E. coli, however there is a lack of general consensus on whether or not it is functional in Staphylococcus species. Therefore, determining if Hfq is needed to stabilize the interaction between sRNA and mRNA in Staphylococcus species became the focus this year’s project; as this is vital information needed to proceed to engineer a successful silencing system.
If Hfq binds to the sRNA, we would know if it is essential to include on the plasmid utilized for our proposed treatment. This plasmid would then not only include the gene that codes for the appropriate sRNA, but would also need to include the gene for Hfq under a bidirectional tetracycline inducible promoter. It will become the focus of next year to engineer and deliver such a plasmid.
Literature on Staphylococcus Hfq demonstrates that it binds most favorably to an AUAUAUA portion of RNA (Horstmann et al., 2012). Based on this, we included an AUAUAUA sequence on the 5' end of our custom designed sRN"

The calibration curves were used to estimate the influence of the optical density on the fluorescence. Thus, the fluorescence caused by the medium was subtracted from the emission.
For determination, of the effects caused by various promoters, the measured emission data (minus the fluorescence caused by the media) was compared. For a comparative analysis between the experiments with different gains plain media was used for standardization. This was done for all three replicates. Data obtained from the triplicate is shown in figure 4 for GFP and figure 5 for mRFP1. Remaining schemes and emission data are shown in the appendix.

overview
We are proud to be part of the interlab study. Although we are a Software Team, this never separate us from experiments and never extinguish our passions for contributing our efforts for iGEM and Synthetic biology community.
This year, Interlab study provide detailed protocol to eliminate as much difference as they can, and find a way to make OD/FI measurement conducted by different machine comparable.
Experiment Design
Eight different plasmids, Positive Control (BBa_I20270), Negative Control (BBa_R0040), Device 1 (BBa_J364000), Device 2 (BBa_J364001), Device 3 (BBa_J364002), Device 4 (BBa_J364003), Device 5 (BBa_J364004), Device 6 (BBa_J364005) were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, which were inoculated on LB plate with chloramphenicol (cmr). After an overnight cultivation, single colonies was picked to keep cultivating. After 6 hours cultivation, Colony PCR was conducted to test if the plasmids were transformed successfully. And the colonies were moved into liquid cultures (LB medium) and cultivated overnight. Liquid cultures were diluted with LB medium until the value of OD600 reached 0.02. Then we took out 500 μL samples from the cultures every 2 hour (t=0, 2, 4, 6h). At last, we measured OD600 and fluorescence of all samples.
Materials and Methods
Growth Conditions
The bacteria were cultivated in Lysogeny Broth(LB) plate with chloramphenicol added when doing transformation. The plates were kept at "
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Lab#Mutant_-_-_TEXT.html,"
8. Match the OD600 levels by diluting with corresponding Luria-Bertani (LB) broth.
9. Measure OD600 again.
10. Once OD600 are matching for all samples, serial dilute them (1 in 10, 1 in 100). To serial dilute, aliquot 100uL of original culture into a new tube containing 900uL of corresponding LB broth (1 in 10). To make 1 in 100, aliquot 100uL of 1 in 10 dilution into a new tube containing 900uL of corresponding LB broth (1 in 100).
11. Go back to wizard, change the reading parameters to the following settings*:
Reader: Fluorescence
Reading type: Endpoint
Excitation: 485/20
Emission: 528/20
Optics position: Top
Sensitivity: automatic adjustment, scale to high or low well.
Top probe vertical offset: 3mm
12. Click ok.
13. Again, go to wizard, change the layout of the cells.
14. Read.

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Beyond The Basics
Apart from basic lab work we also established a dialogue with the public.
Our outreach included contributing to conferences, socializing and scientific events.
Beyond that we asked ourselves how to maximize the future impact of our project and made an effort to get as much feedback from outsiders as possible. This motivated us to evaluated the economic perspectives of our LIPs, as well.
Economical Perspective
Many iGEM teams create great ideas and great projects, but when it comes to the implementation and application in real life, it is also important to deal with the following questions: Would this project be applicable in reality? Would there be a market for this product? What opportunities are there to make the product more appealing to consumers? Apart from ""Integrated Practices"", it was also of great interest for us to examine the potential of our idea on the laundry detergents market.
That is why we created an economical analysis in cooperation with a business administration student from the University in Nantes, France.

Protein Purification - Heparin Chromatography
The dxCas9 protein was further purified with Heparin chromatography. The 1mL HiTrap Heparin HP column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃. 2mL of nickel chromatography elution fraction 3-6 from dxCas9 protein was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the heparin chromatography of the dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Heparin Chromatography. 12% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 starting material, lane 3 flow through, lane 4 wash, lane 5 elution 1, lane 6 elution 2, lane 7 elution 3, lane 8 elution 4, lane 9 elution 5, lane 10 elution 6, lane 11 elution 7, lane 12 elution 8, lane 13 elution 9, lane 14 elution 10, lane 15 elution 11.
The heparin chromatography was successful. The protein recoveries were high, with no losses in the flowthrough and wash (lane 3-4). The first 4 elution fractions (lane 5-8) contained some low molecular weight contaminating proteins, as a result only elution fraction 5 to 10 (lane 9 to 14) were pooled. Again the double band for dxCas9 was observed on the 12% SDS PAGE, which we have seen with all purification.

Successfully assembled Mg-PPIX to chlorophyll a plasmid. Plasmid double digest confirmed the correct size of the plasmid.
Unable to assemble the 12 gene plasmid due to time constraints
Protein induction revealed intense bands of correct sizes correlating with each gene in the Mg-chelatase plasmid. Mass spectrometry results also confirmed the presence of chlH, chlI1 and chlI2.
Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra revealed that when the Mg-chelatase plasmid is added to ΔHemH mutants, Mg-PPIX production increases proving that the plasmid is functional.
Fig 1.The above gel image shows a ladder in lane 1, the chlH gene by itself in lane 2 and the plac-ChlH sequence in lanes 3-10. Lane 3 shows a slightly smaller band then the others and was excluded from sequencing results. Lanes 4-10 were confirmed as correct through sequencing. The lac promoter has a 200 base pair sequence which was added to the start of the gene and taken from iGem part BBa_R0010.
Fig 2.Gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) provides evidence of successful assembly of Mg-chelatase plasmid (10.9 kbp), pLac-ycf54-chlM (1.5 kbp) plasmid and Mg-PPIX to Chlorophyll a plasmid (6.3 kbp). Each plasmid was assembled via 3A assembly and double digested to reveal the biobrick backbone (2000 bp) and the correct insert size.

Testing
Testing for chemotaxis can be split into qualitative and quantitative assays. Qualitative assays involve putting engineered E. coli and an attractant onto semi-solid agar plates and observe the movement of the microbes. If they can be observed to move towards the attractant source, they are likely to be attracted to the ligand. In quantitative assays, capillaries are filled with different concentrations of the attractant malate. Positive controls are provided by filling identical capillaries with different concentrations of serine, which E. coli naturally move towards. Negative controls are provided by filling capillaries with media that does not contain a source of attractant. The amount of bacteria that swim into each capillary is evaluated by FACS.
For simplicity, we will be working with Arabidopsis to observe the uptake of bacteria into plant roots. Arabidopsis thaliana is a common plant model organism. It belongs to the mustard family and fulfils many important requirements for model organisms. As such, its genome has been almost completely sequenced and replicates quickly, producing a large number of seeds. It is easily transformed and many different mutant strains have been constructed to study different aspects (National Institute of Health, no date). While Arabidopsis may not represent plant populations naturally occurring in arid areas threatened by desertification, it is a handy model organism we will be using to study the effect of auxin on roots, observe chemotaxis towards them and look at uptake of bacteria into the roots.
We will be using Arabidopsis to look at the uptake of our engineered bacteria into the plants. For this, we will be using wild type Arabidopsis and E. coli that constitutively express green fluorescent protein. The natural fluorescence produced by plant roots and green fluorescence produced by the bacteria can be used to image the uptake of bacteria using confocal microscopy.
1. Testing for chemotaxis towards malate
Experiments involving chemotaxis can be split to two categories, qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative experiments, we are able to show that bacteria, which we study do or do not move towards a source, however it does not inform us at all about the cell count.
5th of August - Agar plug in assay
The simplest method for studying chemotaxis is to use agar plug in assay, which is a simple experimental method to show bacterial movement towards a localised chemical source.
Experiment is performed as follows, bacteria are added into the plate on one side, and the attractant to the other. Result is then the shape"

After transformation, it enables the yeast to transfer biotin to biotin acceptor peptide（BAP);  pYD1 is another 5.0 Kbp expression circuit designed for expression, secretion, and display of proteins on the extracel-lular surface of S.cerevisiae. The vector contains AGA2 gene from S.cerevisiae encoding one subunit of the a-agglutinin receptor. By fusing our gene of interest to AGA2, so we can enable the yeast to display the biotin on the cell surface.
After successful construction of plasmids, we introduced pYD1 containing BAP and pYC230 containing Bira into S.cerevisiae EBY100.
Protein expression verification
We want to test whether biotinylated BAP is successfully integrated in the yeast cell wall. So, we dyed engineered yeast and negative control respectively with FITC-streptavidin. Using fluorescent microscopy, we are able to observe the fluorescence of both.
Fig 2.7 The fluorescent staining of yeast with FITC-Streptomyces. (left) S.cerevisiae EBY100 without target gene; (middle) S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA though galactose induction for 12h; （right) S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA though galactose induction for 32h.
Meanwhile, we would like to  quantify the expression of biotin compared with EBY100 by plate reader, and wonder when biotin can reach the maximum expression.
Fig 2.8 Expression level of biotin in different time point compared with negative controll. The red curve represents for the fluorescence of  EBY100-BirA-BAP as time  goes  by. And  the  blue curve represents for the fluorescence  of  EBY100 control.
As a result we can see the FI/abs600 of S.cerevisiae EBY100 with BAP+BirA after galactose inductionis that increases as time goes by. At about 20h the expression of biotin reached maximum level，and at about 30h the accumulation of biotin reached maximum.
Further, we want to know how many biotins are expressed on the surface of a single cell. Luckily, we found that we can confirm the expression of biotin and its expressing percent under Flow cytometer.

BioBrick K2020001 is a composite part itself and includes the secretion tag pelB ( BBa_J32015 ) and a subtilisin E gene optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage ( BBa_K2020000 ). Once introduced into E. coli, this BioBrick is able to produce subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease, which non-specifically digests proteins, and simultaneously secrets the enzyme into the periplasm of the cell. Caused by the lacI regulated promoter BBa_R0010 , the expression system can be induced by addition of IPTG. With the iGEM promoter BBa_R0011 , which was integrated in our sequence at first, it was not possible to successfully express subtilisin E due to fatal mutations inside the expression system in all analyzed colonies. Either there have been single base deletions or insertions in the pro-peptide, which led to a frameshift of the whole protein, or a 23 base pair deletion in the promoter. Both types of mutations result in an incorrect expression system, so that an expression of the protease is impossible. Since the promoter BBa_R0011 is leaky and induces the expression even without addition of IPTG, it can be assumed that subtilisin E is toxic for E. coli. Hence, we exchanged the promoter against BBa_R0010 . For achieving this, we carried out a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to extract everything but the promoter and the RBS and simultaneously extend the remaining DNA sequence with the pre-fix of iGEM. Afterwards, we assembled it with the BioBrick J04500 and in parallel cloned it into the vector pSB1C3 - by cutting RFP out of the BioBrick J04450 . The implemented BioBrick J04500 itself contains another IPTG inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) and the same RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). An expression with the newly integrated promoter BBa_R0010 led to a colony with the correct sequence in opposition to our trial of gaining a positive clone while working with the first promoter BBa_R0011 . We continued our experiments by performing a skim milk assay on agar plates. Therefore, we poured LB skim milk agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotic and streaked out the E. coli BL21 cells containing the plasmid with the expression system.

Nicht gerade eine studentische Spielwiese, sollte man meinen. Doch der vor fünf Jahren am MIT begonnene und im Jahr 2005 mit dreizehn Mannschaften international erweiterte Wettbewerb zeigt, dass der Biotechniknachwuchs allzu gerne sein schöpferisches und strategisches Potential ausreizt.
Dieses Jahr erwartet man 85 Gruppen in Cambridge. Drei davon kommen aus Deutschland, neben dem Heidelberger Team werden Studenten aus Freiburg und München an den Start gehen. Es gilt, Goldmedaillen und vielleicht einen Hauptpreis zu ergattern und dabei natürlich - das gehört in der Altersgruppe der Achtzehn- bis Dreiundzwanzigjährigen naturgemäß dazu - auch noch Spaß zu haben.

DgrA/DgrB Circuit
Introduction
The concentration of c-di-GMP is varying, and for our experiment we will promote its expression to inhibit rotation of flagella. It will bind to DgrA and DgrB. The resulting complex will have two routes to go: one is the [c-di-GMP&DgrA] complex which will inhibit FliL, a protein bound to the membrane playing a key role in rotation of flagella. And the other route is that the DgrB will directly affect the rotation of the flagella.
Equations
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA])}{dt} = \frac{(Ka \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrA - Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrA}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA])}{cell}$
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrB])}{dt} = \frac{(Kb \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrB - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrB}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrB])}{cell}$
$\frac{d(FliL)}{dt} = \frac{(-Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL + Kg_{FliL})}{cell}$
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA-FliL])}{dt} = \frac{(Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL)}{cell}$

3.    iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
Gold Medal
1.    Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Further than spreading our love for science and our passion for making a change, our main objective is to share what we have developed in the laboratory with our community, because regardless of the size of our contribution, it can generate great changes. We focused on prevention and awareness of self-medication, which is one of the most practiced habits without concerning its consequences. Our target was the whole society, from children to elderlies, since the oldest are the ones who instruct the young people, the ones that represent our future generations. In order to generate a huge impact, we carried out a rally for kids, a campaign in a busy park with several activities, a documental with the opinion of experts and a small cinema related to science.

In the play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warriors from UESTC take their plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
It was a play that combined knowledge and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out laughing. We also set some questions after our play to see whether children have learned from it. We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the right answer of “Why butanol is harmful to bacterial” but also explained her choice perfectly with the plot in our play.
 Gene Card
We invited children to play gene card. Children had fun and learned synthetic biology’s basic process and tools in the game. Gene card successfully provoked their interest to synthetic biology.

In order to reduce the nonsense collision between protein molecules and reduce the background fluorescence, we use semi-solid mixed crowding as the buffer [5] . Mixed crowing can modify the inner cellular circumstance. First, we mix α-tubulin-nluc, α-tubulin-cluc with β-tubulin to get nluc-tubulin dimer and cluc-tubulin dimer respectively(Fig.2.2). Since a certain length of microtubule is needed as a premise for taxol’s function, GTP is added into the system to make the heterodimers aggregate into a loci. The light intensities of possibly combined luciferase fragments are defined as the zero point when adding luciferin B as a substrate.
Fig.2.2 The spontaneous aggregation of tubulin dimer
We set a serial dilution of taxol as experimental groups. Taxol is mixed with tubulin heterodimer mixture and wait for a certain time, then luciferin B was added. Since the more tubulin heterodimers taking part in the aggregation activity, the more complete luciferase can exist. There would be a relationship between the intension of fluorescence and the length of microtubule(Fig.2.3). Through modeling, we know that the length of microtubule and the concentration of taxol is positively correlated [7] , so we can fit a standard curve according to the concentration of taxol and the intension of fluorescence detected in the experiment.
Fig.2.3 The aggregation of microtube under taxol treatment
3. BiFC based fusion protein design
Besides the methods mentioned above, we also use yellow fluorescence protein(YFP) to construct a similar system based on BiFC theory.
We split YFP into N-terminal(YNE, amino acids 1~155) and C-terminal(YCE, amino acids 156~240). When the two parts are expressed separately and mixed together in vivo or in vitro, they cannot aggregate into a complete protein, so no fluorescence can be detected [8] [9] [10] [11] . Once the two parts are fusing expressed with a pair of proteins who can interact with each other, YFP can regain its function. The excitation wavelength is 514 nm, emission wavelength is 527 nm. We design the N-terminal and C-terminal primers based on YFP’s sequence, using pSPYNE and pSPYCE as templates, running PCR to get YNE and YCE gene sequences.

The educational platform for 200 high schools in Denmark has now been launched!
Overview
The educational platform for 200 high schools in Denmark has now been launched!
Our human practice strategy is largely build upon a desire to reach beyond the iGEM community and spark an interest of synthetic biology in high school students in Denmark.
In Denmark, it is not possible for high school students to work with purification of plasmids due to controversial rules issued by the Danish Ministry of Education. As a consequence, very limited knowledge is passed unto the students about synthetic biology and many will only encounter this exciting field when attending university.
We want to change this!
The DTU iGEM team 2015 sketched out the first steps and initiated an exciting project that would allow high school students to work with BioBricks overcoming the Danish rules by using 3A assembly of the parts.              The DTU BioBuilders team 2016 picked up where last years team let go. With a funding of 300.000 DKK (45.000 USD) from NEB for Biosensor kits and 300.000 DKK (45.000 USD) from Novozymes it was possible to send out kits to the Danish high schools allowing them to create their own customized Biosensors. Elaboration of the project is presented under “Biosensor” beneath.
Our other human practices relied on the same philosophy, namely spreading the word of synthetic biology through different events and social media. This lead to exciting outreaches which can all be explored below.

High Schoolers
“I could see a great potential of getting an amazing experience which would challenge and develop my skills within biotechnology” - Rasmus, 16.
During the summer, the DTU BioBuilders fetched reinforcements in the form of three amazing high school students. Our three students, Sigrid, Tobias and Rasmus helped us out in the lab and gained valuable skills which will be of great value for them in their future studies.
“The project seemed like a great opportunity to get some laboratory experience"
Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," know it can be difficult to grasp some concepts we’re not familiar with. So what’s a better way to communicate an idea? Could social media be the answer? That was the idea behind the VLOG series TIL: Syn Bio.
These series are a quick and effective way to convey the ideas and passion of synthetic biology. The series has many episodes that highlight various aspects of synthetic biology through a mixture of one-on-one videos and animated style videos.              The series begin with episodes explaining  “What is Synthetic Biology?, “Fundamental Advances” and “Cell-to-Cell Communication” (Waterloo iGEM’s 2013 project). This phase of the series is important to orient the viewers and provide some background information.
During the second part of the series, the team takes a fun twist. Using the TIL: Synthetic Biology outreach event footage to compare the viewpoints of students and professors on various topics relating to synthetic biology. The footage from this event is used for addressing many factors associated with the idea of synthetic biology. These factors range from the background knowledge to stigma associated with synthetic biology and from the regulations needed to its future potential.
The series begins with these six videos, leaving the rest of the series to be shaped by viewers. Ultimately, viewers engage with the team about what they want to see in future videos, ask questions they want answered and connect with information from a variety of sources.
The TIL: Synthetic Biology outreach event (used as part of the video series) was well-received. The team came prepared with questions to ask passing students. Students were also given 4-5 days notice via Facebook. The idea behind this aspect of the video was to have it be a surprise. Questions like ""do you support GMOs?"", ""would you eat modified fruit/meat?"", ""who should be able to practice synthetic biology/should it be open sourced?"" and many more were asked. The team was in for some surprises with the diversity of knowledge on campus! We hope incorporating the footage into our series will give participants a fun look into their experience, which they can easily share with their friends and family.             Overall, we hope that the team's work will inspire more leaders to take part and contribute to the advances in synthetic biology, regardless of their academic or professional background.
Intent to Invent
Intent to Invent was hosted on March 07, 2013 at the University of Waterloo’s Quantum Nano Center. The purpose of the event was to:
Connect the students to experts in 3 key industries that use synthetic biology in their processes: Agriculture, Health and Pharmaceuticals.

Minnesota iGEM
The year, the Minnesota iGEM team plans to expand on a previous project and develop a more practical mercury detoxification method using engineered auxotrophic bacteria. As part of this collaboration, 4 members on the UCSC iGEM team, who happened to already be flying out to Minnesota in early August, will meet up with the members of the Minnesota team. As of July 23rd, our group has had skype calls with each other and we have exchanged information regarding our progress and thier current status. We, the UCSC team, noticed that the Minnesota iGEM team has not spent as much time in human practices as we have so we plan to provide them with advice on how to find contacts in local communities globally. In exchange iGEM Minnesota will help us ... If you would like to learn more about their work, please check out their team wiki at 2018.igem.org/Team:Minnesota

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html,". From an initial cell density of 0.08, the wild type cells reach a maximum cell density of 0.34. Additionally, the gradient of the graph represents the rate at which cells express lycopene. The plot indicates that the mNARK-Lycopene device expresses lycopene at a higher rate than the wild type cells. It is clear that, for both the mNARK-Lycopene device and wild type E. coli cells, lycopene expression increases with cell density, as more lycopene is being produced as a result of there being a larger number of lycopene producing cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mNARK-Lycopene mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying. Therefore allowing cells to grow to a greater optical density, and, as mentioned above, greater cell density corresponds with greater lycopene production.
The second graph is derived from experiments using LB with two different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP): 50 μM and 100 μM. During the experiment with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate; the wild type E. coli cells continue to grow, since it did not produce an environment where there was substantial oxidative stress. Sodium nitroprusside can create an environment with greater oxidative stress. Due to the greater oxidative stress, the wild type cells are unable to grow in these conditions and show a very low optical density at 485 nm, which indicates a lack of lycopene production. The gradient of the two wild type cell graphs are similar, which is expected, as neither have an oxidative stress promoter. Wild type cells grew better under less oxidative stress (50 μM SNP), compared to 100 μM SNP. The optical density at 485 nm is lower for higher oxidative stress conditions with the wild type cells, which is due to their respective cell densities. However, the mNARK-Lycopene cells continue to grow and produce lycopene in these conditions. The lycopene cells display greater growth in the harsher 100 μM conditions compared with 50 μM. The gradient of 50 μM mNARK-Lycopene at 0.8435 is less than that of the 100 μM sample, which is 1.0864. This indicates that our mNARK device increases lycopene expression under higher oxidative stress.  In this experiment, the performance of the Lycopene cells is more pronounced, clearly showing that the mNARK-Lycopene devlice mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells"

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#CatherineNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," more about synthetic biology. The team presented a general introduction to synthetic biology and after lunch, we began learning about Eugene, a domain specific language for synthetic biologists. As someone with very little programming background, understanding Eugene was rather difficult. Already I could notice the different ways BU and Wellesley students approached solving problems, and it was interesting to work with a group of students who have extensive experience in a wet lab.
Tuesday: Day 2 at BU! Today, we presented our proposed projects to the BU iGEM team, and they provided feedback to us. The presentation could have gone more smoothly, but we learned a lot from hearing what the BU team members had to say. They definitely view our projects in a different light because they come from a strong biology background. I enjoy hearing input from people who come from a variety of backgrounds, which is something I had experienced when I participated in a program that involved students from Babson, Olin, and Wellesley Colleges this past January. Afterwards, we went on a tour of the BU wet lab and saw their high end flow cytometer. Pretty nifty!
Wednesday: Today, the Eugene DeSyne team (now with the addition of Sravanti) spent the morning learning more in depth about the previous incarnation of the Eugene DeSyne project, which was in paper prototype stage. Afterwards, we made a list of things we liked and didn't like about this previous incarnation, and started thinking of new designs to improve upon this model. We were thinking of incorporating windows that can be hidden and revealed to free up screen space, rather than leave a clutter of windows all over the screen. At the end of the day, I participated in a user study for another project going on in the HCI lab, Tabula. It was interesting participating in a user study that was very open-ended, but having experienced a user study before, I knew how to verbalize my thought process and make it clear to the experimenter what I was envisioning. A long day of work today, that's for sure.
Thursday: Today, I joined the Tabula team to help out with running user studies. I had expressed interest in user testing prior to beginning my summer job at the HCI lab, so I was glad to have the opportunity to experience the experimenter's side of the study I just participated in. I read up on some background information on Tabula, and then in the afternoon, we had several user studies scheduled back-to-back. I was responsible for transcribing the dialogue, and it was interesting to hear what other users did to accomplish the same tasks I had"

Modelling collaboration with USTC
The iGEM team USTC comes from the University of Science and Technology of China. Since we discussed their projects on modelling during the 5th conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCIC), we kept long-term communication on this topic. Our team provided them with some advice of the simulation of biological processes and we also learned much in the discussion.
Collaboration with SCU-China
We met team SCU-China at the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) and were attracted by their project. We found their project were similar to one of our previous design in brainstormming. Thus, we discussed about their design and gave several pieces of advice based on papers about Cas9. What’s more, we shared our model and design with them as a reminder of the potential problems they might meet in our concern.
Collaboration with DLUT-China
We provided TeamA from DLUT_China with pSB1C3 plasmid for biopart construction.
Collaboration with Peking National Day School
We instructed BNDS_CHINA in experiment and modeling. We taught them the basic experimental skills. We also helped them when they had problem in molecular cloning.
Collaboration with NKU_CHINA
We discussed with them their projects during the joint conference they held in NKU_CHINA . We provided them with many valuable suggestions in modelling during the 5th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC). We kept a long-term communication with them since then and we both benefitted a lot.
Collaboration with NAU-CHINA
We provided NAU-CHINA with a plasmid.
Collaboration with FUDAN-CHINA
We offered SpheroTech Rainbow calibration beads (type RCP-30-5A) for interlab flow cytometry test use to FUDAN-CHINA team in July. We also shared experiences about experiments and human practice issues at NKU_CHINA’s iGEM meeting on July 6th, at Fudan-CHINA lab"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#policypractice#mt_-_-_TEXT.html," the iGEM community. SULSA aims to inform researchers on the variety of work being carried out within Synthetic Biology in Scotland. The event focuses on giving researchers a platform to share their work and explore various new areas. We gave our talk twice during the conference. As this was early on in the summer it gave a general outline of the project, and the information we had gathered so far. On the first day it was given to the other Scottish iGEM teams, and we also heard about their projects, which were interesting and innovative. Then on the second day we presented again to the professionals who had gathered at the conference. It was great to get their feedback on the project. This was an amazing first experience giving our very first presentation.
Tech Talk
The Dundee Tech Meet Up is an informal monthly gathering, based at the University of Dundee, which brings together those interested in technology. The presentations vary each month with regards to the topic area. However, they remain true to outlining technology used in the specific projects and developing those ideas in detail.
As the Dundee iGEM 2014 Team, we presented our project: The Lung Ranger with a heavy focus on the L.A.S.S.O. To build the L.A.S.S.O. we used the Arduino microcontroller, and we were able to explore that along with the circuitry in the presentation at the Tech Meet Up. We also covered the aspects of Synthetic Biology within The Lung Ranger during the talk so that the audience could truly understand what iGEM is all about.
Young Synthetic Biologists 2.0 (YSB)
For the second year running the Young Synthetic Biologists conference was held in London, this year on the 1st and 2nd of September. This is an event sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and University College London (UCL) for iGEM teams all over the UK (and even a team from Denmark) to meet up and present to each other about the progress of their projects. This was a great opportunity to see all the fantastic projects being created with a diverse range of projects.
On the second day of the event our project was presented by Dave, Fatima and Roddy. This allowed us to fully explain our project from all perspectives and give best representation of the work that had been put in. The presentation was followed by a 5 minute Q & A session. All of the questions were answered concisely and professionally by the team.

Biosensors can be defined as systems containing
genetic elements which are capable of detecting
and responding to a target signal/molecule.
A plethora of biosensors are created
by iGEM teams each year, yet many
are not used in the field.
After a systematic review of biosensors
from iGEM projects and talks with
biosensor developers, five main

""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan.   Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor.  Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.
Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.

In this section of our protocol pages you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks (BioBricks) it is fairly easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to create BioBricks and to modify, mutate, transform and analyse DNA are presented in this section. Methods used: Electroporation; chemical transformation; Standard, Freiburg, Gibson and 3A BioBrick assembly; restriction analysis; colony PCR; site directed mutagenesis.

Production
These are the protocols for the cultivations and the downstream processing.
Before one is able to work with a cell-free system based on biological material, the needed proteins have to be produced and purified first. These methods and the ones we used to characterize our generated BioBricks in vivo are presented in this section. Used methods: Cultivations in shaking flasks and in differnt bioreactor systems with a working volume up to 6L; mechanical lysis of cells, protein clean-up from lysed cells, Ni-NTA- and TALON-columns and chromatography.

Analytics
Protocols for the analytical methods we used.
DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of your upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found in this section. Used methods: Fluorescence measurement; SDS-PAGE; MALDI-TOF; HPLC; LC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS; molecular"

Micro-Transformations, Macro Changes
The goal of our exhibit was to provide relatable information about the general techniques scientists use every day in the laboratory.  We presented brief “elevator talks,” broken down into two topics to more clearly present the information to the public.  The first talk explained the Central Dogma of Biology , where DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA translated into protein. The second elevator talk was about the execution of transformation in molecular biology and the basic experimental concepts, while also giving real life examples of how it is used as an application.  In addition to our presentations, we gave away synthetic biology informational bookmarks and scientific temporary tattoos, and brought culture plates with E. coli transformed with GFP and RFP for visual demonstration of transformations in cells.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," used due to its very high spatial resolution and Depth of Focus (DoF). In order to use SEM, samples have to be fixed and dried, because the measurements take place under vacuum.
With SEM, we hope to see the impact of the polysilicate layer on the phenotype of the cell. If we want to make microlenses, the surface of the cell should be smooth, despite the polysilicate layer. Any deformations in the layer can cause optical aberrations. Since SEM has a very high spatial resolution, we can use this technique to image what our polysilicate-covered cells look like and to see what effect the polysilicate layer has on the cells.
Methods
The polysilicate layer around the cells was prepared according to the polysilicate layer protocol . As a negative control, cultures without substrate (no sodium silicate) were used. The samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde and imaged with SEM. We used an FEI Niva Nano 450 SEM, under high vacuum.
SEM experiments in the cleanroom!
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows SEM images taken of samples in the presence (A, B) or absence (C, D) of silic acid.
Figure 1: SEM images of E. coli expressing OmpA-silicatein in the presence (A, B) or absence (C, D) of sodium silicate.
We know from a previous experiment, the rhodamine 123 staining, that cells with OmpA-silicatein have a polysilicate layer. Figure 1 suggests that this layer does not seem to influence the cell shape as the cells have their normal size and shape. However, the cells that are expected to have a polysilicate layer appear to be somewhat fused together. According to Müller et al (2008) , cells possessing a polysilicate layer appear to be fused by a viscous cover. This might, however, also be the result of limited imaging resolution or an artifact in sample preparation. When using titanium oxide as a substrate, Curnow et al (2005) reported large aggregates visible by SEM. This was not observed in the current experiment, where we use silicic acid as a substrate. This comparison suggests that the polysilicate layer does not form aggregated or influence the shape of the cell, but form a homogeneous layer around the cell.

We then started a series of enzymatic digestions in order to extrude CMVie from pIRES2-EGFP and just take its backbone, and to isolate sBLA from pSEAP.
In the meantime the plasmid pWW1015 we requested from Dr. M. Fussenegger arrived and was immediatedly amplified through transformation of DH5-alpha bacteria, while we also ordered the sequencing of the p65NTraR plasmid (BMR Genomics).
2nd Week (4–10 July)
The oligos we requested the earlier week arrived, and we proceeded with the annealing protocol for the two pairs of complementary strands.
Due to the irregular running pattern pSEAP displayed on agarose gel, we set out to do several control digestions in order to determine its integrity and we also sent a DNA sample to sequence its  multiple cloning site (MCS).
Meanwhile we also started the prokaryotic part of this work by transforming competent bacteria with all the Biobricks needed in this side of the project, and by PCR-amplifying the TraR-regulated promoter, TraI gene and TraR gene sequences from A.tumefaciens genomic DNA.
This Tra family has been cloned into pBluescript and then used to transform bacteria on Xgal-containing Petri dishes. Finally, a colony PCR has been carried out to further amplify the Tra family DNA sequences.
Moreover we transformed new bacteria in order to amplify a plasmid containing the enzyme beta-glucosidase (bGluc) we received from Dr. C. French.
3rd Week (11–17 July)
We obtained pIRES2-EGFP without CMVie but could not ligate our oligo inside it, so we devised new ligation strategies to amplify our backbone, removing all the unnecessary DNA sequences.
We also started working on some of the constructs needed to engineer our bacterial strains, namely: the bacterial construct A0, composed of a TraR-regulated promoter (P-TraR) followed by a beta-glucosidase (BBa_K392008), an E.coli ribosome binding site (RBS, BBa_J15001) and a double terminator (BBa_B0015); the bacterial construct B1, identical to A0 but under the transcriptional control of a LasR-regulated promoter (P-LasR, BBa_R0079); the bacterial construct B2, consisting of a constitutive promoter (BBa_J"

Introducing Team artico
After the tremendous success of team ""optoptosis"" Duesseldorf in 2016 it was clear that the iGEM spirit would be continued in Duesseldorf. In order to establish iGEM at another university as well, we decided to collaborate with the University of Cologne.
Looking back in time, collaboration between our two cities is nothing to be taken for granted, since the rivalry between the cities Duesseldorf and Cologne has been going on since the early 13th century. Nevertheless, we decided to put our rivalries aside and join forces for a much, MUCH bigger cause. With this year’s project we want to take a step towards synthetic cells by creating a fully controllable artificial compartment. Inspired by our scientific approach we decided to call our team “artico”.
This year’s team consists of 19 members, three instructors and three advisors from the University of Cologne and the Heinrich Heine University, Duesseldorf. We are especially proud to have built a team that does not only consist of straight forward biologists but also includes quantitative biologists, biochemists and even a physicist, forming an interdisciplinary group of young minds to achieve the best possible results in this year’s iGEM competition.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Overview#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html,", we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, including AT, ACP, KS, KR, ER, DH, and TE. Then we tested these equations and analyzed their feasibility.
DEBS 1 is the first part of the PKS which catalyzes and synthesizes 6dEB, the precursor of erythromycin. Its domain sequence is AT, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP. Theoretically, the kinetic model of domains which have been stacked is match with the kinetic model of DEBS 1+TE.
In modeling section, we kept pace with the members who are responsible for experiment. We stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1+TE. Meanwhile, we also simulated the kinetic equations of the whole DEBS 1+TE. Then we compared the equations of domains which have been stacked with the equation of DEBS 1+TE, and verified the feasibility of the model.

This protein is a lipopeptide transporter-dependent on proton motive force as the energy source, and it can mediate surfactin efflux, already validated by previous research. Thus, we have two transporters, one putative and one that could work, and our plan was near completion.
Now, we decided to put sfp and YerP/ lmrA together in a single operon to obtain coordinated and controllable expression. Since we want an overexpression of surfactin, we placed a strong constitutive promoter pVeg, which is selected from iGEM registry, before sfp, the gene we’d like to have a stronger expression. We also used a characterized effective ribosome binding sequence gsiB in proximity to sfp and YerP/ lmrA in the same fashion described as previous studies. Some routine considerations in designing our genetic fragments include the addition of double stop codons, codon optimization and planned removal of illegal restriction sites.
Regulation, Degradation and the Killer Switch
Besides constructing an operon, we also took care of other necessities to make our Bacillus subtilis behave more intelligently in our project."
