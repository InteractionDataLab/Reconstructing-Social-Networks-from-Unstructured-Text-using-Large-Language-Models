There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!

OUR PROJECT
Our team goal with the iGEM      project is to construct a yeast      generation counter. The idea is      that each time the cell divides      a different florescent protein is      produced. Therefore by examining      the cell under a microscope or in a      flow cytometer one can determine      how many times the cell has      divided.
Nowadays the determination of replicative age of yeast cells is     done by counting the budding scars of each cell in a microscope,     a process time consuming and not effective.
Our goal would be achieved by constructing a logical AND gate in     the cell where the input signals consist of a cyclin activated dCas9-     VP64 and a guide RNA (gRNA) signal from the previous cell cycle.     The output response consist of a different fluorescent protein and     a new gRNA molecule.
dCas9-VP64 is an engineered turntable transcription factor only     active when dimerized with an interchangeable gRNA molecule.     The gRNA also determines the specificity of the transcription     factor which enables the dCas9-VP64 to activate different     genes depending on the sequence of the gRNA molecule and     the promoter. gRNA consists of two parts, a scaffold and a 20     bp Specificity Determinant Sequence (SDS) on the 5’ end. The     scaffold constitutes the majority of the gRNA molecule and     gives it its structure whereas the SDS binds to the target site in     the gene promoter. Cyclins are proteins that are involved in the     progression of the cell cycle, therefore activated at specific times     [5]. To mimic the specific production pattern of cyclins the dCas9-     VP64 gene is placed under the control of a yeast cyclin promoter.     Therefore the Cas9 will be produced in the G1 phase. When the     Cas9 and gRNA dimerize and the transcription factor is activated,     it in turn activates the transcription of a new fluorescent protein     and a new gRNA molecule to act as a memory for the next cycle.     Once this age counter is implemented, it would be possible to sort     cells according to their replicative age automatically with a flow     cytometer device.

Tsinghua,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," to characterize the relationship of “AND” “OR” “NOT”. Usually this can be realized through the combination of different kinds of promoter or repressor and also cascade reactions and so on. To characterize the threshold, the binding site of the trigger and switch needs to be designed and so does the binding strength of the promoter and repressor. This part involves more analysis of biochemistry and biophysics.
If sub-problem 1 utilizes linear combination to characterize the relationship between y and x, the analysis of the problem is similar to the above.
Model1
Aim
To find out the relationship between whether or not have the cancer with the combinatory concentration of 4 or 3 kinds of miRNAs in the saliva.
Idea
This problem can be summarized as a classification problem. Concretely, we can use variable y, which only takes the values 1 or 0, to indicate with or without the cancer, and a 4 or 3 dimensional vector x, each element of which takes a real value, to represent the concentration of 4 or 3 kinds of miRNAs in the saliva. Then y can be modeled as a function of x:y=g(x)
The parameters of the model is unknown, but it can be learned using some machine learning techniques. Considering the scale and nature of this problem, we can use Fisher linear discriminant, logistic regression or SVM to solve this classification problem. Concretely, we can separate the data into a training set and a test set. We will use the training set to obtain the parameters, and the test set to test whether these learned parameters can make good predictions on new examples.
Method and Results
We use the experimental data from Salivary MicroRNAs as Promising Biomarkers for Detection of Esophageal Cancer, Zijun Xie et. al. Altogether, there are 58 samples, 46 of which are patients and the rest of which are healthy control.
Plotting the ROC curve
The ROC curve can be used to test whether a single feature (in our case, the concentration of a particular kind of miRNA in a person’s saliva) is linearly separable. The bigger the area under the ROC curve, the higher the possibility of the single feature being linearly separable is.
We have the following results:
Using the original concentration of miRNA:
Using the log2 of the concentration of miRNA:
Using the log10 of the concentration of miRNA:
For the above 3 figures, the first 3 subfigures are the results of 3 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s whole"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is commonly applied in lysing cells during DNA extraction. It is also used in SDS-PAGE to denature protein molecules. Though having little toxicity to the organism, long-term or repeated exposure may still irritate to eyes and skin, or even lead to allergy reaction for certain people. Under this circumstance, protections such as laboratory gloves and eye protectors are still recommended.
Investigating in the lab
In fact we know little about the things actually happening in the labs. So we had to go to many labs and observe the situations for ourselves. We designed a questionnaire and went to observe many biology labs in Tianjin. We talked with the students and got 193 samples for the questionnaire. We did the data analysis and took some pictures in the labs.
All the questions and the results are as follows. To make things clear, pictures taken in biology institutions in Tianjin will also be presented.
Q1. How is the experiment and resting area separated in your lab?
A. There is a separate room for resting purposes
B. Two areas are in the same room on separated benches.
C. Two areas are on the same bench with separated sections.
D. We practically do not separate those two areas.
E. Other situation
There are more and more young scientists returning to China from abroad, which is encouraged by the government. Also, many students choose to seek a higher degree in China and professors are encouraged to supervise more students. Accordingly,  many institutes have run out of room for laboratories and the laboratories are sometimes crowded with too many students and equipment. Though many laboratories have set a separate room for resting purposes, many laboratories cannot provide a living room for students. They have to set a special area in the room for living purposes and they agreed not to do experiment near the living area. They will remind each other not doing this. However, some reagents are easy to evaporate and some microorganisms can spread into the air. Things like that would still cause harm to the students. The slight harm can accumulate in the long-term lab work.
Also, there are some labs that don't care about this issue. In some microorganisms labs, the two areas have to share a bench or even do not separate with each other.
Different types of resting area in different labs.
Q2. How frequent do you have meal in lab (excluding the situation if you have the meal in a separated resting room)

Collaborations
The MIT iGEM team collaborated with the University of Georgia to help with the measurement of mCherry and protein concentration in an extract from M. maripaludis. The MIT team used the required plate reader and accompanied software to measure mCherry and protein concentration. The given samples were suspended in 25mM PIPES buffer at pH 6.8. As instructed, a designated extract from the set of 30 extracts was serially diluted to find the correct excitation wavelength for the plate reader. The goal of the collaboration was to contribute to the multitude of data points that the University of Georgia was looking to collect. We sent our data back to the team for analysis. We are glad that we could help with their project. https://2015.igem.org/Team:UGA-Georgia
The MIT IGEM also collaborated with the Wellesley-The Tech team to help test the prototype of their system intended on educating the public on how synthetic biology could eventually make colonization of another planet possible. We also aided them in giving feedback for their data visualization of personal genetic information. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Wellesley_TheTech"

Product Idea
The context
The global demand for energy is highly dependent on fossil fuels. Nowadays, gas, coal and oil provide 80% of the total demand (World Energy Council, 2013) . Those gases are associated with the emission of among other things carbon dioxide, which make them extremely environmental unfriendly. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the main pollutant that is warming earth. In the past 150 years people have pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to raise its levels higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years (IEA, 2016) . This has resulted in a temperature increase of almost 1 degree. Another problem of fossil energy sources is the fact that they are limited. Fossil fuels are not inexhaustible and as a result of the growing demand for energy, it is expected that they eventually will be exhausted in the future. Most people agree that to curb global warming and to prevent shortage, a variety of measures needs to be taken. Probably the best response to the growing energy problem is to switch to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Since in less than an hour, the theoretical potential of the sun represents more energy striking the earth’s surface than worldwide energy consumption in one year, this is considered to be the most promising renewable energy source (Crabtree, 2006) . In this context, solar panels will be the first application for the BioLens microlens array (BioLens MLA).
The problem
The efficiency of solar panels is still very low nowadays and has to be increased to make them profitable. One promising finding is the use of microlens arrays (MLAs). It is already proven that the use of a MLA as an encapsulation layer for the solar panels results in 20% to 50% increase of the efficiency (Jutteau, et al., 2015; Nam, et al., 2013) . However, the production of these MLAs is still relatively expensive and especially very environmental unfriendly (Nam et al., 2013) . Therefore, economically it is not favorable to use MLAs at the moment and perhaps even more important for us, it does not fit the idea about environmental friendly solar panels. After all, the production is very environment unfriendly.

Chip
Overview
The final setup of our CTC-detection system will be a water in oil emulsion within a microfluidic chip. To approximate this environment in the limited amount of time we had, we invested a lot of thoughts into our Chip design . We were able to test some components of our final system in the nanowell plate that resulted from this design process. We used our test setup to investigate lactate detection by our bacteria in a single cell analysis setup.
Fabrication of the chip
The construction of a microfluidic chip relies on three steps:
Designing a transparency mask of the chip architecture.
Generating a negative mold of the chip on a Si-wafer using a negative photoresist and standard photolitography technique.
Cast PDMS over the produced mold to get a positive image of the chip.
Many thanks to the D-BSSE Clean Room facility for making the mold, and the Tay group PDMS room facility for making the chip for us.
Draw the design on Autocad software.
Order the transparency mask from CAD/Art Services, Inc
Use a negative photoresist (SU-8-3025 ) for mold making
Non-stick functionalize mold: first, place mold in closed wafer carrier box with a beaker containing a few drops of TMCS. Incubate for 15-60 minutes.
Prepare the PDMS: Mix 10:1 PDMS: Weigh in 66g base PDMS + 6.6g curing agent. Then mix and defoam PDMS in Thinky mixer (3 min at 2000 RPM mix + 3 min at 2200 RPM defoam).
Cast chips: Pour 30 g of the mixed PDMS over wafer in a glass petri dish, degas wafers in excitator for 60 minutes and place in oven on level surfaces. Cure 45 minutes at 80 °C
Finalize chips: Carefully chips from wafers and cut the chips into the desired shape.
Preparation of the chip for the experiments

Conclusion: Aptamers can be used as hooks to detect a protein biomarker. Based on this encouraging results, EMSAs with two STIs couples biomarkers/aptamers were performed                                     (RT biomarker for HIV-1 and HBsAg biomarker for Hepatitis B virus), see below.
The fluorescent revelation system
The first system we worked on was the fluorescence detection system.
Principle
The aptamer is bounded to a fluorescent group (FITC). To temporarily switch off the fluorescence, we fixed on its reverse-complement a quencher molecule, that quenches                                 the fluorescence by Fluorescent Resonnance Energetic Transfert. When the ATP comes, as its affinity for the aptamer is higher, he removes the quencher to link the aptamer, that becomes fluorescent.
To detect the fluorescence, we use the smartphone-with-filters technique: put a blue filter on your flash, a green one on your camera, and take a picture of your test.                                 The FITC fluorescence should appear (see our Results page ).
Linking aptamers to the fluorescein
The aptamer is decorated with fluorescein thanks to crosslinking in presence of FITC.                                 This labelling allows further detection of the aptamer/target complex. The aptamer used here is known as ATP aptamer (DOI: 10.1021/la060961c)                                 The mix was analyzed on a PAGE gel stained with ethidium bromide (red color).                                 The gel was then analyzed thanks to a fluorescence imager (purple color). The figure below overlay the 2 images.
Fig 3. Observation of ATP Aptamer crosslinked with fluorescein on PAGE stained with ethidium bromide. Two bands are visible under a UV lamp after ethidium bromide staining. Only the heaviest band was fluorescent.
Conclusion: we successfully labelled half of the aptamers with fluorescein.
Testing the system on paper
Fluorescent labelled ATP aptamers were loaded and separated on a PAGE gel. A constant amount was loaded in each well. The DNA was blotted on nitrocellulose using capillary transfer. To quench the fluorescence we used quencher oligos. They are reverse complement fragments of 6 nucleotides of the aptamer labelled with a DABCYL molecule at their 3’ end.                                 These quencher oligos were hybridized"

This year’s iGEM Team from the University of Edinburgh aims to use and convert plant biomass, especially cellulose, to fermentable sugars like glucose. Therefore several cellulases are fused to a coat protein of the M13 bacteriophage. Ultimately the team’s goal is to create a biorefinery system to convert complex glucans into higher value products. The last year’s medicine track winner Freiburg presented their virus construction kit for therapy use. They managed to create different BioBricks and devices for individual virus construction. Last year’s grand prize winner Slovenia gave the audience a brief historical overview of all Slovenian iGEM projects so far. The session closed with the talk of the Team Bielefeld dealing with their topics from 2010 – a modulated two component sensor system for detection of capsaicin – and a preview for 2011 – nanobiotechnolgical S-layer based Biosensor for bisphenol A.
Additionally, the students used the opportunity to share and exchange their iGEM experience and their ideas of Synthetic Biology at the symposium and at the social events provided by the iGEM Team Bielefeld. The symposium’s iGEM session was a success and hence indices that the iGEM idea reached the scientific community.

NYU_Abu_Dhabi,2017,Team:NYU Abu Dhabi#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ylceramide (Gb3). Upon binding, the Shiga toxin is internalised by endocytosis. The endocytotic vacuole is transported to the trans-Golgi network, where subunit A exits through the vacuolar membrane and enters the cytoplasm. Then, this subunit enzymatically modifies the 28S rRNA of the 60S rRNA subunit by removing an adenine base. As a result, the binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the ribosome (dependent on elongation factor 1) is prevented, effectively blocking protein synthesis.2 Shiga toxin also induces apoptosis (Figure 3).3
Figure 3. Shiga-toxin's mode of action
What are the symptoms of STEC infections?
As an EHEC strain, STEC are capable of delivering virulence factors to epithelial cells in the surface of the colon through a contact secretion system. These factors alter the structure of the cytoskeleton of the eukaryotic cell, resulting in the formation of a pedestal where the bacterium sits. Moreover, the virulence factors trigger the expression of intimin receptors that tightly bind to the bacterium. It is thought that the deformation of the intestinal epithelium affects its absorptive functions, thus leading to diarrhea. In addition, the secretion of Shiga toxin causes capillary thrombosis and inflammation in the colonic mucosa,  leading to the manifestation of blood in stool. In more severe cases, the circulation of Shiga toxin can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life threatening disease characterized by renal failure, low platelet count, and haemolytic anemia.4 In the US alone, this strain causes 70,000 infections per year. Even more worrying is the fact that 6-9% of those causes resulted in HUS. 5-7% of the individuals affected by HUS did not survive (Fig. 4).5,6
Figure 4.Symptoms of STEC infection
What are we doing?
Due to the geographic location of NYUAD, which is in close proximity to countries where food safety is a daily, life-threatening concern, we were inspired to design and deliver an efficient solution to reduce the severity of this issue. We have produced a rapid, affordable and portable device that allows for the detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).
How are we doing it?

Utilization of artificial endosymbiosis to abolish land grabbing through the production of terpenoid derived chemicals
The term ""land grabbing"" describes the acquisition of land, mainly in developing                 and newly industrialized countries through foreign investors to plant crops for                 food production as well as for the production of valuable secondary plant substrates,                 for example pharmaceuticals or biofuels derived from terpenoids [1] .                 Although production of secondary plant substrates through microorganisms is possible in general,                 it is mostly either inefficient or extremely expensive in terms of research [2] .                 This is mainly due to the different properties of various microorganisms, where some are more                 suitable than others for the production of a desired substrate. In addition, this often                 goes beyond the utilization of traditional model organisms in microbiology, such as S.                 cerevisiae and E. coli. As mentioned before, it requires great effort in terms of engineering                 one of these organisms to make the production of especially these secondary plant substrates                 feasible.
To make this production through microorganisms more interesting and therefore solve the issue of                 land grabbing for this purpose, our project ""Syndustry – Fuse. Produce. Use"" combines the naturally                 given advantages of various model organism strains. For this, we created an artificial endosymbiosis                 between different organisms, mainly S. cerevisiae and E. coli. The organisms can be specialized to                 overcome bottlenecks for improvement of biotechnological productions or can even grant possibilities                  for productions that have not been established to date. The process to make this possible can mainly be                  divided into three parts: establishing a dependency between the organisms, implementation of a production                 pathway and the actual fusion of the organisms.
Since the biological safety of our system would be relevant to the recipients and the environment, we                 also investigated in the behaviour of certain bacterial safety mechanisms, the kill switches. Instead                 of designing one of our own, we took advantage of the numerous kill switches already implemented in the                 iGEM database. Using these, we were creating a model describing their escape rate in terms of evolutionary                 stability seeing them as a genetic network. We did so in collaboration with the iGEM team of Lethbridge,                 who performed to experimental work for verification of our model.
Due to the multiplicity of kill switches designed in the past years of iGEM, we also"

Results
Figure 1: Influence of heavy metals on the growth of E.coli KRX. The tested concentrations were 20 µg/L lead, 60 µg/L mercury, 60 µg/L chromium, 80 µg/L nickel, 40 mg/L copper, which represent ten times the WHO guideline. The influence of arsenic was not tested as E. coli is known to be resistant to arsenic.
We tested our heavy metal biosensors in Escherichia coli as well as in our cell-free protein synthesis.
Prior to the in vivo characterization, we tested whether the heavy metals have a negative effect on the growth of E. coli.
As can be seen from the figure, we observed no significant difference between the growth in the presence of heavy metals and the controls. This first experiment showed us that in vivo characterization of these sensors is possible. Most cultivations for in vivo characterization were performed in the BioLector. Due to the accuracy of this device, we could measure our samples in duplicates. Subsequently, all functional biosensors were tested in vitro.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for Cre-EBD , which is an inducible form of the appropriate site-specific recombinase. Results of the recombination events are dependent on the directionality of the loxp sites. Because of the asymmetry of the loxp sites, when a pair of loxp sites is present in the same DNA strand and they are in opposite orientations, the Cre recombinase will catalyze the inversion of the gene in between the loxp sites; when the loxp sites are in same orientation, this gene will be deleted. Unlike the native directional loxP site, which permits a single orientation for recombination, the synthetic loxPsym site’s symmetry ensures that any pair of sites can recombine in either orientation. Then, controlled expression of Cre-EBD leads to deletions and inversions with chromosome segments flanked by loxPsym sites[1].This characteristic allows more possibilities of recombination on yeast chromosome which lives up to our expectations.
Fig. 3.1 The left : when the loxp sites are in same orientation, this gene will be deleted. The middle : when the loxp sites are in opposite orientations, this gene will be inversed. The right : when the loxp sites are on different chromosomes, the gene will be exchanged[2].

Experiment Design
Construction of Cre-loxpsym System
First, We use two common expression vector plasmid, PRS416 and PRS413(with different nutrition label), in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to load our device, which consists of heterologous gene part (PCLB2 promoter, Cre-EBD gene, CYC1 terminator) . Second, we transform the pSCW11-CRE/EBD plasmid into synX strain , respectively and get three strains with Cre-EBD, 079 and 160 with ura tag ,085 with his tag.

4.Optimization of RBS
    As we’ve got to know in papers about B. megaterium, the RBS sequence plays a cardinally significant role in protein expression. It’s mostly preferred to have 7 to 10 bp of RBS between the mRNA and the 3’ end of the 16S rRNA. Cytosines or guanines shouldn’t be included in the spacer region between RBS and the start codon, which also has a preferred length of 7 to 9 bp. Since N. pacificus and B. megaterium belong to different phyla, we propose that they have low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and optimization of RBS is necessary for the heterogeneous expression of RdhANP in B. megaterium. But unfortunately we haven’t found the RBS for rdhANP in N. pacificus. In this. Therefore, we decided to recombine the promoters and RBSs in our expression vectors and adjust the length of spacer between the RBS and start codon of rdhANP. In this way, we have constructed 5 Biobricks listed below concerning to this subject for the sake of other potential users in subsequent iGEM competitions.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#TimeControl_-_-_TEXT.html," are able to repress their downstream constitutive promoters separated by double terminators. These promoters         are pcI (BBa_R0051) and pPhlF (BBa_K1725000) respectively. The two pairs of repressors and promoters do not         work in synchrony i.e. when cI expresses, PhlF is repressed and vice versa.
Since the purpose of this time delay is to turn Cre recombinase either on or off dependent on the presence of AHL,         there are two scenarios of activity in Time Module Construct:
In the absence of AHL, only PhlF molecules produce and repress its pPhlF. Then, the expression of downstream             recombinase is rendered.
The second scenario is when sufficient AHL initiates cI protein production. The cI molecules will inhibit PhlF expression         by repressing pcI. This turns on pPhlF, leading to expression of recombinase.
In order to observe the maximum and minimum time for the delay in Cre recombinase expression, ribosomal binding site (RBS)         downstream to pLuxR is adjusted. In iGEM biobricks, multiple strengths of RBS can be sought. We selected         five different ribosomal strengths, ranging from the strongest to the weakest:
1.0 RBS (BBa_B0034)
0.6 RBS (BBa_B0030)
0.3 RBS (BBa_B0032)
0.07 RBS (BBa_B0031)
0.01 RBS (BBa_B0033)
The stronger the RBS strength, the higher the recombinase expression. We expect that transcriptional and translational         delay of repressor coupled with tuning ribosomal strength to the lowest degree will significantly contribute to the         longest delay of Cre expression.
Planned characterization
LuxR cassettes expresses LuxR protein that can form dimers with AHL. This dimer is the inducer for pLuxR.         In order to see the effect of different RBS strength used in our time control construct, we use YFP whose expression         can be quantified by fluorescence level.

Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Policy and Practice Manager
As Policy and Practice manger it was my task to “connect” our product to the real world. I was responsible for finding applications for our project. One of those applications, the micro lens arrays as encapsulation layer for solar panels, appeared to be commercially very interesting and I have written a business plan about this application therefore. Furthermore, I have been in contact with multiple researchers, managers and scientists to discuss and improve our project.  Together with Lara, I have worked on a report about iGEM and I think we found some interesting ways to improve iGEM even further. Furthermore, I really enjoyed working with Iris on the Safety tool we have developed in collaboration with the RIVM. Eventually, I have presented the tool during the RIVM and Rathneau event. Next to this event we contributed to multiple other events and it was my responsibility to organize this. Additionally"

We made inoculations using the E. coli carrying pOPPY-XLR2-yX in LB/AMP and the yeast from the previous round of YMC in YNB-CSM-Leu. Colony PCR on E. coli showed bands indicating two colonies had successful transformants. We made streak plates using the two successful transformants, and then went on to make liquid cultures from these colonies. We miniprepped the pOPPY-XLR2-yX plasmid and then performed PCR, mistakenly using Q5 polymerase rather than OneTaq. Q5 polymerase could do the job just fine, it is just much more expensive than OneTaq for simply verifying the size of a fragment!
We isolated more stock of our D17 plasmid for further Gibson Assembly trials. These were miniprepped out to concentrations of ~450 and ~500ng/uL. In order to get growth from the rest of our aptameric inserts, we redid streak plates with higher depositions of transformant. We also redid a transformation of D17 into DH5α to test if our sample of cells was properly competent. These new transformations were unsuccessful, we eventually found this was because of an error in the creation of competent cell stocks.
While more chemicompetent cell cultures were being produced, we used electrocompetent stocks to preform more transformations on E. coli with our recircularized plasmids. We wrote up a new protocol for electroporation and ran tests to optimize our procedure.
We ran another 50uL linearization PCR to restock and checked this on a gel. Then, we performed 5 more transformations to get our recircularized stocks into E. coli.
We attempted a yeast plasmid miniprep yet again, this time using S. cerevisiae containing a backbone pXRL2 connected to five progesterone pathway genes. Despite the improvement in our previous attempt, this attempt yielded an unusable sample. We concluded that our procedures may be inadequate.

Background
Although trying very hard by many brilliant scientists and doctors for decades, the therapies of cancer were still painful and ineffective for patients in many cases. Among various kinds of tumors, solid tumors, which are also the subjects of our projects, have it own features on destroying people’s health. Solid tumors are visible lumps that can be detected by clinical examination. The vessels inside solid tumors are abnormal structurally and functionally, thus cannot provide adequate oxygen and nutrients. The partial pressure of oxygen in normal tissues is 3.21-8.8kPa, while in the solid tumor the pressure is 1.33-4kPa or less than 0.33kPa. Therefore, the solid tumor cells easily undergo necrosis inside, forming regions with necrosis and lack of oxygen, acute or chronic, weakening the effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while the residual tumor cells become more invasive and metastatic. According to many clinical surveys, solid tumor constitutes the most severe type of cancers that threaten human health.
Synthetic biology provides scientists with a novel approach to tackle with cancer cells, which is to use the modified bacteria to express toxic protein as drugs to kill cancer cells yet do no significantly affect the survival of normal cells. The work of Jeff, published in 2016, proved the validity and feasibility of this approach.  In addition to this pioneer work, many kinds of bacteria are regarded safe in vivo. These bacteria show no immunogenic to human bodies, and they could be controlled by the recombinant plasmids. Besides, the growth and reproduction of anaerobic bacteria predominantly happens in hypoxia regions, which coincides with the feature of solid tumors. We took advantage of all these previous work and  planned our own project accordingly.
Design
We were inspired by the work of  TecMonterrey  team in 2013 that the modified bacteria with TAT-apoptin expression elements could be used to kill tumor cells. Apoptin is a protein consisting of 121 amino acids and can selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells yet do no harm to normal cells. It interacts with histone proteins and non-histone proteins in the H1 group in plasmosome and such interaction could lead to DNA rupture and enrichment. TAT was added to"
NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,".coli naturally, there aren't any secretion systems in wild type E. coli to transport Florigen out of the cell. Though secretion through cell lysis may seem as a possible method to solve this problem, we still seek for other ways in order not to let our E. coli die during the secretion process. Thus, we ought to create a secretion system which can help Florigen pass through the inner and outer membrane of E. coli. We have found a system from the 2012 Kyoto iGEM team called Twin Arginate Translocation (Tat) pathway, which can help send Florigen from the inner membrane to periplasm. In the Tat pathway, a Tat transporter recognizes TorA signal. Proteins possessing a TorA signal at their N terminals can permeate into the periplasm. Moreover, the 2012 Kyoto iGEM team also found out that the kil protein from λ phage are capable of making holes on the outer membrane, which then transports Florigen out of the cell. In other words, with the kil protein gene fused with the torA and FT protein gene in our biobrick, we should be able to successfully transport Florigen out of the E. coli.
The use of Auxin is to induce the growth of shoot, but an excess amount of Auxin would likely kill the plant. We want to reach the maximum amount that will promote the plant’s growth but without killing the plant. After researching, the Imperial College London 2011 iGEM team also had the same problem. They chose the native Auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) as their solution. Compared to the former, the synthetic Auxin is more stable since it can be preserved for weeks. However, an excess amount of IAA could be toxic. To ensure the efficiency but at the same time not excessive, they built a model to reach the maximum amount.
We intend to carry out our application with the device beneath. Cultured in the growth medium circulation, our engineered E. coli can absorb enough nutrition to express the desired genes properly. We also use a filter, which allows hormones but not bacteria themselves to pass through, separating the bacteria from plant tissues. Thus, we keep the tissue culture medium isolated.
Under red light and 37 °C, Cytokinin will be produced. Cytokinin is a plant growth substance which can primarily induce cell growth and differentiation in plant roots and shoots. It can decrease apical dominance which will make the main stem grow better compared with other stems. In this way, all the stems are able"

The Coliguard - Killing
Introduction
After the detection of a contaminant by our Coliguard System, part of the labor population must become the killer population, which has as the most remarkable feature the ability to kill this contaminant.
As our project is focused to solve the problem in the production of ethanol, we decided to develop our killing mechanism to be able to destroy the most important bacterial contaminant of this process, the Lactobacillus group, a group of Gram positive bacteria.
But how can a bacteria kill another bacteria without killing itself? That was our first question to answer in the development of this mechanism. To solve this problem we focused in the main biological difference between our guard bacteria, E. coli, and the contaminant, Lactobacillus.
The main difference is that E. coli is a Gram Negative bacteria and Lactobacillus is a Gram positive. That means E. coli have two cell membranes around  a thin cell wall which remains isolated from the intracellular and extracellular environment. That not occurs with the Gram positive bacteria, because they have a thick cell wall with direct contact with the extracellular environment and surrounds the cell membrane.
With these differences in mind we propose a way to attack the exposed cell wall of Lactobacillus secreting something in the medium capable of doing harm just to this structure and not to E. coli’s outer membrane. We found lysozymes the most able enzyme to do this work, and we chose it as our weapon.
Now that our weapon has been chosen, we face a new problem. How to put it out the E. coli?
The Alpha Hemolysin Secretion System
E. coli, as a Gram negative bacteria, doesn’t have a well developed secretion system to transport proteins to the extracellular medium. The best system we found is the alpha hemolysin secretion system.
The alpha hemolysin secretions system is encoded in a operon containing four genes, Picture1A: hlyD and HlyB constitutes the transporter, HlyA is the hemolysin itself and HlyC codifies to a protein important to"

Before purifying the bacteriocin by IMPACT, the bacteriocin must first be transformed into the IMPACT vector bacteria, E. Coli:ER2566.  To do this, we  incorporated  the  pPCR product into the IMPACT plasmid, pTXB1. Thereafter  the products are digested by following the SOP0025. step. 8.1.1. and afterwards ligated by following step 8.1.3 → 8.1.4 in the same SOP.
The following gel image were used to verify that K2018010 were successfully cloned into pTXB1 (the IMPACT vector). Lane 4-6 is K2018010/pTXB1. Lane 4 and 6 showed the correct sized band. Lane 5 is a negative.

DL We ran into several problems while doing the titer.  After we had completed the titer, we found out that the pipet tips we had used were contaminated.  When preparing the top agar, we had to melt it in the microwave which caused it to boil over.  This could have caused some contamination.  While filling my -5 plate with top agar, there was only enough to put in 4mL of agar instead of the 5mL that was called for in our procedure.
RESULTS: 3/22  None of the plates had any phage.  There was just a lawn of bacteria growing. This could either be because of the problems mentioned above or because the source of T3 was bad.  Seeing as nobody else was able to grow any phage we believe that the source was old.
3/22/13
AC 3/22
We had several sources of error in our procedure. First off there was contamination that affected our results. The micropipette tips that we used had not been autoclaved. This caused contamination to several plates. We also microwaved the augar instead of using a heat bath. This caused there to be tons of condensation in the plates and the augar to crack. We didn’t have any plates that had phage present.
Results: Despite the sources of error, it was pretty clear that the phage did not react with the bacteria. This was either because the phage was not viable, or because of the contamination.
AB 3/22/2013
None of the plates showed phage. A big problem that we had was contamination, but our agar was also crystal looking and cracked in several places. sources of contamination were accidental use of unautoclaved pipettte tips, and the agar was microwaved and exploded, causing water condensed in the microwave to fall into the agar.  Results: No phage, lots of contamination. We may need a new source of phage, or just better lab technique.
Next step: find procedures for purifying different phage. Become experts on phage structure. possibly help with designing point mutations.

Moved onto magnetoferritin synthesis, but the resulting product contained a lot of particles in it, we fear this may be due to synthesis of magnetite crystals in addition to magnetoferritin.
We did our tested heavy ferritin as ordered from the synthesis company for expression on an SDS-PAGE. The J04500 LacI induced promoter was induced with 0.8mM IPTG for four hours at 0.6OD for the cultures. The protein was either not expressed or was too difficult to distinguish from the background proteins in the cell. Protein trials will be repeated once we assemble construct two in iGEM’s pSB1C3.
Also continued on with the ABTS kinetics experiments. We were able to create graphs showing the effectiveness of our catalyst under varying pH.

Week 16: August 12 - August 16
Finished off the ABTS kinetics experiments for prussian blue ferritin, which involved finding the optimal temperature for the reaction. But the spectrophotometer available to us is limited to 25-45C. This limitation is still within our expected prototype temperature and therefore it is not a big worry. We will then continue on with determining the kinetics for TMB and find out which substrate is better for our system.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Due to multiple failures of the plasmid switches of both ferritin and other parts, we conducted tests on multiple aspects of our procedures, including ligase, phosphatase and buffer. None of these parts were determined to be problematic, therefore we attempted higher DNA concentrations on controls, which worked. Therefore we will attempt the plasmid switch of the ferritin parts at some other time.
We also began initial tests with TMB, but realized our stock concentrations were at 1mg/mL. As these results would be incomparable to our ABTS experiments, which were at 10mg/mL, we remade the TMB stock solution to 10mg/mL and redid the experiments.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
Our first attempts at observing one of our fusion proteins on SDS-PAGE were conducted, although the bands do not appear to contain the protein. We’ve read about a technique that can stain iron, which is essentially the same as the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin. Using this method we could exploit the iron core of ferritin by running a native PAGE and staining the iron core. This would"

The 2nd LIVE
The 2nd Open Night Live to show the iGEM teams in Shanghai and to give an opportunity to people to exchange ideas and ask questions to every iGEM member. It has been an honor for us to invite Fudan, Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to our ONLive. We were delighted to find out that there were students from other universities watching our LIVE and asking questions. There was even a girl who watched our 1st ONLive in UITC Hefei, which is far away from Shanghai, and came to ONLive to ask questions. Some audience members said something about what more can our project do. Some of the suggestions even made it into our projects (we thought they were reasonable). There was also a symposium among iGEM teams after the Live and we exchanged ideas. We also set up a webcast and gave ONLive to iGEM teams in other provinces.
Before the work mentioned above, we used a questionnaire to understand what the children and parents want in the class and what they can get from the toolbox. We collected and analyzed the data to consider the cost and improve our toolbox. We hoped our toolbox could influence more people. The supporting courses and the contents of the toolbox have changed thanks to the data to make it attractive to more people who might be interested in our toolbox and Synthetic Biology.
We adjusted the contents of the toolbox and supporting courses according to the results of the questionnaire.             Following is part of the questionnaire, there were 20 questions and the sample size is 417:              Q4. Are you interested in learning more about Biology?
Q6. Do you think that your children (or if you have a child in the future) will need more extensive biological knowledge?
Q10. What kind of biological knowledge do you think your child can develop? [multiple choice]
Q13. Do you think a toolbox will help your children (or you) learn more about Biology?
Q20. At what price would you buy this toolbox?

Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," majority people support “treatment and prevention of human diseases”  as the most urgent problem. “command of environment pollution” are in the  second place, followed by “efficient energy production”. “Construction of  appropriate ethical system” was the least.
From this questionnaire, we can easily draw  the conclusion that synthetic biology has been developed to some extent in  universities in contemporary China,  but not very well. The great majority of people do not know synthetic biology  or IGEM at all, according to our data. To our relief, most people already have  some comprehension to synthetic biology. Although faced with safety issues,  many people showed a supportive attitude to the development of synthetic  biology. A large percent of people hold the belief that they should possess the  power to monitor it. Frankly speaking, there’s a long way to go before  realizing people’s demand. There being a vast part of people have the desire to  join IGEM, we hope that synthetic biology could be understood by more people,  we hope people with such dreams could be able to achieve their goals one day,  we hope those worries that people have about synthetic biology could be solved  earlier, we hope that more robust management system could be established as  soon as possible. As great fans of synthetic biology, as students with great  dreams of Tianjin   University, we will  spread knowledge of synthetic biology heart and soul. We believe synthetic  biology will have a better future tomorrow!
③Interaction Activities
（1） Visit to TIB,CAS
On July 31, 2014, our team visited Tianjin  Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, sharing some perspectives of our project and discussing the  direction of further application.
After providing them with our preliminary  plan, we consulted professors there on our weakness and difficulties,  concentrating on the potential applications of our project. In addition to the  detection of the concentration of certain micro-molecules or macro-molecules,  we were inspired that we may also measure the expression level of different  promoters by using our platforms.
Though  we know our team may be faced with a lot of difficulties from our visit, we  also enjoyed the special tour. New ideas can be inspired through good  communication. It provided us with a great opportunity to know deeper about our  projects and synthetic biology.
 
（2） Communication with BIT
On September 18, 2014, our team came to Beijing  Institute of Technology (BIT) for a brief discussion on our projects. We each  made a presentation and exchanged the ideas on both."
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," the PEX13−mRuby plasmid and the level 2 plasmid was performed in order to verify peroxisomal colocalization.
PTS screening
Trusting on our targeted approach alone seemed risky − that is why we planned a PTS screening to find the most favorable PTS for our three receptors. Dueber et al. (2016) used the Violacein assay for a similar purpose. They screened for the best PTS for the wild type receptor and were successful. Hence another subproject of our team is the integration of the Violacein pathway into the peroxisome ( Violacein ), we were already supplied with all necessary enzymes − VioA, VioB and VioE.
Figure 1.8: Pathway leading to the production of prodeoxyviolacein − the assay is based on the green color to identify colonies without functional import mechanism.
The figure above shows the principles of the assay. VioA and VioB are localized in the cytosol and lead to the production of the IPA imine dimer while VioE is tagged with a PTS1 variant. Successful import leads to white colonies whereas missing import results in green colonies due to the cytosolic production of prodeoxyviolacein.
Our rests upon the following two plasmids which are co-transformed into yeast.
Figure 1.9: Plasmids used for Violacein assay. The left one carries the coding sequence for the Pex5 variant, VioA and VioB whereas the right one contains the gene for VioE plus the attached PTS1 variant.
As shown above, we created one plasmid containing VioA, VioB and one of our Pex5 variants while the other plasmid only contained VioE. We then designed primers which bind to the VioE plasmid to amplify the whole plasmid except the terminator − random PTS1 variants were attached to VioE with the help of a random primer library. Following up, we did the ligation with the corresponding terminator and obtained a mix of several different VioE-PTS1 plasmids.
After plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli we then co-transformed yeast with the two constructs and waited for the colonies to grow. With the yeast growing, prodeoxyviolacein should be produced in yeast cells with absent import (green color) and the IPA imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.

Interview with recovered patient
One gorgeous day, three of us visited a teacher, who has recovered from breast cancer for 4 years. The purpose of this meetup was to recognize deeply how a cancer patient suffered from cancer. She surprised us with her open-minded, optimistic and brave personality. She discovered the tumor by herself and confronted with her misfortune straightly. Because of her characteristic, she overcame the cancer with only 4 chemotherapies. We really appreciate her sharing.  During the conversation, we had a wonderful interaction with her, introducing our ideas and goals to her. Despite that the therapy she took was not relative to our project, we still received a lot of supportive response for our project from her. Last but not the least, we all realized some valuable experiences and feelings in the recesses of our mind from this meetup!

Newsletter
We took part in Amoy newsletters no 1, no2 and no3.We have shown how our team works. The best thing is that we shared our experiences to harmonize with each team member, hoping to share the key to success. We also wrote about the ethics topic that happened in Guangzhou’s Sun Yat-sen University about modifying human embryos. Lastly, we also talked about the progressing project. We had been proud and happy to share all our knowledge, our opinions and with the world.

Valérie Desjardin (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Alexandre Duprey (Lyon 1)
PhD student at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, I'm back for a fourth year of iGEM ! This time as an instructor, I'm excited to see entirely new aspects of an iGEM project, and experimenting teaching in an unusual and rather unique way.
Apart from iGEM, I'm preparing a thesis on the regulation of the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. You know, complex stuff involving 5 different proteins, 2 promoters and DNA supercoiling acting simultaneously on a single gene... Still, I hope my experience with genetic regulation, reporters and data analysis prove useful to the team.
Emiel van der Kouwe (Pharmacist and biologist)
Freshly graduated as a pharmacist but also in Systems and Synthetic Biology, I had the unique opportunity of coordinating the Evry iGEM team 2013. The experience was intense and stressful, albeit very addictive and rewarding. Back in my hometown, I met the organizers of the Lyon Jamboree 2013 and joined their 2014 team as a supervisor. My favorite experience so far is to tease Juliette Paillet and push her mental toughness to the limit. I sincerely hope this team will go through the same experience as I did.

3.     On what aspect does the cyanobacteria problem have an impact
The effective number is 91 in total. Among all these interviewees, 24 of them agree that cyanobacteria may particularly influence the drinking water; 10 of them take the view that cyanobacteria may have an impact on family's daily water usage; 9 claim that it may affect fishery products; 45 of them indicate that it may have an impact on water quality; 16 of them are worried about the aquatic ecosystem and other environmental issues; 13 interviewees agree that it may damage the appearance of the Lake Taihu; 16 support that there might be dreadful smell; and the rest don't think it will influence their life at all.
ps: for this question, people could choose more than one option
Online Research
The online research is crucial to our social research, as it provides us with the most precise perspective through which we could learn about the public opinion on our project. Unlike our former questionnaires, this time the online questionnaire is more complicated and more inclusive of detailed questions about the outbreak of cyanobacteria, the government's policies toward such problems, current solutions to the outbreak and our special approach. Among all 21 questions, about 60% are general to cyanobacteria, and over 20% are about our project itself. Even though we've spent a lot of time and effort designing the questionnaire, we knew with satisfaction that our effort paid off when we received over 200 responses.
Part of the results presents as follows
I. The Outbreak of Cyanobacteria in China
Most people have heard about water pollution and cyanobacteria outbreak passively through TV programs or websites, but a large proportion of them are indifferent towards the issue: about 55% of the interviewees don't feel that their lives are affected by the outbreak of cyanobacteria. When being asked about what they think lead to cyanobacteria outbreak, the interviewees provide various responses: the unregulated disposal of fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus, the loss of biodiversity in the water body, and even a warmer temperature, etc. They provide their opinions on the advantage and disadvantage about the existing methods: for instance, salvaging is of lower expense but not effective enough, while using chemicals is faster but causes severe harm to the ecosystem. Despite all the different opinions, people generally all agree that there is no one perfect solution right now.
II. About the project itself
It really encourages us that the interviewees are surprisingly supportive"

The correct clones were sent for sequencing. This time the fragments showed the sequence we needed. (Figure 6)
Figure 6 Sequencing result for the ccdB toxin dam methylase part.
Plasmid Assembly
To assembly our final plasmids we used the correct sequenced pjet clones to perform a PCR. To see if we have the correct sequence we perform agarose gel and extracted the correct sized DNA band from the gel.
The next thing we did was to digest the different parts with the correct enzymes. After cutting we cleaned the product to be sure we can perform a perfect ligation.  After the ligation and transformation, we expected red and blue colonies.  To be sure the clones which turned blue and red had the correct plasmid we did a restriction digest of different colonies. For both clones we used EcoRI for restriction analysis. For the reason this enzyme has two restriction sites we expected two fragments one fragment with 1000bp and one with 4000bp. For the pUC19_red_mazF we checked 8 clones und 6 of them were positive (Figure 7). For the pUC19_blue_ccdB we checked only three clones. Two of the three showed the pattern we assumed (Figure 8).

Debating safety
Wellcome Reading Room Open Platform Event
We found a very useful way of generating more in-depth debates on synthetic biology: small scale events. We experimented with a focused conversation, titled ‘Guiding cell behaviour with light – technology of the future?’ Ten visitors from various backgrounds discussed societal and ethical impacts of light-induced technologies and initiated a debate on how policy for those should be developed. We divided them into stakeholder groups to direct their brainstorming towards more focused goals and used 2 provocative statements to initiate debate about ethical and societal issues between the groups involved. We then used the focused list of issues that should be addressed, when producing our policy plan.

Smart Dinner
Alex from EatOffTheMenu gets people together to talk about philosophy, the latest dumb thing presidents may have said or fashion. We pitched the idea of trying to get 10 people from different backgrounds more comfortable talking about genetically engineering organisms.
Throughout the dinner, sensitive points were raised, such as the history of using and misusing genetics in and about humans; we talked about safety and what expectations people have from those who choose to engineer organisms or explore new such possibilities and what they think alternatives to what synthetic biology promises are. After introducing the concept of CRISPR-Cas9 system, we discussed whether the government should implement a policy to genetically engineer humans to eradicate diseases, similarly to the implementation of vaccination programmes. Generally, people agreed that at the moment we are not ready to answer such questions definitely and that more interdisciplinary work is needed on the topic.
We encourage future iGEM teams to consider such small scale events, through which people can interact in a more relaxed fashion. Events that would turn into a regular activity can definitely benefit an iGEM project or university, which can get local support from people interested in how synthetic biology develops and how it can impact their communities.

ECOL activity at different temperatures
Figure 18: Standard activity test for ECOL measured at 10°C and 25°C resulting in a decreased activity at 10°C. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10°C were analyzed.
To investigate the activity of ECOL at lower temperatures activity tests as described above were done at 10°C and 25°C (Figure 18). A significant decrease in the activity can be observed upon reducing the temperature from 25°C to 10°C. While the activity at 10 °C is reduced, final saturation levels are still comparable: after 3,5 hours, only 2% difference in oxidized ABTS is observable. The negative control without the ECOL laccase and only 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10°C shows a negligible oxidation of ABTS. Although a decrease in the activity of ECOL laccase was expected the observed reduction in enzyme activity is problematic for the possible application in waste water treatment plants where the temperature differs from 8.1°C to 20.8°C. A more cryo tolerant enzyme would be preferable.
ECOL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
Figure 19: Analysis of ABTS oxidation by ECOL laccase tested with different amounts of ABTS. The higher the amount of ABTS the more oxidized ABTS can be detected.
Furthermore ECOL laccase were tested using different amounts of ABTS to calculate KM and Kcat values. The same measurement setup as described above was used only with different amounts of ABTS. As anticipated the amount of oxidized ABTS increased in dependence of the amount of ABTS used (Figure 19). The results of the measurements of the samples tested with 16 µL could not be detected longer than 1.5 h because the values were higher than the detection spectrum of the device used ( TecanReader ).
Impact of MeOH and acetonitrile on ECOL
For substrate analytic tests the influence of MeOH and acetonitrile on ECOL laccase had to be determined, because substrates have to be dissolved in these reagents. The experiment setup included 0.03 mg mL-1 ECOL laccase, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, different amounts of MeOH (Figure 20"

- BSA
- TOTAL – 50 µl
Procedure:
1. Calculate how much template is needed for digestion. Then calculate how much water needs to be added to make a 50 µl reaction.
2. Pipette appropriate amounts of dH20, template, and 10x Buffer in that order into a PCR tube (200 µl). Mix reagents together by vortexing and then tapping tube on desk to keep reagents on the bottom of the PCR tube.
3. Add appropriate amounts of Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2. Add .5ul BSA, or other volume depending on BSA content in enzymes. Once added gently swirl around reaction mix with pipette tip.
4. Incubate at 37o C for 1 – 2 hours
5. Incubate at 80 oC for 20 minutes to deactivate the restriction enzymes
6. Run a gel of your digestions on a gel with low temperature melting agarose. Run at 100V for 1 hr. 30 min.
7. Look at gel under 320nm UV light. Conduct gel extraction purification.
NOTE: When digesting your vector it may be useful to use 2 µl of each enzyme in the 50 µl reaction and extending incubation time.
Gel Purification
What you need:
- The sample of interest, typically a DNA double-digest (50 uL)
- A low-melt gel
- Razor blade
- Autoclaved 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes
- Agarose-dissolving buffer (ADB)
- Big Zymo-spin columns in collection tubes
- DNA wash buffer
- Autoclaved MilliQ water
Procedure:
1. Place each sample into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
2. To each tube, add 3 volumes of ADB (i.e for 100 uL gel slice add 300 uL ADB)
3. Incubate at 37-55˚C in the warm water bath until the gel is completely dissolved (if DNA fragment is larger than 8kb, add one additional gel volume of water to the tube following incubation for better DNA recovery)
4. Transfer the melted agarose solution to a Zymo-spin column in a collection tube
5. Centrifuge for 30 seconds and discard liquid flow-through
6. To the column, add 200uL wash buffer
7. Centrifuge for 30 seconds and discard the liquid flow-through
8. Repeat steps "

Unfortunately, we didn’t succeed to isolate an inducible pIV* in time. But we have managed to optimise methods and protocols that can be quite useful to reach this goal. We just needed some more time because, as the first team of our university, we had to discover the difficulties to lead such an ambitious project, such as looking for sponsors, establishing efficient communications, etc.
Despite this disappointment, we obtained an intermediate phenotype that can still be improved and used. We think our project has some more potential to be exploited and we count on further UCLouvain teams to take over from us.

Figure 3. pET-15b was used for cytoplasmic and periplasmic expression of proinsulin and winsulin.
B. Subtilis
pUS258 is an integrative expression vector which undergoes homologous recombination to insert into the amyE gene of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. It’s a relatively simple plasmid using the same IPTG induction system that we use across all of our expression systems.
Figure 4. pus258 was used for cytoplasmic and periplasmic expression of proinsulin and winsulin.
Our Expression Systems
In order to maximise the yield of our insulin, while also reducing the post-expression methods currently undertaken by manufacturers, we tested both of these constructs in three different expression systems. Two of these expression systems were in BL21 E. coli, and the other was in Bacillus subtilis.
E. Coli- Cytoplasm
Cytoplasmic Expression
Cytoplasmic expression is our recombinant protein production in its raw and simple form. With no tags attached to the fusion protein, both Winsulin and Proinsulin will accumulate within the cytoplasm to form aggregated inclusion bodies. Extraction will involve complete lysis of the cell and purification will require separating them from DNA,  membranes and other proteins.
The reason to express in the cytoplasm is mainly to compare our other expression systems to where we will be able to see whether they are a viable means of production.
We are using the E. Coli shuffle strain as alternative to BL21 because it is associated with a higher capacity to fold recombinant protein within the cytoplasm This should promote the formation of disulfide bonds and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies
Figure 5. Details of E. Coli cytoplasmic expression of pro/winsulin
E. Coli- Periplasm
Periplasmic Expression
Potentially the biggest hurdle to overcome in efficiently producing recombinant insulin is having the three disulfide bonds in proinsulin and active insulin form correctly. This is because they require an oxidative environment that isn’t usually found in the cytoplasm of common protein factories like E. coli where proteins are naturally expressed.
Fortunately, the periplasmic compartment of gram negative bacteria, including E. coli is more oxidative than the cytoplasm and will therefore improve disulfide bond formation. So we are using"

International enterprises such as Roche gave us a better understanding of medicine and public’s need to a convenient, noninvasive diagnosis method. We’re surprised to see that there are so many people are actually afraid of traditional diagnosis method like colonoscopy and how widely brand new diagnosis ways are accepted. Thus, we collaborated with 2018 iGEM team Tongji_China to make our engineered systems into a capsule, a real product, taking the first step to make this project applicable to practical use.
On the way developing our project to real device, biosafety is definitely something that requires detailed design and awareness, especially when our device is designed to be consumed orally. Despite the suicide mechanism we’ve designed to prevent our device from remaining in vivo, we also strictly obeyed every rules and regulations approved by iGEM Safety Committee as well as our nation and institution. We also set up a standard to evaluate the safety level of an iGEM project and you can see further details at Biosafety page.

We put lots of time into developing human practices this year by working on ethics, safety, sustainability, and many other human practice initiatives. We conducted an ethical review of our project and the Lethbridge high school’s project. For safety we continuously use safe practices in the lab and have started to develop a bioreactor for the implementation of our lab. Our project focuses on sustainability as our construct would replace environmentally harmful disposal methods. Lastly, throughout the year we also conduced many different human practices initiatives such as connecting with industries directly affected by our project.

Notes from the Writers
Hopefully we have revealed a simple trend: The scope of IP protections, both copyrights and patents, have grown in both the duration of the protection period, and the breadth of actual content that can be protected.. Now I pose a question to you the reader: why has the scope of these protections grown? What fueled this evolution of IP protections? If there is a trend or common theme that explains how and why IP protections have evolved over time, this theme would give us insight to how IP protections might change in response to new advances in synthetic biology. Please, join the conversation! Share your ideas! The best way to learn is to discuss. Follow the link to the iGEM forums, where you can join the conversation by commenting or starting a new thread.
Our two cents? We believe that IP protections have grown in scope in response to changes in technology, industry, and commerce. Remember that first form of IP protection from Renaissance era Venice? These protections emerged as a natural response to the growth and boom of new ideas: the governing body in Venice recognized the potential of unique ideas to bring revenue to the city, and in turn decided to protect individuals who develop new ideas. This in turn would stimulate more inventors to come to Venice, thus new inventions and ideas would emerge, and greater market competition would also be generated. All of this is good for growth, development and economy. Indeed, copyright protection in the United States grew in scope as a response to many, many different forces. To take one example, President Roosevelt heavily urged the implementation of the Copyright Act of 1909, saying,
“Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.” [10]
In a time when new technologies, industries, and arts were emerging in America, Roosevelt echoed the frustrations of many individuals who felt the scope of the original 1790 Copyright Act to be inadequate. Musicians (in a time when music was booming in America), greatly benefited from this new copyright act, which allowed exclusive rights to artists to perform for-profit performances. Other new technologies, such as lithography or photoengraving, were also protected under this new act, further emphasizing how"

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#InternalCellular_-_-_TEXT.html," our key assumptions for translation are:
  1. The major factor affecting translation rate is by the speed of the ribosome across the mRNA, which can be approximated by a constant rate.
  2. Translation rate is limited by the amount of available mRNA transcripts for ribosomes to bind to.
  3. Thus, translation rate is a function of ribosome speed and mRNA transcript concentration.
Finding parameters for translation
A literature search revealed an average translation rate of 17.1 amino acids/sec (Young and Bremer, 1976 and Proshkin et al. 2010. The rate of transcription therefore, will depend on the length of the mRNA transcript divided by 17.1. This is presented in the table below.

Translation rate (1/s)

0.07668
EtnR1

0.02943

0.08593
These translation rate coefficients are for ribosomes moving across a single mRNA molecule. In reality, our cell will contain multiple copies of the same mRNA molecule. We multiply these translation rate coefficients by total number of mRNA molecules to give the total translation rate, in molecules per second per DNA construct.
Degradation and Dilution
The concentrations of each species in the model is affected by it’s degradation (inherent to the molecule) and dilution (due to cell growth). While these processes are completely unrelated, they have the same net effect: Decreasing the concentration of the species. Therefore, we represent the two rates as a combined degradation/dilution parameter in our model.
The lifetime of mRNA is usually extremely limited. Compared against the rate of cell growth, or dilution of the cell, mRNA degrades before it encounters any significant dilution.
The opposite is true for proteins. While proteins are victims of degradation, it is not the major factor in the reduction of a protein’s concentration. Proteins tend to far outlive the mRNA molecules that produced them. It is often the changes in the protein’s environment that lead to it’s decrease in concentration. As a cell grows in size, the amount of AmilCP inside it remains relatively constant, but the concentration of AmilCP decreases.
In our model, we consider only the degradation/dilution of AmilCP mRNA and AmilCP. Regardless, it is revealed in the sensitivity analysis below that degradation and dilution have a minimal effect on overall biosensor performance when compared to other more important parameters.

Bring iGEM to art students
In order to bring the concept of synthetic biology and igem competition to the art college and let the arts students feel the fun of synthetic biology and participating in the igem contest, our team went to the China academy of art which can represent the highest level of arts in China，we held an exhibition titled with ""synthetic biology tour”. We showed them from the basic concept of synthetic biology to igem competition, from “ zju - China ” to the fact that art college students can be involved in  igem family by countless possible ways. Besides, we also left the specially designed doodle board for students to let them use their brushes and describe igem in their own ways.
Some people might feel strange for the site of the exhibition - China Academy of Art，they may wonder why biology exhibition is held in art college？We believe that bringing the concept of synthetic biology to the people who never learn about that can make more significants ， because they have never thought that they can have any contact with biology science， so they will be more curious, and it is because of the curiosity, they will learn lots of knowledge about synthetic biology and igem, this is what we want to see.Art and science is interlinked, we use the “pen ”to modify organisms in nature, this"

High School Achievement
Auc Turkey, the high school iGEM team trained by Atoms Turkiye member Mustafa Elitok has achieved the non-other 1st runner up prize in the 2013 jamboree which can be viewed on the link https://2013hs.igem.org/Main_Page . Despite joining for the second year, their achievements was an inexplicable joy for us and our university. Our high school student Furkan Bestepe who has undergone a training period of two years has become a member of our team Atoms Turkiye. Below: AUC Turkey Project Description.
Big budgets and significant amounts of energy are annually allocated to cooling systems. Also, these cooling processes are one of the factors of environmental distruption. The aim of our project, BactoCooler, is to accomplish a highly efficient and low cost cooling without distrupting nature’s magnificient balance through the usage of the most common form of life on Earth, bacteria. BactoCooler contains a special RNA Thermometer which allows translation after a specific temperature. This initiates the production of the urease enzyme which is responsible in the breakdown of urea. This organic endothermic reaction results in the significant cooldown of the environment.

FimE recognizes IRL and IRR, then catalyze the inversion of J23119. The weak acid would be generated at that time. For the environment, due to the production of the weak acid, it would turn neutral gradually.
Since the recombinases were found and RMCE was invented, more recombinases’ functions and features were be explored. Recombinase has stick logic relationship and high robust. It fits the modern research of synthetic biology.
○ Result
To test and verify the recombinase system, we replace the mLdhA and gadA to mRFP and GFP respectively. (Fig.13) Through fluorescence, we could verify the recombinase system.
Fig.13 The verification circuits of recombinase system
We constructed our verification circuits through OE-PCR, and linked them into vector pSB1C3 (Fig.14~17). And we divided it into recombinase part and fluorescence part.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," NDC-AS using RNA-21 and RNA-217. After incubation with the RNA targets in PBS at 37 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, NDC-AS gave the expected output as in Lane 6. Displacement of Strand 5-AS out of NDC by the RNA targets were visualized as bands of size around 50bp on PAGE.(Fig. 7) This was consistent with the results of NDC, showing that NDC-AS also produced the expected output in the presence of RNA targets, despite carrying an extra aptamer.
NDC-AS Construction - Thioflavin T Fluorescence Measurement
To test if the AS1411 aptamer on NDC-AS was successfully formed, we incubated 1μM of our nanostructures with 10μM Thioflavin T at room temperature for 10 minutes. Thioflavin T is a selective sensor of DNA G-quadruplex. Thioflavin gives off fluorescence upon binding to G-quadruplex due to its restricted rotation and enforced planarization [1]. High fluorescence signal after incubation of NDC-AS with Thioflavin T would indicate successful formation of AS1411, which has a G-quadruplex structure [2].  Thioflavin T was incubated with water only as control.
NDC-AS, after incubation with Thioflavin T, emitted significantly higher fluorescence than NDC without AS1411. This shows that G-quadruplex was formed in NDC-AS.
Loading, Release and Strand Displacement - Fluorescence Measurement
Doxorubicin (Dox) loading and release
Doxorubicin is a self-fluorescent molecule with maximum excitation at 480nm and maximum emission at 595nm [3]. Fluorescence quenching occurs when doxorubicin intercalates into DNA duplexes [4]. To characterize the maximum loading capacity of the Nano Drug Carrier (NDC), we incubated doxorubicin with NDC and measured the fluorescence signal decrease. The point of maximum quenching was an estimate of the ratio of loading of doxorubicin onto NDC, ie. number of doxorubicin molecules on each NDC. When incubating in ratio exceeding the maximum quenching , excess doxorubicin showed low affinity to NDC.
After intercalating into DNA, doxorubicin's intrinsic fluorescence will be quenched. Using the property, we designed fluorescence measurement experiments to determine the drug loading capacity of the"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html,"246 per ha is the average investment of a winemaker in France in 2012 for his fight against mildew.
4 days this is the optimal time necessary to complete mildew its entire cycle from contamination by spore until the following sporulation.
1878 is the year when the mildew , Plasmopara viticola , was observed for the first time in France.
Treatments against mildew have a cost that varies between € 50,000 and € 164,000 per year.Over the last 20 years, no less than 3 mildew epidemics were recorded in France . These outbreaks have a direct impact on the production of wine. As shown in the graph below, represents the number of hL (millions) produced over time , production in 1998 , 2001 and 2006 dropped by over 50 % compared to previous years.  You can find on the vinopôle website the evolution of mildiou risk every week !
In 2010, each hectar or grapevine had received around 16 chemical treatments (this number was 15 in 2006) and varies greatly between regions. Amongst the biological threats on grapevine, mushroom parasites are far ahead of insects and fungi (12 fungicides are used against 2 insecticides and 2 weedkillers). Over 95% of the fongicide treatments in 2010 were due to mildew and oidium, sicknesses that are favorized by rain, humidity and heat. They bring the global quality of the wine down by reducing it's composition in phenols and sugars. The risc of contamination on the leaves begin during the period where the floral buds and futur grapes are growing and lasts until the moment when the grapes touch each other. The sensibility period between oidium and mildew have common momments and vinyards don't heasitate to mix anti-mildew and anti-oidium solutions making the concentrations of these chemicals twice more concentrated in the grounds.
Downy mildew requires optimum conditions to reproduce and infect. A warm, moist, and humid environment is required. Studies in Sicily have shown optimum time for oospore germination is between the end of February and the middle of March. With this understanding, if fungicides are used just before these conditions occur, and have proven to be efficient measures. Other methods include proper watering, and a good location where the plant can receive continual sunlight.

UNSW, Australia: Protein Expression + His-Tag and GMO Legalities Collaboration
We traded expertise in protein work with the UNSW team. We attempted to express two of their proteins (G3P and PP3) using our pET28c plasmid in BL21 (DE3, pGro7) E. coli. given our success in expressing our two mycobacterial proteins EtnR1 and EtnR2 using this system. We also gave them strains of E. coli. that overexpress membrane proteins for their work on outer membrane vesicles. The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a"
