The final biosensor would share the same principles with our original design, but would result in our opinion in a better success rate of production and functionality. However, this semi-synthetic design would require additional modifications after being expressed, which would increase the amount of time and cost needed to be manufactured.

Figure 4: Working with cultivated moss on our laboratory bench
Cell culture: Physcomitrella patens plants can be cultivated either on solidified medium or in liquid medium. Liquid cultures can be kept in Erlenmeyer flasks under constant rotation and light exposure or in bioreactors for large scale production. By regularly (ideally weekly) disrupting the plants mechanically with a mixer (e.g. Ultra-Turrax) a homogenized culture can be achieved.
Storage: Long-term storage of Physcomitrella strains can be achieved by cryo-preservation. This procedure ensures a maximum survival rate of the plant by preconditioning and controlled freezing. [ Schulte and Reski, 2004 ]
Targeted knockout: P. patens is unique among plants in its high efficiency of gene targeting by homologous recombination. To knockout a specific gene a disruption construct has to be generated. This consists of the gene to be silenced with a selection cassette (usually the nptII gene) inserted into its center by suitable restriction sites. The moss is then transformed with this DNA construct which is integrated into the genome by homologous recombination. [ Reski et al., 2004 ]
Figure 5: Transformation procedure
Transformation: Transformation of P. patens requires protoplasts of the plant, which can be obtained by cell wall digesting enzymes. The protoplasts can either be transformed by particle bombardment or via polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is the easiest and most commonly used method. The DNA constructs should be linearized for optimal transformation and contain a selection marker for subsequent screening. After transformation, the protoplasts are cultivated in the dark for 12-16 h followed by 9 days under normal growth conditions during which they regenerate their cell wall. Afterwards they are plated on solidified medium in normal petri dishes and first experiments can be executed. [ Schaefer et al., 1991 ]
Analysis of transformants: First, the transformed protoplasts are plated on solidified medium containing the antibiotic G418 (Geneticin), to which successfully transformed plants are resistant due to the selection marker nptII which encodes the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase. Secondly, the transformants are analyzed by a PCR screen using primers derived the selection marker cassette´s sequences [ Schween et al., 2002 ].

Jilin_China,2017,Team:Jilin China#geneguard_-_-_TEXT.html," CbtA. Therefore, the difference among various concentrations of L-Arabinose in TA group maybe because of the metabolism of L-arabinose. With the consuming of L-Arabinose, the concentration becomes lower. The expression of CbtA decreases gradually, so the bacteria can recover from the toxicity of CbtA automatically. Also the concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% are too low for TA group to be poisoned by CbtA after the 6th hour. (3) Comparing the growth trends of two groups of bacteria, we conclude that toxicity of cbtA induced by L-Arabinose can make bacteria stop reproducing. (We think that Western Blot can better prove it but the time is limited and we add this experiment into our future work).
Figure 4. Toxication curve. Different concentrations of L-Arabinose were added into vector (A) or TA group (B). The growth curve was drawn to detect the effect of L-Arabinose towards bacteria at indicated time.
Figure 5. Turbidities of TA group after culture for 14 hrs. Different visible views for A&B.
2. CbeA function validation
Result: We measured the Abs600 values of TA and vector group from 0 to 16 hours and the Abs600- time curve was drawn(fig.6). The Abs600 values with different concentrations of IPTG in TA-pET28a group were higher than pET28a group. Without the induction of IPTG, the growth curves were almost the same.
DIscussion: (1) The growth of vector group after adding IPTG will be stagnated compared with that without IPTG addition. This is because IPTG shows toxicity towards bacteria. (2) Comparing the Abs600 values between TA group and vector group, the growth condition of TA group is better than that of vector group. It is because that CbeA induced by IPTG promotes the assembly reactions of MerB and FtsZ[2]. Therefore, we speculate that CbeA can promote the reproduction of bacteria. (3) Comparing TA group with IPTG addition to that without addition, we can tell that the growth rate is also decreased. We think that it is because the effect of CbeA cannot offset the toxicity of IPTG.

Add 100ul TENS to the tube
Mix well by inversion for 2 minutes. Do not shake the tube. The solution will get viscous
Add 150ul sodium acetate and mix well
Centrifuge for 3 minutes
Transfer the supernatant (liquid) to a clean, labeled MCF tube
Add 1ml 75% Ethanol to the tube and mix well by inversion. You may see DNA as faint white strands in the liquid. The tube should be nearly full of liquid. Sharpie brand pens have an ink that is soluble in Ethanol. Make sure your labels do not get removed accidentally.
Centrifuge 5 minutes to pellet the DNA. Place the tubes in the centrifuge with the hinges out to make finding the pellet easier
Pour off the 95% Ethanol
Place the tubes upside-down and allow them to dry completely
Resuspend the pellet in 25 uL TE
Use 10 uL of the DNA in a restriction digest or 1 uL for PCR
Digest
obtain the plasmid prep tubes (in incubator), new MCF tubes, enzymes in the freezer
For each new tube, prepare the master mix(MM):
water 15ul
buffer 2ul
Upstream enzyme 0.5ul
Downstream enzyme 0.5ul
Each tube needs 18ul of the MM, in order to get enough MM into each tube. If you have x digest, do x+1 MM. (Ex. If I need to do a digest for one tube, I will prepare 30ul of MM, but still put 18ul into the tube)
Label the new tubes with corresponding tubes and change the ""P"" into a ""D""
Add 3ul DNA and 15ul MM into each tube
Obtain a tube float and put all the tubes into the dry incubator for at least an hour.
How to make gel
Obtain one 125ml conical flask, 1x TAE solution, and agarose
With the balance, measure 0.32g of agarose
Use a measuring cylinder and measure 40 ml of 1x TAE solution
Put the measured powder and liquid into the conical flask (make sure no powder is stuck to the wall)
Use plastic film and wrap around the opening of the flask, BUT remember to leave a hole. Do not completely seal the flask

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Original_-_-_TEXT.html," which is to result in a repigmentation of white skin patches after a longer time period of treatment. The complementary short term research is based on repigmenting the affected patches in the similar effect of make-up while the long term treatment is under progress. This will be carried out by bacteria producing melanin on the skin, which will be absorbed and result in colored skin.
Our aim
Our research project uses harmless bacteria that, in fact, are already living in the human body as biological machines. These helpful bacteria are designed in our research project to become cost efficient machines to produce molecules that are deficient in vitiligo skin compared to normal skin. The goal with our project, until November 2010, is to obtain a “proof-of-concept” by having our bacteria produce and secrete molecules that we know, through previous research, are in a deficit in vitiligo skin. The lack of these specific molecules is thought to be involved in the impaired and disappeared pigment cells in vitiligo affected skin areas, leading to white spots.
Currently, there are not any treatments like ours for vitiligo skin. Our idea is to develop a treatment for vitiligo skin, where an ointment with harmless bacteria is to be produced for applying on white patched skin. The bacteria will synthesize and secrete several molecules of interest; these will be carried with a special carrier molecule through the outermost layer of the skin and further down to target specific inner skin cells with the aim of repigmentation.
With our research we aim to in the future develop a treatment that works faster and more efficient in achieving a repigmentation on affected skin areas compared to current medicine.

The column was washed with 5 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA-equilibrationbuffer . The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing elutionbuffer gradient from 0 % (equates to 20 mM imidazol) to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) with a length of 200 mL. This strategy was chosen to improve the purification by a slower increase of Ni-NTA-elutionbuffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 5 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the BPUL elution is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Chromatogram of wash and elution from FLPC Ni-NTA-Histag Purification of BPUL produced by 6 L fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo>. BPUL was eluted between a process volume of 832 mL and 900 mL with a maximal UV-detection signal of 115 mAU.
The chromatogram shows a peak at the beginning of the elution. This can be explained by pressure fluctuations upon starting the elution procedure. In between the processing volumes of 832 mL and 900 mL there is remarkable widespread peak with a UV-detection signal of 115 mAU. This peak corresponds to an elution of bound proteins at a Ni-NTA elution buffer concentration between 10 % and 20 % (equates to 50-100 mM imidazol). The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ensuing upwards trend of the UV-signal is caused by the increasing imidazol concentration during the elution gradient. Towards the end of the elution procedure there is a constant UV-detection signal, which shows, that most of the bound proteins was already eluted. Just to be on the safe side, all fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect BPUL. The SDS-PAGE is shown in Figure 6.

Background
Water pollution
Water, such a vital material for all kinds of creatures, plays a rather important role in human's life. In China, Laozi, a well-known philosopher in the Spring and Autumn Period, thought highly of water and said,
The best of men is like water;
Water benefits all things.
And does not compete with them.
It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain
Wherein it comes near to the Tao.[1]
However, in our daily life, although water is noble, it is not so strong and usually gets sick. With the development of industry and modern society, water is badly polluted. So what is water pollution? Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies and degrade the quality of water. Although over 70% of the earth is covered by water, fresh water, which can be used by human, occupied only 2.53% of the global water resources. Over 80% of rivers in China have been polluted in different degree[2]
Some pictures about water pollution reference from the Internet.
Water pollution can be classified into organic, inorganic and so on. What we care most is heavy metal pollution because water heavy metal pollution is the current outstanding problem in the field of water pollution and becomes the focus of research in the controlling field.
Heavy metals from industrial processes can accumulate in nearby water body, which are toxic to marine life such as fish and shellfish, and subsequently to the humans who eat animals accumulating heavy metals. Heavy metals can slow development, result in birth defects and some are carcinogenic. The most commonly encountered toxic heavy metals in wastewater include Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, and the less common include Chromium, Copper, Nickel, Zinc[3]. Three kinds of heavy metals are of concern, including toxic metals (such as Hg, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Co, Sn, etc.), precious metals (such as Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Ru etc.) and radionuclides (such as U, Th, Ra, Am, etc.)[4]. Heavy metals bring about serious environmental pollution, threatening human health and ecosystem.[5]
There are millions people are struggling with water pollution. In China, for example, about 75 percent of the population (or 1.1 billion people) are without access to"

Finally, we used a syringe to draw a line with each ink across Whatman paper (Figure 4). The acetone based inks were more prone to bleeding than the water based inks. The water extraction of the cranberry tablets yielded a more vibrant colour on paper than the acetone extraction, and the water extraction of lutein/zeaxanthin was more uniform in colour an darker than the acetone extraction.
Figure 4. Demonstration of the inks application to Whatman paper.
Using the ink in old fountain pens was attempted, but we found contamination with previously used ink in the pens were interfering with our results. The creation of our ink for use in fountain pens does not need to be as precise in terms of viscosity as it would need to be for printers. This is because there are no mechanical or moving parts or significant movement of ink within the pen, all we need is for the ink to be able to come out while keeping the amount of solvent as low as possible to prevent bleeding of the ink. This allows us to just attempt a few proportions of pigment, resin, and solvent for the pens.
Quality Control of Ink
After our interview with Dave Warwick of Warwick Printing in our hometown Lethbridge AB, he raised a few questions about the quality of products he uses. He stated that a few of the qualities a consumer is looking for in ink are: consistency in color, a variety of colors, lack of bleeding and bleaching, and the cost. For more information concerning the Warwick tour and interview, click here . We intend to solve or address all of these qualities and hopefully surpass the existing inks in any and/or all of them. For the consistency of color, we intend to make sure that we have added the correct proportions of pigment to resin to solvent and to mix thoroughly to ensure an even spread of all substances in any amount of ink. For color variety, we addressed this issue in our research, we have made pigments that correspond to the CMYK in any color printer. CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and black and these four colors can make any color in existence. To address bleeding we will be testing our produced ink on many substrates to ensure that the volatile solvent evaporates before the ink can bleed through the substrate, and if there are any problems we will need to change the proportions of our ink. For bleaching we will test our pigments against current inks"

In addition to working with the degradation enzymes, we created a mechanism where quorum sensing can cause a needed time delay for degradation so that our UAV does not degrade as soon as it starts to fly. Quorum sensing is a cell to cell communication mechanism, and here we use it to control when and how fast degradation should occur.
Figure 2. Our ideal quorum sensing system works in a loop: quorum sensing will activate a promoter that will trigger the expression of the degradation enzymes, which will activate positive feedback on the loop.
Click here to go to our project journal, which details our design and engineering process and included descriptions of the protocols we developed and used.
Results
Our goal for this project was not only to isolate biodegradation enzymes but also to control the release of these enzymes, so that our UAV would not degrade uncontrollably. In order to control the initiation of biodegradation, we first considered using a pressure sensor. This would allow the UAV to begin degrading after the impact of a crash. The 2008 Tokyo Tech iGem team found that the ptet promoter was pressure sensitive and increased its activity 3-fold after undergoing 30 MPa of pressure. We got their construct from the distribution kit and tested its functionality by monitoring GFP expression. We found that this promoter is always turned on even at very low pressures (The cells were bright green even with no pressure at all). When we introduced a repressor for the Ptet promoter, we found out that the repressor is too strong, and even at high pressures, the Ptet promoter will still be repressed. The photo and graphs below show our testing of the Ptet promoter in the presence and absence of the Tet repressor.
Figure 3. A graph showing the relationship between pressure applied and expression of GFP under control of the ptet promoter.
The graph above shows that there was not a clear correlation between the amount of pressure applied on the ptet promoter to the amount of GFP expression: For instance, application of 14000rpm pressure on cells with ptet promoter for 30 seconds led to production of less fluorescence than application of 5000rpm pressure to the same batch of cells. When Tet Repressor was used, its effect was too strong and we could not find a repressor that could inhibit ptet just enough to control the biodegradation process.
On top of testing the ptet promoter,  we analyzed the impact a crash would have on our UAV by using a force plate ,and we found it unlikely that the impact of the crash would ever reach as high a pressure as 30 MPa,"

Medical aspects
Figure 1: The structure of an immunoglobulin (Ig)
Antibodies, immunoglobulins, are proteins that bind targets ('antigens'). They are produced in vertebrates as a defense against foreign microbes. This characteristic has been utilized in research for decades. As mentioned in the introduction, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are frequently used for numerous purposes in research and in medical aspects.
For peptide aptamers to be implementable in diagnostics and therapy, some challenges have to be accomodated. Antibodies comprise a dangerous threat for microorganisms displaying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are recognized by the antibodies FabFabfragment, antigen-binding-region and induces an immune response through the FcFcfragment, crystallizable-region, that binds effector cells of the immune system. The effector mechanisms include: OpsonisationOpsonisationOpson originates from Grece, where it referrers to a delicious side-dish. In this context it means that antibodies mark pathogens, making them more appetizing for phagocytes (i.e. neutrophils and macrophages), aggl"

With this research, we were able to see that there is a growing movement of engineered probiotics mostly in the U.S., but that there still is a lack of laws and regulation all over the world to regulate these products before they can reach the market and the final consumers.
Shiv Nadar University
Genesis, The Life Sciences Department of Shiv Nadar University is interested in setting up an iGEM team for 2019. We are currently mentoring them after they reached out to us through our social media accounts. We had an illuminating mentoring session with them in this aspect where we discussed in detail the prerequisites for participating in iGEM competition as well as a discussion regarding Human Practices, Safety, Funding, iBEC and Track selection. It was a great experience for both the teams. We wish Team Shiv Nadar best of luck for their future endeavors and look forward to work alongside them in the coming year.
iGEM LabPats
During the summers, we had a skype session with iGEM Labpats - a student team from Carroll High School, U.S.A. We talked about our project and exchanged design ideas. We discussed the possible ways in which human practices could be conducted in an impactful manner. The discussion was really stimulating and gave us some great ideas for our human practices. iGEM IIT Delhi being a collegiate team was amazed to see the dedication of these school students. We wish them our best in their future endeavors.
InterLab Troubleshooting
We faced some problems during our InterLab characterization, our absorbance at 600nm for silica beads at high dilutions didn't follow the trend. Upon which, we discussed the problem on All India iGEM group, where the teams gave us multiple suggestions and shared their protocols by which we were able to obtain our results as deisred by iGEM. Hence, we would like to express our gratitude towards the Indian iGEM teams.

Biodetection of hCG hormone Aug 3rd
Chalmers Gothenburg, Sweden and Dr. Eriko Takano
The Chalmers Gothenburg team are working to modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae to function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and and their idea is for their biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. They also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production as the output signal of the pregnancy test.
Prof. Dr. Eriko Takano (Groningen) has an internationally leading position in the field of small signalling molecules in Streptomyces coelicolor, the model organism of the major group of commercial antibiotic producers. Her research interests include the synthetic biology of new antibiotics, the systems biology of the metabolic switch from primary to secondary metabolism, and the regulation"
Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#orthogonality test_-_-_TEXT.html," Therefore, according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014, shown below (Fig. 1), we may design the gene circuit of our E. coli as follows. (Fig. 2)
Fig. 1 Results from ETH_Zurich 2014 . From these results, we may think that the gene circuit designed in Fig. 2 can satisfy our needs. However, from our results, we can see that since E. coli can actually synthesize much more C4HSL than the maximal concentration considered by ETH_Zurich 2014, the gene circuit in Fig. 2 cannot satisfy our needs.
Fig. 2 Designed gene circuit by results from ETH_Zurich 2014
     In conclusion, it is not suitable for us to choose our gene circuit just according to results from ETH_Zurich 2014 since it does not consider the ability of E. coli synthesizing AHL. Therefore, we designed our experiment as follows, which considers the E. coli’s ability to synthesize AHL.
II Experimental design
    To test which kind of AHL, receptor and promoter pair we can choose to keep the gene circuit orthogonal during the time period of our experiment (For example, in our final experiment, we will co-culture six characters in 3ml medium for 48h), we should detect the killing effect of the two warriors in real time.
    Here for simplicity, we used RFP to indicate the amount of LacI inside bacteria, so its intensity inside each bacteria in real time can be used as a relative measurement of the response intensity of specific receptor-promoter to specific AHL and the killing effect of warriors in real time.
    What's more, we let E. coli secrete and receive AHL itself to mimic the real situation of our system approximately.
    The detailed plasmid construction design is shown below.
    First, we cloned three AHL synthases---luxI, lasI and rhlI to the low copy backbone---pSB3K3. At the same time, we cloned nine receptor-promoter combinations to pSB6A1. The three receptors are luxR, lasR and rhlR while the three promoters are Plux, Plas and Prhl. RFP is attached to the promoters, which is used to detect the response of the promoters to AHL molecules via the receptors (Fig. 3). After that, we cotransformed the plasmids containing AHL synthases and plasmids containing receptor-promoter combinations. As a result, we get 27 different combinations.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Discussing Synthetic Biology with Highschool students and their parents
Our iGEM team managed to secure a place at a University Open Day on the 7th of September for high-school students who were considering studying at Glasgow Universityand their parents. This gave us an excellent opportunity to interact with an unique group of individuals - members of the public who had a specific interest in life-sciences but did not have significant training beyond that available at a high-school level.
We created a poster with a broad summary of our project and manned it throughout the day, whilst a steady torrent of prospective students asked us questions about iGEM and synthetic biology. We received a number of questions and were challenged on a variety of aspects of the project, such as how each of the parts worked or what their function would be in something like industry.
Through explaining the project to a variety of people we became far more aware of areas in the project which were difficult to understand or didn't gel together well. As a result of this, we were able to change the ideas we put forward to explain what we were doing and even came up with a couple of new concepts for application of the project itself!
Overall, our attendance at the Open Day was a great success: it gave us a dry-run practice for the upcoming Jamboree, it allowed us to see our project through other people's eyes and, best of all, we had a fantastic day!
Here's our poster which we were presenting during that event:

The iGEM Protocol Guide
When we were starting out in the lab, we spent so much of our time searching through the Registry trying to locate various protocols! We thought it would be really useful if some of the most commonly used protocols and information were all compiled into one place.
This is why we created the iGEM protocol guide. It contains all the protocols, from transformations to Minipreps, that we think future teams will need to get them started in the competition. We've also included some useful reference material on biobricks and some handy safety tips!
It is our intention that the guide will be made available to all teams competing next year, as we believe it will be a highly valuable resource for future iGEM teams.  We also hope that future teams will contribute any material to it that they think will be helpful, allowing for this booklet to become an excellent reference material for the competition.

DNA used in Gibson from yesterday and several weeks ago. Run on gel to verify the presence of DNA fragments of the correct size after gel extraction.
Old DNA appears to have degraded, or else products were produced in too small a quantity to show up on the gel. Fortunately, these are not/ have not been used.
Bands of the correct size for fragment A (5.5kbp), fragment B (3.5kbp) and the genomic DNA (550bp) present. Though riboswitch DNA has not come out well in this image, it was present under visual examination.
Approximate DNA concentrations in the range of 2 - 6 ng/μl.
Sunday (02/09/12)
Results from colony PCR (right of central ladder) and of restriction digest (left of central ladder). Restriction digest produced inconclusive results, however colony PCR indicates that the riboswitch only inserted into the second of the two colonies picked from the +8 version plate (last two lanes before ladder).
Verification of Mg2+ riboswitch construct by colony PCR
Gibson primers used to amplify out riboswitch section of plasmid produced and transformed into e.coli to verify if riboswitch had inserted into PJS130.
Band at ~550bp in lanes 8 and 9 (replicates) indicate that the riboswich has only been successfuly transformed into the second of the two colonies picked on the +8 plate, and not at all for the -8 construct.
Miniprep of plasmid DNA
E.coli from strains made yesterday miniprepped to get plasmid DNA at high concentration. After colony PCR results, all DNA other than that of the successful colony discarded.
Verification of Mg2+ riboswitch construct by restriction digest
BamH1 and Sal1 used to digest plasmid DNA produced from miniprep.
Resultant fragment run on gel.
Bands produced inconclusive, possibly because of too short an incubation time with restriction enzymes. Expected bands at ~4900bp and ~4500bp. Will re-run experiment in future to check results of colony PCR.

XMU-China,2011,Team:XMU-China#Acknowlegements_-_-_TEXT.html," Practice we have organized and participated in various events. We organized the Open Lab Day for kids from a primary school in Xiamen. Our team members and instructors gave a lecture on synthetic biology in Xiamen University, mainly focusing on biosafety issues. We took part in the 2011 iGEM China Meetup at USTC, Hefei.
OPEN LAB DAY FOR KIDS
At the beginning of the 2011 autumn semester, we invited students from Yanwu Elementary and their parents to our Lab. We first visited a class of Grade 3 in this school and sent out our invitation cards. The Open Lab Day information was also released on the internet. This activity was greatly supported by the president of Yanwu Elementary and many kids and their parents showed great interest. After all, in China, opportunity for primary school students going into the lab is so rare that they regarded it a really worth thing to do. 15 kids and their parents joined us in the Open Lab Day on Sept. 25. They were first showed quite a lot pictures of insects and microorganisms in an exhibition prepared by our team members in the Ground Hall. Most of the pictures were taken by our team member Zhizhen Zhao in the Dinghushan National Nature Reserve in August, giving kids a general understanding of lives from the Biggest to the Smallest. Then we gave the kids and their parents a short lecture on life science and synthetic biology. Many parents showed both interest and concerns about synthetic biology, and almost all of them never heard of this subject before. We discussed the practical application of synthetic biology as well as the safety threat it might bring about.  Finally after being given safety instructions, kids were led into the lab doing some interesting experiments and playing some games with the help of our iGEM team members. They learned some basic organelles inside a cell and watched different types of cell samples using microscope. They were also taught how to use pipette. Many parents told us that they thought their children had learned a lot in this activity.
(picture open lab day 1-7)
THE BIOSAFETY LECTURE
Our instructor Zhaoshou Wang and team member Xin Wu gave a public lecture on biosafety issues in Xiamen University in September. This lecture was to awake the public awareness of biosafety and start their discussions about the definition of synthetic biology in their views. This public lecture was so popular that students from various majors took part in the discussion.

Outreach
One of the growing (sub)fields of science is science communication. It is key to effectively communicate intricate researches to the general public. Not only when applying for grants, but also to inform the public on ground breaking findings. Good communication is especially important in the field of synthetic biology, because the idea of altering DNA sounds scary to a lot of people. To better communicate CryptoGErM, we tried to make our project accessible by using animations, as you can find in our tour . But also by approaching newspapers, radio- and television stations and giving talks at open-access science events.

The curves with the highest IPTG concentrations are not overlapping, indicating that we could repress LacI even further with higher IPTG concentrations.
You can compare these results with the characterization of Plac alone . Without IPTG, RFP expression is much lower than the real Plac strength; thus LacI has a powerful effect on our system by limiting RFP expression
IPTG dose-response curve
Even if the RFU range is small, there is a clear parallel between RFUs intensities and IPTG dosage. An 8-fold difference between the two extremes can be sufficient for an effective and reliable readout system; however we could use a stronger Plac promoter to get more RFP expression and perhaps a bigger difference.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," While culturing again at 37℃, we measured OD600, which indicate the density of E.coli. The figure below shows the results. These results indicated that the expression of plac-RBS-kil-DT (pSB3C5) makes no effect on the survival of E.coli.
We established the new biobrick for the useful secretion system. When we apply these systems, torA signal and kil protein, to Flower Fairy E.coli, we can make E.coli secrete FT protein without cell lysis!!(Fig.2-7)
Fig.2-6 The result of evaluation of kil protein.
Vertical axis means the value of OD 600. And horizontal axis means incubation time. Time caused changes of cell growth after IPTG induction.
Fig.2-7 Overall vision of Tat secretion system and kil protein. We apply this system for Flower Fairy E.coli.
1.Tat transporters are piercing in the inner membrane. They recognize TorA signal, and transport into the periplasm only proteins that have TorA signal at their N terminals. 2. Kil protein makes holes in the outer membrane of E.coli and the proteins go through the outer membrane.
Improvement of secretion system
Now we can let E.coli to secrete FT protein to the outside by using Tat pathway and kil protein. But E.coli secrete only a small amount of FT protein when they use Tat transporters which they inherently have.  To make E.coli secrete enough amount of FT protein, we needed to improve the efficiency of their secretion systems. To reach this goal, we used two genes. One is composed of TatA, TatB, and TatC, which composes Tat transporter. Another is phage-shock protein A (pspA), which wild E.coli have. When their inner membrane is damaged, pspA gene is expressed ,and pspA maintains membrane potential and H+ concentration gradient between the periplasm and cytoplasm. It is known that pspA promote trasport of proteins to the periplasm through the detail mechanisms are unknown. As the next step of secretion, by the extra induction of these genes, we tried to increase the amount of secresion. We constructed Tat secretion cassette with constitutive promoter (BBa_K797004).(Fig.2-8)  This part includes TatA, B and C proteins coding region and pspA. By using this part, the amount of Tat transporter is and pspA can be increased . In short, we can make E.coli se"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"
ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to the literature, multiple bacteria are suitable for tumor colonization. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 was the bacterial strain we planned to equip with our synthetic circuit. Our choice was based on both the strain's safety (probiotic strain) and its ability to colonize tumors within the patient. [1] [2]
Other E. coli strains, such as E. coli DH5α, E. coli TOP 10, were used in cloning experiments. All of the organisms mentioned here are used in biology research on a daily basis and are characterized as BSL-1 organisms. However, we are working with GMO strains which cannot be released into the environment and low risk does not equal no risk. For this reason, we stuck to all the safety regulations for biosafety level 1 laboratory. During our experiments, there was no intravenous administration of the engineered bacteria to any living organism, as our final application goal would suggest.
Furthermore, in order to see the effect of our Anti-Cancer Toxin (either produced or purified azurin), several cancer mammalian cell lines were also used, namely HeLa CCL-2, HEK293, HCT-116, HT-29. All these cell lines are characterized as BSL-1 strains according to the Swiss regulations . However, our laboratory is equipped with a separate BSL-2 space, where all the experiments using mammalian cells took place. We started working in this lab only after receiving a BSL-2 laboratory training.
The anti-cancer peptide, azurin, was kindly provided in a purified form by the Freiburg iGEM Team . Azurin is a non-virulence factor involved in electron transfer during denitrification in Pseudomonas aureginosa. [3] This strain should be handled in a BSL-2 lab, however in our work we did use this strain, but we ordered the gene sequence of azurin as gBlock in order to clone it into E. coli Nissle 1917 strain. As long as azurin is not a virulence factor of P. aureginosa we were allowed to use it in a BSL-1 laboratory.
Notably, there are actually already bacterial treatments approved and administered in Switzerland, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), acting against bladder cancer. [4] At the same time, there are also U.S. companies that have taken approval to conduct Phase II clinical trials. All of these examples show that our designed bacterial therapy could result in a safe, effective and realistic"

The Crabapple Blossom Festival
TJU’s Annual Crabapple Blossom Festival is a great activity, almost one hundred thousand citizens in Tianjin gather together         in TJU to enjoy the beautiful flower and various association activities, including many innovative research productions.         This year, we seized this opportunity and showed interesting biology to many visitors, mostly young persons, and         children. What’s more, it was impressing that about ten percent of the visitors paid attention to our activities,         which was an excellent chance for us to spread the theory of synthetic biology to the society.
Figure 9. IGEM and the magic scissor.
Figure 10. People participate in our activities.
We showed interesting short videos about CRISPR to the visitors, which briefly illustrate the theory of synthetic biology,         especially the technology of CRISPR. We use such an approach to attract more visitors to gather around us. In this         case, an increasing number of citizens were standing there so that we can provide biologic knowledge to more people         around us, and we believe that more visitors will be interested in synthetic biology.
Figure 11. Videos about CRISPR-Cas system.
We provide some beautiful pictures of proteins and cells for children to color in. The purpose of this activity was to         draw children and adolescents’ attention to involve in the progress of learning structures of all varieties of simple         biologic molecular, including protein Cas9, Cpf1, Cas13a, and some RNA figures. Maybe these children didn’t really         understand what it was, however, this activity indeed developed their interests in synthetic biology. Some visitors         even asked us for further knowledge of our project.

We invent a small game named ‘ball collision’, which represents base pairing. Stringing up balls of four different colors,         representing four bases, we want the participants to find the string up the balls with another thread to make them         a pair, which represents the principle of complementary base pairing. We believe this could be an excellent way of         teaching children biologic knowledge. Furthermore, we made some attractive postcards as well as bookmarks as the         award, in case certain visitors want to gain more details about synthetic biology in our"

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics to solve this problem. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," results are in before then. In addition, it is advantageous for them to have high-throughput tests, allowing for the testing of many samples at the same time. Athlete privacy is also an important advantage, since this is in compliance with data protection laws. They also benefit from a test that is >accessible to all WADA-accredited laboratories and that fits within the current testing framework. This means that tissue sampling cannot be considered for doping tests ( Haisma and De Hon, 2004 ) and that new doping tests can be implemented within the current testing practices and times. Finally, a method would be easily adaptable to new developments in the doping world, keeping up with the rat race of doping user versus doping detector.
In contrast to these benefits, there are a few outcomes that doping authorities strive to prevent. False positive test outcomes must be prevented at all costs. A single false positive result could ruin an athletes career unjustly, so everything possible must be done to prevent such an outcome. Finally, they strive to lower the costs of detection methods as much as possible.
Value: Advanced Detection of Performance enhancement
The product we present is ADOPE, which stands for advanced detection of performance enhancement. The result is not a single kit, rather, it is a comprehensive step-by step method, including products (adapted kits and newly developed proteins), as well as services for more efficient testing and data analysis. The result includes a model for selecting the proper detection time , a sample preparation method for isolating trace elements of gene doping DNA from the blood, a pre-screening method to quickly screen and rule out many samples, an unique test based on targeted sequencing using a newly developed fusion protein , and finally a sophisticated, self-learning algorithm for data analysis to group the sequencing output in a reliable manner.
These products and services answer the needs from the anti-doping agencies in several ways. Our efficient pre-screen reduces costs and increases throughput.  The screen rules out most of the samples, leaving only a fraction to the relatively more expensive sequencing step.
Due to our highly specific fusion protein, our method sequences only a low amount of DNA. This reduces data-processing time greatly compared to methods based on whole genome sequencing . The sequencing step reduces false positive test outcomes, delivering a DNA sequence from the athletes blood as definitive proof of doping use. Thanks to the versatility of the target sequences we use to find doping DNA as well as our self-learning algorithm, our test is easily adaptable to new developments in the doping world. In addition, our test does not require expensive or rare laboratory equipment apart from the consumables supplied with the test, making it accessible to"

For inoculation of the culture cells or spores may be used, spores can be taken from the separation step and kept until needed for inoculation. If cells are desired they can be frozen in glycerol stock until they are needed. Cultures with an O.D. of 2.00 are desire but any high concentration will be effective. To create frozen stock add equal parts culture and 50% glycerol into a cold resistant tube and store at -80 C. To inoculate using frozen culture thaw until liquid and pipette directly into/onto desired medium.
Separating Spores from Live Cells
According to the Donnellan et. al. article after 4 days 60-80% of the cells completed sporulation. To purify the spores from the live cells we will follow the Donnellan et. al. protocol. We will split the culture into 12 1L flasks which will be centrifuged at 4 C then washed with 500 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5). The pellet will be resuspended in 250 mL water and 200 mL 1:1 polyethylene glycol-600 and 400 mL 3M phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). Rest the spores in an ice bath for 3 minutes and remove the top phase by suction. Add and mix in 500 mL 2M phosphate buffer (pH 7.1), remove the top phase and wash 7 times with 250 mL water by centrifuging at 4 C. The resulting pellet will be suspended in 15-25 mL water, frozen and vacuum dried for 2 days.
If the final cost of separating the spores from the live cells prove to be too expensive due to the labor and reagent costs this step should be considered for exclusion. A similar product named Milky Spore which contains Bacillus popilliae, a species inhabiting the soil which infects and kills grubs. Due to the similarities between Milky Spore and the Minecrobe many analogies can be made especially in the manufacturing and packaging processes. Many brands of Milky Spore are produced from live culture, undergo sporulation, and the whole culture including the live cells are packaged and shipped. The material they are packaged in provides few nutrients so many live cells die or undergo sporulation. This can then be seen as a way to further reduce costs, making our"

Qualitative test with chromoproteins expression. In order to check the performance of the Sensynova device in terms of modularity, cultures of IPTG detector, processor unit and 3 different reporter modules carrying two chromoproteins ( BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205018 ) and sfGFP ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+Chloramphenicol (12,5ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600: 0,1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:1 and 1:1:13. Some samples were supplemented with 1mM IPTG to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 10, 11, 12).

The 3 experiment sets clearly show that the framework is optimised when a higher concentration of cells expressing the reporter device is present (Figures 10, 11, 12, samples labelled 1:1:13). This can be considered as a further validation of our fine-tuning approach using the simbiotics model and the previous plate reader experiments.

15 August, 2016 Milestone 7: Synthesis of p62, p70 and J23100 constructs with varying RBS strengths for further characterization
Upon characterization, it appeared that the promoters with strong ribosomal binding site (RBS, BBa_B0034) exhibited high leakiness. Therefore, we designed this series of constructs by replacing the strong RBS by the medium (BBa_B0032: 30% strength of B0034) and weak RBS (BBa_B0033: 1% strength of B0034). Each promoter fragment p70, p62 and J23100 (without RBS) were isolated and amplified by PCR from the construct 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Each promoter fragment (without RBS) was ligated to the ALR-Terminator fragment by PCR overlap using primers having the overhang sequence of either medium or weak RBS.

4.26 T7 Phage Selection Test
I) Purpose
Test the possibility of selecting for smaller phage by increasing agar concentration
II) Expected Outcome
As top agar increase in concentration, the number of plaques/plate should decrease and individual plaques should become smaller.
III) Reagants Used
T7 + phage: fresh dilution from 4.8 -4; E coli BL21; Agar: ×2 prepared by Jordan in 500mL glass bottle; LB: prepared by us on 4.3; overnight bacteria culture: set up on Friday at 6:00pm using 4.6 streak; ×8 top agar stock: prepared by us on 4.3
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Made fresh -5 stock phage ×2
i) 180 μL LB was added to a 1.5mL centrifuge tube. 20 μL of phage stock -4 was then added.
2. Performed selection method test
i)  Six test tubes were labeled control, ×1, ×2, ×4, ×6, and ×8 respectively. To each of the test tubes, 0.5mL of E coli overnight liquid culture was added.
ii) To ×1, ×2, ×4, ×6, and ×8 test tube 20 μL of -5 phage solution was added. This mixture of E coli and phage was left sitting for 20 minutes before proceeding.
iii) In a separate set of test tubes, top agar was diluted to give ×1, ×2"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#CatecholDegradation_-_-_TEXT.html," completed by following the protocol written by the 2008 Edinburgh iGEM team.
Figure 3: Results of the catechol visual assay using xylE BBa_K118021 .  Cultures were grown overnight in LB and the pellets were washed with M9-MM at various times (From left to right: 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min.). Cells were then spun down and catechol was added to the supernatant to 0.1 M.  The amount of time didn't affect the colour change in the cultures containing the xylE gene. The far right tube has E. coli cells without the xylE gene as a negative control and the supernatant remained clear when the catechol was added.
Converting Catechol into hydrocarbons?
After verifying that we could in fact degrade catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde using our xylE construct ( BBa_J33204 ), we wondered if we could take this any further.  What if we could convert this by-product into hydrocarbons too?  As catechol is the breakdown product of a number of different degradation pathways in bacteria, this could be particularly useful.
Since 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde can be further metabolized to pyruvate and acetaldehyde (Harayama et al., 1987), it seemed possible that these products could be routed into the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and converted to alkanes using the PetroBrick or the OleT enzyme.  Given that the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase reaction is extracellular, it creates a possible scenario in which cells with the xylE construct could be co-cultured with Petrobrick-containing cells to cooperatively metabolize catechol into hydrocarbons.
In order to test this, we followed this protocol , where we co-cultured cells expressing our xylE construct with either E. coli cells expressing the PetroBrick, or Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456 cells expressing oleT in the presence of catechol.
Figure 4: Gas chromatograph of catechol degradation assay using the PetroBrick.  While there is limited differences between xylE incubated with and without the PetroBrick, there was one peak with a retention time of 10.5 min which was dramatically increased in the co-culture.

We miniprepped pC13BN culture and did a double digest on pC13BN culture with KpnI and HindIII to see if internal cut sites were present. There was some digestion that occurred when it was run on a gel, so we are confident the sequence is correct. We double digested pC13BN again with KpnI and HindIII. We ligated it with pC13Y (time constant 4.86), pC13BR (4.86), pC13BQ (4.90), pC13CD (4.80). We got transformants for pC13DD. A colony PCR was run and pC13DD colony 3 looked good. This colony was grown in liquid culture for miniprepping and sequencing. We grew cultures of pC13BX, pC13CK, and pC13BN for submission (pC13BX submitted directly; pC13CK and pC13BN need sequence confirmation first). pC13BF transformants were cultured, pC13AZ cultures were digested with EcoRI/PstI and gel screened; results were good, so they were submitted for sequencing. Digested pK13AL and pA13AW with XbaI/PstI for ligation to make pK13AX. pC13P and pC13E were digested with EcoRI/PstI and ligated to make pC13AY. Cultures of pC13Q and pC13BE were made from glycerol stocks. We electroporated pC13AU, pC13AT, pAK13CY, and pC13AQ. We also ran a Q5 PCR of pC13CB and pAK13AO using standard BioBrick primers 23 and 24 in order to confirm lengths of inserts. We redid the Q5 PCR with the new dNTPs for pC13CV, pC13I, pC13AF  and pC13L--pC13CV, pC13I and pC13AF were bad, but pC13L was good! We suspect that electroporation did not go well to begin with. We reran the 2-step Q5 PCR for pC13A. We ran a gel of our PCR to create Gibson assembly parts, and it appeared unsuccessful. We ran the colony PCRs of pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE on a gel, and only observed bands"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#LinkerJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," week involved transforming the part BBa_K648013 received by request from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This part is a GFP reporter that contains the RFC 25 standard prefix and suffix. This prefix and suffix will allow us to create a fusion protein with GFP and the coils to be used in our testing purposes. After successful transformation of the part the plasmid was isolated via miniprep and its presence was confirmed through a restriction digest. The part was also sequence confirmed to indeed verify that there were no unexpected changes to the nucleotide sequence.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
Research efforts were devoted to the Ferritin system during this week. Flooding in the city of Calgary interrupted the planned lab work for the beta-lactamase and coil group.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The first BioBrick construction was attempted this week. The goal was to put the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) behind the IPTG inducible LacI promoter (with a ribosome binding site) ( BBa_J04500 ). This construction however did not yield any colonies after ligation and transformation were performed. It is recommended the next time this construction be performed that the amount of vector DNA added to the ligation reaction be increased from 5 µL to 7 µL to correct for the dilution of the vector DNA during the Antarctic phosphatase treatment performed. BBa_J04500 in pSB1C3 was transformed this week so that we could have this part available with a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid. The colony PCR for this part was successful (Figure 3) ergo overnight cultures were prepared on the weekend so that a miniprep of the plasmid could be performed the next week.
Figure 3. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500. Standard BioBrick primers were used. Bands between 400 and 500-bp indicate the successful amplification of these parts. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. Some non-specific amplification is seen within this control. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin synthase_-_-_TEXT.html,"ans produces a lot of waste and uses a lot of chemicals. The waste of the seafood-processing industry, mostly the shells of crustaceans, contains 14 – 40 % chitin. This waste is treated with alternate acid and alkali to remove other components from the shells of the crustacean and to extract the chitin [1] . One approach to produce the polymer in an environmentally friendly way, are bacteria like E. coli which can produce chitin enzymatically via a CHS.
The production of chitin appears to be important as it is a useful substance which finds applications in medicinal, industrial and biotechnological research. Chitin, and its derivate chitosan, are non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable. Their bioactivities are for example the promotion of wound healing or hemostatic activity, immune enhancement, eliciting biological responses, and antimicrobial activity [1] .
Chitin oligomers are also of great biological interest as they lead to biological responses in plants and form the backbone of substituted lipochitooligosaccharides which induce the nodulation in leguminous plants [3] .
There are various kinds of CHS from several organisms. The  enzyme of our interest is the NodC which originates from the gram-negative bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum. It is a homologue to the chitin synthase from yeast (Structure see Figure 2) [6] .
Figure 2. Structure of NodC. The 3D structure was modeled with SwissModel [7]
Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae is found to live in symbiosis with plants of the genera Pisum and Vicia of the family Fabaceae [9] . Rhizobium species live in symbiosis with legumes, where the bacteria form nitrogen-fixing nodules in the legume roots. The symbiotic interaction leads to an activation of the bacterial nodulation (nod) genes and the secretion of Nod factors. These nod genes create and modify the Nod factors. The Nod factors have a backbone consisting of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides, most often tetra – or pentasaccharides with an acyl chain at C2 of the non-reducing end instead of an acetyl group [6] [10] .
Figure 3. Transmembrane domains of NodC. The NodC protein has strongly hydrophobic domains which indicate that it is an integral or transmembrane protein."

Screening of : pSB4A5-CA3, pSB1C3-ccaS_EcoRI and pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP. Followed by screening of pSB1C3 – CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI (has insert).
We also made screening of Cph8, 4 samples (VF2 and VR, biobrick backbone) and making the glycerol frozen stock of Chp8 (un-mutated, Biobrick Backbone). Screened with gel and all the bands had accurate lengths.

Last thing was making O/N culture of pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP and of CA3.
Evaluation The new Ccas-EcoRI showed good bands, Ccas_EcoRI_SpeI did not (as expected due to illegal insert of approximately 50 bp shown after sequence data). The reason why we screened it again was to compare the band length with the new mutation of Ccas-EcoRI. Cph8 insert was successfully cloned in the pSB1K3. We had to redo PCR procedure of B0034-amilCP and do the second, new mutagenesis of ccaS_EcoRI to remove illegale SpeI restriction site.

Additionally, I have supported Liza with the modeling and I also made the final presentation together with Charlotte.
Célina
Public Relations Manager
As PR manager my function was managing contact with the community. Therefore I placed weekly updates on the Facebook and started a LinkedIn page for the team. I went a few times to our communication advisors of the TU Delft, Wendy Dallinga and Lenny Bakker. They helped me with creating a press release. I also managed to get articles on different websites, magazines and newspapers. For policy and practice I made a little start in looking into how to optimize teamwork within a team. For the wet lab, I helped a few times, such as doing colony PCR, ligation and transformation.
Charlotte
Hardware, Graphics and Safety Manager
My first task was being the hardware manager. For this task I have approached a great amount of optics and photonics companies and requested sponsoring, discounts or borrowing equipment that was required for building the optical setup. Once all equipment was collected I was responsible for building the optical setup and testing our cells in it. Furthermore, I was responsible for conducting all wide field and confocal microscopy experiments, together with Liza. My second responsibility was being graphics manager. Here my main task was designing and making the posters and presentations. Furthermore, this task included designing and making the logo, figures and all outreach materials for the team, as well as making sure that all data from our experiments is represented in a clear and professional way. Lastly, I was the safety manager of the team. This means I wrote the research proposal for our project including all safety considerations and handed in all the iGEM safety forms. It was my responsibility that all ML-1 safety measures were met. Besides my managing functions, I also made and did the final presentation, helped out in the lab, did a little modeling and arranged some conversations with experts for policy & practice.

As a team leader I was responsible for the organizational aspects of the project. This means I had to find places for the team to stay and dine in Boston, arrange the registration of the team members and mentors for the Jamboree, communicate with headquarters with problems we had, but also more day-to-day chores such as chairing the weekly meetings and reminding the team about deadlines, and creating weekly updates for the advisors.

4. Full moon inhibits Artificial Cooperation system
Have you heard the legend of 'The Wolfman'?
He is an ordinary man at daytime, but suddenly transforms into a ferocious wolf in the full-moon night. Our project aims to imitate the character of Wolfman. More specifically, we designed two types of E.coli that help each other to survive at daytime, whereas competing at full moon night. In order to create the “Wolfcoli”, we introduced "" red-light-dependent gene expression network"" and ""band-detect network"" and combined these networks with the Artificial Cooperation System. We characterized series of OmpC promoters and LacIM1 which are the crucial parts for our networks. (See more…)
4-1. New series of osmoregulative promoters
In order to fine tune the Wolfcoli system, we prepared a new series of OmpC promoter. The new series of promoters are PompC(C) BBa_K395301 , PompC(CB) BBa_K395302 and PompC(CS1) BBa_K395303 . For measuring the strength of each promoter, we used GFP as a reporter. We have found that expression of GFP in OmpC(CB) and OmpC(CS1) promoters increased in high osmolarity medium. In contrast, under same conditions, there was no significant difference of GFP expression in OmpC(C) and OmpC(WT) promoters. (See more…)
4-2. LacIMI showed weaker repression than WT
We characterized LacIM1 (BBa_K082026), a mutation of LacIWT, which is a key component in the band-detect network. In fact, this part was registered by USTC(2008). However, sequence data of BBa_K082026 is incorrect and it was not well characterized in the BioBrick registry.

Science Pub Tuebingen
The Science Pub Tuebingen is an event where people and scientists can get together.
In recent years a format called “Science Pub” has become more and more popular in Germany (and also other countries). The idea was born from difficulties scientists face when trying to communicate their research with the general public. The “Science Pub” offers a solution that significantly improves this: instead of giving a dull lecture or displaying posters with lots of information that most people will ignore, a scientist can give rather informal and often more entertaining presentations in a pub or café in the city. This way it is possible to reach more people - and maybe even more important people that usually would not be reached - with an explanation of what scientist are actually doing.
juForum e.V. hosts the Science Pub Tuebingen.
In Tuebingen, the student group “JuForum e.V.” is organizing multiple science pubs presentations each semester.
We sought cooperation with them and were invited to present iGEM and our Team’s projects in science pub talk. This was not just a great opportunity for us - it was also a novelty for the science pub in Tuebingen since normally only professors or other established researchers and not students present their work.
Our team members Daniela Nguyen and Nicolai von Kuegelgen presenting this year's project
We informed the public about our this year's project and the impact of GMOs on contemporary reasearch.
In our presentation, we introduced our team and the iGEM competition to all attendants and went on explaining the ideas of synthetic biology. We also showed how genetic modification of organisms can be achieved, so that people know better what the often discussed GMOs are. After an overview of the project we did in 2015 and the ideas for our Fruitforce project, many people, went in for a final discussion. The most interesting topic was - as expected - GMOs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems of gene editing, which we had explained as part of the Fruitforce project, since these issues had been discussed very critically in German media"
UiOslo_Norway,2017,Team:UiOslo Norway#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," a presentation - it went well, we got good feedback regarding the presentation.

Circadian switch
We aimed to produce butyric acid in our trap during  the day and formic acid during the night.   We designed a light response system which is improved to obtain an   on/off switch of genic expression.
The center of the light sensor is composed of membrane proteins PCB  (chromophore phycocyanobilin) and the hybrid protein Cph8 (EnvZ and Cph1)[11].
PCB protein comes from a cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803  and to be synthesized, it needs the expression of two genes:  heme oxygenase (Ho1) and biliverdin reductase (PcyA)[11].
Ho1 with RBS ( BBa_K1587000 )
A gene required for chromophore synthesis in photosynthetic  light-harvesting complexes, photoreceptors, and circadian clocks. ho1, along with pcyA, converts heme into the chromophore  phycocyanobillin (PCB). The gene comes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
The biobrick is composed of a strong RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and Ho1 coding region ( BBa_K566022 ).
PcyA with RBS ( BBa_K1587002 )
A gene required for chromophore synthesis in photosynthetic  light-harvesting complexes, photoreceptors, and circadian clocks. The gene comes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

What we can do is to lower the threshold and the cost of an application so as to track for a long period and make transformation faster and easier. And this may attract many farmers to join the ranks of organic agriculture. Eventually, the farmers mentioned that it is hard to avoid contamination. As long as they use the water in the downstream of the river, it is impossible to get a license. Land in Taiwan is too small, so the farms are close to each other. Once there is a non-organic agriculture nearby, pesticide and fertilizer will pollute their own farm indirectly.
[ Figure. 3.1-3 ] We interviewed one of a famous organic farmer, Ron Chi farm’s owner in Hsinchu, who shared us many dilemmas that most organic farmers faced nowadays.
(2) Aquacultural base investigation
Through the visit to the fish farm, we understand more about seem-to-be-easy fish aquaculture, which is actually connected with a lot of techniques; aside from the application of new tech concepts, there are more experience heritage and mutual cooperation from neighborhood; for example, judging the typhoon’s impact on the fish farm from the path of typhoon, the fishermen should adopt different kinds of precaution measurements depending on whether the typhoon comes from the Pacific Ocean or the Philippine Sea, or they have to apply the concepts of food chains in order to shunt the water stream to different fish pools for water cleaning; it can increase the water cycle and decrease the water waste, and moreover avoid the pollution caused by water purification chemicals. These techniques cannot be learned from school education or textbooks; this kind of experience inheritance combines with the development new technology is what we aim to move forward on our traditional agriculture. It’s a pleasure for me to learn this much about various industries in this visit.
The selection of water origin
The standard of water quality is not that high for common adult fish farming farms—the water source is mainly derived from the underground water mixing with seawater to a proper salinity. It controls the oxygen content through the cultivation of red and green algae, with a rare requirement of filtration.
The control of water quality
Generally speaking, the control of water quality is mainly the observation about the quantity of alga to judge the oxygen content; the green alga in water is excessive, which means the oxygen content is too high, while the red alga is too much, which indicates the oxygen is too low. When it rains, the rain would bring the air pollution or the frontal would take the germs from another area to the water, resulting in water contamination, requiring the"

From 2010.igem.org
As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthesis biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthesis biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Three paper discs of the third row are red. So it's possible to detect the mRFP lysate up to a 1:10 dilution.
Now we wanted to find out if it is possible to photograph the fluorescence from a Cell-free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) on Paper . After a CFPS run on paper, we took the paper discs and took the photo shown below. We took the paper discs of paper from the  experiment on paper, took a photo and it worked, hence we can take a photo of the sfGFP generated in a CFPS experiment. In the first row you can see purified GFP, a dilution of the GFP and sfGFP lysat. We used this row for comparison. In the second row is the negativ control. We need the negativ control to visualize the  self-fluorescence of the cell extract. In the third row are the paper discs where our self made extract were added for the CFPS. In the last row you can see the paper disc with the commercial cell extract for CFPS. So it's possible to take an image of sfGFP produced during a CFPS reaction with an smartphone. Hence it's possible to take this as a device to analyze our paper based biosensor .

In the first row you can see purified GFP, a dilution of the GFP and sfGFP lysat. We used this row for comparison. In the second row is the negativ control. We need the negativ control to visualize the  self-fluorescence of the cell extract. In the third row are the paper discs where our self made extract were added for the CFPS. In the last row you can see the paper disc with the commercial cell extract for CFPS.
The app
Now it's possible to photograph fluorescence, but sometimes it's difficult to see the differences between the divers paper discs. Additionally analyzing the pictures with the image processing software Fiji requires know-how of the user. For both the program and the interpretation. We solved this problem with a smartphone app. We coded the app with Android Studio 1.2.2 and it can be installed on smartphones on Android 4.2 (Jelly bean) and later. The app determines the median of the greenvalue of a area of pixels in the sensorspot and compares it to the pixels of the negative control (the"

Project Description
Background Research
In the process of deciding what our project would be, we thought that we should choose something that would apply to our own community, as well as the international community. This idea led us to look into products that are used worldwide, and one of the things we found was ink. It is used in schools, homes, and nearly all workplaces. We then decided to go to the public and explore the idea of an innovation for ink as a viable product. After some research, we discovered that the ink is made up of three main parts; the resin, the solvent, and the colorant. Further research also led us to discover that the colorant is responsible for over 50% of the cost of ink. This led us to investigate the colorants themselves and we found that the production of colorants and pigments creates some horrible byproducts, such as large amounts of greenhouse gases, PCBs (polychlorinated byphenyls) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). We took a tour of the Warwick Printing company in our hometown of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada and learned about how the ink is used in the industrial sector. We also learned from the owner Dave Warwick some of the important qualities of ink. For more information concerning the Warwick tour, click here .
Choosing our Project
After our initial research and our investigation into the industry and market we chose to do a project on ink. We then needed to decide what sort of problems existed within ink production and usage. The cost breakdown of ink led us to decide to focus on the colorant portion of ink as it accounts for the majority of the cost. This led us to research colorants and how they are made and used. We found that there are a few different colorants, pigments, organic molecules, and inorganic salts or compounds. We found that the most used and in highest demand colorant was carbon black, which is the byproduct of burning petroleum for energy (Figure 1). We had found our problem! Harmful byproducts of carbon black production are plentiful. We decided to combat this problem by producing a colorant of our own. We chose to produce four pigments"
