The concentration of Y rises from zero and gradually converges on the steady-state.
Note that at early times, when
,we can use a Taylor expansion to find a linear accumulation of a Y:
Y～βt
early time,
The concentration of protein Y accumulates at early time with a slope equal to its production rate. Later, as Y level increases, the degradation term-
Y begins to be important and Y converges to its steady-state level.
We considered the activation of transcription of a gene (mRNA production) and used a dynamical equation to describe the changes in the concentration of the gene product, the protein Y. The mRNA needs to be translated to form the protein, and mRNA itself is also degraded by specific enzymes.
Assuming that mRNA is produced at rate
and degraded at rate
, and that each mRNA produces on average p protein molecules over its lifetime. The protein is degraded/diluted at rate
.
The dynamic equation for the concentration of mRNA of gene Y,
, is :
①
The dynamical equation for the protein product is due to production of
copies per mRNA and degradation/dilution at rate
The steady-state mRNA level is found by setting
in Equation ①, yielding
Using this for
in Equation ① yields the following equation for the protein production rate:
In other words, the effective protein production rate is equal to the steady-state mRNA level times the number of proteins translated from each mRNA:
In the first step of our modeling, we support that all genes have the same expression way in the cell. We support that all the input signals appear at time t=0. Because we don't have enough time to measure transcription and translation rates of the genes, we assume that all the proteins have the same production rate and this rate are supported to be 200 nM/h. To measure the degradation rate of protein, αdeg, T1/2 is used in the following calculation, in which period of time the protein decrease by 50%. T1/2 of each protein is determined by their Instability index (II). Degradation rates of protein can be calculated by the aquation, T1/2 =log(2)/α.Yst means steady-state concentration of protein Y.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If"

Gene Network Game
Overview
Gene Network Gameは、与えられたプロモータ、遺伝子を組み合わせて目的の挙動を示す遺伝子回路を構成するパズルゲームである。このゲームを通してプレイヤーは遺伝子回路の性質を学ぶことができ、それは他チームのコンストラクトを理解したり、自チームのコンストラクトを設計する際に役に立つ。また、モデリングの入門教材としても使用出来る。
プレイヤーは、まずいくつかのプロモータと遺伝子、シグナル入力と、目的とするタンパク質濃度の時間変化が与えられる（左）
プロモータと遺伝子を適切に並べて、目的の時間変化を再現できたらクリアである（右）
ゲームは複数のステージに分かれており、順番にプレイしていくことで、プロモータや遺伝子とは何かといったところから、オシレータやトグルスイッチといった代表的な遺伝子回路までを学ぶことができる。

HP Silver - Education and Public Engagement
From interviews with cataracts patients, ophthalmologists, veterinarians, polls from residents in Taipei and our school community, we learned that cataracts are prevalent and have a huge impact on everyday life. Now we wanted to raise awareness through education. We started by informing teachers and students of various grade levels about the severity and causes of cataracts, and how our project could tackle these problems.
Then, in our community, we handed out pamphlets, taught people how cataracts form, and simulated a cataract experience by wearing goggles of varying cloudiness.  Finally, we wanted to make a global impact.  We joined the international BioBuilder Club community and connected with 23 other synthetic biology high school clubs to discuss our project and ideas.  We held fundraising events to benefit people who have cataracts in underdeveloped nations.  Below are a list of activities and programs that we did in outreach.

● msmK ( BBa_K2606001 )
    It is a fragment cloned from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group, which is verified to be a new and effective anti-acid gene in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900.
    Usage and function
    The msmK overexpression strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one at pH 4.0 after 3 hours.
Fig 1 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.

    Before the acid stress, the cell structure of the control strain and the recombinant strain remained intact. After 3 hours of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

For our second yeast transformation attempt, we accidentally used less plasmid DNA; we obtained no growth. For our third attempt, we made sure to use the sufficient amount of plasmid DNA and to eliminate the outgrowth step, which was not necessary for leucine-marker selection. This yielded a successful transformation.

Over the weekend our final Y. lipolytica plating showed a large amount of growth, indicating that our old stock was indeed competent. Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend.
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by the end of the week. Nanodrop analysis gave the following concentrations of PCR products in the table below.
We also began out first Gibson Assembly experiments with our amplified inserts and linearized plasmid backbone. After this, we used PCR to confirm the presence of our pOPPY_GFP plasmids by using two of our Sanger sequencing primers and running the generated amplicons against a ladder on a 1.5% agarose gel. We also attempted a series of transformations of E. coli using our 5 Gibson Assembly products.
We also sent off our first samples for Sanger sequencing at the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected"

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," FT protein or R9 peptides.
If the cause was that our FT protein was not active though FT had entered the cell, FT will be confirmed.  In that case, we have to consider the possibilities that FT needs Post-translational modification or Arabidopsis thaliana that we used was old.
When FT needs Post-translational modification, we have to do more research about difference of Post-translational modification between E.coli and Arabidopsis thaliana.
When Arabidopsis thaliana that we used was old, it might have originally expressed enough FT, so our FT might not be necessary to induce FUL and SEP3.
If the cause was that FT didn’t enter plant cell or FT was decomposed in the cell, FT will not be confirmed.  When FT didn’t enter plant cell, we have to reconstruct experimental system, for example, by using other kinds of R9 since there exist more effective R9s. Wnen FT was decomposed in the cell, we have to investigate the mechanism of decomposing protein.
Future Works
We noticed only flowering and florigen in this time but there are many other plant hormones. We made translocation pathway from E.coli into plant cells, so we will be able to introduce plant hormones into plant cells if E.coli can make them. It means we can control plant growth in any stage through genetically engineered E.coli. In the future that is not so far, we will be able to meddle in plants' growth――germinating, elongation, flowering, and fructification. We human will finally accomplish a technology that control plants perfectly.
Moreover, R9 peptide functions not only plant cell. R9 peptide works on animal cell similarly. It means that we found a pathway into any kinds of cells. R9 peptide tag enables us to introduce proteins into any cells, so we will be able to control all living cells using this technology.

Why Mathematical Models?
To be able to predict the behavior of a given biological system, one has to create a mathematical model of the system. The model is usually generated according to the Law of Mass Action and then simplified by assuming certain reactions to be fast. This model then could e.g. facilitate optimizations of bio-synthetic pathways by regulating the relative expression levels of the involved enzymes.
Why are we not necessarily interested in the best fit?
To create a model that produces quantitative predictions, one needs to tune the parameters to fit experimental data. This procedure is called inference and is usually accomplished by computing the least squares approximation of the model to the experimental data with respect to the parameters.
There are several difficulties with this approach: In the case of a non-convex least squares error function several local minima may exist and optimizations algorithms will struggle to find all of them. This means one might not be able to find the best fit or even a biologically reasonable fit.
Another issue with this approach is the fact that it provides no information"

Saturday September 15th
We did a PCR screen of the things that we transformed the previous night. From yesterday’s PCR screens, we ran the gel.
Week 14
Monday September 17th
We digested B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 to ligate it together with the J23101 and K206000. We want to do this so that we can see if just the expression of dehydrogenase will increase the success rate of the MG1655 and Strain E-15 EG3 living. We had to re-digest the pieces because the nanodrop of the gel purification was erratic. However, when we went to nanodrop the second round of digestions, the previous gel purifications were at a higher concentration than that of the second digestion. We ligated the pieces overnight at 16C. The concentration of the library for the genomic sequencing was too low, so we had to redo the preparation. We ran the qPCR overnight to see how much there is in the new prep. We also took the liquid cultures from yesterday and put them into glycerol stocks and minipreps. Successful sequence results were seen for T96A, D98T, S101A, F125Y and Y127A. pNPB assay performed on control (cells with no cutinase), J23101 and inducible construct all at varying cell concentrations.
On the cutinase front, we started a new round of cultures from which to take samples for western blots. First, we inoculated two 5mL cultures cultures one with pBad regulated cutinase in MG1655 and the other with only the antibiotic resistance (to be used as a control). When the cultures reached an OD of 0.5, we then used this inoculate two 100 mL cultures. Once these reached an OD 600 of 0.8, we divided them into four 50 mL cultures and induced two of them. At this point we had four 50 mL cultures at an OD of 0.8, an induced and uninduced pBad promoted cutinase and an induced and uninduced negative control.
From these cultures, we took 1 mL samples at several different time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.75, and 3.5 hours. Tomorrow we will prepare these samples to run on an sds page gel and western blot.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," the variation of promoter strength (RPU) in different concentration of arabinose. Each strain of cells inoculated overnight in various arabinose concentration above. The cells were diluted around 10 fold and grown until they reached mid-log phase (OD600 0.3-0.5). Cells were fixed and fluorescence was measured using flow cytometer. The graph represent triplicate mean ±SD.
We thought that Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) defined by Endy et al. would be a better a measure of promoter strength at different arabinose concentration than simply comparing the  fluorescence measurement of different strains. This is because simply measuring and comparing fluorescence as an output can also be affected by other experimental factors such as the genetic context. Because RPU is a ratio to fluorescence measurement, the effects caused by these factors can be minimized (See Methods for RPU calculation).
We observed clearly a different promoter response among the three cell strains. The all-or-none response was observed for the strains, but the levels of RPU were different.  For DH10B, RPU leveled off around 0.45. For BW25113, RPU leveled off around 0.3. For DH10B and BW25113 we see a very clear “all-or-none” response. The RPU reaches a plateau at  0.2% of arabinose. For DH5α, it is less obvious, because the initial increase of RPU at 0.2% arabinose is around 0.1, lower than the other two strains. With the given graph,  statically, we cannot say that the RPU level gradually increases as % arabinose increases.
The lower RPU of DH5α was expected because DH5α has araC gene, gene for the repressor, in its genome. This could have caused the lower promoter strength of  PBAD in DH5α. All in all, all three strains produced all-or-none response.
For DH10B and BW25113 we see a very clear “all-or-none” response. The RPU reaches a plateau at 0.2% of arabinose. For DH5α, it is less obvious, because the initial increase  of RPU at 0.2% arabinose is around 0.1, lower than the other two strains.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#InformedDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," developing tools to monitor E. coli in cattle prior to harvest. We learned in populations of beef cattle, about five percent of the animals are “super shedders” because they pass three to four higher orders of magnitude of dangerous E. coli in their feces.
Could food safety be improved by separating “super shedders” before they contaminate processing plants? We decided to build a device to rapidly test cattle feces to determine an animal’s shedding level. Our intuition told us that by bringing less E. coli into processing plants would lead to fewer opportunities for contamination. We wondered whether the processing plants would agree.
The Meat Processor
We proposed this idea to Ryan Clisdell, the Food Safety, Quality & Regulatory manager from Cargill Meat Solutions in High River, Alberta, who oversees the processing of 4,500 cattle daily. He took our team into the harvest facility and explained how his team helps prevent E. coli contamination through food safe harvest practices. The mechanization and choreography of the harvest process to lessen opportunities for contamination was remarkable. However, this left us wondering whether addressing the root cause of E. coli contamination, by helping prevent or limiting how much is present on live animals, would further help to prevent the chance of food safety illness?
Our tour of the Cargill plant settled us on developing a system to monitor E. coli shedding in cattle prior to harvest. By developing such a system, we hoped to introduce new tools so that E. coli could be managed at additional points during production. This idea would complement current E. coli management programs used by companies such as Cargill and provide another layer of food safety.
We needed to know where a pre-harvest E. coli management program could be implemented in industry. Cargill gave us positive feedback and told us that super shedders could be screened and processed differently based on E. coli. But we were curious if performing these tests earlier in the supply chain might cause a greater effect on food safety. Would cattle feedlots consider adopting this idea and use the data to isolate super shedders?
The Feedlot
We took these questions to Dr. Eric Behlke, a veterinarian from Feedlot Management Services Ltd. , who took us on a tour of Chinook Feeders, a large scale Alberta feedlot which manages 18,000 head of cattle. Dr. Behlke received our idea positively, but he challenged us to build a system which could be integrated into existing feedlot infrastructure. We saw opportunities where cattle could theoretically be monitored on a single animal basis, but only at specific periods when they are processed for vaccines and check"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

They also had the opportunity to learn how to do a fruit DNA extraction using oranges and take the DNA solution home as well. As this was another hands-on experiences, we thought it would be optimal in attracting the general public and explain the concepts of synthetic biology. Having discussions with all those who came to our booth, we were thrilled to see that children and adults were open to learning about synthetic biology. A previous researcher from the Laufer Center at our university stopped by our booth and shared her experiences with synthetic biology within her own research.

 We were invited to have a booth at another Maker Faire, World Maker Faire, in New York City, to teach attendees about synthetic biology. We had an amazing time with the children there, showing them the basics of biology with a more visual and interesting method: extracting DNA from strawberries and oranges. To make the activity as hands-on as possible, the children themselves became “scientists” and through dish soap, salt, and rubbing alcohol, were able to visualize clumps of fruit DNA. They then learned how to use a micropipette, and pipetted their DNA solution into microcentrifuge tubes, which they were able to bring home as a necklace or bracelet. We chose this as an activity in order to inspire and introduce younger children to the fields of biology and synthetic biology. For high school students, parents and other adults who visited our booth, we presented our project and explained the importance of synthetic biology. For this fun event, we invited the Columbia iGEM Team to help bring supplies and manpower.

 Although science has reached almost every aspect of life and field we can imagine, it has not quite reached the Deaf community. Therefore, our iGEM team decided we should pioneer and educate those in the Deaf community about iGEM and synthetic biology. Three members of our team, one of whom has a background in American Sign Language, ventured to the Islip Middle School, a satellite center of the Cleary Deaf School, packed with activities, posters boards, and presentations. We first gave a presentation on biology, synthetic biology, and our presentation -- translated with the help of an interpreter. We thought hands-on activities would be the best way for the students to get a visual of biology in action. The first activity we presented was DNA extraction with fruit. As soon as the DNA began to clump up, the students (and teachers) were beyond excited. With just"

Biobricks for uptake into blood
Indu will email professor Wessel about the bifunctional issue. We will go from there.
New issue, the bifunctional protein is that we are targeting to very different things, with different properties, quantities, and location. The IGE Antibody binding protein may be too large compared to the histamine binding protein, and this protein may be too large to be taken into the bloodstream. This can be solved by finding the single important region of each receptor and bridging them together. Protocols and biobricks for secretion, production, protein bridge can be our focus.
7:02: We need faculty input on these issues! Michael will follow up with Wessel and Adrian about the June 12 meeting.
7:08: Indu and Steph are researching parts of the IGE Antibody that we can focus on to minimize the size of the binding protein

We can characterize the one Holin in the registry and see if it works for our project. We can do the same for UCP. SulA Promoter (?) and colicin are in the registry…

iGEM was a great way for me to end my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering. I've learned a lot (mostly from my own stupid mistakes) and had fun. When I'm not in the lab transforming bacteria, I enjoy mountain biking and playing board games. I really don't have a clue what I'm going to do once iGEM is over. I'll probably spend lots of time with my husband who I've barely seen since iGEM took over my summer.

Indeed, cancer can be the result of DNA damage due to carcinogens or appear spontaneously during DNA replication. The inability to correct this mistake due to mutation of gene repairing or to the absence of gene control to the cell cycle can give a growth advantage to the cell. These genes constitute the best targets for gene therapy in cancer treatment.
When genes are identified, gene therapy success depends on the efficiency of the gene transfer in the cell. Transport of gene-medicine is one of the most difficult challenge encountered by gene therapy. The efficient transfer system which stabilizes, induces and express transgene has not been found yet. Naked gene-medicine transfer in cells is still not very efficient. The gene-medicine expression is as low in intensity as in time because of the polyanionic nature of the DNA which not permits to pass through the cell membrane barrier. Thus, 100 000 DNA molecules should be necessary by target cell to permit at least to one DNA sequence to penetrate in the nucleus. To this is added the non efficiency of the naked medicine transfer. Indeed, the naked DNA use decreases the target efficacy to a given tissue, so the number of cell which has incorporated the gene-medicine still low. But the pharmaceutical industries objective is the systemic administration of these genes.
One of the solutions consists to integer DNA in a vector. This last one should reply to several criteria:
- Be able to protect DNA,
- Target the desired cell with a high specificity,
- Deliver easily the gene through the cell membrane,
- Deliver the gene to the nucleus to permit its expression.

In conclusion...
... Gene therapy made its proof for monogenic diseases treatment, like hemophilia, or for cancers. Moreover, molecular and cellular biology evolution combined to bioinformatics progresses permits to the gene therapy concept to be even more promising… However, this tool should be further optimized, in particular in the gene-medicine transport. Despite researches abundance on this subject, an efficient vector has not been discovered yet.
Gene therapy success stays in the capacity to transport the gene in the target cell and to obtain a high expression level. It appears necessary to design a new vector.

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthesis biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthesis biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend.
However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics"

Safety training received
Prior to the researches of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety in turn ,lectured by professors in the laboratory.The safety training included  many aspects, such as the proper usage of all the equipments, how to deal with the experimental rubbish correctly, and wear rubber gloves, lab coats when making operations. Before using the super-clean bench,we must sterilize,etc.
Environment safety issue and biosafety group
Hela cells are commonly studied in labs, and they are not generally considered to be dangerous. Minor risks are contained in our research since the organism and plasmids, which causes no severe infection to human and animals, will be handled properly by well-trained personnel after every and each experiment, and the chemicals in frequent use are proved to be friendly, except EB ,which is separated along with related devices in a special section, the contact with which requires such protections as a pair of rubber gloves. Thus no major safety problem will possibly be encountered, which will be under control if they would emerge. We are supported and financed by Department of Automation, instructed and supervised by its professors and engineers studying life sciences. And laboratory assistants give us quite a lot of instructive suggestions including problems on biosafety. safety form 2(part1) safety form 2(part2)

Introduction
We utilized well-characterized light transduction bricks to induce lysis in our cells. Multiple pathways have been considered: one depends on red (632nm) light to activate an OmpR transcription factor, another depends on infrared light to activate a heat-shock promoter; either of these promoters can be connected to a downstream brick which induces cell lysis. Originally, the red light-induction bricks were used by the UT Austin iGEM team to create bacterial photographs, termed coliroids . The heat-shock promoter brick (<partinfo>K112400</partinfo>) was created by UC Berkeley as part of a biological parts suite for bacteria. Similarly, the lysis cassette (<partinfo>K124017</partinfo>) we used was produced by another team – hence the beauty and utility of the Registry: versatility and availability.
Ultimately, our team set out to produce a 3D printer with the following specific design constraints: (a) print an arbitrary shape and with reasonable resolution, (b) minimize the cost & time required, and (c) maximize the hardness and utility of the material produced.
Light-Induced Lysis
M30109 System Schematics
We first tried to use the red light transduction system pioneered by Levskaya et al in 2005 [12] and adapted to BioBricks by the UT Austin iGEM team. Upon exposure to 632nm light, the receptor protein would be activated (<partinfo>BBa_I15008</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_I15009</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_I15010</partinfo>) which then activates a naturally occurring signal protein OmpR, positively regulating a corresponding OmpR promoter (<partinfo>"

Protocols
OD600 Reference Point
LUDOX-HS40 was used as a single point reference to obtain a radiometric conversion factor to convert absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement. The Reference OD600 divided by the Abs600 from four replicates of LUDOX was used to obtain a correction factor for use against the cell based assays.
Fluorescein Standard Curve
A dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates was prepared and measured in the plate reader to obtain a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. This was used to correct cell-based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration, and to then convert this to a GFP concentration.
Plate Reader
Competent E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with each of the devices and plated onto LB+Chl agar, and two colonies from each transformation plate were grown overnight in 10 ml LB + Chl in 50 ml Falcon tubes. Protocols for making competent cells and cell transformation can be found here (link to protocol). Fluorescence was measured as specified in the InterLab protocol on a Synergy H1 plate reader.
Results
Raw results can be found here
Figure 1 InterLab results – (A) Growth, (B) fluorescence and (C) calculated µM fluorescein/OD600 of InterLab devices grown at 37°C in LB for 6 h. Measurements from 4 individual plate readings at 0, 2, 4 and 6 h.
Bacterial growth - We found that the negative control, Tests 3, 5 and 6 grew the most in the 6 h experiment, with the positive control and Test 2 growing less so. Test 1 had the least growth.
Fluorescence - Test 2 showed the most fluorescence after 6 h, with Test 4 showing slightly less, followed closely by the positive control, then Tests 1 and 5. Tests 3 and 6 showed very little fluorescence.
FL/OD - Test 1 gave a significantly higher overall uM fluorescein/OD600 ratio compared to all other devices with values of 0.91 and 0.94 from the separate isolates, compared to a range of <0.01 and 0.18 from all"
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," is gifted by a very sustainable vitality and because it is very easy to prepare it”. (Letter to Cavallo, 1793)
The “galvanists” in favor of animal electricity and the “voltaists” in favor of the metallic electricity enrolled the animal in their controversy. The great traveler and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt transported in his luggage, “even riding a horse”, pliers, scalpels, and metallic patch to defend the thesis of animal electricity on local frog, always accessible in neighboring pond.
Today, animal manipulation is no more allowed in schools, and public demonstration had to be replaced by another media.
Pioneer of the wireless communication, it catches electromagnetic waves!
The frog’s career in electricity didn’t end in 1800. After the announcement of the existence of electromagnetic waves by Heinrich Hertz at the end of the 1880’s, many scientists and inventors looked for diverse detector of these mysterious waves. Thus, in 1912, Lefeuvre, professor in physiology at the University of Rennes, realized a “physiological detector”, capable to detect waves of telegraphic wireless emitted in Paris. Before being able to diffuse speech and music, the Hertzian waves transmitted Morse code telegraphic signals. The core of Lefeuvre’s apparatus is nothing else than a frog, which tight contracts at the signal reception! One dash: an extended contraction, on dot: a brief contraction.

In its bowl, it predicts weather
The popular wisdom in weather prevision uses many of sayings that refer to the frog:
“If the weather is nice, the frog croaks on the banks of its ponds”; in the vase, it digs, if the bad weather is coming”.
“Frogs that croak at day, rain in the three days”
“When frogs sing at night, in the morning, the sun shines""
In the 70’s, on the French radio Europe 1, the famous hoarse-voiced meteorologist Albert Simon awarded the quality of his prevision to his frog which, in its bowl, went down or up its ladder in accordance with the variation of the barometer.
A “privileged fragment of the living world”
Let’s go back to life science. The study of the parthenogenesis - that is the reproduction without male - by the biologist and popularizer Jean Rostand was also done with frogs. By inflicting an appropriate trauma on a non-fecundated egg,"

In addition, users are free to control the speed of the revolution (Auto/Seton). What's more, users can press the SET button to change the speed and the REQUIRE button to require the current speed.
The second function module named Analysis aims at taking advantage of AIT to analyze the images that Fang has already photographed. The technology we chose is Tensorflow-the second generationartificial intelligent learning system developed by Google based on DistBelief. When an user takes a photo, the photo will be sent to our cloud server. In the cloud server, there are some modules which have been trained by large amounts of samples with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Intelligently, the photo uploaded will match the model by machine learning and user can obtain the information containing analysis results accurately and efficiently from App.
The third function module named Interaction. It is based on block chain technology. In our cloud server, we have already established a private chain of Ethereum, and we will issue our own digital currency provided for users to deploy smart contract of their own, including all theirdiagnostic messages. There is a One-to-One correspondence between a user and a doctor. When a smart contract is deployed, it allows only one doctor to confirm. Later the doctor can write the therapeutic methods or suggestions into the smart contract to which the patient can refer. On account of its transparency, openness and immutable property, a medical certificate (smart contract) can be corresponded to one specific patient and one specific doctor. Thus, it can effectively avoid medical dispute such as misdiagnose and unscrupulous disavowing.
The last function module named About. contains introduction of our teamand some users' information.
Following the function recommended above comes the introduction about the communication mechanism of our App. It is based on three-party communication among Raspberry Pi, App, and cloud server. The instruction sent from App will first arrive cloud server, and will be transmit to Raspberry Pi by server. Actually, the instruction sent from Raspberry will be in a similar way. What's more, the machine learning and mining mechanism of block chain will be operating in the cloud server, thus we can enhance operational efficiency and real-time performance.

Parts Collaboration
We have collaborated with iGEM teams from across the world in a few ways, one of which is providing parts for other teams to use.  We supplied the Valencia_UPV team with our chromoproteins ( AmilCP (Bba_K1467201) and AmilGFP (Bba_K1467202) ) so they could use them alongside their TA29 promoter and barnase to build their biosafety modules (for more information about these parts please visit the Valencia_UPV team 's website).  They also submitted some of their parts to the registry using our MoFlippers and sent us their biosafety modules.
New RFC with Cambridge and Valencia_UPV iGEM teams
We joined forces with both the Cambridge-JIC and Valencia_UPV teams to develop a RFC (Request For Comments) as we hope to define a standard that is based on type-IIS restriction endonucleases.  All three projects used this method of assembly as well as employing a plant chassis.  We are also running a workshop at the Jamboree to tell everyone about the benefits of using plants and the type-IIS restriction endonuclease-mediated parallel assembly method.

Meetups
Part of the iGEM ethos is open communication and the collaborative nature of scientific research, which requires interactions between teams and projects.  We have attended all the UK meetups (Oxford, Sheffield and UCL) in order to see how or if we can help any other projects or if any projects could help us.  We also had a great time meeting and talking to everyone!

–Do you like science?–No. EW!
That is a common answer when that question is asked among mexican children. We think it’s a problem. We think we should be worried (and you too!). But we cannot take no for an answer, and a kid’s mind can be quite stubborn. We needed to change their mind, and although the children’s answer could change over time through different, positive stimulus on the children’s lives, we knew we have the power to be one of said stimuli, and thus, decided to take responsibility and bring science to the kids in a friendly, and most importantly, fun way. Since it is important for us to introduce science topics related to biology to children, we made several visits to elementary and middle schools in our area. For each of our visits, we planned a “science day” where we explained the concepts in simple, visual ways. After each explanation, we assigned manual activities for kids to reinforce what they had just learned through playing: making their own edible culture medium, creating amino acid chains, and proposing transformations for bacteria were some of the activities they enjoyed. We taught children how to invent their own bacterium, first they “built” their own “BioBrick”, then they filled a “patent form” with the bacteria name and its function, later they created their “bacteria” with flour-filled balloons, markers and decorations. Finally they made their own “culture medium” with jelly-filled petri dishes, syrup, colored sugar and cake decoration. We taught them that are good and bad bacteria and how biotechnologists use them to create useful devices. For children from 3rd and 4th grade to understand what living beings are, that they are formed from cells, and DNA inside them, we made them build their own “BioBrick”, then create their “patent form” with the bacteria name and its function, then a “bacteria-bookmark” with foamy, clips, decorative eyes and yarn. Finally they created a “culture medium” with jelly-filled petri dishes, syrup, colored sugar and cake-decoration.

September
Two months away - Presentation Time
It’s the beginning of September, and we’re now 2 months away from the Jamboree, all this hard work and long hours are now shaping into a reality. It was time to start thinking about the presentation in Boston. Presenting to a class with a professor sure sounds scary and gives most people the chills, now imagine presenting to a room with 200-300 people! We didn’t waste any time planning the presentation, we watched previous iGEM presentations, and noted down what was good and bad about said presentation. From there, we had an idea of how our presentation would look like, we wanted it to be scientific, intuitive, fun; to sum it all up, we wanted it to represent our team spirit.
September 25th
First Meeting post Summer
Summer vacation is over, but that doesn’t mean that the iGEM work is done though! After 3 months of vicious and relentless work, it was time to take a minute and look at the big picture. We met to for 4 hours that evening to evaluate what we have completed so far, and to plan the upcoming last month. The spirits were all positive and high as we saw how far we have achieved, the work we put in has really paid off! We were about 1 month and a half from the Jamboree, so we planned the following month based on the uncompleted tasks. It’s now or never at this point!
October 7th
PRACTICE JAMBOREE!
It’s October 7th we’re exactly 1 month away from Boston! Four months we have been thinking about hosting an event, at one of KU Leuven’s facilities. Earlier in July, we thought of the European Practice Jamboree, an event where we could bring together teams from all over Europe to try and mimic the real Jamboree taking place in Boston. So, we started contacting teams and organizing the event! Saturday, October 7th  arrived, and the event was a major success. Keynote speakers included the Vice Rector of Sciences and Technology (KU Leuven), Prof. Jos Vander Sloten and our own PI Prof. Johan Swinnen. The event also included presentations and feedback by all the participating teams, and poster viewing session. Every team left with more information on how to make their presentation perfect.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," ease of testing and minimise any error in the testing.
Firstly we had to consider where we would take the testing sample from. The current skin test is performed on the neck, which must be shaved and then injected with avian and bTB. The vet then returns 72 hours later to diagnose the cattle based on the skin’s reaction to the injected strains. Phil told us that neck testing is awkward and time-consuming for the vet, and that blood tests are easier to perform.
As the RNA associated with a TB infection (but not present in the BCG vaccine) is found in the blood of infected cows, we further discussed this option with Phil. He told us that bovine blood tests are usually drawn from a prominent vein behind the tail of the cow, and that this kind of test has many benefits over the cumbersome skin test. These are outlined:
The blood test is much easier and quicker to perform. There is no need to shave the area, it is a simple process of inserting a needle and drawing blood.
The blood test is a safer option, as the vet can stand to the side of the cow (avoiding kicks from the hind legs) to draw blood quickly, and the thick skin in this area means that the cow is unlikely to feel much pain from the test.
The current skin test can agitate the cow as the neck is a sensitive area, which must be shaved and injected.
The vet must only make one visit to the farm to draw blood samples, whereas with the current test the vet visit twice returning 72 hours after injection to diagnose.
We decided that our test would work well as a blood test, and that a few drops of blood would be enough for our toehold to detect the trigger RNA and hence diagnose bTB.
We then focused on making our test as easy as possible for the vet to perform. Phil Leighton was invaluable during this process, telling us exactly how we could help vets like him. The current test has several steps: the cow arrives through a press, the number on the cow's ear tag is recorded, it is shaven and injected with the attenuated strains, and then released. 72 hours later, the vet returns. The cow again arrives through a press (in a random order), it’s ear tag number is recorded, the neck is observed and then finally the cow is diagnosed and the appropriate action can be taken.  This method has several areas where error can occur:
The wrong number could be written down at either stage (testing or diagnosis).
The list of numbers written down can be mixed up, resulting in the diagnosis being matched to the wrong cow"
NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new drug therapy, which proved the significance of our topic.
Most of the patients desire to try the new drugs, but the amount of patients who meet genetic testing standards and requirements of targeted therapy are still limited. Therefore it needs the joint effort of various communities to promote the development of therapeutic targeting drugs and enlarge its covering. At the same time, efforts should be made to diminish the cost of molecular targeted therapy as much as possible, becoming affordable for more patients and families and permitting continuation of more lives.
Interview with patients
Ms. Chen (60-year-old)      Gastric adenocarcinoma sufferer
Ms. Chen primarily realized her disease due to sudden hemafecia. After a thorough check, she was told that she has got poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. She had surgery on Dec. 22nd, 2013, removed the 2/3 of the stomach. In May this year, she suffered a plummet of her weight, from more than 140 pounds to less than 90. Her gastric cancer recurred. She ate less, and one examination showed that cancer cells could be found in 13 different pieces of tissues in her.
Ms. Chen’s treatment now mainly depends on chemotherapy, while cooperates with oral drugs simultaneously. Chemotherapy treatment period is 21 days of hospitalization, followed by 3 days infusion (Oxaliplatin) for about 7-8 hours per day. Her medication cycle is to take oral medications (made in Japanese) for 15 continuous days, then withdraw for 1 week, then circulate.
She chose imported drugs for chemotherapy (import drugs are at her own expense, while domestic drugs can be partly covered by medical compensation). Although imported drugs have relatively limited side effects, as it can prevent hair loss, there are still some adverse reactions like nausea and vomiting, and she felt numb hands and feet. Monthly cost is around 8-10k RMB (around 1300$).
She has adapted gene detect to find pathological cause, and she has more in-depth knowledge of molecular targeted drugs. Yet because the examination results showed that her gene type does not match targeting drugs, thus she gave up targeted drug therapy. When told that targeted treatment costs about 30k RMB (around 4500$) per month, she considered it as acceptable and affordable.

Since the process of encryption and decryption can derive a series of interactive activities, the idea of biological cipher machine itself can be a good carrier of synthetic biology. How does our Enigma machine inspire the public? And what will these voices outside the lab inspire us to reflect on our project?  Continue to find the answer!

Overview
    We believe that a project will not be excellent enough without creative design, diligent lab work, and serious human practice work. Design of the biological machine determines the upper limit of the project, and lab work determines the lower limit of the project. As for human practice work, it views iGEM and synthetic biology in a broader perspective, which is close to the exploration of social value and describes a bigger world that synthetic biology and iGEM exist.
 
    In order to describe this “bigger world” better, ZJU-China has been tried hard to collect the voices outside the lab and integrate the investigated issue into the design and the execution of our project.
 
    As previously mentioned, we explored the topic of public engagement/dialogue. We intended to call for the public’s attention through our attractive project and use their feedback to improve it and the way we tell the story of synthetic biology. What’s more, we reflected our own conception of what synthetic biology can bring us.
 
 
Elementary activities
    We went to STEM science festival and science & technology museum in summer. And set up a stall in the exhibition hall. We used room escape game, decoding game using cadies as props, and a video telling a story based on synthetic biology to attract their attention and introduced synthetic biology to"

Our improved part is mainly from the TU Munich iGEM Team in 2012. We used Thaumatin for the experiment. Thaumatin is a single chain with 207 amino acids residues and eight disulfide bonds and a molecular weight of 22.2 kDa. It is highly water soluble, stable at heating (not for cooking, bakery, etc.) and stable under acidic conditions. The production of thaumatin is induced by an attack upon the plant by viroid pathogens.
We will transform BBa_K801080 to smd1168. Hope to increase the amount of gene expression

Characterization of Designed Variants
For each family, we tested the randomers and the designed variants separately. To characterize the promoter strengths, we used RFP as the reporter gene and used a platereader to test for fluorescence during and after induction with IPTG.
The six designed T7 promoter variants are named as a function of their predicted promoter efficiency, relative to the wildtype. For example, T7 14 has a predicted efficiency of 14% compared to the consensus T7 promoter, whereas T7 111 is predicted to be 111% more efficient than the wildtype. In the chart above, you find each of the designed promoter variants for both the T7 with and without the lac operator, arranged in increasing predicted efficiency. Contrary to our expectation, some variants that were designed to have a lesser efficiency than the wildtype (e.g. T7 54) seem to have a much higher strength (as measured by fluorescence at saturation, normalized by the optical density). Already in the designed variants, we see a substantial difference in the behaviour of the promoters that have a lac operator as opposed to those that do not. The data for this graph was produced in triplicate, so the error bar represents the standard error across those three measurements.
In addition to fluorescence at saturation, another way to characterize promoter strength is to look at its induction ratio, which is the ratio, at saturation, of fluorescence produced by induction with IPTG versus fluorescence produced without induction. In layman's terms, it indicates how strongly the promoter reacts to induction. Here again, our results indicate that some promoter variants (T7 80 in particular) stand out with respect to this feature. Here too the importance of the lac operator in producing high induction ratios is not to be underestimated.

MoWestern_Davidson,2009,Team:MoWestern Davidson#notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," We discovered that there were several successful ligations. We are sending some clones for sequencing and will also digest them with SpeI and PstI so we can ligate our reporter downstream of this gene.
Week 10 (July 27-July 31)
Davidson team traveled to St. Joseph, MO to summarize our findings, create the wiki and decide what we need to do next.
While we were in Missouri, the team standardized the names and descriptions for our tRNAs and 5mers. We also finalized and entered all clones into Registry at MIT and the GCAT-alog of frozen stocks .
In addition, we came up with our theme, and wiki design.
We also brainstormed some designs for the final construct. Some of the ideas were to use one promoter (pLac) followed by RBS and the reporter and then the tRNA. Another idea, which we thought was better, was to contruct pBad-tRNA upstream of pLac-RBS-reporter (or downstream of the reporter). We did not want to use pLac as the promoter for tRNA because we assumed that being a strong promoter, pLac may cause fatal overexpression of the tRNA. Instead, we used pBad as the promoter.
This same week in Missouri, our team also received sequencing back of the promoter-RBS and of the complete constructs from the previous week. We discovered that what we had assumed to be the pLac-RBS, was actually pLac-pTet. Somewhere along the way, a mistake was made in the ligation. We realized this was the reason we were not getting expression of our reporter.
On the other hand, most of the pBad-tRNAs constructs were correct.
One of our members, Olivia, was working one more week by herself and she completed the final constructs for the summer.
We had to make a poster for the poster session on campus in early September.
Several members on both campuses decided to continue trying to build the full constructs during the semester. Their findings are described below.
Fall Semester
This Semester's work:
1) We started with the pBad Promoter
Initially started with weaker promoter because we did not want to flood cells with suppressor tRNAs.
Concerned about lethality and binding of suppressor tRNAs to non-target mRNAs.
2) pBad results
1 out of 5 clones gave visible fluorescence
A second clone produced detectable fluorescence by fluorometer
3) We switched to a stronger promoter: pTet
We hypothesized that stronger pTet promoter would increase suppression"

User Study
Goal
User studies are carried out to make our software “Easy BBK” to be more user-friendly. Based on the problems exposed in the test process of different users and their feedbacks, our developers can track the bugs and add new functions in the development of software.
Users
9 members from SJTU-bioX-Shanghai and some members from SUSTC-Shenzhen were invited to use our software. All of their operations are recorded in video and researched later to figure out problems or highlights in our software.
Highlights and problems fixed
Since we have focused mainly on the problems in our software during those studies, highlights are briefly recorded here.
• The search result offered by the search engine are quite satisfying
• Novelty of ""Present""
Most problems identified during user studies were solved before wiki freezes; however, there remains some problems unsolved. Those problems which are not solved now are to be solved later, and we will continue conducting user studies to refine our software.
Problems solved by October 17th

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html,", experts tend to see the necessity of these considerations. This report will not describe into detail why these social and ethical reflections are said to be necessary; rather, it will describe what has been stated in literature on the ethical and social challenges in modern literature, which questions and values are considered and how this applies to the emerging field of synthetic biology.
To do this, this chapter will start by describing what is meant by “synthetic biology”. Thereafter, the risks associated with synthetic biology will be mentioned. Hereafter, the implications and implicit assumptions made in synthetic biology research will be explored. Subsequently the relation between constructive biotechnology in an open source setting and intellectual property rights will be discussed, followed by a brief prospective on synthetic biology.
3.11 Summary
Synthetic biology comes with a number of new issues in terms of risks and ethics. But first, which research falls under the “synthetic biology banner” remains unclear. In this report it will be used as a term that encompasses constructing and deonstrucging biological processes of life, in different gradations of naturalness or artificialness. This extreme form of genetic engineering also gives extreme controle over certain (unicellular) organisms. The modern technology used in an open source setting in the iGEM project poses additional questions, e.g.: how synthetic can biology be; which implicit assumptions do we make in participating in iGEM, which ethical considerations play a role; how do iGEM and intellectual property relate; how is synthetic biology presented in the media, is it just another hype? No decisive answers were given in this chapter, just some major considerations. The next chapter investigates the participant’s opinions on the issues that were mentioned in this chapter. Also the design process in iGEM is investigated.
3.1 A definition of “Synthetic Biology”: a discourse in semantics?
Stakeholders in synthetic biology do not use a single definition of synthetic biology. Therefore, the boundaries of the scientific area that can be called “synthetic biology” are also not 100% clear. In this report the moral values related to the technology are described without defining into detail what is meant by “synthetic biology”. Further, the used technologies that converge in synthetic biology are also not very clearly defined. E.g., what is meant exactly by industrial biotechnology, nanotechnology, nanobiotechnology, etc., is also not clearly described. To give an impression of what synthetic biology involves, several definitions as defined by different stakeholders are given below.

Popularization
This year, IGEM Bordeaux took a particular interest in talking with people about synthetic biology and Genetically modified organisms. You'll find in this section a preview of what we did this year
Cap Sciences
Cap sciences is an animations center in Bordeaux open to all which try to help people discover and understand scientific phenomenons, new technologies and their industrial applications. They try to make science accessible to everyone and to engage a large variety of people  in scientific activities (most commonly people which are interested by sciences in general). They were glad to hear about our project and we have been in contact with them all throughout the year, presenting what we've done on popularization.
During the first meeting on the 17th of December, we created the group ImagineLife composed by iGEM team members and other people interested by sciences.
We talked about how we can explain synthetic biology to non-scientific people. After a long discussion, we were agreed to do a survey about synthetic biology to find out:
✵ What people already know / don't know about this field
✵ What what scares them
✵ What do they believe that synthetic biology can do for them
With the results of this survey, we hoped to have a better overview of the situation and be able to explain synthetic biology in simple terms to the general public.
So we worked on a survey, and interviewed people in the streets. Emilie, Charlotte, Hiba, Caroline, Gilles and Diego spent a few afternoons in the streets of Bordeaux trying to get in contact with walkers.
These conversations thought us that in Bordeaux the main concern about GMO's is that people are unaware about what they really are and the possibilities that synthetic biology offer us. Furthermore it made us start to realize the importance of scientific communication and for the need to think about our project from an ethical and safety point of view. For more information on the questions we asked ourselves please see the Ethics page! Then we have presented our work during the next meeting, on the 20 of February. Below is a link to the presentation of our interviews and the pdf of the questions we asked. We apologize in advance that the video is in french but you can find the subtitles in"

Introduction
In our project, multiple transistor elements are assembled to create logic gates. We envision the chaining of such gates in order to create complex logic circuits within cells. Predicting the behavior of these complex cascades of reactions and way they reach a stationary state can be challenging.  Modeling here represents the best way to understand our system and quantify the influence of various biochemical parameters. On the long run, modeling may also help fine-tune the design of biological systems and wet lab experiments.
Since the wet lab is normally accessible only during the summer, the time available for experiments during the iGEM competition is very limited. Our team were able to build a solid proof of concept of a new way of building logic circuits using dCas9, but creating a whole complex circuit would require more time. However, a good model (tuned on the experiment we performed for single transistors) allows the design and the study of complex circuits in silico.
We attempted to model the dynamics of our system's components to predict the temporal response of our biological circuits. In order to achieve a good description we initially used the powerful tools of statistical mechanics in order to generalize Hill's description of ligand-receptor binding [1] taking into account a possible interaction between two dCas9 binding to the same promoter. This statistical view of regulatory dynamic is then used, following the same steps of the simple ligand-receptor binding, to write kinetic equations.
Kinetic equations forms a system of ODEs which is solved numerically and fitted to some experimental data, in order to describe the actual dynamic of the system. We found that our model considered at the steady state is able to satisfactory describe experimental results and can be used to predict the output of complex logic circuits.
dCas9 binding models
In the following text we will often call dCas9 our dCas9 protein fused with the RNA polymerase recruiting unit. This unit is called \(omega\) in E."
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," it. The problem is costly with an estimated billion pounds a year spent on treating resistant infections by the NHS alone; globally, resistance presents a cost of trillions.
Over recent years, there has been a shift from developing new antibiotic compounds to considering targeted solutions to the most subborn cases of antibiotic resistance. This new focus is made possible by new technologies in synthetic biology. This is an emerging science that utilises genetic engineering and molecular cloning. The purpose is to genetically modify bacteria in order to use them as functional agents. The applications are diverse; modified bacteria could be used to detect cancer cells inside the body or provide targeted drug delivery.
Our project involves using E. coli to target the main causes of UTIs, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogenic E. coli, both of which form an antibiotic resistant film inside the urinary tract. Our bacteria sense specific molecules secreted by these bacteria and, upon doing so, release therapeutic agents that disperse the biofilm and subsequently kill the bacteria. Our project represents a more complete method of treating the infection. A biofilm provides resistance to antibiotics due to its composition. As such, the use of biofilm dispersing agents removes the bacteria's defences ensuring the entire population is destroyed. In contrast to conventional antibiotics, this reduces the chance of a few bacteria surviving due to resistance and so removes the risk of repeat infections.
WHAT'S UP? 20/08/15
With just four weeks to go, our project is entering its final phase, yet there's still plenty of work to be done. The team is now concentrated on characterisation, our biobricks are ready to be sent, and we are currently analysing the interlab data. Characterisation involves a number of key areas. The first stage was to carry out toxicity assays, which allow us to determine if our secreted products are toxic to our modified cells. Overall expression has been largely non toxic to the bacteria which is a big success. The next major challenge has been to determine whether the bacteria are successfully secreting our therapeutic molecules. We have used three secretion systems and, at present, one has been confirmed, with the other two being tested currently. Our other main line of experimentation is to determine the effects of our products on biofilms. In order to ensure safety, we are using a closely related, but non-pathogenic, form of pseudomonas.
Now that our wiki is ready, we can begin the process of putting our data in its completed form, ready for the jamboree. At the moment, our wiki has our project outline and modelling data with more content to follow soon."

Each gene list was determined in a variety of ways and there results show very little consistency.  The number of genes from each source varies greatly.  When the lists are compared to one another, there is very little overlap noted.  Please see below:
Venn Diagram of the Number of Essential Genes Shared Between Lists in the Literature
The maximum number of genes in common between any two literature lists is 205, which is between Baba et al 2006 and Gerdes et al 2003. Only 48 genes were present in all four lists.  The lack of consensus between these literature lists makes it very unreliable to use these genes in an essential genome.  Still, these lists provide an important foundation for basic components that are required in an essential genome list.

Cadmium Contamination Effects on Humans
The main issues with cadmium getting into waterways and food supplies are the affects that it will have on the people who ingest it. The effects of cadmium poisoning can be devastating as it is a known carcinogen and can consequently lead to death if ingested in large quantities. The other l effects of cadmium ingestion include:
Gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, salivation, abdominal pain, cramps and diarrhoea[1]
Anaemia due to the cadmium resulting in a lower level of iron intake in the gastrointestinal region, this is especially problematic if the affected individual already has low levels of iron intake in their diet[2]
Kidney damage is a common symptom of cadmium toxicity which further leads to a decrease in production of vitamin D[3]
Osteomalacis and osteoporosis both of which lead sufferers to have increased chance of bone fractures and lower bone density [4]. This may be as a result of the kidney damage giving way to decreased levels of vitamin D. [5]

On Thursday October 12 we worked at the Musée des Arts et Métiers (The Museum of Arts and Trades, emblematic as the                 cradle of French engineering). We  presented different applications of synthetic biology tools.                 We had 2 groups of 4 girls in the 10th grade. These were very interested and returned with knowledge                 and the desire to learn more!
The next day we went to the University of Orsay, also famous for its historical standing science.                     There, we met two classes of science-track high school seniors. During our presentation we played a synthetic                     biology card game with them to show that science is a matter of creativity, ideas, and the desire to innovate in                     particular. Based on current problems, students had to propose a solution (a “mini iGEM project”) with a chosen organism                     and the functionalities they could give them. A few students gave some funny solutions that might be tomorrow's innovations.                     It was very interesting to discuss with students and have their point of view. They were interested in our project and asked                     many questions about synthetic biology and its limits.
The Softer Shock iGEM special week
Another way we communicated about our project was to organise an entire week of iGEM events in our school.
We decided to organise an iGEM week from 05/08/17 to 05/12/17 to promote our project, sell home made food, and invite           people to look at our softer shock project.
It worked very well and when students came for food they asked about our project: Why did we choose this name?           What is the goal of this competition? What is the main purpose of Softer Shock? They were interested in our specific           project but also in the larger iGEM competition.
We also had a conference with few third year students at our school, who are interested in taking part in the iGEM           competition next year.
We asked them to produce a video describing a previous iGEM project in an entertaining way. The winning team got             free tickets to the prom!
Here is the link of the winner's video.
Bravo to this team, they all enjoyed participating in the activity and had a few ideas for next year's competition.
Finally, some pledges were organised to challenge students with biology. One of the funniest was to disguise one               person from each of the student unions (Sharkomère and Western Shot)  as a bacter"

Gel Extraction of DNA
1. Cut off the Single goal DNA band from the gel put it into the clean centrifuge tube and weigh. 2. Add same volume of Buffer PN more than the gel slice (0.1 g gel account for 100 μl). Incubate the mixture at 50 ℃ for 10  min until the gel has completely melted. 3.Place a column CA2 in a provided 2 ml collection tube. Add 500 μl Buffer BL to the CA2 column, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. Discard liquid and place the TIANGEN DNA column back into the same collection tube. 4. Place a column CA2 in a provided 2 ml collection tube. Add the mixture in last step to the column CA2, and place it at 4 ℃ temperature for 8-10 min,then centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min . Discard liquid and repeat the former step. 5. Add 600 μl Buffer PW into the column CA2 and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1min. Pour out liquid and repeat the former step once. Attention: Buffer PW have to be diluted with absolute ethanol and store at 4 ℃. 6. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Dry the column. 7. Add 50 μl Buffer EB directly into the middle of the column membrane and place it at 60 ℃ temperature for 15 min. Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000"
