A Modular Approach to Constructing the Circuit
The general layout of our limiter circuit is very amenable to variation.  Each of the logical roles can be filled by a number of different parts, possibly resulting in different behavior.  This process was made especially straightforward by the modular transcriptional control elements at our disposal.  Work with these transcription factors in the Silver Lab at Harvard showed that they show efficacy in regulating a variety of promoters, including the minimal mCYC1 and the inducible pGAL1.  To extend this work further, we have constructed a library of regulable promoters for use in our network, ligating binding sites for the synthetic transcription factors onto a variety of yeast promoters.
Regulatory Regions
Minimal Promoters
mCYC was used as a minimal promoter, with all transcriptional induction and repression coming from transcription factors binding to sites ligated upstream.  We generated a variety of minimal promoters for use in the limiter system, with mCYC ligated to each of the four sets of binding sites, and three variations on mCYC ligated to two different sets of binding sites.  These will allow for construction of multiple variations on the limiter circuit.
Constitutive Promoters
In a limiter circuit with a static threshold, the Thresh. promoter above is constitutive, but also requires regulation from alpha.  To investigate the effect of changing the threshold, we ligated binding sites onto two constitutive promoters: the high-level TEF2, and the low-level ADH1.
Repressable Promoters
Work in the Silver Lab has shown success in using binding sites to regulate inducible promoters.  We have constructed two versions of the MET25 repressable promoter with binding sites, hoping to construct a limiter circuit in which we can set the threshold by varying the input concentration of"

T-Shirts
The Front of our Tshirt.
The Back of our Tshirt.
Team Newcastle have created their t-shirts. You should be able to recognise us easily at the Jamboree.
Design
Initial iterations of the design were being created throughout the summer. During July we decided on purple shirts. Our designs were in part influenced by Football (""Soccer"") shirts. We have had 15 shirts made, with most of them being personalised with our names on the reverse side.
Front
The front of our t-shirt contains a large version of our team logo in the centre. Traditionally on a football shirt this is where a sponsor logo would go, but as we have more than one sponsor, we decided to collect the sponsor logos together and put them at the bottom of the front of our shirt. Like a football shirt, we have put our university crest at the top on the right.
Back
On the back of our t-shirt contains the number '09' in the place that a football shirt would have a squad number. 09 represents the year, 2009. At the top of the back of our t-shirt we will each have our name; making our shirts personalised. This again is a football reference. Surrounding the number 09 is a representation of an imaginary plasmid, which contains the names of all of the genes that we have been using in our project.
T-shirt shopping trip
On the morning of 10 September, the students took some time out of the lab to visit t-shirt printing companies. The first company which we visited was located in Newcastle city centre,"

This year, iGEM IIT Delhi went a step further in its quest to promote collaboration among the diverse enthusiasts of synthetic biology and to spread awareness about the emerging field of biological engineering and genetics.
We participated in iBEC, a competition organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, and emerged as the winners with a reward of 10 lakh rupees. The foundation for this mini-iGEM competition was laid by iGEM IIT Delhi.
We underwent collaboration with iGEM IIT Kharagpur on their project. The 2016 kit plates had not yet arrived and they needed certain parts which were available with us in previous year’s kit plates. We sent them these parts so that they could begin working on their project. This proved to be a crucial headstart for them and they have attributed us for the same on their Wikipedia Page.
We also collaborated with iGEM Glasgow on their project wherein they needed reports and findings on deficiency of Vitamin A. A survey (https://goo.gl/forms/xg9LuUXzCtD5iN8g1) on Vitamin A intake was conducted and publicised through social media platforms, messengers and circulars. This survey was conducted on a very large scale and invited responses from over 700 Indians. Their responses were evaluated and analysed and we reached the conclusion that Indian people mainly suffer from deficiency of Vitamin A due to insufficient consumption of carrots, fish and meat. After the survey, we came up with a message on IITD On Air describing the benefits of Vitamin A. All the findings and our analysis was reported to iGEM Glasgow and we hope it helped them in their project.
A PhD student, Mr. Mahendra Sahare, doing a humanities project under a Supreme Court lawyer, Dr. Naveen Thayyil, has been in collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi for the past two years. Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. Also, on his recent visit to IISER Mohali, he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali and help in the establishment of iGEM club there. On our return from the Giant Jamboree, we have a presentation scheduled there. Below is the screenshot of the e-mail showing the confirmation of the visit.
Loreal India also approached us for expert consultation regarding drug synthesis (production of opiods).

Wheat Germ DNA Extraction
Cynthia Morton, the associate curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, brought The Wheat Germ DNA extraction to our attention due to her routine usage of the lab. Seeing it as an experiment that can be done with a younger crowd, the CMU iGEM team worked on improving this lab using dyes to better see the DNA that precipitates into the isopropyl alcohol. The IvyTech iGEM team from Indiana, USA helped us achieve this by beta testing and figuring out the exact concentration needed for the optimal result. Thanks to their collaboration, this experiment was able to prosper and receive its own spot in the SynBio Educational Series, along with its routine usage in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History at outreach events.
Future Impact: The wheat germ DNA extraction allows for a younger group to perform the experiment without getting too messy. Cynthia Morton regularly guides this lab at the Carnegie Museum for Natural History with a crowd of about 500 community members (mainly kids) every other month. The iGEM- improved experiment will start to be used by November at the museum and we hope that it reaches a large crowd at its colorful debut and every other month afterwards. Once again, DNAZone will be offering the wheat germ DNA extraction as an alternative kit to the strawberry DNA extraction for teachers to borrow.

yhjH
This gene codes for a phosphodiesterase which reduces the levels of c-di-GMP that are involved in cell motility (Ko and Park, 2000). The protein YcgR is able to bind c-di-GMP and act as a flagellar brake which consequently reduces motility (Paul et al. 2010). The mechanism that we would like to exploit is illustrated in Figure 5. Overexpression of yhjH should therefore result in lower levels of c-di-GMP and increase E. coli's speed by diminishing the ability of YcgR to act as a brake on the flagellum. The second messenger c-di-GMP furthermore plays a role in the regulation of biofilm development. Expression of yhjH on the other hand represses biofilm formation (Suzuki et al. 2006) which could also serve our purposes and induce swimming motility.
Fig. 5: The yhjH gene encodes for a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. The substrate, c-di-GMP, is a second messenger that binds to YcgR, a protein that functions as a flagellar brake and thus down-regulates the motor (A). We suggest that the overexpression of yhjH results in increased c-di-GMP degradation and hence in narrowed braking force. Due to a stronger rotation of the flagellum higher motility could be achieved (B).

Fig. 6: BL21 E. coli carrying different constructs on Tryptone swimming agar after 12h incubation at 33°C. Cells expressing yhjH in puc18 under the natural promoter travelled approximately 0.5cm (radius) whereas no swimming could be detected for the control plasmid carrying K777125 .
Results:
Expression of yhjH under its natural promoter in puc18 increased motility in almost all of our assays on LB or Tryptone swimming agar (Fig. 4 & Fig. 6). Not only were the yhjH expressing strains among the fastest on these swimming agar plates but also usually the first colonies to start swimming. This might be an indicator that indeed biofilm formation was inhibited and the E. coli were able to spread faster. Compared to our other tested constructs we got the most reliable results for yhjH. However the positive effect on motility was"

As shown in Figure.5, bacterial colonies were counted in order to determine whether absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements.
It is evident that the promoter of the Device 1 is strongest followed by the promoter of the Device 2 and Device 3. Additionally, CFUs could not replace the lab measurement because bacterial colonies was so crowded that it was impossible to count precisely by Promega Colony Counter.

BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,": the Fluid Functionality Checklist. This fluid functionality system was broken up into two portions: a qualitative checklist and a quantitative analysis.
Qualitative Checklist | Dylan, Sarah, and Dinithi
The qualitative portion of the fluid functionality checklist consists of various failure modes. These are visual cues that something has gone wrong while running a chip, such as liquid leaking out of a channel or primitive. If a chip passes each of these qualitative checks, it is deemed “fluid functional.” If a chip does not pass each of these qualitative checks, the user moves to the quantitative analysis to determine why the chip failed.
Quantitative Analysis | Dylan and Sarah
The quantitative portion of the fluid functionality checklist consists of various quantitative analyses. Two forms of analysis are included in this portion of our evaluation system: physics-based primitive analysis and image processing-based analysis. Physics based analysis helps to determine if a qualitative failure occurred because the incorrect primitive dimensions and/or flow rate were used. Image processing analysis is used to evaluate the functionality of primitives such as mixers. Using these analyses, a user can both determine why their chip failed and evaluate the functionality of key primitives.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," transmitted by sender cells. When modification and retransmission are induced, there is a risk that secondary receivers might still be overwhelmed with Mori, preventing them from receiving the modified message (M-mod¬). This could result from the following modes of failure:
The majority of secondary receivers become infected with Mori during the lag time between Mori and Mmod production.
M¬ori is present in the system first, since Mmod must be produced from Mori.
There is an additional lag in Mmod production caused by the “turnaround time” between receipt of a DNA message and accumulation of copy number and protein concentration that can fuel packaging and transmission of the modified message
Inefficiency of production of Mmod vs Mori due to genomic tinkering keeps concentration of Mmod low compare to Mori.
We have picked apart the M13 genome in order to allow control over production of viral particles in primary receivers. This may result in lowered efficiency of particle production in primary receivers compared to senders.
2. False positive: When retransmission and modification are not induced, basal expression of integrase due to promoter leakiness may cause unwanted flipping of the switch, producing Mmod and leading to retransmission. Since a switch holds state after flipping, such an error would be irreversible. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the resulting unwanted message transmission would spread to other cells. Such amplification of error could make the system effectively constitutive, even though an inducible promoter is employed.
Questioning our Model
Our goal in modeling is model-based design. We would like to use our model to guide design choices and direct lab efforts. Before producing the model, we made the following list of questions on which we hoped the model would shed light. In each case, the measure of system performance is the ratio of secondary receivers that receive Mmod vs Mori:
What is the sensitivity to reduced viral particle production efficiency in primary receivers, leading to weaker transmission of Mmod?
How does the ratio of initial populations (senders : primary receivers : secondary receivers) affect the output of the system?
What is the sensitivity to basal (uninduced) expression of integrase in primary receivers, leading to unwanted modification and retransmission, especially given amplification of error through retransmission?
To cut to the chase, skip to the “conclusions” section! If you like details, keep reading here.
Model Construction
We used the following set of state variables and parameters to model the spread of Mori and Mmod through the co-cultured populations:

We also made an assumption that using EGFP to do homologous recombination with Fus1 behind fus1 promoter in yeast genome, the EGFP would be integrated into the genome and eliminate the differences of the copy number between each yeast. What’s more, the reporter gene will not be lost and can be inherited steadily. Besides, more promoter can be tried, such as fus2, fig1 promoter [5], from them we can compare their intensity and choose an appropriate one.

The results showed that PhaJ was being expressed for our pET29b(+)-phaCJ construct in the insoluble phase. After trouble-shooting our experiment, we decided that the cells were not fully lysed because our insoluble proteins samples were stringy, indicating that the cell membrane was still intact for some cells. Therefore, we decided to modify the SDS-PAGE protocol by adding a sonication step after the 15 minutes incubation of cells resuspended in STET buffer and lysozyme.
We performed another SDS-PAGE with another batch of overnight cultures containing the same vectors. We sonicated the samples five times; we sonicated for 5 seconds and cooled the sample for 5 seconds on ice each time. In addition, we also decided to resuspend the insoluble protein after the soluble portion was separated in 100uL of Tris-glycine running buffer instead of the 50uL outlined on the original SDS-PAGE protocol. The results of this SDS-PAGE experiment are shown below.

NEB Color Prestained Protein Standard, Broad Range (11–245 kDa) was used as the protein marker. The gels were run for 45 minutes at 300V.

German MeetUp
Dresden
We participated in the iGEM german-wide meetup from 30.06. to 02.07.2017 in Dresden    and had a great chance on getting to know nine other participating iGEM teams, their projects, people and the beautiful city of Dresden.
From 30.06. to 02.07.2017, three of our team members -- Hannah, Maximilian    and Benedikt --attended the iGEM German-wide meetup in Dresden. Overall ten teams    from Germany participated and introduced    their projects to each other while having an opportunity to find collaboration    partners and spent time together.     On Friday, we arrived in Dresden and the whole meetup started with    participating in several funny “ice breaking games”    as well as joining a local party of the TU Dresden.
The teams presented their individual talks on Saturday. This was a great    opportunity to present our project to other teams. We joined many interesting    talks about the several iGEM projects afterwards. Also, a guest talk was given    by a representative from PROMEGA. Hannah was lucky enough to win a special goody    bag for scientists.     After the talk session, we were going on a sightseeing tour with    the fantastic tour guides from the Dresden team. Getting to know the city    of Dresden was really great.
A great tortilla party at the Biological institute was organized by    the Dresden team, giving us a great time and many new connections to the other iGEM    teams. Afterwards we went playing pool billiard at local pubs with a reduced number    of members from different iGEM teams. It was great fun.
On Sunday, an interesting talk was given by Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun,    who used to be an old iGEM advisor. He presented some of his supervised and very    interesting iGEM projects of Dresden.
Then the Dresden team offered some workshops for us: e.g. a speed-dating    for iGEM collaborations and a workshop for the “iGEM goes green”-initiative, introduced    by the iGEM team Dresden. Again we had a great time and learned many things about the carbon    footprint of the everyday lab work. Please visit the website of this beautiful project to learn     more about"

The Third Generation Fuel Cell
The fuel cell consists of six plastic parts. The overall design is similar to 2nd generation cell, but the frames are split up into two parts each. This allows for the carbon electrodes to be mounted between two frames, as was already the case for the membrane before. This ensures the fragile carbon cloth is fixed in the center of each chamber and can be tapped by squeezing a wire between the gaskets. Since the material is highly porous, bacteria and medium can diffuse through the electrode and travel between both halves of a single chamber.
The second important change from the previous design is the introduction of four tube connectors on each frame. This allows aeration of the anode chamber with nitrogen gas and, e.g., introducing fresh medium in the system. The copper wire connecting the electrodes is replaced with platinum, because of the rapid copper-oxidation, resulting in a decreased conductivity.
Dimensions per chamber:
height: 50 mm
width: 50 mm
depth: 12 mm
volume: 30 mL

The black squares represent the electrodes, the proton exchange membrane is located in the middle. This design allows for nitrogen aeration and easy refilling of the cell through the tube connectors at the bottom of each compartment. The compartments have been split into two parts each, which makes mounting of the electrodes much easier. Click picture to view animation.

This modified model of the 3rd generation fuel cell was designed and constructed to enable the use of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode . The power output was also increased, as well as the ability to maintain it for a long time. To fit the reference electrode inside the chambers, the outer frames of both chambers are thicker, 10 mm acrylic glass plates. In addition to tube connectors of the third generation fuel cell 5 mm fittings for the reference electrode SE11 were added. Beside these technical changes the aeration with nitrogen was increased in comparison to previous experiments. This was to compensate the increased distance between the bacteria and the"

Overview
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
Beyond the technical work on the lab, we comprehend our project exists within a world that requires us exploring aspects that involve issues such as ethics, sustainability, safety, legal framework, security, between others. These issues are complex and approached only through our human practices. Being aware of this we engaged with the communities that might be impacted by our work to invite them to shape the course of our investigation.
These social considerations were upfront in our project and integrated with the design and execution of our project, impacting in our Entrepreneurship, Wet lab, and Mathematical model work. We aimed to develop a thoughtful project with inspiring Human Practices for other teams to build upon and come up with new and creative approaches for this section, striving not only to understand how the world affects our project but also aiming to contribute to how synthetic biology is understood and practiced around the world.
Social Science Research Description
Since our Human practices involved interacting with communities to understand the social concern we are addressing, it was essential for us to approach these communities correctly by getting informed on our institution and national guidelines. This way we were able to conduct our social science research respectfully and always looking after the well-being of our cooperators.
The Mexican National Guidelines for integration and operation of the Research Ethics Committee (REC) declare the inclusion of ethical aspects as a quality indicator in social science research. The development of a bioethic culture is favorable to guarantee individual and social well-being since the discipline promotes the concepts of equity, solidarity, quality, principles of benefit, no maleficence, as well as the protection of human rights.1
Human subjects research entails risks; this makes it necessary to guarantee ethically acceptable conditions in the production of knowledge, considering that the legal framework is not sufficient to elucidate or resolve conflicts of a moral or ethical nature that arise in scientific activity.1
To protect our contributor’s human rights, respect their dignity and privacy, avoid any form of discrimination as well as ensure their integrity and wellness, we took"

As a control, HEK293 cells were also transiently transfected with carrying the original CMV promoter, submitted by the team Freiburg in 2012, followed by the EGFP reporter.
Fig.16 EGFP signal under the control of CMV promotor
Fig.17 EGFP signal under the regulate of HRE in normoxia situation
Fig.18 EGFP signal under the regulate of HRE in hypoxia situation
Under normoxia condition, we observed weaker green fluorescence under the control of HRE, the hypoxia responsive promotor, than that under the control of the original CMV promoter. Moreover, under the control of HRE, more cells exhibited green fluorescence under hypoxia condition than under normoxia condition. The results suggested that our HRE is working.
Fig.19  Left：The transcription level of hypoxia responsive promotor under hypoxia and normoxia situation.
Right: The transcription level of hypoxia responsive CMV promotor and orginal CMV promoter under normoxia situation.
The overall florescent intensity under the control of HRE, however, were similar between hypoxia and normoxia conditions. After discussion, we thought there may be several issues in the model, i.e. slower growth of cells or weaker activity of EGFP under the hypoxia condition. Thus, we also measured expression of EGFP by real-time PCR. That data further proved that the HRE device worked as we expected, although not as strict. We believe we can improve this promotor and make it more sensitive in our future work."

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Abstract
BioBrick-A-Bot: Lego Robot for Automated BioBrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot
Commercial Liquid Handling Systems are extremely expensive, and are typically beyond the reach of the average molecular biologist interested in performing high throughput methods.  To address this problem, we design and implement a liquid handling system built from commonly accessible Legos. Our goal is the automation of BioBrick assembly on a platform that can itself be easily replicated and we demonstrate a proof-of-principle for this system by transferring colored dye solutions on a 96-well plate. We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build from 3 new LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.
Project Goals
Low Cost – Robot cost significantly lower than $10,000, the price of a commercial liquid handling robot. (Actual cost of BioBrick-a-Bot prototype: ~$700)
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible.
Hardware Design that is easily replicable by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM teams.

All these strategies allow a rational design of an artificial compartment, which is fully engineerable regarding  the proteome, metabolome and the entire peroxisomal environment.
Design of yeast multi -knockout strains
The Crispr Cas9 System
The demands on yeast engineering have significantly increased with the design of more complex systems and extensive metabolic pathways. Genetic techniques that have historically relied on marker recycling are unable to keep up with the ambitions of synthetic biologists. In recent years the Crispr Cas9 system has been used for several strain-engineering purposes, including:
Markerless integration of multiple genetic cassettes into selected genomic loci
Multiplexed and iterative gene knockouts without the need to recycle a marker
Precise genome editing – nucleotide substitutions, etc.
We utilized the Cas9 system as a tool for peroxisomal engineering and have adopted the existing toolbox from (Lee et al. 2015) and the complete cloning system which also provides the possibilities for genome integration and gene editing by Cas9. For this, two oligonucleotides have to be designed for targeting the Cas protein to the gene of interest.
Figure 1: Plasmid construction for the gRNA expression plasmid
Two oligos, containing the targeting sequence of the gRNA, have to be annealed and can then be integrated in the gRNA entry Vector by a Golden Gate reaction. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
Several gRNA vectors can subsequently be assembled into one vector with a Cas9 expression cassette and then be transformed into yeast. The expression of Cas9 together with gene specific gRNA´s leads to double strand breakage followed by non-homologous end joining repair or homologous recombination, in case of added repair DNA (figure 3).
Figure 2: Plasmid construction for the expression plasmid containing Cas9 and gRNA´s
Vector for Cas9 and gRNA expression, assembled by a Golden Gate reaction, containing a URA marker, Cen6 yeast origin and a kanamycin resistance. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
The combination of the Cas9 system with DNA repair sequences enables not only knockouts of peroxisomal proteins, but also allows redirecting protein localization by changing protein targeting signals or integration of linear DNA into yeast chromosomes. Genome engineering facilitates yeast strain development for customized peroxisomes.

Modelling
Introduction
E.coli is a motile strain of bacteria, which is to say it can swim. It is able to do so by rotating its flagellum, which is a rotating tentacle like structure on the outside of cell.    Chemotaxis is the movement up concentration gradient of chemoattractants (i.e. malate in our project) and away from poisons. E.coli is too small to detect any concentration    gradient between the two ends of itself, and so they must randomly head in any direction and then compare the new chemoattractant concentration at new point to the previous    3-4s point. Its motion is described by ‘runs’ and ‘tumbles’, runs refer to a smooth, straight line movement for a number of seconds, while tumble referring to reorientation of     bacteria [1]. Chemoattractant increases transiently raise the probability of ‘tumble’ (or bias), and then a sensory adaptation process returns the bias to baseline, enabling the cell    to detect and respond to further concentration changes.  The response to a small step change in chemoattractant concentration in a spatially uniform environment increase the      response time occurs over a 2- to 4- s time span [2]. Saturating changes in chemoattractant can increase the response time to several minutes.
Many bacterial chemoreceptors belong to a family of transmemberane methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) [3]. Each chemoreceptors on the bacterium has a periplasmic binding domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain that communicates with the flagellar motors via a phosphorelay sequence involving the CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins. Modeling of this chemotaxis pathway in single cell is very important, as it will help us to determine, with certain numbers of chemoreceptors, the threshold of chemoattractant concentration where the bacterium is able to detect and the saturation level of chemoattractant where the all the receptors"

Fig. 1. A graphical representation of the approximation of Hill’s function by piecewise-linear function. (Polynikis et al., 2009)
Then, equation (14)-(16) are reduced into the following form:
Using linear algebra, we solved the approximated analytical solutions:
We then apply the analytical solutions into a Jacobian Matrix of the system of ODEs to assess the stability:
After computation, we obtained the following results:
Eigen-value \ Analytical solution
$\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\a\\0\end{pmatrix}$
$\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\0\\a\end{pmatrix}$

The result shows that all eigenvalues of the 3 solutions are smaller than 0, according to the criterion of Poincare-Perron Theorem, these three solutions are all stable equilibrium points only if $n\geq2$ and $a\geq1+\frac2n$.
(II) Phase Portrait
Another method can be adopted to analyse the system's stability is phase portrait. (P, 2009) In order to give a clear picture, we begin with the illustration of the phase portrait of a simpler yet similar system, bistable switch.
Fig. 2. Phase portrait of bistable switch (Principle of synthetic biology -- stability analysis.)
The arrows on the plot represent the vector fields of the system, which indicate the direction that the system tends to evolve to. Specifically speaking, a direction to which vector fields point tells where the system tends to approach; conversely, when vector field points away from certain region, that region is where the system does not tend to stay. On the other hand, as shown in figure 2, there are two functions namely nullclines which are obtained by setting $\frac{dx}{"

Results
Results of the sample were obtained at 6 timepoints and can be seen in figure 2. As can be seen, not all pictures where taken with the same settings of the fluorescence microscope. This was because other people had to use the device as well, in-between measurements settings might have been adjusted. Therefore the measurements needed to be normalized in order to be able to compare them.
Figure 2: 6 Fluorescence photos of the Dextran-based hydrogel containing GFP that diffuses overtime.
Using FIJI software (previously known as ImageJ) a longitudinal intensity plot of the hydrogel was made. This data was later processed in MATLAB to ensure the samples to have the same offset and also an equal scaling. The result of these steps can be seen in figure 3. As can be seen, the samples have the same offset outside the hydrogel (0-0.1 mm). Also the plateaus of all samples, around 1mm were set to have the same intensity, because it was expected that this would not change throughout the experiment.
Figure 3: Averaged longitudinal sections of the fluorescence intensity of the experiment for different timesteps.
In figure 3 it can be seen that the measurement combined with the method of rescaling is reasonably accurate, since the measurement at 3 hours and 50 minutes is fairly equal to the measurement after 4 hours. While performing the experiment, it became clear that after more than 20 hours the gel suffered from dehydration, hence they should not be included in the determination of the effective diffusion constant. Also were the results not entirely what was expected, because the gel that was seeded did not illuminate homogeneously. It was therefore hard to process the data in order to obtain a diffusion constant.
Nevertheless this was tried for the samples taken after 0, 3:50, 4 and 20 hours, by looking at the behaviour of the concentration indicated with red lines at figure 4. Behaviour of the concentration along this line overtime was investigated using COMSOL Multiphysics, by comparing simulations with the results displayed in figure 4. From comparison with these simulations it became clear that the tortuosity of the hydrogel is between 1 and √1.5.

From the naked eye the slides appeared to be successful, the Gram stained slides were all purple and the spore  stain slides were completely pink, but they will be analyzed at a later date under a microscope.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
Unfortunately, we are having troubles biobricking lacZ. In the meantime we transformed B. subtilis again using primer product and got similar results.

Post sporulation and regeneration imaging
Michael Wilton, University of Calgary Health Sciences Campus, allowed us to use the microscope in his lab to  image the slide stains for the regenerated B. subtilis spores.  All of the slides gave desired results:
Gram stain:
All slides gave a purple colour, showing that the bacteria still behaves as a Gram-positive bacteria after  sporulation and regeneration.
Figure 10: B. subtilis post-sporulation Gram-stain.
Spore stain:
All slides showed vastly more pink cells compared to green spores.  This is good because it shows that the  regeneration of spores has a high efficiency even when the spores are only grown on LB at 37 °C overnight.
Figure 11: B. subtilis post-sporulation spore stain.
Treatment of spores
We wanted to test if the spores could still be regenerated and generate viable bacteria after the spores were subject to harsh conditions.  To do this, a collection of short term storage of spores (kept in distilled water at 4 ° C), and a collection of long term storage (kept in distilled water and frozen) were separated into five 0.5 mL tubes, one for each condition.  Each of these tubes was then centrifuged, for five minutes at 14 000 rpm,  so that the distilled water that the spores were suspended in could be removed before the spores were subjected to  each condition.  The chosen conditions were designed to subject the spores to a wide range of conditions, some of  which were chosen to simulate some of the conditions that the diagnostic tool might be subject to, such as excessive heat, while others were chosen to see what exactly the pores were able to survive through, such as chemical conditions.   The five chosen conditions were; 1% bleach, 70% ethanol, complete drying, heating at 60 ° C, and heating at 90 ° C.

Introduction
MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) is an essential component in both analog and digital circuits, serving as analog switches or micro-processors. Inspired by this idea, we built genetic circuit ""MOSFETs"" in animal T cells, which is Monitoring and Operating System Founded on Engineered T cells. We hope our system can serve as a sensitive bioswitch to real-time monitor the extracellular concentration of a certain antigen, and determine whether to activate the expression of a downstream protein according to the preset threshold. As we expect, it should make no response to low concentration, but have quite high sensitivity near the threshold. In order to achieve our goal, we introduced synNotch, TetR-TetO, recombinase and Recombination Directionality Factors (RDF)in our system.Our MOSFET can be divided into 4 devices, namely, signal detection, signal processing, signal output and system reset.
Signal Detection
SynNotch, an engineered transmembrane receptor, bridges intra- and extra-cellular information.
Synthetic Notch (SynNotch)[1]consists of three parts: the synthetic extracellular recognition domain (SynECD, e.g.scFv), the core transmembrane domain of wild Notch receptor[2], and the synthetic intracellular transcriptional domain (SynICyi5yD, e.g.SynTF). When the SynECD binds to its target surface antigen, induced cleavages take place on the core transmembrane domain of SynNotch, releasing the SynICD. The SynICD would be transported into the nucleus and activate the transcription of its corresponding gene.
SynNotch is an ideal platform for customized antigen sensing behavior.
SynNotch provides us an exciting platform because its SynECD and SynICD are both customizable. SynECD can be designed based on currently available scFvs for different tumors .SynICD will trigger customized output after SynECD recognition.

""Besides having to wear trousers in the lab, I really love the research here, so I decided to stay for my fourth year at UCL. As a biochemistry major, one of my favorite aspects of synthetic biology is its combination with other disciplines. I also love seeing how art can be combined with synthetic biology; from concrete crack sealing bacteria to DNA used for information storage, there are so many cool things that can be done. Even at school, I couldn't focus solely on sciences (I also studied English Lit). I find that this variety helps for keeping me aware of the world, and actually assists with creativity and keeping my brain active. This is especially true in the outreach work we are doing: iGEM involves reaching out to other engineers worldwide with different perspectives. -- indeed, the opinions of people of different fields, and how they perceive what I am doing with synbio, again, keep my mind aware of all the unique viewpoints we hold.""

Procedure
Day 1
Inoculate 1 colony from a fresh plate of the strain to be made electrocompetent into 5m: of LB in a 15mL falcon tube.
Incubate for 16-18 hours at 37°C and 250 rpm
Keep in the 37°C shaker overnight, make sure cap is on loosely and tape is securing cap to tube - this allows aeration of the cultures
Day 2
Have a 1L baffled flask containing 99mL LB ready. Add 1mL of the overnight culture.
Shake at 37°C and 250 rpm until the cultures reach an OD600 of 0.4-0.55.
Be sure to turn on centrifuge and cool rotor to 4°C well in advance of harvesting cells.
Be sure to place 1L 10% glycerol on ice well in advance of harvesting cells
Pour culture into 2 chilled 50mL falcon tubes.
Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Pour off the supernatant and aspirate any residual broth.
Add glycerol to the 50mL mark on each of the falcon tubes and completely suspend the cells by pipetting up and down.
Place cultures on ice for 6-10 minutes. From this point on the cultures must be kept ice cold.
Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. Pour off the supernatant and aspirate any residual broth.
Add glycerol to the 25mL mark on each of the falcon tubes and completely suspend the cells by pipetting up and down.
Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 min.
Pour off the supernatant and suspend the cells in the residual glycerol by pipetting up and down (there should be ~1-2mL per tube).
At this point you can electroporate or freeze the cells away.
Freezing cells
Add 100μL of the culture to microcentrifuge tubes on ice.
Once you have used all of the culture, transfer the tubes to dry ice for 10 minutes.
Once the cultures are frozen, transfer them to a -80°C freezer. The cultures should be good for 3 weeks.
Leaving the lab
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.

Several constructs were ligated. The mutated nptII (pCg13S) was ligated with TtrpC. Assembled bar in pSB1C3 and submitted for sequencing. The Gibson of hph into pSB1C3 was rerun. An experimental method of ligating crtY into pAK13D upstream of the T7 promoter was tried as an alternative to gel purification and PCR purification, since we lack the primers to PCR and gel purification interferes with ligation.

The nptII+TtrpC ligation was checked by doing a colony PCR on the ligation colonies and a subsequent gel. Possible gel outcomes were plasmid self ligation (200bp) in which TtrpC was randomly cut out of pC13Q, 800bp if the plasmid has only TtrpC, ~1kb indicating nptII noise from PCR template, and ~1.7 kb indicating successful construct formulation. The gel showed two bars at ~800bp, indicating a failed ligation. The third Gibson attempt of hph into pSB1C3 was also plated, and a 10mL culture was made of the successful nptII DpnI mutagenesis plate, evidently for future great justice.
The nptII ligation with TtrpC grew colonies was unsuccessful. In other news, much lab organization was done today!

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," yielding a false-positive output. However, insufficient data are available to accurately determine the model fit parameters. In addition, experimental validation is lacking. As such, it is possible that experimental work proves Cas13a to have increased off-target activity. We investigated what the effect of this would be on the reliability of the system, and subsequently propose methods to experimentally reduce the off-target probability.
We repeated the simulation for a higher energy gain for matches ($\Delta C=0.30$) and lower energy penalty for mismatches ($\Delta I=0.80$). In this situation, we find the off-target probability to be much higher than in our original simulations: $P_{FP}$ is 10 to 800 (Figure 7). It is now more intuitive to interpret $P_{FP}$ as the total number of false positives per true positive. Given a positive output, the probability of it being false is higher than 90% in all simulations. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions.
Figure 7: Number of false positive outputs (per true positive) for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. $P_{FP}$, now more intuitively interpreted as the total number of false positives per true positive, or relative signal strength, for crRNA 1-4 for the E. coli, S. aureus and S. epidermis genome and the Bos Taurus chromosome 27 ($\Delta C=0.30$, $\Delta I=0.85$). The large values indicate a false positive probability higher than 90% in all simulations (given a positive output).
In our simulations, we assume equal representation of all genomic sequences. In reality, only part of the sequences are transcribed and available in RNA, and of course in different quantities. We can correct for these effects by applying a mask over the genome which takes into account the amount of RNA transcripts for each position. Moreover, our simple sample preparation method for gene amplification (RPA) and in vitro transcription are able to specifically amplify a region of interest at least 452 times ( notebook of sample prep 15-08-2017). This amplification changes the ratio between true and false positive output probabilities (by the same factor of 452) in favour of on-targeting (Figure 8). We can incorporate this amplification factor in a generalized version of $P_{FP}$: $P_{FP}'$ and we call the amplification factor α:
$$ P_{FP}' = \frac{1}{1"

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Higher annealing PCR of 7/7 was successful: 394ng/ul of fairly pure DNA. Ran the product out on a gel, and observed a large band at 3kb, with two smaller bands further forward (probably primer-dimer/non specific amplification). Cut the 3kb band out, and ran it through the Epoch gel extraction kit according to manufacturer instructions. The extraction kit did not work (yield was 6ng/ul of highly impure DNA). Set up new linearizing PCR with the same DNA, primers, Q5, and thermocycler settings as 7/7. (JLG/AW)

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

To clear up common misunderstandings each participating team, including us, designed a postcard on a topic of synthetic biology. The card includes an eye catching picture on the front to spark interest in the topic and an explanatory text on the back.  This text explains the connection between the picture and synthetic biology. Of course you could not only learn something about synthetic biology but also share it by sending it to a friend! But sending each other post cards was not enough so  on 28.08 the iGEM team Düsseldorf invited us to join them on the “NRW-Tag” (NRW-day) in Düsseldorf. We took the opportunity to present our project together with team Aachen https://2016.igem.org/Team:Aachen and team Bonn http://2016.igembonn.com to the public.

We had the privilege to present in the “Haus der Universität” (house of the university) in Düsseldorf with a stage not only to present our project to the public but also to discuss it with the audience.
We faced the challenge of simplifying our rather complex project so that everyone could understand. Between the presentations we had a stall where we had the opportunity to talk to the people and get their feedback on our project. Afterwards, we had a meeting with team Düsseldorf where we talked about our projects, ideas and difficulties with which we were confronted. Furthermore, we exchanged advices, tricks and new ideas on how to improve each other’s project."

If the precaution is not taken, then catastrophe will occur
These conditions are quite strict, which limits the use of the maximin rule, e.g. it is rare that we have complete uncertainty (1) when discussing the Precautionary Principle. The problem is more often incomplete knowledge.
The minimax regret is originally an economic principle but has been proposed as an explication of the Precautionary Principle by Chrisholm and Clarke CHISHOLM, A. & CLARKE, H. 1993. Fair principles for sustainable development. Natural Resource Management and the Precautionary Principle (ed. Edward Dommen), Edward Elgar Publishing, 109-122. . The minimax regret helps finding what action (i.e. precaution or no precaution) in a given case that has the least difference between its result and the best possible result that could be obtained in the case. If there is no difference between the first action and its result and the best possible result, then there is no regret and it is therefore the action to choose. It can be clarified by showing in the two tables.
Table one.
Case 1
Case 2
Case 3
Precaution
Expenses that occur when implementing the precaution (e)
Expenses that occur when implementing the precaution (e)
Expenses that occur when implementing the precaution and catastrophe (e + c)
No precaution
Catastrophe (c)
No risk of catastrophe, but damage will occur (d)
Catastrophe (c)
If one then supposes that the catastrophe is more severe than the expenses, which then are more than the damage (If one sees it as absolute numbers of costs, then: c>e>d). Then the table with the regrets will look like this:
Table two.
Case 1
Case 2>
Case 3
Precaution
No regrets (0)
The amount of the difference between the expenses and the damage (e - d)
The amount of expenses (e)
No precaution
The amount of the difference between the catastrophe and expenses (c - e)
No regrets (0)
No regrets (0)
The recommendation will then be to select the action (i.e. precaution or no precaution) that has the smallest amount of regret in the case in question. Then, if we stick to the fixed"

Aim
- To share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school students.
Description
Our workshop targeted on future high school igem teams in Hong Kong. Prior to the sharing session, we got feedback that only a few high school students plan to join the iGEM in future. Our team was invited to teach them how to start an iGEM project.
We introduced a “Top-down Design” which is a common and easy method for high school students to brainstorm a project idea. We used the example of planning our summer vacation as a parallel comparison with the “Top-down Design” topic - building a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
Achievement
The students were appreciated by the concept and had a brief knowledge on project-designing. The teachers were really impressed by the workshop and had a strong interest in recruiting HKUST iGEM team to mentor and advise these students in the future.

Second attempt at EMW (October 9th and 10th)
Pictured is our community lab, where we poured the remainder of our plates. We created a batch of                     1.5% agar medium (see protocol) and began                     pouring them onto both the concentric and radial designs, in the 7’’ size. Overall, the main points                     of the protocol had already been outlined--the main task was adapting them for use in the Street Bio                     community lab.
Sterility in the community lab environment was dealt with as much as possible by meticulously                     disinfecting the materials. Medium, however, had to be made fresh every day as we had no autoclave                     or other sterile place to store it between work sessions. Problems we had not foreseen, however,                     included the inability to fit our 1L flask into the microwave, and resulted in the need to microwave                     the medium in smaller batches. The most major challenge that the community lab space brought was the                     fact that none of the work surfaces available were level, resulting in many issues when pouring such                     shallow plates and the need to avoid cross-contamination when agar was present on the tops of the                     section dividers.
The first two nights then, were full of several botched attempts to pour plates due to several of                     the above issues. Ultimately, with a combination of micropipettes and a fume hood, most of those                     concerns were eventually addressed.
Pouring for the Youth Science Initiative (October 10th and 12th)
Plates were finally successfully poured! On the first of these days, however, another issue was                     encountered, where the outermost ring of concentric design plates were leaking and unable to hold                     the liquid medium (see the hardware section--outermost rings were initially cut as two pieces in                     order to save space on the acrylic sheets). When possible, additional acrylic glue was used to                     reseal these dishes; if problems persisted, however, parafilm was then used to seal these areas.
After all the plates were poured, they were each sealed with parafilm and stored in the community                     lab fridge at 4°C until the first meeting of the Youth Science Initiative.
Below you can see photos from a 7th inch plate growing over four days.                     Inoculated on 12th October 12:30pm, first photo was taken 30 minutes after inoculation and                     second picture on the fourth day (16th October)

Mentoring a team initially sounded to be a little intimidating for us because we weren’t very experienced at mentoring teams. But it turned out to be a really great experience for our entire team, as we grew more comfortable with the IISER Mohali team. So much so, that we now are really confident about mentoring new teams and look forward to it in years to come.
IISER Mohali Team members were really awesome, we had a great time mentoring them and we wish them all the best for all their future endeavours in the field of Synthetic Biology.
It happened to be a Research Serendipity
Mr. Mahendra Sahare is a PhD student, doing a humanities project under a Supreme Court lawyer, Dr. Naveen Thayyil. He has been in collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi since 2015. Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. It was during his visit to IISER Mohali, that he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali. We took this opportunity to increase the culture of iGEM in India and wholeheartedly helped them in the establishment of an iGEM club at their Institute.
Talk with iGEM IIT Delhi
On our return from the Giant Jamboree 2016, our team members gave a presentation scheduled at IISER Mohali. Three members of our team, Kshitij Rai, Tarun Mahajan and Angad Chandel went to IISER Mohali to give a session on emergence of synthetic biology and our previous projects. We discussed"

In a study conducted by researchers in the region, they discovered that the people of Hong Kong were less keen on using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for medicinal than for nutritional purposes (Zhu & Xie, 2015).
This may be due to the  prevalence of traditional medicine in Hong Kong, which may cause a drift in public perception towards new methods of medicine.  16.7% of the Hong Kong surveyees were above the age of 50, the demographic of the population which is more familiar with and possibly inclined to traditional medical procedures. By contrast, 91% of the Australian surveyees were between the ages of 19 and 25, and this age group tends to be more familiar with western medicine than traditional medicine. This may explain why the survey results from Hong  Kong reflect a much smaller proportion of people who are completely receptive to the RIOT System as compared to Australia (12.5% for Hong Kong against 32.5% for the Australian survey), with reference to Figure 2.

ETHICS Of OUR PROJECT
ETHICS OF OUR PROJECT
The Lascaux caves since 1979 belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO. In 1946, representatives of 37 countries met in London to sign and enforce the Constitution UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), defining the concept of world heritage and establishing an initial list of this heritage. This concept is unique by its universal application. Indeed, the World Heritage sites belong to everyone, irrespective of the territory in which they are located. Places as amazing and diverse as the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil, the Pyramids of Egypt, Trogir historic town in Croatia are the heritage of our world.
Sphinx and Chephren-Pyramid , Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil) , Historic city of Trogir
Among the 1052 world treasures that need to be saved, the Lascaux cave and the impressive frescos by their number and aesthetic quality are listed since October 1979 (ICOMOS Recommendation). This prehistoric site is located in the French countryside. It includes 147 deposits dating from the Palaeolithic era and 25 decorated caves globally. There is no parietal cave in the world that matches it in terms of the quality and variety of the finds (skeletons, objects, flint, various utensils). The hunting scenes include 100 animal figures with amazing accuracy of observation, rich colors and lifelike quality. The site is particularly interesting from ethnological, anthropological and aesthetic point of views, marking a milestone in the history of prehistoric art and our human culture. Like the links of a long human chain, the Lascaux cave shows to future generations a work executed by ancient men. In order to preserve this chain, it is our duty to best protect this legacy. Indeed, the walls of the cave are partially and gradually covered with black and white mushrooms that hide the frescoes.

Why save art?
Art is a paradox in itself. Indeed, at the time of the Renaissance, an interesting definition of art appears: it is a disinterested and free activity, pleasant in itself, having no utility for production. But if art is aimless, why of all times, men made art and attempted to protect it?
In other words, is it really necessary to save art"

Our Sensor
The goal of our project is to design a biosensor to rapidly identify cattle known as super shedders. Super shedders are cattle that excrete extremely large numbers of E.coli O157:H7 a subgroup of E. coli referred to as Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). EHEC organisms produce a toxin called Shiga toxin or verotoxin. This toxin binds to renal cells and lyses them, resulting in hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans and can be deadly. Supershedders excrete more than 104 colony forming units of E. coli O157:H7 in every gram of their feces and can contaminate other cattle in the same holding pen as well as the meat downstream. Super-shedders are thought to be the reason for 95% of the E. coli O157:H7 contamination in the industry.
We are building a DNA-based biosensor, as it is more reliable and cheaper than a protein-based sensor; antibodies are expensive and the proteins that they target can get degraded during the sample preparation, whereas DNA is much more stable. A DNA-based sensor also enabled us to target a broader range of harmful E.coli. Our sensor is specific to shiga toxin (stx2) gene, present not only in E.coli O157:H7, but other EHEC strains as well. This means our detector will not only be specific to one specific strain of EHEC, but instead target a broad group of EHEC organisms.

EcoRI has 12 u/uL while SpeI has 10 u/uL.  For future reference, XbaI has 12 u/uL, PstI has 10 u/uL, and NotI has 10 u/uL.
For 10 ug of DNA, one will need 1 uL of SpeI and 0.83 uL of EcoRI.
For Z0842, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 1.657 ug of DNA.  This would require 1.657 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.127 uL of EcoRI and 0.1526 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
For Z0279, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 4.150 ug of DNA.  This would require 4.150 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.346 uL of EcoRI and 0.415 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
For pRS306, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to give 5.103 ug of DNA.  This would require 5.103 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.425 uL of EcoRI and 0.510 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  This will yield a 50 uL reaction.
It should be noted that EcoRI has star activity in the presence of multicore buffer so the restriction digest should not proceed for too long.  Placed in incubator for 1 hour then denatured enzymes on heat block at 70 degrees for 10 min.  Put in freezer in preparation for next step tomorrow.
Decided to postpone the linearization reactions until tomorrow since we were lacking BstEII.

Main sponsors:"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," collaboration of industry, academia, and governments. From our conversations with those not in the scientific community, we found that biosafety and biocontainment was a major concern, which included the potential pathogenicity of our genetically engineered bacteria.
Scientific
We also spoke with Dr. Juan Robalino, a researcher tackling the problem of Panama Disease, about our project, and we discussed the regulatory hurdles of conducting synthetic biology overseas. He is from Ecuador, and he founded / is the CEO of the startup Cronicas, which aims to develop crops that are more resistent to virulent and fungal infections. As a researcher in genetically modified bananas, he was able to explain that outside of the US, the precautionary principle with regards to recombinant DNA is applied to even research in the lab, requiring a permit which may take years. Since bananas are not affected in the Americas, research has to be conducted in Southeast Asia, which is both the major producer of bananas consumed outside the Americas and the country most devastated by the disease. The governments of the Southeast Asia also view this as an industry issue that companies need to solve, and that governments do not need to intervene on this issue. Currently, there are tissue banks (which are used to culture and grow the banana plants) in Taiwan that are working on finding resistant varieties. He also notified us that there isn’t much of a push towards solving this crisis because banana markets are depressed, meaning there is overproduction and a very low cost of bananas. He forecasted that once bananas become a more valuable crop, there will be a more concerted effort.
Regulatory
To understand the regulatory hurdles, if they were to be tested in the US first, we spoke with Dr. Eric Olson and Dr. Carrie McMahon of the Federal Drug Administration and Dr. Chris Wozniack of the Environmental Protection Agency, the two organizations that would regulate the use of our system. We learned that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens has been used as a fungicide in the past, and that thaumatin, which is similar to TLP, has preliminary evidence to be safe for ingestion by humans. We also learned that the FDA wouldn’t regulate our system because it does not directly impact the food and that the US Department of Agriculture would not regulate our system because we are not engineering plants, leaving only the EPA as the sole regulator. Although the regulation of genetically engineered bacteria versus a symbiont is more strictly controlled, there is enough precedence to consider our project more feasible compared to the engineering of banana plants themselves.

Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry
Five biobrick parts were constructed and submitted, two of which are novel parts: 1) hsp60 promoter from M. bovis expected to work in P. acnes ( BBa_K1548000 ), and 2) hsp60 promoter + TM4 bacteriophage RBS bacteriophage, also expected to function in P. acnes ( BBa_K1548001 ). The additional parts are 3) a protein generator system using the hsp60 promoter to produce mRFP1 ( BBa_K1548002 ), 4) a protein generator system using the hsp60 promoter to produce the blue light regulator to lead to blue light induction of mRFP1 ( BBa_K1548003 ), and 5) a composite part ( BBa_K1548004 ). The new parts are documented in the registry along with citations for the sequences.
Silver Medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
M. bovis hsp60 was characterized in E. coli attempting to express mRFP1 from the promoter and a strong E. coli RBS, B0034 ( BBa_K1548002 ). An induction experiment was then performed to determine whether the hsp60 promoter would be active in E. coli by growing Mach1 E. coli cells containing this plasmid in LB + Cam overnight. The results documented on the part page show that we observed no activity of the hsp60 promoter in E. coli. Consequently, in silico E. coli promoter prediction analysis was performed on the hsp60 promoter using the BPROM program in the Softberry software package. This software predicted that the promoter would not function in E. coli, and thus our negative results in E. coli were validated. Promoter"
BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Human Practices#Marketing Campaign#Public Perception_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 found that 61% of the community agrees that scientific advances should be communicated to society [4] . Our campaign is designed such that our own team can bring our research into the public domain, communicating fairly and openly the potential uses (and challenges) of the field, and also providing further reading.
This willingness on the part of the synthetic biology community to engage with the public could indeed enhance the image of the field as a whole. Valencia 2009 observed a trend for ‘people with a greater awareness of synthetic biology [to] believe that it is potentially more beneficial and less dangerous than uninformed people’ [5] . This suggests a more favourable response from the public when more information has been made available to be considered.
Our response
Teams are concluding that there is a need for more public engagement of science, and synthetic biology in particular. This directly motivates our advertising campaign as a tool for introducing the public to the many possible avenues of research. By explicitly addressing the motivation for the research, the potential benefits of technologies being developed, and the regulations in place, we hope to encourage informed debate.
Careful communication requires scientific input
The issue of the accurate and fair communication of scientific advances was highlighted by TUDelft 2009 [6] , who suggested a combined approach from journalists and the scientific community towards unbiased reporting to avoid controversial headlines.
There is further evidence from GM reporting, that will be considered later, that misreporting can be damaging to an entire field of research, and must be avoided. The way in which findings are presented is influential, and care should be taken such that research is not distorted into sensational reporting. Promoting research however also often requires journalism skills to reach the public.
Our response
Our campaign has been formulated such that it does not rely on outside reporters to create a marketable story. By being framed as a public information leaflet to be given out in the community, it can be directly influenced by those scientists developing it and less likely to be misreported by being used for sensational headlines. By remaining as a hypothetical campaign, obviously created by students and transparently theoretical application, it can be used as material for science fairs and similar to spark an interest in the debate.
Of course, if this were a real product and advertising situation, our leaflet might be considered biased by whichever company had produced our beads. Our approach would then include appeals to trusted organisations for support of the morals of our product and endorsement, to lower mistrust in our product and advertising material.
The importance of safety and security
Safety and security were suggested to be of greatest public concern by Groningen 200"

In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

ABSTRACT
Saline soil could affect the growing of the crop such as wheat and rice. As the traditonal method of  curing  saline soil is hard and inefficient , we decide to deal with this global challenge in a new way. Several part in bacteria was designed, which can decrease the concentration in the range.
By modifying a potassium channel by D-alanine , a non-natrual amino acid ,we get a novel channel protein which allow K+ get thought in the high concentration of K+ and allow Na+ get thought in the low concentration of K+.Because of the use of D-Ala, A part for importing non-natrual amino acid into the bacteria was  established.
We analyzed the proteins and tested them by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemistry,and a mathematics model of the relation of cell and salt concentrate had been founded.
We will use the patch clamp and a new method to test the protein and bacteria in solution,After experiment of our cell ,we are going to use it into agricultural and water-purification processes."

Another part is going to student dormitories to make a brief introduction of CRISPR and iGEM because most students are unfamiliar with CRISPR. They also played ‘Bacteria War’ and appreciated our software and game very much. Before our leaving, they congratulated us beforehand on our success.
The response to this activity was tremendous. We were glad to find that many students knew about iGEM. To extend the influence of iGEM and synthetic biology, we are always in action.
