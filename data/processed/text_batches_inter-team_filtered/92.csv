Impact
Our goal focuses on exploiting a novel combination of synthetic biology and phages to treat a bacterial disease that currently causes sizable patient mortality and economic burdens worldwide. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is a malignant problem that requires alternative treatments to be overcome and it is our hope that with this project we can extend knowledge of innovative ways to utilize phages in a medicinal context. Today phage therapy is largely focused on utilising lytic phages however, there are unique ways to manipulate phages at the genetic level so that they can control bacterial populations in a less absolute way which may serve more useful in certain circumstances, such as in the gut. Although phage therapy is relatively unknown to the public, we hope to draw attention to the remarkable outcomes that can be achieved from understanding and manipulating bacteriophages.

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

Project Description
Current biosensors are limited in the sense that they produce digital outputs (either 0 or 1 output) in the presence of an inducer. In order to create a more useful biosensor, analog devices with wider ranges of outputs are necessary. In contrast to digital sensors, an analog device can measure an inducer across a spectrum; for example, an analog device could be used to pinpoint the concentration of iron in groundwater, whereas digital devices could only register whether the concentration exceeded a pre-defined threshold amount.
Our device, the bacterial tape recorder, will generate such analog outputs by converting chemical inputs into DNA based memory. Using the SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events) system developed by Timothy Lu’s lab at MIT, we aim to standardize a device that can characterize the intensity of and duration of events and store them for later retrieval. The SCRIBE system works by integrating plasmid DNA, later becoming specifically ssDNA into genomic DNA upon stimulation. By population analysis of cells that express the analog marker, we will use this system to monitor hazardous environmental factors such as heavy metals, which are known to be detrimental to groundwater in urban areas and developing countries.
We aim to introduce a degree of modularity that will allow future synthetic biologists to choose what inputs are the stimulus for analog recording.
Project motivation
When brainstorming project ideas, we went over what typically motivates an iGEMmer: Saving the world, making food available to all, fixing the environment, making really cool looking plates with an array of different chromoproteins. But we realized a central theme in all of our projects, there was no concrete way of telling whether or not a cell carried the memory of being manipulated to perform such tasks. An advisor suggested that we look into a new analog way to store cellular memory: SCRIBE. We didn’t really contemplate any other project after that, all we could think about is how we could manifest all of our project ideas using SCRIBE. After researching different storage capabilities using synbio, we realized that SCRIBE truly did have merit, and could possibly"

Four samples with 1 mM chitin pentamers and 2,5 µM purified NodB were previously incubated overnight in NH4HCO3 adjusted to pH 9 at 37 °C. Afterwards these were heat-inactivated for 20 minutes at 80 °C. The measurement with Tecan200 infinte Pro plate reader ranged over 76 minutes.
4 µg acetic acid were detected in the 0.1 x sample volume. In the 0.15 x sample volume the amount of acetic acid was 1.5 times higher and in the 0.2 x sample volume it was 2.5 times higher (figure 8).
Figure 9. Final extrapolated amount of detected acetic acid in 1 ml sample after 76 minutes. The extrapolation mean of the measurements with Tecan infinite200 Pro plate reader is also shown.
About 1 mg of chitin was used as substrate. If chitin is completely deacetylated by NodB into chitosan about 60 µg acetic acid are expected to be produced. In our results about 50 µg acetic acid were produced.  Consequently, approximately 83 % chitin has been deacetylated. This extrapolated result is shown in figure 9.
Conclusion
We verified the expression of NodB in E. coli BL21 with a SDS-Page. After tagging the protein with a His-tag, we performed purification and refolding through an ÄKTA pure system, and verified the success through another SDS-Page.
To test whether NodB works properly, we used the acetic acid assay kit (Acetate Kinase Manual Format, Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). NodB deacetylates chitin to create chitosan. This chemical step releases acetic acid. As already explained in the methods, the amount of acetic acid is indirectly measured via amount of NAD+. Thus, the amount of acetic acid is stoichiometric with the amount of NAD+ in the last reaction step. NADH consumption is measured at 340 nm.
As the graphs show, this verification was successful and indicates that NodB was refolded properly and is"

This weekend, we had our third regular meeting, and had a new teammate joining in us.  Jiren firstly further explained to us the conceptions we didn't figure out last week.  Chao, our team leader, introduced the fundamental knowledge about cancer therapies and the background of the review, combining with his own experience in previous experiments.  He also presented the weakness of the anti-cancer drugs nowadays, and the orientation scientists are working towards, which made us have a deep understanding of our project.
Afterwards, Anqi, Xianwei, and Jingwei gave us their presentations on specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, and native bacterial cytotoxicity.  An later added illustrations on Salmonella typhimurium with the information he found.
During the presentations, other students raised questions to further dig into the review. For example, when talking about TNF-α, we had doubts on human immune system, the infection of S. typhimurium, and the function of this factor.  Though we couldn't explain all these questions now, these discussions indeed broadened our minds.
In the end of the meeting, we assigned everyone tasks as usual.  Although the exams are coming, giving us pressure on our study, we will still working hard towards our goal.

Today we continued to focus on document reading like last week.
Bomiao and Bei firstly illustrated on cytotoxic agents, cytokines, tumor-specific antigens and antibodies, gene transfer and gene silencing.  Among all these topics, the one of expression of anti-cancer agents caught the attention of us all.  Everyone presented his own opinions on this topic, especially in the transfer of genetic material in mammals by bacteria.
In the second part, Wenping described to us particularly on gene-triggering strategies, focusing on the pictures of the mechanism.  She tried hard to explain in detail, and asked us to understand it with the knowledge of molecular biology.  And it worked out.
After that, our new teammate Zhifei Yuan elaborated on detection.  Though he doesn't major in biology and is new to our team, his thinking is distinct and in order, and"

Kids obtain a cup of Gatorade containing a saline solution and swish the drink in their mouth for about a minute while gently chewing on their cheek cells. Then detergent is added to the test tube and meat tenderizer is added and the tube is inverted gently a couple of times. Cold rubbing alcohol is then added with a pipette which should allow the DNA to be visible. Then kids   transfer the DNA into a PCR tube where they can hang it on a string to make a really neat necklace.
Kids were keen and interested in these activities, especially learning about various different concepts that they had not yet been exposed to. “Who knew that DNA could come out of your own cheeks?” was the idea we wanted to pass along- that every living organism contains DNA. From bacteria to animals.
Are you interested in doing these activities with kids around this age? Feel free to contact us at uwigem.outreach.hp@gmail.com. It is an inexpensive, interactive and fun way to have kids involved in genetics, microbiology and synthetic biology at a very early age.
Introduction
Synthetic Biology has been perceived as a field of science that has introduced tools, concepts and technologies which are sometimes sociologically and ethically insupportable. The non-scientific community has developed a stigma against the application of various synthetic biology technologies. The problem does not lie within the technology, but by an institution’s poorly executed strategy in educating the prospective end user about the relative benefit of its product. At times, the rate of technological advancements in the bioengineering industry surpasses the end-user’s ability to understand the necessity of the technology.
The science behind these synthetic biology tools has been the current driver in instilling a sense of appeal and intrigue within the scientific community. However, it is critical that the institutions that develop these technologies educate the non-scientific community of the importance and benefit of these tools to help relieve these evolving stigmas.
This year, the University of Waterloo’s Human Practices team’s focus was to develop a marketing strategy for their 2010 design project, the Staphiscope. The Staphiscope is an enhancement to the existing conventional plating methods that are used to detect Methicillin Resistant Staphylococus Aureus.
The scope of the analysis includes:
.
What is the selling point of the product? What differentiates the Staphiscope from what already exists and is accepted by the non-scientific community?

Presumptive diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis relies on confirmation of the presence of S. mansoni infection by stool microscopy for trematode eggs, and also serologic testing of blood and spinal fluid.
Because this condition is relatively rare in Western countries, it is often hard to diagnose. It should be considered if a patient has a history of exposure to schistosome-infected water and shows any of the following symptoms: seizure, ataxia, increased intracranial pressure, hemianopsia, nystagmus and vertigo or paraplegia, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory disturbances from the pelvic girdle down, as these are the neurological effects most commonly brought about neuroschistosomiasis. Other frequent complaints are leg weakness, bladder dysfunction and low back pain Nascimento-Carvalho & Moreno-Carvalho 2005 .
Ectopic schistosomiasis
Schistosomiasis can less frequently also cause complications in other organs, such as lung or the genitalia. These as well are caused by the parasite eggs and the ensuing inflammatory reaction. Lesions in the genital areas such as vulva and vagina might have implications for sexual transmission, although this is not well documented. Additionally there is the risk of infertility in those cases where lesions and inflammations occur near the testicles or the fallopian tube and ovaries.
Treatment - Praziquantel
There are a number of drugs available to cure infection with schistosomes, for example amoscanate, chloroxylenol, meclonazepam and oxamniquine. However the by far most widely used helminticide to combat schistosomiasis is Praziquantel despite not being licensed for medical treatment of humans in the UK. It is effective against Schistosoma in a single treatment, although it should be followed up by a second treatment after 4-6 weeks, and is also used for some other parasitic trematodes such as liver flukes. Although the drug has been in use for over 20 years, the mechanism of its action is still not understood (Aragon et al. 2009) . Side effects are usually mild, although in cases with high parasite load they can be more severe as a result of massive release of parasitic antigens from the dead worms.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," France. Each participant had 8 minutes to present in front of a jury a subject chosen at random among several field such as Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry, etc. Our head of human practices, Yanis, represented the team in this contest. He was given the subject of the Earth Atmosphere. He successfully described its characteristics and functions concluding about the importance of its preservation for human sake. He reached the finals and finished 2nd after a tight battle and a long deliberation according to the jury composed of scientific journalists, scientists and teachers. This event was recognized by professionals and launched a dynamic around democratization Popular Science in France and will be reconducted for the second edition next year.
Science Discovery Day
EvryBiody is the association of Biology students in the University of Evry. It organises events in the University like the graduation ceremony, prom, or scientific events. In this dynamic of promoting science in our territory, we organised with them the Science Discovery Day in the “Parc des Coquibus” in Evry. We proposed interesting experiments to initiate children to Science and scientific communication for adults. We also introduced the iGEM competition and our project. A concert closed the day allowing us to enjoy this open event and to get close to people thanks to Biology. It was an exchange between Students and people interested in Biology that led to very interesting conversation and maybe a future vocation in synthetic biology.
Film Maker in Biology
To go further into communication  with people through the competition, we introduced a team of filmmaker to produce a movie around the Psicose. We worked alongside to wrote a scenario to promote our sugar allowance in France playing with the fact that Psicose, a sugar with kind properties, wasn't allowed yet in the market whereas a dangerous sugar, saccharose, was. See their incredible work on the video below:
The BioLab
Real places of emulation around sciences, The Biolab is a bio-hackerplace type structures allowing exchanges between enthusiasts, amateurs and professionals to transcend the existing barriers between the population and the highly specialized circle of scientists through scientific mediation. Meetings between these different stakeholders are intended to inform the public about the current practice and the challenges of research and allow mutual exchange and discussions in return for scientists to be supported in their work. Historically born in the MIT, hackerplaces are structures that push people to do things by themselves, a policy that we wanted to develop in our territory in France. This territorial and intellectual cohesion can ultimately lead to the emergence of vocations and interests for the professions of science.

This guy is Xingwen Chen,a rising Junior majoring in Life Science.
The boy started his erupting interest on all kinds of creatures since his childhood. He luckily spent a lot of childhood in the countryside. Catching insects and picking wild potherbs were his favorite. And his dream was an entomologist.
Soon, the naughty kid learned about cell, gene and protein. And he knew Darwin, Mendel and Watson. He found something more attracting than insects.No one could change his passion on biology then. And his dreame was obviously a biologist.
Now, in college, the ignorant guy amazingly found his eyesight too narrow before. In fact, what he can see in the universe of life science is just a drop in a ocean. He had to choose one particular drop even though he didn't want to leave any drop. It was at that time that he noticed synthetic biology. And then came iGEM.
The 'crazy' guy loves and enjoys designing. In winter, brainstorming really excited him and he felt inspiration erupting. And this summer, he did a lot experiment to verify their thoughts. Finally, he could skillfully complete all the experiments they needed. Besides, analyzing result and puttting forward hypothesis was his another enjoyment. What's more, he learned how to manage his time!
In the future, we have reasons to expect the guy to stand on the stage of the world.

I’m a junior and study Life Science at USTC. My research interests span antineoplastic and Brain-computer interface, but I am also interested in the synthetic biology. For, one day, it may play an important role in making the antineoplastic. And we can use some engineered bacteria to kill the cancer cell or induce the cancer cell to become a normal cell. What interests me more is that iGEM can make me consider a lot about the project and practice the ability to solve the problem by myself. I like to discuss academic topic with others. During our experiment there will be lots of new problems, and then we can try our best to overcome these difficulties. It’s a challenge and we can learn a lot from these challenges, and I take delight in overcoming these difficulties. After USTC, I want to pursue Ph.D in the aspect of antineoplastic or Brain-computer"

For more details, read Directive 2001/18/EC.
C. If your business involves selling or producing genetically modified food or feed:
Apply to a competent authority supplying them with relevant information
Follow appropriate labelling guidelines once you have received the authorisation
For more details, read Regulation (EC) 1829/2003.
D. If the product you want to sell inside the EU includes GMO:
Inform trade buyers in writing that a product contains GMOs (or provide a ‘declaration of use’ for products intended for food or animal feed).
Communicate the unique identifiers assigned to each GMO under the regulation.
Identify each ingredient produced from GMOs, if an ingredients list exists (for food and feed).
This information should be provided at every stage in the production and distribution chain and kept for 5 years.

Under FDA regulations, most plant GMOs are considered equivalent to non-GMOs and do not require much further approval. However, if the modified plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein it originally expressed, then the business must get approval from the FDA.
To receive EPA approval for GMOs with the Bt toxin, the business must conduct a food-safety analysis and verify that the toxin will be safe for the environment. GMOs without this toxin can be freely used.
Australia
Prior to any use of a GMM, a business must first obtain a license from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. This process involves providing detailed information about the host, donor, transferred DNA, properties of the GMM and where it will be grown. A formal risk assessment is then carried out by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator who then make a decision as to whether a license will be granted.

Conferences Calling for Advice
At the end of brain-storming period, with 5 alternative projects, we invited professors to give us advices. They mentioned multiple aspects that we’ve never concerned, even shared skills on funds management.
Except professors, we gave presentation to fellow students, listening to their points of view. Unlike professors, students’ suggestions are more imaginative, and their questions are sharper.

Ferritin Mineralization
Soon after the setting up of project, we were trapped by technical problems. It was a monograph written by professor Yongxin Pan that attracted our attention: There are many details about ferritin and biomineralization, which helped us a lot. We connected him, and he welcomed us. His friend, assistant professor Changqian Cao, who does research on ferritin and in vitro mineralization, shared valuable tricks and experiences with us. They also recommended professor Jintian Tang, who is an expert at Magnetic hyperthermia.
Ferritin Heating Performance
Fortunately, professor Jintian Tang also welcomed us, and introduced us professor Yun Huang, who had done researches on heating performances of ferritin.  Professor Huang shared her data about heating performance of ferritins in plants, gave us suggestions on sample preparation, and offered us parameters of heating device of their own design.

As riboflavin's structure shows, there is a transfer of two electrons from hydrogen and hydrid ions, so riboflavin can be regarded as a electron shuttle and even a kind of redox mediator. Though riboflavin is very important in mediator-driven bioelectricity generation, the detailed mechanism on electron transfer has not been precisely investigated yet[10].
Researchers find that increase of riboflavin biosynthesis can profounfly enhance extracellular electron transfer in bacteria and then improve the efficience of MFC. For example, the increase of riboflavin biosynthesis by Shewanella at the alkaline condition underlies the improvement of the electricity output in MFCs(Fig 2)[11].
Fig 2  Increased riboflavin synthesis underlies enhanced electron transfer in Shewanella.
We draw the conclusion that increased riboflavin synthesis can improve the MFC's production.
So riboflavin became our star. Since it can be expressed in bacteria, we can combine riboflavin and MFC to improve the electricity output of MFC. And it is easy and mature to measure the concentration of rirboflavin in aqueous solution based on the technique of OD (optical density). The peaks of absorbance occur at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm(Fig 3)[12]. P. Drossler etc. investigated a wide range of pH values from pH -1.1 to pH  13.4 and made the absorption spectrum curve over different pH value(Fig 4)[13].
Fig 3 Absorption spectrum of riboflavin in aqweous solution. And the peaks of absorbance occur around at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm
Fig 4 Absorption cross-section spectra of riboflavin in aqueous solutions at various values of pH. The riboflavin concentration used in the measurements was around 10-4 mol dm3
In our laboratory, we used the multi-spectral scanner to analyse the optimal absorption wavelength and finally found absorption peak at 444nm is the optimum in pH 1.17. And our optimal absorption wavelength corresponds with previous researches. In order to make pH 1.17, we mixed 2ml 0.1mol/L HCl with 1ml riboflavin aqueous solutions extract from engineering bacteria. Then it is able to detect the concentration of rirboflavin by OD value.
There are many methods to get riboflavin by microorganism. In E.col"

Casey also sent us a lot of new animations and art, so we worked on incorporating those into our design.
7/17/2015: Day 35
Today was dedicated to getting ready for tomorrow’s collaboration meeting. The BU and MIT iGEM teams are coming to the lab on Saturday so that we can demo our prototype to them and run some user studies, and we are giving them feedback on their presentation and methods. We incorporated the image of a static status bar in the design, and added functionality that lets a group of bacteria appear on Mars when the flask empties. I hope tomorrow goes well!
7/20/2015: Day 36
Saturday was so much fun! We spent the morning testing our prototype and demoing other technology we have in the lab, and the BU and MIT teams gave us so much useful feedback. Hearing their presentations in the afternoon was also very interesting. Today, we are continuing working on the animation and the feel of the interface. We will be doing more user tests this week, so the prototype is really starting to come together.
7/21/2015: Day 37
We finished the functionality of the  status bar today! It now updates dynamically so that resource level decrease at random intervals, and when users send bacteria to Mars, the appropriate resource level increases. At this point, we have practically all of the functionality, but we need to continue working on the design for testing it tomorrow.
7/22/2015: Day 38
We tested the prototype with three of the Outreach program interns who are at the science center this summer. We had the opportunity to change some things before we test it with the students from Upward Bound tomorrow. We added more informational messages on the side, which will hopefully make the interaction easier.
7/23/2015: Day 39
Today we tested with the students from Upward Bound. There was a total of almost 50 students, so we got to test with 10 groups of 3-5 students each. It was very informative to observe such large groups interact with the surface. Overall, we found that we need more informational messages, and many people liked the idea of having instructional videos to incorporate into the design.
7/24/2015: Day 40
We’re almost there! We continued working on the functionality and incorporating features the test users suggested. We decided to make the information on the side a tabbed panel split into several categories so"

The black horizontal dashed lines indicates the natural range of EPO levels. The red horizontal dashed line indicates the red blood cell count at which the risk of stroke due to a blood clot becomes significant. In (a), 94 billion Ad5 vectors containing the EPO doping gene are injected at day 0. In (b), 141 billion Ad5 vectors are required to achieve the same EPO and red blood cell production as the IV injection.
IV and IM exhibit similar behavior with regards to EPO and red blood cell production. However, IM injection requires more vectors than IV for the same response due to the vectors being destroyed in the muscle and having to pass into the bloodstream. The detection limit of the doping DNA for large dose administration is 261 days after administration. The effects of EPO gene doping on red blood cell count is prevalent until 136 days after injection. The red blood cell count passes 30 trillion cells 19 days after injection.  It reaches its maximum count of 35.9 trillion cells 57 days after injection before dropping below 30 trillion 136 days after injection. Assuming the athlete is trying to maximize his or her performance for a competition, the gene doping test could be conducted during the competition and the doping athlete would be caught. Gene doping athletes are also at risk of being caught through the athletes biological passport system implemented by WADA. The biological passport is an individual electronic record of a professional athlete which profiles biological markers of doping.  Every time an athlete is tested for doping, his blood cell count is recorded. Any large fluctuations in red blood cell count would flag the athlete as a potential blood doper. Another problem with single dose administration is that red blood cell count falls below normal levels after the doping EPO wears off. This causes a decrease in the athlete’s performance following gene doping. For these reasons, athletes are likely to avoid single dose methods in favor of multidosing.
Microdosing Gene Doping
In multidose gene doping, an initial large dose of gene doping EPO DNA is injected to rapidly increase the red blood cell count. Following this, smaller doses are given to maintain the desired red blood cell count. This can be seen in Figure 22. For IV administration, an initial dose of 64 billion vectors is used followed by smaller doses of 18 billion vectors every 20 days.  For IM administration, an initial dose of 96 billion vectors is used followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even"

What are the benefits of palm tree cultivation for Malaysia? How are the people profiting from it? What would happen if it would not exist anymore? What role does it play in economy?
We export the oil to earn money and help the Malaysian economy. Mostly we export and make goods to profit from it. Since palm oil plays a significant role in the economy, if it were gone many businesses could not operate and internationally, countries would have to find a substitute for the palm oil they get from Malaysia. You can’t grow it in Hong Kong or Taiwan so where will they get it?
Have you heard about the planed palm oil boycott from the EU? If yes, what do you think of it? What would you think if the prohibition would only regard big concerns and not small farmers?
I haven’t heard about this. I don’t think it will affect Asia very much as the Asian countries will still buy from us. We are closer to them so it is cheaper to ship oil within Asia.
Are the Malaysian people opposed to deforestation of the rainforest? Do you think that big concerns reflect bad reputation on small farmers?
I don’t think Malaysians connect palm oil cultivation with deforestation. The forests haven’t been there anymore for a long time, so it is not a problem for Malaysians.
The aim of our project: We want to find a way to produce palm kernel oil using microorganisms, especially E.coli. Our goal is to retain most of the positive traits from the natural product, which causes the oil to be such an essential resource for industry. With this product it could be possible to produce palm (kernel) oil on an industrial scale and save areas of rainforest.
Have you heard of research concerning biotechnological alternatives to natural plant oils? What do you think of this way to find an alternative to palm (kernel) oil? Which problems or ethical difficulties do you see within these ideas?
I haven’t heard of this before. I think it might be competition for Malaysians palm oil market in the future. It is a good idea, but it will certainly change what our land is worth and how we will use it. Malaysia will have to find a new way to make a living.
Do you think that this kind of research is met with refusal or acceptance by the Malayan community? What do small farmers think?
I think Malaysians will be accepting at the moment. If the economy starts having trouble, then they might change their minds.
Our method of producing palm oil could be used in Malaysia as well. Would you approve this"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#11 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," able to learn the details of oil composition and how oil is extracted. I thought the tour was excellent because it gave me more insight of how all these technologies come from. As well, we were able to watch a video regarding some history of oil. In general, I had fun and I thought the trip was definitely useful in terms of iGEM and my career. I will update more as I think about the things we learned the last few days, and will explain it on friday.

What I remember Fort Mcmurray Trip Day2
At the Plant : A powerpoint presentation was given first. Very helpful .  Learned about land holdings by ConocoPhillips… leasing . The Bitumen is only extractable in the Ft Mcmurray area because the oil sands are closest to the surface. There is oil sands ranging from the Rocky mountains to the Ft Mcmurray area … Includes calagary… But too deep to be extracted.  SAGD: Steam Assisted Gravity Drilling .  Drill vertically down . Drilling assisted by drilling fluid . The fluid has to be heavy to counter act the pressure of going deep underground. After reaching the required level drill horizontally . There are two pipes drilled . One for the steam to go under ground . The second one for the extraction of Bitumen. The bitumen follows into the second pipe which is below the steam carrying pipe after being heated(It is only slightly less viscous but still extremely viscous. ) The steam moves upwards out of the pipe and creates a V shape of extraction . SAGD can’t be implemented with bitumen that is too close to the surface due to pressure considerations. Most of the PLANT is underground unlike mining so the above ground environment is less affected. The extraction occurs very much below ground water tables.  The Bitumen carrying horizontal pipes underground have holes in them so that bitumen can flow in . So that sand can’t flow into these pipes there are considerations. A mixture of bitumen and water flow up the pipe.  The steam pumped through the pipe underground is recovered by a lifting gas.  At the surface:  The pipes that move on the surface are subjected to weather conditions. To function in extreme cold the pipes are well insulated and after certain lengths the pipes make a squarish U turn to account for expansion and contraction between the summer and winter months . The pipes are not set on the ground… supposedly so that wildlife can cross under them.  The Bitumen and water mixture needs to be separated. It is done so easily by heating this mixture . Forming froths … Oil moves"

Suspend the pellet in 200 μl of TBS. Microcentrifuge for 1 minute to pel¬let any remaining insoluble material. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. This is the amplified eluate.
Titer the amplified eluate as described in the Phage Titering protocol. The eluate can be stored for up to 3 weeks at 4°C. For long-term storage, add an equal volume of sterile glycerol and store at –20° C.
Incubate overnight at 4°C a new piece of fabric/thread in 1mL of blocking buffer for the 2nd round of panning.
Inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet with ER2738 and incubate with shaking overnight at 37°C.
DAY 3
Count blue plaques from the titering plates in Step 6 of DAY 2 and determine the phage titer, which should be on the order of 1013–14 pfu/ml. Use this value to calculate an input volume corresponding to the input titer in Step 3 of DAY 1. If the phage titer of the amplified eluate is too low, succeeding rounds of panning can be carried out with as little as 109 pfu of input phage.
Carry out a second round of panning: repeat DAY 1 using the calculated amount of the first round amplified eluate as input phage, and raising the Tween concentration in the wash steps to 0.5% (v/v).
DAY 4
Repeat DAY 2 with the panning eluate from the 2nd round.
Incubate overnight at 4°C a new piece of fabric/thread with 1mL of blocking buffer for the 3rd round of panning.
DAY 5
Carry out a third round of panning: repeat DAY 1 (steps 1 to 9 only), using the second round amplified eluate at an input titer equivalent to what was used in the first round, again using 0.5% Tween in the wash steps. It is not necessary to amplify the third round eluate.
Plaques from the titering can be used for sequencing"

2.Flow cytometry results
Figure2-a
Figure2-b
Flow cytometry results of GFP expression in experiment group Figure2-a and control group Figure2-b.The average GFP fluorescence strength of control group is 432 unit and of experiment group is 251 unit. Therefore, the terminator efficiency is 251/432=0.58
3.Agreement with theoretical prediction
(Figure 3 The horizontal ordinate represents the value of efficiencies measured by experiment. The vertical ordinate represents the value of efficiencies predicted by TTEC. We can see a good agreement between experimental efficiency and TTEC predicted efficiency.)
(Figure 4 Here listed the sequences of  terminator whose efficiencies are measured in the lab.)

UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#The Game_-_-_TEXT.html," copy plasmid is used.To get a fast response, you have to work with Escherichia coli: the model bacteria. It also is the bacteria that work best with the chosen biobricks.
System of recollection
After the decision of how to kill the spirochetes is taken, then another problem comes to attention. It is against every biosafety rule in the world to set free a recombinant bacteria into the environment. So, all the modified E. coli needs to go back to the pretri dishes they came from. In order to do this, partregistry.org has yet again the answer.
Magnetosome
Formation of a magnetosome.
There are different ways of attracting bacteria, like chemotaxis and quorum sensing. However, the fastest of them is magnetosomes (9) . Magnetosomes are prokaryotic organelle-like invaginations of the cell membrane that contains a specific set of proteins that are able to direct the synthesis of a nanometer-sized magnetite crystal. The genetic information needed for this is contained in a well conserved region known as the magnetosome island, and is present in magnetotactic bacteria (10)
In Research, the biobrick that contains the proteins needed to generate a magnetosome [link al biobrick] is given inside the plasmid pGA1C3, ready to use, by the father of Synthetic Biology, Tom Knight. This is our way of honouring him.
pGA1C3 is a high copy plasmid with high Gibson Assembly efficiency, which has Chloramphenicol resistance. The promoter used is T7, constitutive in order to facilitate the recovering of the bacteria. The terminator is Tnos again, and the ribosome binding site is maintained too.
Recovering the bacteria
A giant magnet from the physics department is used to recover the modified bacteria that contains the magnetosome, which is attracted by electromagnetic force. The termites that contains the bacteria are attracted by the magnet too.

BioBricks, Synthetic Biology in Atlanta
(GSU/GaTech iGEM)
The Atlanta Science Festival is a week-long event dedicated to the celebration of science and technology. This year the festival attracted over 45,000 people
This year, GSUiGEM collaborated with the Georgia Tech iGEM team for this event. During the Exploration Expo, these main topics were discussed with Atlantans: What is iGEM/Synthetic Biology?; Ethical Concerns and Careers in Synthetic Biology. In addition, children (and even adults) could build their own Biobrick with legos
GSU Discovery Day
Day 1: Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival consisted of over 100 events strewn across Metro Atlanta.  This event brought together science lovers and the curious together to learn more about science.  Events included nature walks, scientific movie breakdowns, and even a lecture from Neil deGrasse Tyson himself at the Fox Theater.  This year, GSU-iGEM participated in two events to help educate the public about synthetic biology.   The first event, Discovery Day, was held at Georgia State University.  The team met hundreds of guests and unveiled our fun and educational game we called “BioBricks.”  We also answered questions about bioethics and concerns people have regarding synthetic biology.  Both the parents and their children learned a lot with us that day!
Exploration Expo
Day 7: Atlanta Science Festival
For the second event, we collaborated with GTech’s iGEM team to greet thousands of people in Centennial Park for the Exploration Expo.  Once again, we hosted the BioBricks game and connected with people from all over the city.  We answered questions and raised awareness for science literacy.  We explained what iGEM is and how the program is beneficial to not only undergrads, but to"

During the project, of course, it is indispensable to communicate with other iGEM teams. Therefore, we exchanged opinions with many other iGEM teams to solve the problems we encountered together. Among them, we have carried out further cooperation and communication with the two iGEM teams: Sun Yat-sen University and South China Agricultural University. We finished an indispensable part of each other’s projects and made critical work.

SYSU-software is a friendly and open team. We had a meetup and exchange our project. With a presentation, they introduced their software to us, a multi-functional collaboration platform. Their software amazed us and we thought it can be useful in genetic circuit collaboration design. However, they ignored a fact that experimental protocol was also an important element in collaboration. So, in the meetup, we came up with this idea. They took much amount of it and verified their software based on our suggestion, adding a new function of editing protocol. Also, SYSU-software took a lot of time help us make the navigation bar of our wiki.
South China Agricultural University
The team from South China Agricultural University is also friendly and accommodating. In our project, they helped us determine differences in yeast growth and tested for its activity. At the same time, we helped them extract the Acetobacter xylinum genome. Both of us have made a contribution that cannot be ignored to each other."

Inflammation-detecting bandage
- Inflammation is caused by the immune response to pathogens.
- It an be acute to chronic.
- Acute inflammation: 1. increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (granulocytes) from blood to injured tissues 2. causative agent = pathogens and injured tissues 3. cells involved: neutrophils, mononuclear cells (monocytes and macrophagens) 4. primary mediator = vasoactive amine and eicosanoids - to carry out the detection mechanism, we will set a target chemical to detect - at this stage, interferon gamma is taken into our consideration: Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a dimerised soluble cytokine that is the only member of the type II class of interferon. This interferon was originally called macrophage-activating factor, a term now used to describe a larger family of proteins to which IFN-γ belongs. In humans, the IFN-γ protein is encoded by the IFNG gene.[2] - the goal of this project is to find a gene coding the protein which and react with interferon gamma and give an indication - a further step may be taken as a “damaged tissue cleaner”, which means that the bacteria can not only detect but also remove the inflammation tissue

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," and fused a BioBrick ( BBa_K2170141 ) that encodes a double Tet-Operator (Tet-Repressor binding site together with a bacterial promoter and an signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA [6] ) from E. coli that has a 3' RFC[25] restriction site, allowing the protein fusion of proteins that are secreted into the bacterial periplasm when expressed with this BioBrick. As a protein fusion, we then assembled a protein cargo domain that is generally exchangeable for any protein that is so small in size that it can be transported through the outer membrane by the EspP autotransporter. In our project we used the same extracellular domains as for the eukaryotic receptors: enhanced monomeric Avidin (eMA; BBa_K2170204 ), single-chain Avidin (scAvidin; BBa_K2170205 ) and a composite part composed of a N-terminal Biotinylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and a C-terminal NanoLuciferase (together shown as BAP; ; BBa_K2170118 , see Fig. B). Further downstream our design features a A3C5-epitope tag that can be recognized by a high affinity Fab-fragment and is generally used to detect and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [7] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli [8] [9] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator. For the termination we again chose a well working terminator from the distribution plate (""double terminator""; BBa_B0010 - BBa_B0012 ).
But this was just the DNA-part. What is expected to happens on a protein level? The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to thet Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can't bind any more to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated. Although the TetR-system is known to be a tight promoter system there is always a certain background expression with most promoters. If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

iGEM Meeting Minutes 3/25/12 Announcements: - Thanks for the wonderful food everyone! Special thanks to Cara for organizing this and Anthony for hosting! - Presentations today! - Only 6 weeks left! There will be no meetings in May so everyone can focus on their finals, so we have to make good use of the 5 general meetings we have left! - Things to do before summer: o Clean up the lab! Angela started, but we need to dispose of all the old chemicals and strains. We also need to make an inventory that will be digitalized. Isiah will be in charge of the lab, but we are all going to help! Things to be cleaned: 4 degree room for fridge, -80 and -20 degree rooms for freezers, lab bench, and lab desk. o Familiarize ourselves with the protocol that Angela will send out. o Familiarize ourselves with the lab machinery. PCR, gels, centrifuge. Get to know these in lab bootcamp. o Familiarize ourselves with biobricks. We’re going to try to create a circuit based on previous year’s biobrick kits. Also, the biobricks are free so if you want one, just go to the part registry to order it. The email for ordering is hq@igem.org. o We want to find sponsors. Divya and Adi will needs to collaborate to create a brochure and start contacting corporate sponsorships. This will really come together after we figure out what our project is. - Upcoming publicity events: o Undergrad research symposium: Divya will be contacting us about when this it gets closer. o Volunteering to do chemistry demos with Courtney sometime in mid to late April. Send Courtney an email if you are interested! - Collaboration with other teams: o We have been contacted by University of Michigan to collaborate. We will see how this progresses as we both come to conclusions about our separate projects. o During the summer our goal is to go visit WashU, Northwestern or both! We will take a weekend off during the summer to have fun with another iGEM team! Anthony and Cara will collaborate on this contacting the teams and getting SORF funding. - General outline of summer schedule: o There will be a short daily meeting that is mandatory! This is just so we all know what everyone else is doing and can keep on"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"PS activity of CFPS reactions with salt concentrations according to the surface response design (Table 3) was determined as fluorescence intensity at each time point minus fluorescence intensity at the 15 minute time point. Reactions 12 through 16 failed due to an error in set-up. These reactions were replicates of reactions 8-11 and their removal had little negative effect on the SRD according to the design diagnostics tool in JMP.
Figure 8: Cube plot generated by JMP using data collected for the SRD. The x-axis shows magnesium glutamate concentration, the y-axis shows potassium glutamate concentration, and the z-axis shows sodium oxalate concentration. The ovals shows predicted CFPS concentration. The maximal CFPS activity was found at 195 mM potassium glutamate, 6 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. The minimal point was found at 65 mM potassium glutamate, 18 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. This was verified as the maximum and minimum points using the surface profiler function in JMP.
Figure 9: CFPS activity for two CFPS systems utilising two different cell extract batches prepared identically. A) Results for a system utilising the same extract batch used to test the SRD. B) Results for a system utilising a new batch of cell extract. The blue lines show systems using the normal CFPS supplement premix, and the purple lines show the systems with supplement premix with ‘optimised’ magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate as identified above. The system utilising extract from the same batch used in the SRD testing had a higher CFPS activity with the ‘optimised’ premix (purple) than with the original premix (blue), whereas the system utilising extract from a separate batch had higher activity with the original premix.
Design Stage 3
All 15 supplements in the supplement solution premix were analysed similarly to how the four salts were initially analysed (i.e. a main effects screening design). A classical screening design was created with all supplements as continuous factors (the nucleotides UTP, GTP, and CTP were combined to form a single factor), and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit. The main effects screening design was then used to generate the experimental design (Table 4).

The families were deeply in grief when the patient passed away and at this time they need help to ease the sorrow and lead them back to normal life. We were told that patients who received hospice service were in good mental and living condition. Some of the patients were even able to spend their last time of life at home. Hospice care really meant a lot to the patients. When we asked about the price of hospice care he showed us a research they had done. According to the research each patient had to pay 268 yuan a day but the health care insurance could cover 248 of them. It meant that patients should pay 20 yuan per day for the service. Besides this 20 yuan they had also to pay another 80 yuan for the staff that took care of them if their families couldn’t look after them by themselves. Receiving hospice service was much cheaper than staying in normal hospital for treatments. After the interview we had a better understanding to the good cause about its content and meaning and we were more willing to be a part in it in flesh: to be hospice’s volunteers.
Fourth we attended a seminar for volunteers of hospice care.
Hospice care is a special service that it requires well training. So we went to Tianhe Book Centre for Dr Xie Shuoxi’s lecture for hospice care volunteers to learn how to be a good hospice care volunteer. We learnt several rules that for example volunteer should not ask for anything from patients. One thing that impressed us most was that as a volunteer you should not let patients see your empathy for them. Different from what many people believe, showing empathy would just strengthen patients’ grief and despair from being ill and dying rather than comfort them. Volunteers mean a lot to the patients. Being a hospice care volunteer means great duty but can also learn a lot through the impressive experience. After listening Dr Xie’s lecture we decided to be a hospice care volunteer on our own.
In the fifth we went to Kangning department of Hospital of Panyu Shiqiao as hospice volunteers.
On 26th August we went to Hospital of Panyu Shiqiao and begin our first day as hospice volunteer. The patient who we met was a kind granny. We were kind of nervous before we met her. We were afraid that the granny would be so upset and pessimistic but after we introduced ourselves to her and started talking, we found that she was a quite nice and happy granny.

Dr. Andrew Hammond.
“What a gene drive could do is, that it can spread [genetic modifications] in theory in the entire population, potentially cross whole sub-Saharan Africa. [...] It worked very well with Anopheles gambiae, which is the main vector of malaria in Africa. [...] Together with a couple of other closely related species [they] are responsible for about 95% of malaria transmission in the region. [...] In 2016 we showed, that we could spread this element through the population and [...] [the females] of the population got unable to reproduce. In theory, you could crash the whole population.”
We debated the difficulties, which malaria researcher are recently facing as well as prevention methods. Furthermore, we discussed different aspects of our project intensively. Dr. Hammond gave us a lot of suggestions regarding the experimental design, especially in conducting mosquito experiments and testing our odours. He also gave us input for the decision, where to place our trap in the field. We agreed, that placing it close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater or on the outside of houses by eaves, is not only reasonable but feasible as well.
Finally, we came to the conclusion, that multiple approaches in combating the malaria-transmitting vectors are crucial to prevent Plasmodium falciparum from adapting to other vector species. This includes very focused approaches, e.g. gene drive, which targets Anopheles gambiae, the main vector in malaria, as well as broader approaches, which targets non-dominant vector species too.
“I do not like looking at gene drive as “the” solution. I see it as a chance to get rid of the major vectors in the most affected areas. [...] I think the technology you are developing would be extremely useful in that case, when used in regions were this non-dominant vector species are present. At the same time with other vector control programs, it would be effective, because you do not give malaria enough time to adapt to other vector species. So you want to target a range of all these vector species all at once with a range of different tools, because if you rely on one tool and they become become resistant, we are in big trouble.”

Figure 1. A schematic illustration of our EGFP-T2A-mCherry reporter system.(A.)The ACG mutated reporter has the start codon mutated from ATG to ACG. As the second ATG codon in- frame is 78 nucleotides away, elimination of the first start codon leads to a 26 amino acid truncation of eGFP at the N-terminal. Since the minimal fluorescence region for EGFP is from amino acid 7-229 (Li et al., 1997), this truncation mutation will cause the production of non-functional EGFP protein, while mCherry is expressed normally. When our APOBEC1-dCas13b successfully edit C in ACG to U in the presence of gRNA, the start codon will be restored and functional EGFP is produced. As such, our dual fluorescence reporter allow for the unambiguous change from OFF (unedited) to ON (edited change), where unedited cells only have mCherry fluorescence (B.) while cells with successful editing events will have both green and red fluorescence (C.).
1.2 Identification of GLB, a gene mutated in patients with lysosomal storage disease and the designing of a second EGFP-GLB1 dual reporter to test Cas13b-APOBEC system in cells with mutated GLB.
The second reporter design involves a GFP fusion protein linked to the human GLB1 gene. GLB1 encodes a human lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that is responsible for the cleavage of terminal β-linked galactose residues from glycoproteins, sphingolipids, keratan sulfate, and other glycoconjugates. Genetic mutations in the GLB1 gene has has been shown in the occurance of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases such as GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease (Suzuki et al., 2001). There are more than 130 single base mutations that have been identified in GLB1 and some of these mutations are actually (T→ C) base change as listed in Table1. Hence the use of our Cas13b-APOBEC system could potentially restore the function of GL"

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,"8. Yeast Genome extraction
Protocol for Yeast Genome extraction is based on the introduction of TIANamp Yeast DNA                                 Kit.
Special protocol
1. fluorescence measurement
Protocol for fluorescence measurement is based on the introduction of Reactive oxygen                                 species (ROS) testing Kit.
a. Yeast induced culture
1) add the yeast into 2 to 5 mL of liquid medium and incubated overnight in a shaker.
2) The cultured cells are seeded in fresh medium at a volume of 10% by volume.
b. ROS detection by DCFH-DA staining
For the detection of accumulated ROS, incubate DCFH-DA with yeast cells for 30 min                                 (37℃), then wash the cells with PBS twice and analyzed by flow cytometry and                                 Fluorescent microplate reader.
2. Yeast Survival Rate Test
Spotting assays and viability tests
For spotting assays, yeast strains recovered from −80°C vials were shaken in SGR-URA                                 liquid medium overnight for revitalization. Then they were adjusted to the identical                                 OD600 of ∼0.5 and serially diluted to 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3. A 3-μl amount of each                                 diluted yeast culture was spotted on SD-URA or other plates. SGR-URA plates served as                                 the spotting control. Generally, pictures were taken after 2 or 3 d, depending on the                                 growth.
For survival tests, yeast cells were shaken in test tubes and grown until they reached                                 the exponential phase, and then different apoptotic inducers were added to induce                                 apoptosis. After the cells were treated by Mn for 12 h or H2O2 for 100 min, the number                                 of surviving colonies was determined by plating a small aliquot of the treated cultures                                 on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates or selective plates (SD or SGR dropout                                 plates).
3. Yeast Growth Measurement
1) The cells are added into 2 to 5 ml of liquid YPD medium and incubate overnight at                                 30°C with a shaker.
2) The cultured cells are seeded in fresh YPD medium at a volume of 10% by volume.
3) When it grow to the right time, take some of it to do the test through                                 Fluorescent microplate reader.
4. dCas9
1) PCR of a plasmid containing dCas9 to obtain a gene fragment of dCas9 protein.
2) Synthesis of g RNA by chemical synthesis.

Design Considerations
i) Roadblock AND Gates
This collection of AND gates each have either one, two or three esaboxes placed as roadblock. Since more than one EsaR     binding close to each other could create steric hindrance, we constructed variants where the spacing between the esaboxes     is either 8bp or 15bp.

ii) Competitive Binding and/or Roadblock AND Gates
Here our aim was to prevent either NorR or the sigma54 factor of RNA polymerase from binding the promoter. There are 3     NorR binding sites, and one sigma54 binding site on the NorV promoter (Figure 2). We placed esaboxes either right before     the sigma54 binding site, as a replacement for part of the sigma54 binding site, or upstream of one of the NorR binding     sites. For one of these designs, we also have a variant where an additional esabox is placed as a roadblock. This was     designed as a solution to potential problems with leakiness of the AND gate.

Using a program that can control the lights, we could create a feedback system that loops between reading the culture ratio and then adjusting the light. In addition, you would be able to easily determine how frequently the system would be observed and even set the desired ratio of the co-culture (40-60, 30-70, etc…).

Compartmentalization Parts
One of the sub-projects for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds is to create synthetic microcompartments that we can then use to isolate various pathways within an Escherichia coli cell.  To do this we need to have a microcompartment as well as a means to characterize the compartment so that the system can be optimized.  Here are the experiments we have performed so far towards the characterization of the microcomparments.
Placement of Oligoarginine Tail on Proteins

BBa_K331030
BBa_K331031
Hypothesis
The placement of an oligoarginine sequence at the N-terminus of a protein will destabilize the protein in vivo.
Introduction
The long term goal of our team is to utilize an oligoarginine tail to specifically target enzymes into a microcompartment composed of modified lumazine synthase subunits. While conducting background research on the project, we came upon data originally reported by Bachmair et al.1 suggesting that the identity of the amino acid at the N-terminus of a protein is related to its half-life, and mostly notably, that arginine residues at the are destabilizing. This data suggests that by placing an arginine at the N-terminus of a protein to be targeted into a lumazine synthase microcompartment would cause degradation of our protein before it can be moved into the microcompartment.
We chose to investigate the how the placement of an oligoarginine sequence affects the stability of the protein to which it is fused.
Method
In order to further characterize the C-terminal and N-terminal oligoarginine tag (BioBricks BBa_K249005 and BBa_K249004 respectively) and investigate the effect their placement on protein stability, yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP) with the oligoarginine fused to either the C-terminus ( BBa_K331023 ) or N-terminus ( BBa_K331022 ) (and preceded by a ribosomal binding site – BBa_B0034 ) were synthesized. We used our Red/White 3-Antibiotic assembly method to add a tetracycline repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ) for constitutive expression"

The importance of safety and security
Safety and security were suggested to be of greatest public concern by Groningen 2009 [7] , and Edinburgh 2009 [8] have also expanded to identify environmental and health effects and the unknown consequences of new technology as the most concerning aspects. The need to approach safety in a transparent, unbiased and careful way is acknowledged by both teams.
The effect of previous coverage on forming the public perception of the safety of genetic manipulation will be explored later – from these survey results, it is clear that concerns need to be allayed about synthetic biology contaminating the environment, causing harm or being misused.
Additionally, it has been found that 89% of those surveyed were happy for environmental application and only 45% for food by Edinburgh 2009 [9] . This is assumed to be relating back to the history of reporting of GM foods and the associated scares. Our beads will be applied to the environment, and are not intended to enter the food chain. Further investigation is needed to ensure that our beads will in no way interact with plants, and also to assess their impact on organic crop status.
A practical approach to proving safety of synthetic biological technology is that 91.5% of Calgary 2008’s sample were in favour of regulation [10] . Regulations are in place in the UK and EU, and need to be communicated effectively to relieve fears and win support for the use of engineered organisms.
Our response
A strong emphasis needs to be given to safety and security in our materials, addressing fears of potential misuse and accidental damage that may result from the use of our organism. It should be clarified that using these beads does not result in a GM crop and attention should be drawn to the testing process. Explanation should also be provided detailing the barriers between our product and the ecosystem: the weak strain chosen, and their encapsulation.
Opinions of synthetic biology
The majority of people are not opposed to synthetic biology, according to the Edinburgh 2009 team survey, and would approve the release of their organism. [11] This suggests a positive attitude to synthetic biology, when framed in the context of a specific project for release, with obvious motivation. It could be noted that using the phrase ‘synthetic biology’ may not conjure a similar distrust as ‘genetically modified’ has come to represent. Just twenty percent of Freiberg 2009’s interviewees responded that they would buy genetically modified food. Reasons not to were given as:
unknown consequences for human health such as cancer or allergies
threat to “natural” biotopes and plant species"

2. Tried the traditional lambda Red recombination and successfully inserted four testing devices into the genome, locus of LacI.
Experimental details [Expand]
Coupling CRISPR/Cas9 system with λ-Red recombineering
1. Plasmid construction
We designed a two-plasmid system applied for it. There was a low-copy plasmid pSTV29 for Cas9 and λ-Red expression from the arabinose-inducible promoter PBAD respectively and a high-copy plasmid pUC19 for sgRNA expression from a constitutive promoter J23119.
Fig.1 Double plasmids to meet different requirements for each element. Equip the high copy number plasmid pUC19 with sgRNA targeting site on genome and donor fragment with homologous arms. The low copy number plasmid are equipped with expression cassette of Cas9 protein and λ-Red recombinase
We mainly used Gibson assembly to construct these two plasmids. The pUC19 plasmid containing sgRNA and donor fragment was successfully constructed. Separately, we successfully constructed the lambda Red protein and Cas9 protein on pSTV29.
However, we didn’t finish the second plasmid construction due to the limit of time. Instead, we decided to employ the traditional lambda Red recombination system to carry out the integration process since we received the plasmid pKD46 from Dr. Bo Lv.
Lambda red recombination
For facile blue and white colony screening, the target site we chose is the 5 ’end of LacZ gene encoding the active site of β-galactosidase. At first, we used strain TOP10 as our host. To test the experiment conditions which is optimal for transformation, we did the pre-experiment and used the resistance Kana gene as the donor fragment to target the gene locus of LacZ. We have tried several times, but failed.
Considering that the complementary sequence between donor fragment and target site is one of the most important factors deciding the successful rate of recombination, we re-designed our experiment. The whole sequence of TOP10 is not open access and the specific sequence for LacZ has been modified and we couldn’t confirm the modified one. So we decided to replace the host to DH5α.
1. Transformed the plasmid pKD46 into host and made it competent cell after induced by L-arabinose
We transformed the pKD46 into competent cell DH5α, and added arabinose to induce the expression of recombinase. When the OD600 is about 0.6 which means"

NanJing University and Peking University             Communication and support   JLU, NJU and PKU were working on a similar task: deletion and degradation of Microcystin LR, a toxin from algae bloom which can damage human’s liver, we communicated and exchange our ideas during this summer holiday. We found the enzyme coded by MlrA can degrade this toxin and a membrane protein coded by MlrD can transfer MC-LR from outside to inside of the cell. In spite of the theory discussion, we received the MlrD gene from NanJing University. We show our gratitude to NanJing University.
Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan University and so on      Exchange ideas We compete in iGEM for the first time this year, so there are still many issues to be resolved. The first Huazhong iGEM Conversation offered opportunities for every university to exchange experiences with others. We understood lots of points about the competition, including how to show innovation points, how to finish a perfect wiki and so on. These issues provide thoughts and directions for following data processing and showing. Besides, some posters and shows we made in the communication have been ready for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Lanzhou University          Theoretical analysis When we synthesized pathways involved STAT-JAK, an advisor engaged in this filed from Lanzhou University gave us personal suggestions, which contributes to understand enzymes regulating PP2A better. There are no doubts the suggestions from the advisor help a lot for undergraduates who never contact this pathway. We express our heartfelt thanks for the advisor.

Figuring out the current status of Synthetic Biology in Korea: Interview with a synthetic biologist
Our team visited one of the few synthetic biologists in South Korea, Professor Jihyun Kim of Yonsei university whose research focuses on the optimization of the system of organisms and the fine-tuning process. We requested an interview to Jihyu Kim because he was a synthetic biologist who meeted the reuirements of well-knowing the reality and status of Synthetic biology in Korea.
Throughout the interview, we discussed the history and the realistic prospect of synthetic biology. We first talked over the birth of synthetic biology and how the actual word “Synthetic biology” was born. We also compared the benefits and disadvantages of utilizing synthetic biology with chemical or physical methods in problem resolvation. The biggest difference is the direction of approach and the ability to easily synthesize macromolecules. Unlike small molecules, macromolecules are hard to build in a chemical way, and as the length gets longer the error rate increases exponentially. However, using organisms and designed synthetic biology methods solves the problem and at a considerable cost.
Furthermore, as a synthetic biologist, we pointed out the reality synthetic biology having low recognition to the public in Korea. We thought this atmosphere was formed by Korea’s education environment which only focuses on developing one’s major and directing attention away from other possible interests. To solve this problem, our team conducted an education session for Yeouido high school on introducing the general basis of Synthetic biology. Excessive competition in the academic field also removes the possibility of taking an attempt to a new field of science. We also considered the need of breakthrough in the synthetic biology field since we reached to an plateau resulting from our lack of knowledge of the organisms.
Moreover, the negative image of Gentic engineering displayed by the media also contributes to the avoidance of implementing this new branch of study. The interview led us to set our plans on changing out the recognition of Synthetic biology and Genetic engineering. We also felt the need to take a close look in the discomfort people are indicating about genetic engineering. The negative image imposed on GMOs and genetic engineering also made us acknowledge the current status of Synthetic biology in Korea and hold an open seminar for all undergraduate students.
