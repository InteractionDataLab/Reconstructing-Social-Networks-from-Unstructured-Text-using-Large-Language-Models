Applications of co-reporters include:
Using one output as a control to check for biosensor viability, avoiding false negatives
Measuring two or more quantities concurrently, e.g. a number of different toxins

Thus, in overseeing the entire performance, it can be divided into three parts:
HB-EGF binding to the diphtheria toxin
TAR protein’s binding performance
Reaction rates of the auto-phosphorylation process
Quantitative Overview
In calculating reaction rates of either association or dissociation rate, the following mathematical equations are applied:
The surface concentration Gamma (G), for a protein can be calculated by the following formula (3): One Response Unit (RU) in the Blacore 2000/3000 machine corresponds to a surface coverage of 10-6 g m-2 for a typical protein. A 100 kDa protein generating a response of 1000 RU, corresponds to a surface coverage of 10-8 moles m-2.
Formulas:
Response unit, which is the symbol for reaction rates’ response that are given directly by the response machine will first be converted into gamma (surface concentration), which will then be converted into concentration of complex with the following formula:
Therefore, reaction rates can be calculated with following formula:
The formula is synthesized by following the mass-transportation-based reaction rates, which is based on chemical kinetics of the reaction’s constituent.
HB-EGF Receptor Activity
Part I: Association and Dissociation Rates Based on Time
This part of analysis is mainly referenced to an article by Brooke et.al. [1], in which they model binding of immobilized HB-EGF with diphtheria toxin response unit versus time, which will be shown below:
Figure 3.Binding of DT to immobilized hHB-EGF. The first arrow represents the start of the injection of DT over the immobilized hHB-EGF. The arrow with a ball represents the end of the DT injection and the beginning of the flow running buffer. From the bottom curve to the top curve, the respective binding curves for DT of 400 nM, 500 nM, 600 nM, 700 nM, 800 nM and 1 μM concentrations are shown. The number ①, ②, and ③ represent the baseline of running buffer, the association phase of the binding of DT to hHB-EGF, and the dissociation phase of the release of DT from hHB-EGF, respectively, RU, resonance units. This figure shows a representative experiment (use Materials and Methods).
Therefore, the prediction of both association rates and dissociation rates are shown below, by comparing our chimeric protein’s kinetics with literature, the"
DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," a bigger market, with the end-user having similar diagnostic needs but more means to pay for a diagnostic device and its use
- Expand to more challenging market (i.e Africa)
- Africa
- Utilize already existing distribution and logistical channels set in place by
- Humanitarian aid organizations such as UNICEF and Doctors without Borders.
- Governmental Health Authorities and Antivenom supplies
As long as research and development can be done within the University framework, utilizing students - the cost on laboratory use can be lowered tremendously.
Revenue streams for this kind of solution has been a challenge to establish. We have, so far, identified that we could pay back investor or stakeholder by either selling the patenting information, or by establishing a subscription model for the application access of the costumer, who is identified here, to be the Rural clinics, UNICEF, or Antivenom Suppliers.
The incentive for antivenom suppliers to invest in our device would be to raise their value proposition by offering a package, containing both their antivenom and the diagnostic solution.
They would be the only supplier on the market doing this, raising their competitiveness, considerably. Ideally the target for this strategy should be a monovalent antivenom manufacturer, as polyvalent manufacturer have the benefit of being able to market their product for multiple snakes, where detection between closely related snake species would not have much effect on the administration of antivenom.
We also identify an opportunities to gather and sell metadata for epidemiological research. This is facilitated through the use of the application. The challenge here is that we would ensure that there is data coverage at either the treatment facility, or at the envenoming incidence site. However, this can prove useful in assessing morbidity in certain areas.
If diagnosis is subsidized by Humanitarian Aid organization, such as Doctors without Borders or UNICEF we could offer the end user to use the diagnostic and channel cost for its use to these organizations.
This to be necessary as we can not expect the average Ugandan working the fields to pay the cost for both diagnosis and treatment.
Our unique value-proposition is the rapid diagnosis of snake envenoming to potentially save lives and cost of treatment. We do the latter to exclude use of antivenoms identified to be less effective against the type of envenoming present in the patient. This is valuable to more effectively use the limited stock of antivenom to patients that have more need for it.

Site-specificity of the miniTn7-Gm insertions in P. putida KT2440 obtained was determined by PCR amplification using a primer annealing at the 3' end of glmS and a primer annealing at the Tn7R end. The occurence of a 164 bp product indicates successful site-specific integration at attTn7, while absence of this product suggests non-specific insertion elsewhere. 12 candidates each from the electroporation and mating experiments were tested by colony PCR as indicated (Figure 3). All candidates from the mating experiment and 10 out of 12 from the electroporation experiment displayed a band of the expected size, indicating that miniTn7BB-Gm efficiently inserts at the chromosomal attTn7 site of P. putida.
Figure 3. Agarose gels showing amplification from the chromosomal copies of miniTn7BB-Gm in candidates obtained in mating (top) or electroporation (bottom) experiments. Open arrowheads indicate the location of the correct 164 bp PCR products.
Finally, we tested whether the gentamycin resistance cassette in the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon can be excised by site-specific recombination performed by the flipase enzyme at the flanking FRT sites. To achieve this, we transferred the pFLP2 plasmid, encoding the yeast flipase, by electroporation into one of the P. putida clones bearing a miniTn7BB-Gm transposon insertion. Upon selection of the transformants on LB-carbenicillin plates, clones were patched onto LB-gentamycin and LB plates. 6 out of 100 candidates failed to grow on the LB-gentamycin plates, indicating the successful loss of the Gm-resistance cassette in the transposon. The low efficiency of excision may be improved by prolonged incubation on medium not containing gentamycin. Alternetively, the introduction of point mutations at the FRT elements to remove the XbaI restriction site may have resulted in decreased recognition of the target by the site-specific recombinase. Nevertheless, our results show that excision occurs and can be detected in a simple, effortless fashion (Figure 4).

- Eirik and Hilde will look at the project description.
- Travel visas: We should fix this asap. Do this by the end of the week? Post on Slack when you have done it? iGEM can provide documentation if needed. CHECK YOUR PASSPORT - maybe it expiers and you need a new one.
- Visa application (Norwegian): http://www.esta.us/norsk.html
- Use slack for communication.
- We need to update the social media channels!
- Meetup with NTNU - maybe in Trondheim sometime in the first week of August. Maybe bad timing? Make a doodle.
- Make a short bio about ourself and send to it Aman. He will make a format and we will use that.
- If you do not have access to the calendar talk to Hilde (give her an email she can add).

Agenda 28.06.17 Presentation and feedback
Summary of the sfGFP sequence alignments
- Currently our sfGFP DNA sequence doesn't seem to exist in the registry. This means we can submit it if I'm not mistaken? As a modified or new part?
-Talk to Sandra in regards to what parts need to be used, and if she has any terminators or promoters that can be useful to submit. S. Pombe is slightly different from S. Cerevisiae after all. Should cover most bases on parts? - Amino acid alignments necessary. Someone needs to do this asap. Not fun, but necessary.
3 - Meeting with OsloTech tomorrow What to do, what to expect? What can we ask for? Oslo Innovation Week? Need to put particular focus on the laser setup, as that's the biggest roadblock right now. Other sponsors are also relevant. What else do we need? Mol.bio-stuff? 4 - Script Can and Aman made a really nifty script for searching through the parts distributions and finding parts with relevant keywords. Is put up on git, could be useful to develop further and talk to other teams about it. Perhaps this is something we could collaborate with another team on? 5 - Mol.bio-work Finalize things with Sandra, then start asap. We also need to make some sort of plan for the InterLab. 6 - Misc?

2.    Prepare iDUET101a (Addgene) in which EF-1alpha promoter was cloned from. This plasmid contains EF-1alpha promoter and EGFP reporter. We have transfected this plasmid for positive control for EF-1alpha characterization.
3.    Culture HEK293FT cell line (see below)
4.    Transfect EF-1alpha characterization construct, CMV construct, negative control and positive control plasmids in HEK293FT cell line.
5.    Observe GFP signal under fluorescence microscope
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK 293FT cells following American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in our culture medium. For transfection, we  followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form the DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Result
Figure 1: GFP signal of EF-1alpha observed. HEK293FT cells were transfected with iDUET101a (positive control), pEF-1alpha-GFP, pCMV-GFP (alternative mammalian constitutive promoter), and GFP without promoter. Cells transfected with pEF-1alpha-GFP showed weaker green signal compared to those with iDUET101a and pCMV-GFP. This result agreed with the result reported by Qin et al., that the EF-1alpha promoter gives weaker activity than CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. Our negative control, GFP without promoter did not give any GFP signal. Scale bar = 0.1mm
At the time of regional jamboree, no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from i"

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", where the system of direct democracy and referendums allow the population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. Research in synthetic biology could have come to an end had the 1998 federal popular initiative “for the protection of life and the environment against gene manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)” been accepted. Indeed, production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited [1].
Given the importance and relevance of this topic, we decided to investigate the issue of communication and interaction in the field of science. We began our investigation by attempting to identify the general public opinion before discussing this outlook with a panel of experts from different fields such as biology, ethics, politics, law, industry, religion and journalism. It quickly became obvious that the matters of communication and interaction raise extremely difficult questions, and we do not claim we have a final answer. Instead, we tried to highlight the different opinions we encountered during these interviews and help sketch the landscape of science communication in our country.
The GMO stigma
In order to assess how the general public perceives the field of synthetic biology, we designed a survey that we submitted to people passing by a stand we held in the streets of Lausanne. The survey and its results can be found on the Human Pratcices page of our website. The first salient result of our survey was that people reacted very differently to the subject of synthetic biology depending on whether the acronym GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) was present or not in the question they were asked. While our survey stimulated the interest and the curiosity of the subjects as they were reading and answering the questions (many even asked about the veracity of past iGEM projects), this open-mindedness faded out when the word GMO came up. These two seemingly contradictory positions underline a big problem in the way people in general understand synthetic biology, in Switzerland at least. We mentioned it to Prof. Denis Duboule, geneticist and professor at EPFL: “These reactions are very interesting”, he says, “It pinpoints the fact that that the word GMO has become a stigma. This situation accurately reflects the repercussions of poor scientific communication. After all, people only read what is given to them”. “GMO is one of those buzzwords we hear too often without actually knowing what is meant, apart from their association with controversies and scandals” notes Aurélie Coulon, journalist for the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps.  Indeed, several people spontaneously mentioned the scandals associated with the agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto. One of them even accused the United States of being “the greatest terrorists on"

Detailed protocols for experiments mentioned in the journal can be found on our Experiments page.
Week 1 (May 1 - May 5, 2017): Uploaded Sequences onto Benchling
The synthesis group focused on completing lab safety courses and laboratory training, which involved following commonly used protocols, and took inventory of our lab supplies.   We also looked into the genes needed for synthesizing PHA in E. coli . We examined many organisms capable of producing PHB.
Pseudomonas putida
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Aeromonas caviae
Ralstonia eutropha
We also looked at different genes for the pathways (beta-oxidation and glycolysis) of interest. After finalizing the genes, the constructs were uploaded on benchling as follows:

The boys learned a lot from their error and submitted defeat. The day was wrapped up by working hard designing the wiki and learning how to code.
Packaging: The RX team finished the miniprep from Monday and ran another nanodrop test to make sure of the concentration and purity.  Later, the team prepared LB broth with Kanamycin. To increase the amount of DNA, the RXers ran a PCR and then prepared a gel to test the PCR products.
Wednesday (06/21/17)
Sense/Respond: Today the students began their second Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Under the watchful eye of Dr. Harbaugh, the students independently finished the PCR and loaded it into the thermocycler. Another small gel was prepared and the PCR’s were taken out and loaded on the gel. The students meticulously loaded the PCR’s onto the slits of the gel with incredible precision that truly showed their growing expertise.
The students received the results they had been hoping for, which showed that the Super folded GFP had been inserted into the bacteria. They then performed a PCR Purification, which separated the massive amounts of DNA. The DNA was then measured using the nano drop and these results were given:

TUDelft Conjugation Protocol
This is the Protocol Used by TUDelft iGEM 2009:
Day 1
Get plates from fridge containing Donor and Recipient.
Make 5 mL cultures with the appropriate antibiotics and leave overnight.
Day 2
Prepare your plates (see tables at the bottom).
Put 1 mL of the overnight cultures into 5 mL tubes. Usually 2 tubes of donors and 2 tubes of recipients.
Test the OD600. You can use the following graph to estimate the time needed for E.coli containing R751 to reach an OD600 value of 0.45 to 0.6.
Place 500 μL of culture into enough 1.5mL Eppendorfs for the conjugation test.
Prepare AB free plates for the conjugation. One plate for each set.
Centrifuge 1 at 3000 rcf for 3 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Centrifuge 2 at 3000 rcf for 2 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Centrifuge 3 at 3000 rcf for 1 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Place cells on ice.
Mix 100 μL of donors and 100 μL recipients in an eppendorf tube and vortex gently.
Centrifuge for 1 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 μL of LB.
Put a PALL 0.2 μM filter on top of a AB free plate. Gently pipette the conjugation mix on the filter"

Wait...What? iGEM Netherlands?
The Netherlands is a small country, yet in iGEM it has a good reputation. Amsterdam hosted two European Jamborees, and Groningen won the Grand Prize in 2012! To not let all this experience go to waste, the advisors and teams have put their forces together, and from that emerged ‘iGEM Netherlands’, a national effort to enhance the integration of synthetic biology activities, with a special focus on the international genetically engineering competition iGEM!
Dutch iGEM teams we unite
The goals of the organization include hosting an iGEM primer event for the new iGEM teams by the supervisors and past iGEMers, meet-ups to amalgamate new ideas and of course exchanging thoughts and bricks. This medium intends to improve the research quality, exchange past working experiences, preaching the iGEM mantras to the beginners, feedback on the human practices and safety measures, to equip the teams with an arsenal to tackle the obstacles during the iGEM competition. The preparatory course organized by iGEM Netherlands were in sequential order starting with the general introduction of iGEM and how it played a significant role in promoting synthetic biology, where our adventerous journey starts in Groningen back in April 2013.
The start of our journey
A whole day was spent, where teachers, students and teams gave their presentations about synthetic biology, though it was a long day, it was certainly an unforgettable and informative one. It opened our eyes on the endless possibities that a team can achieve if they have the proper tool, creativity, support, motivation and dedication.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"
DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html," a long range of organic acids and polyols. The recent introduction of several genome-scale models for Y. Lipolytica will most likely lead to more processes utilizing the chassis for production. Perhaps, the most important advantage for using Y. Lipolytica over S. cerevisiae, to our project at least, is the broad substrate utilization range of Y. Lipolytica. Y. Lipolytica is known to naturally utilize alcohols (especially glycerol), acetate and hydrophobic substrates (eg. alkanes, fatty acids and oils) as carbon source 4 . This has naturally led to Y. Lipolytica becoming a model organism for several metabolic pathways, especially fatty acid transport, -metabolism, and single cell oil (SCO) accumulation. Y. Lipolytica has even been shown to exhibit enhanced growth on mixed substrates. Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous cell factory platform for production of fatty acid-based biofuels and bioproducts. This renders it ideal for utilization of industrial waste streams due to their complex and variable content. These findings have us believe that we had found an excellent candidate chassis for our project. The table below shows a comparison of the substrate range of Y. Lipolytica W29 and S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D.

* it should be noted that the molasses was autoclaved thus degrading some of the sucrose content. This growth might not be possible to replicate with untreated molasses.
As seen in the table Y. Lipolytica is able to grow on all the waste sources we tested, while S. cerevisiae is only able to grow on molasses.
Methods
Each growth experiment (for Y. Lipolytica and S. cerevisiae) is conducted according to the following setup:
Minimal medium is produced as directed by Mhairi Workman 5 using 20g/L of a given carbon source for all the growth experiments.
The cells were grown overnight in YPD medium, and prepared by spinning down and washed twice. The preculture was then used"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html,". Naturally the plant rice can convert provitamin A (β-carotene) into vitamin A (retinol derivates) just in the leaves. The dependence on rice as the predominate staple food crop can reduce to use genetic engineering. The Golden Rice project is one example of producing GM rice to convert the provitamin A into vitamin A in the grain. Even if this project leads to an effort concerning the malnutrition in Southeast Asia the eradication of VAD and malnutrition can’t happened without the solving of underlying political, economic and cultural issues, the dispersion of supplementation programs and the achievement of financial support worldwide.  The medical consequences of VAD:
impaired vision
irreversible blindness
Night blindness
increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease
fertility disorder
impaired epithelial integrity
susceptibility to infection
dryness of the skin
reduced immune response
defective haemopoiesis leads to reduced capacity to transport oxygen in the blood
disturbed skeletal growth
etc.
“Which Strategies are available to combat Vitamin-A-deficiency?”
In addition to the biofortification strategy (e.g. Golden Rice) there are also classic intervention approaches of supplementation or fortification. In general no single intervention solves micronutrient malnutrition i.e. all different strategies are important. The following apron shows you a few strategies for combat VAD within the limitations to each approach.
1.Biofortification:
“biofortified” means genotypes which deliver increased levels of essential vitamins and minerals by use of plant breeding of micronutrient content of crops. In contrast to the supplementation programs biofortifiction leads to providing a daily, sustainable supply of dietary nutrients. Another advantage is the efficient access to the technology in form of seeds. In comparison to the supplemetation programs in India normally 2,700 $ against 4,300 $ are necessary to save each life concerning to an article in ZM Science . Present ambitions are aiming at adding other micronutrients to the rice grain (e.g. iron, zinc, high-quality protein, and vitamin E) after introgressing the provitamin A-producing trait into local varieties has happened sufficient.
2.Supplementation Programs:
Concerning to the cost analysis of the national supplementation programs in Ghana, Zambia and Nepal in 2004 it shows clear the disadvantage “cost” of the supplementation programs. Twice a year capsules of vitamin A in solution were distributed to six months to five year aged children. Total 1,14 $ had to paid for annual cost per child doses. Other limitations are the opportunities for frequent contact"

From left to right: SOX+0 µl sarcosine, SOX+IPTG+0 µl sarcosine, WT+0 µl sarcosine, WT+IPTG+0 µl sarcosine, SOX+50 µl sarcosine, SOX+IPTG+50 µl sarcosine, WT+50 µl sarcosine, WT+IPTG+50 µl sarcosine, SOX+200 µl sarcosine, SOX+IPTG+200 µl, WT+200 µl sarcosine, WT+IPTG+200 µl.
This shows SOX works as expected, however there is leaky expression as formaldehyde is produced when no IPTG is added.
Conclusions and Future Work
E. coli cells naturally have the C-P lyase pathway which degrades glyphosate into sarcosine. The fact that no formaldehyde was produced when glyphosate was added, but was when sarcosine was added, indicates that we have not overexpressed the C-P lyase pathway enough to produce enough sarcosine for SOX to convert into formaldehyde to be detected.
Due to time constraints, we were unable to produce an in vivo formaldehyde detector variant of the Sensynova framework. Future characterisation of this part would include using the platform customised as a formaldehyde biosensor in order to sense compound produce and therefore creating a biosensor of glyphosate.

The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team ( here ) that hamper the success in biosensors development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components.

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulence. Our system contains three parts: HsbA, BbChit, and MCL1. These three genes work sequentially during infecting cockroach, promote adhesion, penetration, and immune-avoidance respectively.
HsbA
It encodes hydrophobic surface binding protein A, located on the surface of fungus. This protein works like “glue” by forming a hydrophobic bond between spores and the waxy epicuticle of their host.
Bbchit
It encodes chitinase, which can hydrolyze chitin. Chitosan is the major part of the insect body wall, chitinase can hydrolyze this to penetrate.
MCL1
It encodes a collagen-like protein, which can combine with β-glucan.β-glucan is distributed on the cell wall surface of fungus and is the recognization site for insect hemocytes to combine and clear invader. MCL1 acts like putting an “invisible cloak” on the fungus. so that fungus can evade being recognized by the host immune system.
Then, we design a trap box named GreenGround to bring our idea into real world. We mix spores,banana powder and oil together to form emulsifiable powder,which is applied to non-woven fabrics for use.        ( Click, and check more details about our box )
Suicide switch
We built a safety mechanism for our system. It consists of a tryptophan attenuator and a MazF venom protein. In the cultivating and cockroaches environment, the Tryptophan attenuator makes a difference that stops the translation before MazF, and then the fungi can keep alive. If the fungi abscise the environment we mention above, the Tryptophan attenuator would not work and the MazF expresses to make them die quickly.[4] ( Click and check ‘How to ensure safety’ for more details )

As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

Cuatrociénegas. Special Tunnel Edition
Last year, we reached about 7,000 people in the exhibition we called Synthetic Biology Tunnel 2012 . This year we continued to grow as we went to a small town named Cuatrociénegas, Coahuila, a place known for its great metagenomic diversity, whose people we believe should be aware of what the treasure they possess. Synthetic Biology Tunnel 2013 was a great experience both for local people and for us.
Genomics Biotechnology Roundabout One of our largest public exhibitions.
This year we also designed a new exhibition for all ages to explain the application of Synthetic Biology in the main Biotechnological areas: medical, industrial, genomics, environmental, agriculture and marine. The Genomics Biotechnology Roundabout was exposed in two editions where we caught the attention of more than 4,000 people of all ages.

Split Polymerase
Dickinson-PACE:
Several plaque PCRs were performed using plaque assays of Dickinson-PACE samples. The sequence of interest was amplified using PCR reaction and sended to GATC for sequencing analysis. Sequencing revealed that we got an evolved phage from the Dickinson lab. This phage obviously not showed any mutations or differences after the seven days of evolution in our PACE device. As results we can retain the facts that we could not determine the danger of washout. On top of that, we have learned how to handle the turbidostats, as well as the lagoons. Beyond that, we are now familiar with the workflow the apparature. We know how to propagate phages and moreover avoid turbidostat contamination with phages.
PREDCEL:
First PREDCEL runs and the associated plaque assays showed that we are not running into wash out for all of the three different amounts of transfered supernatant (10 µl, 100 µl and 1000 µl). On top of that, the phages are propagating well, as we can have similar phage titers for the different timepoints (20, 30 and 60 min). Our second experiment should evaluate, whether 2YT, LB or Esvelt-Medium should be used for further experiments. Since Kevin Esvelt reported in his PhD thesis, that medium influences the"

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," analysing the growth curves of the sucrose and salt gradient cultures, we can observe a much greater difference between the samples in the sucrose gradient than those in the salt gradient. As the sucrose concentration increases, the growth is inhibited (figure 10). This trend cannot be observed in the salt gradient (figure 11). However, the salt concentrations were very low in comparison to the sucrose concentrations, which could explain the small difference.
Figure 9. Growth curve of samples cultivated in sucrose gradient.
Figure 10. Growth curve of samples cultivated in salt gradient.
In conclusion, we have proved that the activity of the OmpR promoter is increased in higher osmotic pressure with the results from the sucrose gradient, meaning that our bacteria would be able to sense the changes in osmotic pressure in the mucus. However the RFP was just used as a reporter gene to test the activity of the promoter. The next step was to replace RFP with our mucus-degrading enzyme sialidase.
Expressing sialidase with OmpR promoter
Hypothesis 5: Successful cloning sialidase downstream of osmosensitive promoter
We digested a PCR product with RBS-sialidase and ligated it downstream of the OmpR responsive promoter. After screening using colony PCR, we confirmed successful cloning as we saw bands at around 1700 bp (figure 12). The control is slightly smaller than the insert, which is because it does not contain the OmpR responsive promoter.
Figure 11. Gel of colony PCR after cloning. From left to right: DNA ladder, well 2-6: successful clonings of RBS-sialidase downstream of OmpR, well 8: re-ligation of OmpR to the backbone, well 9, 10: successful clonings of RBS-sialidase downstream of OmpR, well 11,12: successful cloning of RBS-sialidase in pSB1C3 backbone, control.
Hypothesis 6: Increased expression of sialidase due to increased osmotic pressure, using a sucrose gradient
After cloning sialidase downstream of the OmpR responsive promoter, we executed the same osmolarity test by procedure, but this time using only a sucrose gradient as this yielded conclusive results before. However, when analyzing the SDS-PAGE gels of our expressed protein, we found only a very faint band at the expected size, in 10% sucrose (figure 12).

UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," day, meaning that the images turned out too blurry to be conclusive and strong enough to submit - while the E.coli were imaged well, we just couldn't get enough clarity to see smaller OMVs (if they're actually there...). We also began to harvest OMVs using our centrifugation protocol
And, due to the folding of the CRISPR team, all hands were devoted to cloning and expressing our parts. Three of us tried to clone our constructs into pSB1C3 (to submit to the registry), and the other three put it into our Duet plasmids (to express).
To put our six parts into pSB1C3, we started from scratch: 1) PCR amplify six of our synthesised parts, 2) PCR amplify the backbone, 3) digest both with EcoRI and PstI, 4) phosphatase-treat the backbone, 5) cleanup both, 6) ligate, and 7) transform. This failed the first time, so we tried the transformation again, this time with new SOC media, as we used the wrong type of glucose in it. It failed, so we retried the ligations with QuickLigase, T4 Ligase, and a Gibson - none of those transformations worked! It was an enormous effort, though, so despite the setbacks we were all proud
To put our six parts into the expression vector, we did exactly the same process as above, only using different primers for the initial PCR amplification (to add on specific restriction enzyme sites), and the above step (2) was not needed. About twenty transformants were made, but colony PCR revealed they had not taken up the insert.
Further, we began work on a part we received from the registry: INPNC. We 1) transformed, 2) miniprepped, 3) digested with BamHI and PstI, 4) ligated in GFP and RFP that had been prepared to add in a BamHI-overhang, and 5) transformed. As above, this didn't work either
Week 19: October 3 - October 9
Overexpression Team
We first retried reinserting our parts into the Duet expression vectors, but this time we ligated using a Gibson. Hundreds of transformants were made, and we stayed in late screening as many as we could using colony PCRs
And we got several hits! Our next task was to test for expression from our colony PCR hits. To do so, we first grew up our cells"

    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Orp1 is reversible.
Verify codon optimization of roGFP2-Orp1
Determinate the DTT concentration making roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5mM, 3mM and 5mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Figure.5 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(After Codon Optimization)
Figure.6 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(Before Codon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
Characterize roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5Mm DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to                         approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

Figure.10 Contrast After Codon Optimization with Before Codon Optimization on                             Protein Expression

As Figure.7~Figure.10 shown, codon optimized roGFP2-Orp1 had higher expression protein than                         control group without codon optimization and wide-type without fluorescent protein.
Therefore, the codon optimization improved the roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression successfully.

http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/401.html
(This is a website for the safety of genetic engineering from our university.)
About our local rules and regulations
1. Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution? (You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
A subgroup for genetic engineering under the department for security and environmental safety is responsible for the biological safety at our university. Every staff member in the Georg-August University Göttingen is entitled to give instructions to colleagues and/or students regarding content and structure of the work, as far as Health and Safety Regulations are concerned. We have discussed our project in detail"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and written feedback, as well as videotaped user studies for further analysis.
Future Work
While our progress made great leaps and bounds this summer, there is still much work to be done to continue developing our projects beyond the scope of iGEM. We hope to continue receiving user feedback from other members of the synthetic biology community, specifically the BU and MIT iGEM teams. The Eugenie team plans to conduct more user testing to ensure that the program is robust enough that any genetic circuit can be designed. zTree 's goals are to animate carousels on and off the screen, rather than simply appearing and disappearing. Additionally, we would like to integrate a search feature that will allow users to search for specific parts at any point in their tree traversal. Finally, Bac To The Future 's goals are also to perform more user testing, to create a gesture-based, interactive tool, and to iterate and improve the usability of the application as well as to maximize its potential for educational purposes.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

Safety
There are risks in all lines of work, however those within labs must be assessed and reduced as the hazards in this environment usually have more severe consequences. In order to minimise the risk within labs there are legislations in place within iGEM, the UK and worldwide, our lab work is in line with these legislations. As Part of our Human Practices we have looked into the National Legislation around Biochemistry. In the labs we used the standard safety procedures, wearing appropriate lab equipment and performing appropriate procedures within fume hoods.
Local Policies
Each member of the team must abide to the policies, practices set by Newcastle University, all staff, and students are responsible for making themselves familiar with these responsibilities. Academic staff support our team to ensure that these policies and practices are followed with care. They have prior experience within the molecular biology labs we are working within. Each team member supports each other throughout the project and has received appropriate lab inductions, training in handling of chemicals, sterilisation methods, disposal and handling contaminated material and microbials.
Every lab has safety files that are revised and modified regularly and kept up to date, the appropriate forms have been signed by every member participating in experiments. Risk assessment forms are filled out for every compound and lab experiment, and then signed off by all team members. Before entering any of the labs the Emergency Procedures were outlined by a member of each lab.
National and International Policies
The work conducted in our labs was carried out according to UK and European regulations. We reviewed these in more detail as part of our Human practices section, to help communication within synthetic biology we also"

Tonbridge Science Conference
<img src=""
"" style=""width:30%"">
On the 11th of October, a few members of our team carried out a 20 minute presentation of our work as part of the Tonbridge science conference. The team also had the opportunity to showcase our poster, in a similar fashion as would end up doing at the Giant Jamboree.  This conference included a number of other secondary schools from the surrounding area who also gave presentations and a number of talks which were given by experts in varying fields of science.
Our team found the experience extremely enjoyable and helpful. The conference allowed us to educate pupils from similar schools and of similar ages about synthetic biology and the IGEM competition. As the first UK state school to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston, we hope that other state schools which were in attendance were inspired to follow in our footsteps.
Medical Society
<img src=""
"" class=""left"" style=""width:30%"">
The presentation given in the Judd medical society was focused on the issue of iron deficiency and excess iron in the body. The talk covered the prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world and how our project is specifically designed for this demographic. The medical society presentation was a good opportunity to focus on the potential of our project in the real world before our interview with the haematologist. The medical society is attended by students from all years but primarily by sixth form who have an interest in studying medical sciences therefore the talk also covered why healthy iron is so fundamental to life and addressed common misconceptions surrounding anaemia and iron deficiency as well as discussing some of the latest research which illuminates just how harmful excess iron can be in body. We raised awareness about iGEM and synthetic biology among students who have expressed an interest in medicine and hopefully shown them the global positive impact can have in the medical field.
Whole School Assembly
The assemblies were used as a tool to educate the school about synthetic biology, a subject only touched upon in A level biology. As a team, we believe that synthetic biology needs to be talked about more in high schools as it is rapidly becoming the most influential area of science.
In our presentations, we explained what synthetic biology entails. We talked about the ever growing need for innovation to help resolve global issues. Issues such as the global food shortage and energy crisis. We  also talked about the ethics of synthetic biology and why the public has been so opposed"

Meet the HKUST-Rice Advisors!
Hello from HKUST!
Cuellar Raul M.
4th year, BSc in Biological Sciences
This is the third year that Raul has been involved in iGEM, as well as the first year he participates as an advisor. He is very willing to share his view points and pass years of iGEM experiences. He is one of the busiest and most patient people in the lab, members queue up to show him their failing results and ask him “WHY?”. He has to answer everyone's questions, while having his own experiments going on at the same time. One more point to add, don’t be scared if he speaks mandarin to you.
Park Hojeong Bonnie
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and Chemistry
Bonnie is a kind and amiable person, you will always find her around in the lab, ready to help out. She always carry with her a big smile and you will find her comfortable to talk with. Having Bonnie as one of the advisor in this year is definitely a pleasure for us.
Sulaiman Jordy Evan
3rd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Jordy is a year 3 student majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He is a   very smart and diligent advisor who likes to ask questions and help others. He is an   expert in painting. He also likes funny dolls and playing computer games. Sometimes   he can be quiet serious and very critical, but he can also be funny and entertain others.   Another thing about him is that he is always seen together with Nadia, another   iGEM advisor.

12.  *Potential problem: if PCZ doesn’t work, is our project that unique?  PCZ allows us to combine cell-cell signaling with genetic encoding, and PCZ is the genetic encoding component.
13.  Most of the people have been focusing on the mammalian constructs; but it would be good for us to continue working on the bacterial sender cell as well.  Cambridge team has been contacted about the lux biobrick and how best to transform/get the cells to glow, and the aequorin still has yet to be PCRed.
Next step: design primers to amplify aequorin with restriction sites for putting into pET3a
14.  It is worth it to continue moving forward with the aequorin because PCZ was originally patented in E. coli.  The rationale for using it in mammalian cells is that the mODC is what will target the proteins to degradation, but the proteases will only break down the outside, releasing the CZ from its beta-barrel (someone who knows more about this please add details)
15. We could think about getting fura or indo dyes that are calcium sensitive so that we can use these dyes to have the cells light up differently.
Next step: buy dyes
16.  Arielle is on the luminometer experiments and the coelenterazine resuspension.
17.  BBC documentary due date is this Friday! In our pitch, what should we say that we expect for them to see when they come?  Don’t over-advertise, just say the vision. Don’t necessarily say that it isn’t working. Things that we need to do to make this successful: update wiki, rent video equipment from van pelt and record ourselves, talk to someone in seas to see if someone could help up with webdesign. (avin is going to email joe sun)
18.  We don’t need to worry about having a UV bulb, but we should keep the hoods running 24/7.
Next step: have Sarkar talk to Seville abut it
Upcoming Goals:
1.     Characterize PCZ lysate in gaussia supernatant and aequorin lysate with CZ  by themselves and make sure that you can get light.

Outreach
1 . A survey on how Chinese think of synthetic biology
We wanted to know the general public opinions on synthetic biology. Thus we did a survey among people aged 15 to 30 who will be the masters of the near future. We distributed 2,000 copies of the questionnaire through network , covering 19 provinces in China. Read more...
2 . A talk with public about our project
We wonder that if we successfully finished our project, will the public accept it? What will they concern about. So we decorated an exhibition stand to show our project to the public and got some feedbacks. Most of them appreciated our idea; they said if we could done some animal experiment to prove the function, they would have a try.
3 . Publication awareness
This May,we volunteered to a local high school to introduce the advancement of synthetic biology. We told them about the iGEM jamborees and famous teams in the world. We were happy to see more and more students getting curious and excited about the missions of iGEM Foundations and the idea to combine cells with engineering and encoding.
Last November, after we had returned from Hongkong, we made a public speech in our school to report what we achieved, to share the feelings in the iGEM competition. After that, many students want to join us and make a contribution in the 2013-iGEM. We hope that our team will be inherited and become more and more influential.
4 . Collaboration and share(with WHU&HZAU)
There are three teams in Huazhong district this year：HUST,WHU， HZAU. We have been keeping in contact ever since this April. There will be a comprehensive presentation in the mid of September, as what we are going to do in Hongkong.
We have a meeting with HZAU iGEM team on May 7, 2013. We shared our idea and help them to characterize their part BBa_K1228008 . They help us characterize our part BBa_ K1037000. We have a very happy cooperation.

TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," the 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM project we wished to express MRI contrast providing proteins upon bacteria entering anaerobic tumours. To induce the expression of these proteins we would be making use of an FNR promoter just like the NirB promoter. To design our promoter we made use of an article (Anne M.L. Barnard, Jeffrey Green, and Stephen J.W. Busby, Transcription regulation by tandem-bound FNR at Escherichia coli promoters. Journal of bacteriology 185.20, 5993-6004 (2003)). From this article we extracted the data for our promoter, by choosing the most optimal promoter given in the articles selection.
To test the efficiency of this promoter we, much like the Valencia 2012 team, expressed EGFP under anaerobic conditions in which, again like the Valencia 2012 team were successful. Based on the research by Barnard and al. and our measurements, Part: BBa_K1123005 seems to have more potential as a FNR promoter with higher activity.
We collaborated with:
Purdue iGEM Team : we participated in the improvement of the current characterization forms.
Copenhagen iGEM Team : we participated on the Bricks of Knowledge initiative by making a video about creating an anaerobic environment.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We have created a website with which we provide unbiased trustworthy knowledge about synthetic biology, this website is called Synthetic Facts .

University of Nebraska-Lincoln Safety Case
We collaborated with the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team to build a Safety Case for our project. This is a method of building rigorous logical arguments about the safety of a project that the UNebraska-Lincoln team has pioneered in iGEM. Given the competition’s focus on biosecurity and safety, building this safety case helped us thoroughly evaluate the current and projected risks of our project.

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," produce ethanol efficiently in E. coli, is was necessary to transform E. coli with both the pyruvate decarboxylase gene to produce an acetaldehyde intermediate, and an alcohol dehydrogenase gene that will take acetaldehyde and convert it to ethanol. The Nevada team designed and synthesized an operon without a promoter (intermediate part k558000) containing pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase coding regions along with a standard E. coli ribosome binding site and double terminator (BBa_B0014). The pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) coding region sequences were based on the Zymomonas mobilis sequences (Ingram et. al. 1987) and work conducted by UNIPV-Pavia (iGEM 2009 Part K173016; K173017) and Utah State (iGEM 2009 M11041; M11042). The goal was to express this pdc/adh operon under the control of the constitutive promoter sigma70 (iGEM part J23101), or a glucose insensitive inducible promoter, trc (see details below) and test for expression of functional genes.
The sigma 70-pdc/adh generator (k558001) was assembled using classic cloning techniques. It was then transformed into two E. coli competent cell lines, NEB 10-Beta (New England BioLabs) and T7 Express Iq (New England BioLabs). Colonies were screened through restriction digest analysis, DNA sequencing and tested for enzymatic activity.
Pyruvate Decarboxylase Activity
Pyruvate decarboxylase activity was assayed using aldehyde indicator plates (Ingram et. al. 1987) to test for a Schiff Base reaction to detect the presence of acetaldehyde, a substrate for ethanol production. The figure below shows pink colonies after an overnight incubation on Schiff base plates. The streaked colony on the top of the plate is a negative control cell line (white-light pink). The streaked colony on the right are a typical example (pink color) of sigma 70-pdc/adh generator in the NEB 10-Beta cells. The cells on the left (dark pink) and represent what is typically seen for the sigma 70-pdc/adh generator expressed in T7 Express Iq cell lines. From the results shown here and other experiments, we  concluded that the NEB T7 Express Iq cells"

Lemon Scent
Summary
In the part of the project, we want to express the main components of the lemon scent (limonene, β-pinene and citral) in the odor-free E. coli we constructed. For this, we plan to engineer a plasmid constructed by the team of Taek Soon Lee, bearing a complete mevalonate pathway, a geranyldiphosphate synthase and a (S)-limonene synthase, to express (i) a β-pinene synthase (BBa_K517003), (ii) a geraniol synthase (GES) and a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) to produce β-pinene and citral respectively. We also would like to characterize the limonene synthase biobrick constructed by the Edinburgh team (BBa_K762100) and verify whether it is functional by"

JAMS booth @ Museum
The Joint Academic Microbiology Seminars (JAMS) collective were given the chance to host a booth at the Australian Museum Science Expo during Science Week. We were invited to share the responsibility of manning the booth over the two-week period. Every day, some of our team members got to interact with students from all years of schooling as they wandered around the stations inside the museum. Over 6000 students passed through the expo, making it a very busy two weeks of outreach! The activities we ran we similar to those we did at Science in the Swamp, and again this gave us the chance to reach even more people about our project.
Experience It! Conference
Claudia was invited to be the MC at the Engineers Australia Women in Engineering Division’s Experience It! Conference. Over the course of the day, over 150 female students in their penultimate year of high school attended engineering workshops, listened to inspirational speakers, and discussed challenges faced by women in the field of engineering. As the MC, Claudia was able to offer insights into her experiences as well, and of course took the opportunity to share her experiences in iGEM! Many girls approached her afterwards to further discuss synthetic biology and the details of our project, providing another example of the extensive outreach work successfully undertaken by the USYD iGEM team this season.
Investig8 Uni
Investig8 Uni was an event held on campus to introduce early high school students to prospective higher education opportunities and the pathways available to them. Each student chose from a range of Faculty-based hands-on workshops, and the iGEM team was fortunate enough to run the Science workshop. This workshop introduced the students to a range of microorganisms, from commensals to pathogens and even critters found in local pond water.
The students used compound microscopes to view prepared slides of gram-stained bacteria, could interact with agar plates to show how we culture these organisms, and viewed larger eukaryotic organisms via dissecting microscopes and other instruments. We also introduced them to concepts of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, which generated great interest. Overall the day was really fun and the students learnt a lot – hopefully they’ll be back in a few years!

Promoter Library Sub-Project
Introduction
Mathew analysing and recording the findings displayed in the gel photographs
In yesterday's session, PCR amplifications for the three types of sigA promoter variants was carried out (i.e. V1, V2 and V3). The amplifications of these three types of promoter variants will give rise to a library of different sigA promoters, hopefully of differing affinities.
In today's session the PCR products will be run on the gel and analysed. If there are signs that the PCR reactions have worked successfully then the PCR products will be purified. If it is apparent that the PCR reactions haven't worked at all then another attempt at PCR shall be made.
Preparing the gel and the DNA gel electrophoresis
After the addition of ethidium bromide the agarose gel was prepared in the normal way
The fragments we are expecting to be seen in the gel are roughly 100bp long therefore a fine gel is needed to capture these PCR products. Instead of making up 0.8% agarose gel, 1.5% agarose gel was made up and melted in the way the protocol dictates.
With the gel now set in the tray 6ul (5ul of PCR product and 1ul of loading buffer) of each PCR product was placed into the wells of the gel. The electrophoresis machine was switched on to 90mv and the process allowed to run for 30 minutes.
The resulting gel photograph can be seen here:
The samples loaded into the gel were as follows:
DNA gel electrophoresis
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = C0
Lane 4 = V1
Lane 5 = V2
Lane 6 = V3
Lane 7 = 1ul of neat V1 (control)
Lane 8 = HindIII DNA ladder

With this database specifically designed for the storage of the biobricks, a specific application was written to query the repository. This resulted in a database containing ~20.000 parts that were ready to be used for the application.
Our Publication
Figure 3: Most viewed article on Journal of Biological Engineering
On the 4th of September we published an open access publication about The Constructor. The article, ""The Constructor: a web application optimizing cloning strategies based on modules from the registry of standard biological parts"", was a result of collaboration between the iGEM Wageningen Teams of 2011 and 2012. This collaboration and the writing of the article improved our educational experience tremendously, as for most this was the first article to be published. We are therefore also very proud to mention that this article is now categorized as highly accessed (figure 3), meaning that our article has been especially highly accessed relatively to the publication date and the journal in which it was published.
Results
A test run was completed on the constructs of several iGEM Teams from 2011 (with permission) to identify the possibilities of reducing the amount of cloning steps (table 1). In 5 out of 6 cases The Constructor advised a more efficient cloning strategy. The time that was needed for The Constructor to complete all the calculations was in 5 out of 6 times less than 2 minutes. For the designed circuit of Mexico the calculation was finished within 12 hours and reduced the 26 cloning steps to 25. Suggesting that even though the calculation were finished in 12 hours it is likely that this is less then when using the extra cloning step used by the team.
Eventually this means that it is always advisable to use The Constructor to either confirm your results or identify other possibilities to reduce your cloning strategy.

Evolution of a New Synthetase
Screening System
K2020040
– screening plasmid for incorporation of non-canonical amino acids → pRXG This part is an improvement of the existing BioBrick K1416004 , also called pFRY by the iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014. It is a fluorescent reporter for testing synthetases on incorporating ncAAs. pRXG is one part of a two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation of ncAA via amber codon supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected by a linker sequence containing an amber stop codon. When induced by IPTG and expressed, the fluorescence intensity can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated as response to the amber stop codon, then a green fluorescence intensity is detectable. Fidelity and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of flourescence levels. This reporter plasmid is one of a two plasmids containing screening system for determining efficiency and fidelity of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) incorporation via amber termination supression. One plasmid contains tRNA and corresponding synthetase. The other one is the reporter plasmid. It consists of an mRFP1 domain which is connected by a linker sequence containing an amber stop codon with a sfGFP domain. The expression of the plasmid gives either a red fluorescence, or - if the ncAA will be incorporated at the recoded amber stop codon within the linker site - both a red and a green fluorescence are produced. Synthetase and tRNA are constitutively expressed in a plasmid with low copy replicon, taking into account that expression results in metabolic stress, but are not under IPTG control for he purpose of avoiding abrupt and unpredictable effects considering extra time and energy needed for their assembly. Whereas the reporter plasmid containig two fluorescence proteins, is kept under operon control for IPTG induction likewise on a low copy plasmid with ColE1.

Basic Assumptions
Our solid model has several basic assumptions that are indispensable.
I. A colony-to-grid representation in a 200×200 mesh grid (one grid represents a cell colony) is good enough to simulate bacterial growth in a real medium. (See Overall Discretization )
II. The time it takes for AHLs and nutrient to diffuse into surrounding grids and meet concentration balance is very short compared to the time for cells to grow into colonies. [2] (See Placement Rules )
III. We suppose decomposing rate of AHLs and utilization rate nutrition are constants, and decomposing rate is relatively high compared to growth rate of cells. [3] (See Placement Rules )
Overall Discretization
In the first place we do spatial and time discretization. The whole medium is discretized into a 200×200 mesh grid, and valid space for living is a disk inscribed on it with a radius of 100. Using assumption I , we set each cell colony (abbreviated as ‘cell’ in following sections) into a corresponding grid to represent its presence. In software simulation, we keep three matrices of 200×200 size to record the amount of cells, nutrient and AHLs in each grid, respectively.
Meanwhile, the whole time we take to cultivate cells is discretized into 1,200 iterations. After each iteration, the number of substances in each grid changes according to certain rules (will be discussed in following sections).
Placement Rules
When we place a cell onto a corresponding grid, concentrations of substances in adjacent grids also change as a result. We apply assumption II to develop a set of synchronous placement rules: (1)The event of placing a cell triggers concentration incline in surrounding grids synchronously (2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.  (3)Removal of a cell has inverse effects.
According to assumption III , concentrations of AHL and nutrient will decline in each iteration if their generative sources are removed.
Different types of cell affecting different kinds of substances are illustrated below:
Placing Farmers
When placed, a farmer will eject nutrient to surrounding 5×5 grids, and the amount of nutrient in each grid will increase by 1. Then the amount of nutrient will hold on until the farmer is killed. When a farmer is removed, the amount decrease by 1.

BostonU,2015,Team:BostonU#Mammalian synbio#Solutions_-_-_TEXT.html," parts using BioBrick cloning, there are other, new ways to clone parts that do not require BioBrick assembly or restriction enzyme requirements - for example, Gibson cloning.
Although, current BioBrick submission requirements have been the foundation of the iGEM registry, it may be possible to tweak the criteria so that it is more suitable for larger parts. For example, requiring only one enzyme site in the BioBrick prefix and one site in the suffix (rather than two in each) could turn BioBrick part submission into an easier requirement to accomplish. With an easier submission requirement, mammalian teams (and teams with larger parts in general) may be more likely to submit their parts to the registry, since these will more easily follow requirements. Although this solution would eliminate the ability to assemble parts using BioBrick cloning, there are other, new ways to clone parts that do not require BioBrick assembly or restriction enzyme requirements - for example, Gibson cloning.
We think that it would be interesting if there was a way to redefine some of the classic BioBrick submission criteria, such that it was more permissive towards submission of larger parts.
Awareness
We hope that future iGEM teams will be inspired to consider projects in mammalian synthetic biology, given more awareness about current efforts in the field. Below are some key Principal Investigators that do cutting-edge mammalian synthetic biology research, and we have included links to their lab websites. We hope that some of the research questions these labs are exploring can spark interest in future iGEM teams.

Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#New Series of PompC_-_-_TEXT.html," The induction of new OmpC series in high osmolarity medium at 4 hours. This work is done by Thiprampai THAMAMONGOOD and Taichi NAKAMURA
After 4 hours of sucrose induction, transcriptional activity of PompC(CB)-GFP and PompC(CS1)-GFP increased 2.5-folds and 2.3-folds respectively. However, significant amount of leaky expression was found in PompC(CS1)-GFP without induction. In contrast, under the same conditions, we found no significant difference of GFP expression in PompC(C)-GFP. Although, PompC(WT)-GFP also doesn't show difference in expression of GFP at 4 hours of induction, there was slightly higher GFP expression 1.7-folds occurred in the wild type at 2 hours.
Discussion
The transcriptional activity of PompC(WT)-GFP increased in particular period and declined after it reached the peak of expression. This result shows the relation to the study by the Edinburgh iGEM 2009 . Moreover, we considereated that we can create varities of POmpC by combining OmpR binding sites on the upstream of the OmpC promoters with spacer sequence.
Conclusion
According to the results, we have succeeded  in comprising 2 new series of osmoregulative promoters. Furthermore, we expect that PompC(CB) would be a key component in responding to the middle light intensitys, “full moon light” and probably awaken our werewolf coli in the “full moon night”

The cultures were allowed to grow another three days (supplemented with tyrosine and ampicillin) to see if pigment would form, but we were unable to detect any melanin. The 1OD samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE to check for melA overexpression (Figure 3). The MelA tyrosinase is ~54 kDa in size. A faint band of approximately 54 kDa appears in the TON lane of culture 3. This indicated that we were successful in expressing the MelA tyrosinase from the pJET plasmid. Before the Jamboree, we will attempt another overexpression of MelA from the pSB1C3 plasmid.

 Biological Pigment Ink - Proof of Concept
When we were investigating what our proof of concept should be, we talked to the business liaison at the University of Lethbridge Greg Vilk, and he proposed the ""simple showcase"". He explained that in order to show that our project can work as intended, we need only to prove the concept in the easiest way (for more information concerning our interview with Greg Vilk, click here ). For our proof of concept, we intend make an ink with pigments extracted from an alternate source and put them into fountain pens. We bought common supplement tablets (Lutein tablets, which contain lutein and zeaxanthin and cranberry extract tablets, which contain anthocyanin). We attempted an extraction of the pigments using either acetone or water (Figure 4). Both solvents were able to extract pigment, but they resulted in different shades and intensities of colour. (Figure 4 and 5). Guar gum was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to increase the viscosity of the ink and help it bind to surfaces. The guar gum thickened the water based inks, but precipitated in the acetone based inks (Figure 2).

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Results Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," parts, two halves of a split TEV protease, however these contained illegal restriction sites. We attempted quick-change PCR and overlap extension PCR for site-directed mutagenesis, and the two protocols are on our page, however these were unsuccessful. We therefore could not submit these parts to the registry.
Expression Vector Cloning
For full characterisation of both parts we needed to express both of them in the same system, so we designed an experiment where OmpA-SpyTag and SpyCatcher-GFP-quencher would be present on different plasmids in the same cell. We would clone the OmpA-SpyTag part into the pQE-60 vector, and the SpyCatcher-GFP-Quencher part into pBAD-33. These have compatible origins of replication, differing antibiotic resistances, and are induced by two different and easily-obtainable inducers, IPTG and arabinose respectively.
We designed primers for three purposes:
To amplify the parts from the shipping vector constructs with restriction sites that allowed for cloning into the expression vectors. These were NcoII and BamHI for pQE-60 and XbaI and PstI for pBAD-33. These enzyme combinations ensured that the start codon of the part was the optimal distance from the RBS in the plasmid for efficient expression.
To amplify a ‘noF’ version of the OmpA-SpyTag part which would remove the sfGFP fluorophore and therefore fluorescence would only be detected in the OMV fraction if the SpyCatcher-sfGFP-Quencher part was localised. In hindsight a better design may have been to have used a different fluorophore to assay both at once. This could even have been a CFP in order to use FRET to see if the two parts were close to one another.
To amplify a ‘noQuencher’ version of the SpyCatcher-sfGFP-Quencher part, in order to determine the effectiveness of quenching in our system.

Most of the texts we have been through point to synthetic biology's modification of nature as an ethical matter. Two concepts, naturality and artificiality,are presented as raising an ethical tension. We will, in this section, try to get at why such tension should be analyzed by ethics, what problems both concepts bring and what kind of issues are proposed. In a first look, we can legitimately wonder about the “problem” : what is the point about naturality and artificiality? Indeed, as we already said, our ethical approach asserts a connection with reality, with human actions, with pragmatism. In that perspective, aren't we wasting our energy wondering about a conceptual tension? In other word, we will try to find out why naturality and artificiality are in a certain way, an ethical stake.
The issue through which we will enter that points is : do we have to consider naturality and artificial"
