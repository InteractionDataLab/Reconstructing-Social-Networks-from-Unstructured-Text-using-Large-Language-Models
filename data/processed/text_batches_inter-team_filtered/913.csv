We have decided to use standard reporting genes - fluorescent proteins - as an output, but in theory, any protein could be an output. The signals to be included/ignored are chosen by trasformation with a proper vector and tratment with a corresponding antibiotic.

Project goals
Culture the endophytic bacteria in the roots of grass
Characterize the endophytic bacteria to find good candidates for transformation
Develop a transformation system for at least one of the endophytic bacteria
Clone or synthesize an ACC deaminase from bacterial or fungal sources
Transform the bacteria to allow for fluorescent labeling and ACC deaminase expression
Demonstrate that the transformed bacteria could reinfect a grass and persist in roots
Engineer a circuit to regulate expression as a response to abscisic acid
Demonstrate plant growth promotion in a model grass
Goal 1: Culture the endophytic bacteria in the roots of grass
Our team aimed to find bacteria which could promote plant growth through the enhancement of plant growth promotion traits. We collected grasses, both wild and cultivated, and cultured the bacteria inside the roots after surface-sterilization. This gave us bacteria which were intimately associated with the plant and ideally more permanent, as opposed to the more ephemeral association with bacteria on the root surface or soil.
Goal 2: Characterize the endophytic bacteria to find good candidates for transformation
We aimed to find bacteria that could be easily engineered to symbionts within the plant, an affect the plant’s phenotype as desired. We therefore characterized the antibiotic resistance, growth rate, and ACC deaminase activity of the strains we isolated. For our project, we aimed for susceptibility to chloramphenicol and streptomycin (corresponding to the two selection genes we used on vectors). The strain FCP2-01, originating from switchgrass, was ideal based on these characters.
Goal 3: Develop a transformation system for at least one of the endophytic bacteria
We aimed to contribute a endophytic bacteria of grasses as a part to the Registry. The critical component of this goal is a simple and effective transformation protocol . We explored techniques including conjugation and electroporation. After consultation with Peiqi Zhang, a graduate student in Dr. Ken Obasa’s lab at University of Florida, we developed an effective electroporation protocol. Our attempts at electroporation were based on protocol used successfully on other organisms. We"

Queens-Canada,2010,Team:Queens-Canada#contributing_-_-_TEXT.html," is alluring.
Hormones. The pseudocoelom bathes most tissues, and it's believed that the worm has a number of hormones that it uses to communicate between tissues. It might be possible to transmit stuff in here of our own devising. As of yet, we don't have a strategy for receiving molecules from the pseudocoelom by a cell, but a literature search helped us find a tag that works to introduce molecules into the pseudocoelom. You can find it in our pseudocoelom article . We have not personally tested this technique.
Genetics
Self-censorship. C. elegans supports RNAi , a technique that leverages machinery which enables complementary RNA molecules to destroy each other. RNAi is generally used to knock out genes by feeding the worm bacteria that produce the complementary RNAs, or soaking the worm in a large volume of these RNAs. Since integrating new DNA into the C. elegans chromosomes is difficult and time-consuming, it may make more sense to give the worm a plasmid that knocks out the mRNAs autonomically. To restore functionality of a protein knocked out in this way, especially a mutated version of such a protein, consider employing heavy use of synonyms (alternative codons for the same amino acid). See our article on RNAi.
Variable UTRs. We've only provided a single 3' UTR in our kit (a synthetic modification of unc-54's 3' UTR). However, it's known that UTRs play a role in tissue specificity and expression strength by binding various factors. A better understanding of these UTRs, or even just a larger variety of them, stands to be a very useful project.
Modular promoters. Heidelberg stole the show in 2009 by creating a detailed set of promoter elements that could be arranged to produce predictable and precise variations in strength for HeLa cells. It would be very cool if something like this could be done for worms, especially if this could also include tissue specificity. The potential for doing something similar for 3' UTRs is also alluring.
Biosynthesis
The hindgut (intestine) of C. elegans can be targeted with expression patterns that place emphasis on the front and back regions. In combination with the intestinal export tags used for secreting proteases and other digestive enzymes, this provides an environment of approximately pH 5 in which multi-step biosynthesis could be possible.
Fundamental Tools

Should it be allowed that students are working on such dangerous and maybe far-reaching projects? Demur of several german newspapers like the ZEIT or
Ethical problems if specific method getting patented
Problem: imprecise, broad and vague; have to create a checklist on my own - none known yet; have to acquaint myself with the methods of the wetlab - very precise knowledge is condition
This approach was dismissed. Too unprecise. Too much work for too less outcome. Canceling of the former wetlab-project.
Second concept
The canceling of the former wetlab-project and deciding for the new project gives the ethical reflexion new possibilities especially because the team wants to work with mice. So there is a wide and grown field of ethical discussion and reflexion about animal experiments. I can use the literature and the highly emotional discussion as basis for the reflexion on the specific wetlab-project.

So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists. Biotechnologists worked under the supervision of The National Institute of  Chemistry while synthetic biologists worked under the supervision of The Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology. We also held regular team meetings during which we  organized our teamwork and exchanged our results and experience.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different mediums to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different mediums again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy"

This meant that the iGEM team got the opportunity to explain their project to people from small to large in more detail. This was a great chance to bring the Synthetic Biology more closely to the general public. The project got positive response by the residents of Darmstadt and pushed and inspired even more the young scientists.

7.17 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fifth Protocol
I) Purpose
To test the fifth protocol for applying 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inducing mutation.
II) Expected Outcome
- A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
- A few random mutations that produces smaller phage and consequently larger plaques during selection with x8 agar.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL); 50mL of M9+ prepared by the large phage group; BL21 overnight; 5.15 phage stock; x8 top agar; uracil solution (2.5mg/mL); adenine solution (5mg/mL).
IV) Procedure
1) Applying the mutagen (7.17)
- From 5.13 Determining E coli concentration with spectrophotometer, we know that the concentration of E coli BL21 in a liquid overnight culture is about 3.12E8 cell/mL. But we need to resuspend it in M9+ medium.
- To make the M9+ suspension medium supplemented with the appropriate amount of uracil and adenine, 200uL of adenine solution and 400uL of uracil was add 50mL of M9+.
- Combine the BL21 overnights so that there is 70mL in one tube. This allows for an equal bacterial concentration in each tube in the next step.
- Label 7 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 1, 1C, 3"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Based on his advice, we reached a conclusion that application of our device will be limited to 'farmland where high concentrations of salt begin to accumulate', not to 'redeem farmland from complete salt damage'. In other words, we decided to prevent the problem of salt damage, not to resolve a problem which already occurred. Also, Prof. Funakawa said, ""Some of the farmers who are fighting against salt damage dilute the wastewater that sucked out the salt in the soil with fresh water and then reuse it again"" If we could combine it with our device, we can reduce the salt concentration of the wastewater, and it can be reused as leaching water once again. By doing this, we expect that we could possibly carry out desalination work without worrying about water resources, and it will become possible to work more effectively against salt damage more and more. We decided to use our device to desalinate wastewater.
1-3 Where to apply device
As explained in the Human Practice, freshwater is abundant in Japan, so the opportunity to use our device domestically was considered to be very limited. However, salt damage is not only a problem in Japan, but it is also a problem to be considered on a global scale. We thought that somewhere in the world there might be places that need such a desalination system so we decided to talk with a researcher who knows a lot about salt damage occurring overseas.
First of all, we asked Prof. Ishida who has been studying salt damage for years while conducting field surveys on desertification and salt damage in the Aral Sea. According to his story, salt damage causes damage not only to agricultural crops but also causes direct influence on the human body, so salt damage solution in arid lands was found to be a very important task. Also, from his story, we learned that the amount of river water is insufficient, such that the water of the Aral Sea is depleted. We considered that our system, which has the feature of conserving water, would be effective for dry grounds.
Deteriorated soil in arid land(provided by Prof.Funakawa)
Next, we asked Prof. Fujimaki of Tottori University about the applicability of our system to the dry land. ""In the plains of Iraq and Egypt, which have been facing salt damage from ancient times, draining facilities are pretty popular, and we can recollect nearly 100% of wastewater when it does not rain heavily."" We confirmed that"

Plasmid Design
For the analysis and characterization of PtNTT2, a total of eleven plasmids were designed and cloned based on initial research and the computational analysis. The coding sequence of PtNTT2 was codon optimized using the IDT Codon Optimization Tool and ordered as two gBlocks. Using overlap extension PCR, the two gBlocks were put together and inserted into pSB1C3 using Gibson Assembly. The truncated versions of the transporter as well as the versions with new signal peptides were constructed using primers and Gibson Assembly.

The lacUV5 promotor was used together with a strong RBS (BBa_B0034) for all parts. All variants except for pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were also tagged with GFP (BBa_E0040). cMyc was used as a linker (based on BBa_K2082221).
All plasmids except pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were tagged with the same cMyc-GFP construct for imaging and western blots. cMyc was used as a linker to allow the targeting of the fusion protein with two separate antibodies, an anti-GFP antibody and the anti-cMyc antibody. The GFP part was taken from BBa_B0034, while the cMyc fragment was taken from BBa_K2082221. The fusion proteins were assembled using Gibson Assembly. A schematic overview of the design of the different plasmids is shown in figure (2).

Thus co-expression of these two plasmids in E. coli yields                         FGE and Nb-Tag, while FGE catalyzes Nb-Tag, and finally we will obtain Nanobodies with                         aldehyde-based labels.[2] In this way, the Nanobodies we obtained have specific labels that are                         not found in all other proteins: aldehyde groups. This greatly simplifies our subsequent                         operations without the need for complicated purification steps; there is no need to worry about                         non-specific reactions; modularization of Nanobodies greatly simplifies the subsequent steps                         while increasing the choice of modification. We tried to bind the Nanobody to C18-NH-NH2 because                         the C18 molecule itself has a good ability to induce liquid crystal molecules. It can be said                         that our work combines the specific binding ability of Nanobodies with the ability to induce                         C18. Our subsequent liquid crystal experiment also proved this.

Overview
Recently, liquid crystal sensor, as a novel and unique optical sensor, has the advantages of                         simple structure, low cost, no need for marking and portability, and provides a simple and                         sensitive online real-time monitoring platform for biomolecule detection. The liquid crystal                         sensor uses the object to be tested to change the orientation of the vertically aligned liquid                         crystal molecules induced by the surface active molecules (Fig. 6),then making liquid crystal                         optical imaging change, therefore we can complete the detection of the target.

To make a realistic model, we need the following parameters: diffusion coefficients and wind velocity (when we want to take it into account). The production rates of the molecules were calculated earlier (you can find them here ).
The diffusion and convection can be obtained by solving the convection-diffusion equation, where D is the diffusion coefficient and u is the velocity of the solvent, in this case air, and ∇ is a gradient and ∇2 is divergence:
To solve the equations, we used COMSOL Multiphysics. It is a finite element analysis, solver and Simulation software/FEA Software package for various physics and engineering applications, especially coupled phenomena, or multiphysics. COMSOL is a very user-friendly software, which guides you step by step through the program.
The following steps need to be taken in COMSOL to calculate the transport of the molecules.
First we chose the physics. To calculate diffusion, we used Chemical Species Transport, more precisely Transport of Diluted Species in 3D. We did a time dependent study to see how the molecules spread over time. Because of the constant flux, it is also possible to use a stationary solver.
Next, we implemented the geometry of the trap. (See Fig.1) To know the effect on the environment, we can also add a block of air next to or around the trap.
Figure 1: Geometry of the trap
Diffusion coefficients can be found in literature. We used an estimation based on a calculator [4]. This resulted in a diffusion coefficient of 0.148 cm²/s for formic acid and 0.0912 cm²/s for butyric acid.
We can also take convection into account by accounting for the wind, therefore as an estimation, we checked the average velocity and direction of the wind in the proper region.
To solve the differential equation, we also need to specify boundary conditions in the calculation domain.
If we take the wind into account, the faces perpendicular to the wind are considered as in- and outflow.
The face representing the ground in the air block does not have any flux through it, because the diffusion coefficient of our molecules is much larger in soil than in air.
The three remaining faces of the air block have open boundary conditions, the flux is not known there.
All the faces of the trap have a zero flux boundary condition, except for two which will be explained below.
The face of the trap that is connected to the outside has an open boundary condition.
The lower face of the trap, where the molecules are released, has a"

Examples of Additional Control Systems
The synthetic transcriptional control system that we have added to the registry is a powerful tool, as its elements could be put together in an enormous variety of ways.  These are some possibilities that we have drawn up:
up-limiter - upregulates a gene when the expression falls below a certain level
middle-manager- a combination limiter and up-limiter, it keeps a gene's expression between two threshold levels
dual limiter - regulates two genes simultaneously based on the induction of one.
limiter device as a regulatory bridge between two pathways- the induction of one gene causes threshold regulation of another
directed evolution for transcriptional phenotypes - express a cell-death gene if the level of induction a given gene is above or below a threshold level

     This distrust is a distrust of human, or human rationality itself.
     One thing all synthetic biologist s are subconsciously doing is getting closer to perfection. In the definition of synthetic biology given by iGEM (see preface: Beyond Artificial Evolution), it contains the word ""improve"". What is the theoretical end of constant improvement? Of course, it's perfection. Good->better->best. Though it sounds a bit pitiful for those who aspire high but fall low, but perhaps it's better than not aspiring at all. After all what is the ultimate end of the endless bettering and modifying of the already existing organisms? Synthetic biologists, or the bio-engineers, take what they think is better from other organisms and engineer it into the target organism. This is molding the nature according to a certain subconscious standard: perfection, whether it is virtually reached or not.
     Because of this, there is the issue of “playing God” that has already been discussed by many.
     But then again, it reminds me of the Old Testament, the story of God and Lucifer, and it is astounding how similar the claim sounds. God created Lucifer, the prime angel, the most perfect being, one which God loves the most. And he gives Lucifer something like freewill, that’s when Lucifer got out of control. He “…wants to be like the most high.”[] i.e. he wants to rise above the will of God. Qur'an said he led a bunch of other angels and rebelled, and of course, Lucifer is condemned to an environment that God has to design especially for him, the Hell. We can see the famous excerpt:
""How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.""
     It just sounds oddly familiar. Change the protagonists in the story into scientists and their carefully engineered or synthesized organisms, wouldn"

Sensing
This part of the BaKillus-concept focuses on specific pathogen detection. Here we use quorum sensing to specifically recognize the presence of certain pathogens. The major aim of this subproject is transferring the quorum sensing two-component systems AgrC-II/AgrA of Staphylococcus aureus and ComDE of Streptococcus pneumoniae into Bacillus subtilis, thus creating a pathogen detecting strain. With this strategy we will trigger our killing strategies only if a threshold concentration of autoinducers, produced by pathogens, is present in the environment Thereby we aim to drastically increase the specificity of our antimicrobial strategies compared to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.
Background
Staphylococcus aureus
Virulence of S. aureus
S. aureus is living as a commensal in humans with a prevalence of up to 30% of the population in Europe (1) . It is also responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from skin infections to life threatening toxinosis and is quickly adapting to the use of common antibiotics by becoming resistant.   This dual lifestyle and the expression of a multitude of virulence factors is tightly regulated by a process termed quorum sensing (2) .
Quorum sensing in S. aureus
Quorum Sensing is a mechanism of bacterial cell-cell communication, granting bacteria the ability to measure the density of their surrounding cell population, and react to this by upregulation of specific genes.  In S.  aureus this process is one of the major regulator of its virulence, making sure that energy-costly virulence factors are only produced when a large enough number of pathogens is present to overcome host-defence mechanisms.
In this mechanism a certain peptide termed autoinducing peptide (AIP) is produced from a pro-peptide called AgrD and further processed and exported by a membrane protein AgrB to create a cyclic AIP. When a certain threshold concentration of AIP in the environment is reached, AIPs activate the receptor-histidine kinase AgrC.  Upon induction AgrC phosphorylates the intracellular response regulator AgrA with its cytosolic histidine kinase domain (3) . Phosphorylated AgrA then binds to distinct sites in the P2 and P3 promoter-region and activates these promoters. (2) The P2 promoter activates transcription of the agrBDCA-Operon and thereby represents a positive feedback-loop. The P3 promoter activates transcription of the RNA-III transcript, involved in virulence gene expression (4)"

We have assisted other iGEM team in several dimensions. Interaction between iGEM teams definitely benefits the growth of synthetic biology. At the same time, we are very glad to achieve iGEM’s core value, which is to share resources with other teams.
Zamorano
This year Zamorano team focused on making a toxin that targets insects. They believe our biobricks from last year’s project, which are BBa_K1415202, BBa_K1415205 and the BBa_11415206 could be really helpful to them, hence they contacted us through our Facebook fan page. Our team shipped it to them immediately. Hopefully, our parts can really aid their project.
HSNU-TAIPEI
This year is HSNU's first year to participate in the iGEM competition. As a high school iGEM team, they demonstrated extreme team spirit. We sent them previous year iGEM kits and helped them finish their experiment more smoothly. Providing them with our full help, we hope that more high school students will participate in the iGEM competition.
Mindao
We helped Mindao when they called for helping them analyze protein amino acid component.
NTHU ( National Tsing Hua University )
We promoted the iGEM competition in NTHU. Also shared experience on how to run an iGEM team by inviting them to participate in our meet up. Moreover, we invited them to visit our lab. All of the help contributed lead to them forming their first iGEM team and they are going to join the giant jamboree in 2016.

As one of the only teams working with yeast, we had difficulty finding another iGEM team with whom to troubleshoot research and/or design issues. However, one of our goals this summer was to assess and expand public knowledge about synthetic biology through education and outreach, and in order to achieve this it is important that scientists be equally aware and up-to-date in their understanding of the field. To this effect, we have participated in two surveys assessing our understanding of various aspects of synthetic biology work.
We participated in the outreach efforts of the following teams:
Virginia
University of Virginia iGEM created a survey about biocontainment practices and knowledge, titled ""Virginia iGEM Biocontainment Survey,"" which our team participated in.
Munich United
Munich United created a survey on entrepreneurship in iGEM entitled ""Enabling Factors in Biotech."" Our team participated in this survey as well."

CUHK joined in since 2010, and HKBU participated in 2009 in cooperation with HKU (""Synthetic biology project,"").
Biotechnology Industry
Because of the predominance of market forces and source of capital, biotechnology industry in Hong Kong has been growing in recent years. According to the Innovation and Technology Commission, there are approximately 250 to 300 biotechnology-related companies in Hong Kong. They are mainly related to health-care business such as pharmaceuticals, traditional Chinese medicine, health-care products, and medical devices and diagnostics. These companies work on product research, manufacture, marketing and sales (""Innovation and technology,"" 2013).
Fascinated by the mature business operation environment and close relationship with China, a market with great potential, more international biotechnology companies are attracted to set their offices in Hong Kong. It is foreseeable that biotechnology industry will be much bigger in the coming future.
Biotechnology Industry Funding
Hong Kong government does invest on biotechnology and scientific researches by providing funding even though the amount is relatively low compared to that of the business sector. They also established the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) aiming to upgrade Hong Kong’s technological level and promote innovative ideas so as to increase the competitiveness of the economic activities. It provides the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) which grants various technology areas. According to the report on 30th June 2013, HK$ 7.5 billion (around US$ 970 million) was funded to 3376 projects in different technology areas. Among them, HK$ 462.1 million (around US$ 59 million) was invested to support 223 biotechnology projects. The ITF also granted HK$588.3 million (around US$ 76 million) out of total HK$7.5 billion (around US$ 970 million) to the industrial sector of biotechnology (“Innovation Technology,” 2013).
ITC also provided Applied Research Fund which gave funding support to technology ventures and research projects that have commercial potential. In 1993, the government invested HK$ 750 million (around US$ 96 million) to the funds. However, the fund ceased making new investments in the end of March in 2005.

Most of the patients desire to try the new drugs, but the amount of patients who meet genetic testing standards and requirements of targeted therapy are still limited. Therefore it needs the joint effort of various communities to promote the development of therapeutic targeting drugs and enlarge its covering. At the same time, efforts should be made to diminish the cost of molecular targeted therapy as much as possible, becoming affordable for more patients and families and permitting continuation of more lives.
Interview with patients
Ms. Chen (60-year-old)      Gastric adenocarcinoma sufferer
Ms. Chen primarily realized her disease due to sudden hemafecia. After a thorough check, she was told that she has got poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. She had surgery on Dec. 22nd, 2013, removed the 2/3 of the stomach. In May this year, she suffered a plummet of her weight, from more than 140 pounds to less than 90. Her gastric cancer recurred. She ate less, and one examination showed that cancer cells could be found in 13 different pieces of tissues in her.
Ms. Chen’s treatment now mainly depends on chemotherapy, while cooperates with oral drugs simultaneously. Chemotherapy treatment period is 21 days of hospitalization, followed by 3 days infusion (Oxaliplatin) for about 7-8 hours per day. Her medication cycle is to take oral medications (made in Japanese) for 15 continuous days, then withdraw for 1 week, then circulate.
She chose imported drugs for chemotherapy (import drugs are at her own expense, while domestic drugs can be partly covered by medical compensation). Although imported drugs have relatively limited side effects, as it can prevent hair loss, there are still some adverse reactions like nausea and vomiting, and she felt numb hands and feet. Monthly cost is around 8-10k RMB (around 1300$).
She has adapted gene detect to find pathological cause, and she has more in-depth knowledge of molecular targeted drugs. Yet because the examination results showed that her gene type does not match targeting drugs, thus she gave up targeted drug therapy. When told that targeted treatment costs about 30k RMB (around 4500$) per month, she considered it as acceptable and affordable.

The class ReadSBMLFile is used to extract all useful data from a SBML file and send them to the class “val_func”. Since each class represents one term of the the expression. all the terms will be push into a vector. In another word, another container has been created used to place a list of ""val_func"", of course you can realize that Nth list of ""val_func"" accommodates all the informations related to Nth species in this Biological system.

Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," have been growth also on the CRB and TET plates. We believe we did not see growth on CRB and TET because the DNA concentration might have been too low or they may have needed to incubate longer. The second One Tube mixture (Figure 3, middle) contained only 3 plasmids with the same antibiotic resistance, pAMB1+KAN, pMB1+KAN, and p15A+KAN, and was plated on a single KAN plate. This was done to focus on the effect of transforming multiple plasmids with the same antibiotic resistance. These tests allowed us to determine that the colored reporter system was an effective method of determining which plasmids were present in the bacteria. However, the absence of colonies on TET and CRB plates showed us that we may need higher concentrations of some plasmids relative to others to generate more obvious results.
Rice University performed the same initial tests independently. Their One tube had 8 different assemblies, as described above. This reaction was plated on 4 different plates, each with a different antibiotic. This was to ensure only the E. coli that had picked up each specific assembly would grow on each plate. The results in Figure 4 show that E. coli grew with active reporter genes on the KAN and CAM as well as on the CRB plate. Their CRB plate was left to grow longer than ours, which might be why they saw positive results. TET was not plated because Rice University did not have the antibiotic available. The second One Tube contained was also used by Rice and this was plated on a single KAN plate. This collaborative effort allowed us to see that results produced in other labs would be comparable to ours, and the Rice team was able to provide feedback on how we could improve the protocol we provided them.  This feedback was integrated into our project design.

Growth can be seen on this kanamycin-containing LB plate. It should be noted that two distinct colony morphologies are present. Neither showed distinct colored or fluorescent phenotypes — some colonies were lightly colored.
Though we built the plasmid kit in E. coli because it is a reliable and easy to use model organism, the kit is actually designed for non-model organisms. To ensure that the plasmids and method of transforming many plasmids at once was applicable outside of E."

And we also collect views of the public on the popularity of allergen testing and the privacy of personal allergen information. As the bar charts demonstrated below, over 36% of respondents highly agree that allergen testing is worth popularizing while approximate same proportion of respondents highly disagree that the personal allergen information should be accessible to the public. This result implies us that respondents expect the popularity of allergen testing but also worry about the privacy protection of personal allergen information.
Opinions on whether allergen testing should be popularizing are divided.
Summary
The analysis of the questionnaire survey results helps us to point out the characteristics of the sample, which also makes contributions to evaluate our sampling methods. It also gives us follow inspirations about our human practice activities and project developments.
As the result of survey, the allergen testing is not as popular as we expect in China. So, we tend to design a human practice activity to popularize knowledge about allergy and allergen testing. The targeted population should be those who suffer from allergy but have not taken it serious enough. Also, we want to share more knowledge about allergy to the kids because they are harder to express their feeling than adults. Thus, we choose to hold an exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum.
From the result, we have some ideas about the stakeholders and potential users of our project. They can be population who suffer from frequently allergy and are eager to find a convenient and cheap way to do allergen testing, at the same time the personal allergen information of them can also keep privacy safely. Besides, we should try to co-operate with hospitals and medical school to get more information about allergen testing methods used in clinic now and the feedback of patients.
We try to design a hardware that can ensure our testing can even run in family by people without professional knowledge. This kind of household allergen testing is ultimately convenient and cheap, also it protects the privacy of patient well.

EXPLORATORY RESEARCH
Our exploratory research both in-person with experts and reading through the literature shaped our understanding of the water water treatment process and hexavalent chromium contamination.
Dr. Matthews
The Baker Institute of Public Policy is a public policy think tank and a fantastic resource on Rice University's campus where students can research everything policy-related from foreign affairs to medicine. We visited the Baker Institute to speak with Dr. Kirsten Matthews. We compiled a list of questions and concerns we had about Cr(VI) and our proposed bacterial solution, including ""What is the general process of attaining public and government approval for biotechnology?"" and ""Who would regulate this kind of technology? As a result of our discussion with Dr. Matthews, we gained many insights about the broad spectrum of fields and human activities our project impacts.
Dr. Stadler
Dr. Lauren Stadler is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University. Her research focuses on advancing water reuse and energy recovery from wastewater using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines microbial ecology, environmental chemistry, and sustainability assessment.
Dr. Stadler was able to answer our questions about how water treatment plants work both in general and in Houston specifically. As we presented our ideas to her she helped us to think through potential challenges that could arise with the introduction of our bacteria into a treatment plant. These discussions shaped our design and helped to make it something that will actually be valuable to stakeholders.

We surveyed university students from science and art backgrounds, and to our surprise we found the unconventional idea that the integration of art and science has been well-accepted among the younger generation.
Encouraged by our survey , we interviewed many university professors who are experienced in popularization of both art and science, and also communicated with artists in the AS Research Center. During this investigative interview process we gradually got motivated and had a clearer idea of our story to explore the junction of art and science.
SAFETY & SECURITY
We discussed with Fankang Meng, who was a researcher in synthetic biology, about the biosafety of our project, and the general strategies of biocontainment of genetically modified organisms. We then sorted out and concluded our discussion contents into several aspects, wishing to provide suggestions on biosafety for iGEMers in the future.
More than a hundred years ago, in Wilde’s story, the rose was thrown into the gutter. But today, we UCAS-China iGEMers have picked the rose back up from the gutter, to offer everyone the chance to create their own rose. Inspired by idealism and stirred by imagination, facilitated by scientific gene circuits we develop a practical kit expecting that our work will inaugurate a new era of art and science further inspiring young scientists for future generations.

Explosive degradation/Transformation
In the degradation/transformation aspect of the project, we are focussed the development of two parts containing the bacterial enzymes, NemA and XenB. While there have been projects done utilising different bacterial enzymes 2 3 what is different about our project is that these enzymes have not been adapted for this purpose before and no previous projects have also looked at Nitroglycerin. These enzymes that we’ve selected have been shown to have the capacity to transform the toxic chemicals TNT and Nitroglycerin into non-explosive, non-toxic products.
See The Enzymes for more background information on NemA and XenB.
We provide proof of concept of our explosive remediating enzymes through their characterisation both in-vitro ( Enzyme Kinetics and HPLC ) and in-vivo ( in-vivo: Raman and in-vivo: Observations )
TNT Detection
In order to asses whether any reporter or enzyme part we made had a basis for comparison, we investigated the Xenobiotic Tolerance of our E.coli strains to gauge toxicity levels to TNT and NG.
We have designed a new and simple biosensor that could  be used to detect TNT  in the form of a modified hybrid promoter which functions like a TNT detection switch. We would aim to use this to turn expression of a reporter gene on or off depending on the presence of TNT in the environment.
See Detection of Xenobiotics for more information on the NemR promoter constructs.
In order to create what we think would be the most effective biosensor we have also chosen to further characterise the reporter iLOV which has numerous benefits over the commonly used GFP in many situations 4 )  . This was produced as a part on the iGEM database ( BBa_K6600004 ) by the Glasgow 2011 iGEM team.
See iLOV Characterisation for more information and our characterisation of the iLOV reporter.
Biosafety
We also thought about the use of this NemR promoter in the development of a kill-switch to prevent gene flow if we were to release our organism into the environment. Ideally, this would involve the organism of choice failing to produce an antidote to constitutively expressed fatal chemicals once the source of TNT has been extinguished.
See Kill Switches for some of our experiments testing kill switch ideas.

Halorhodopsin, a light-driven ion pump originated from Halobacterium, employs light to transport chloride ions into cells uni-directionally against osmolality. Since chloride ion is a ubiquitous and essential element in most biological systems, halorhodopsin has thefascinated property to transform solar energy, the most abundant energy in theworld, into intracellular chloride ion level. However, this specificity of halorhodopsinhasn’t been well regulated and characterized in the previous competition. It is of our great interest to characterize its properties, and eventually utilize them in our project, seeking the possibilities tobenefit synthetic biology and the human society.
 
In our project, we integrated halorhodopsininto functional biobricks. Based on the characterized properties ofhalorhodopsin, we have furthermore developed and implemented two innovativeapplications: Light-coupled computer-aided expression platform and entropy-mixingelectrical power generation. The exciting results show us the power and thepotential of this fascinating tool. We are glad to introduce our achievements inthe project session.
 
Besides the proof-of-conceptdesigns in our projects, any design with the linkage of light and chloride ionscan be accomplished by this tool. Thus, there are much more potentialapplications development. We believe that halorhodopsin would be an excitingand useful biobrick in the future.
Field: Project
Block: Background
Session: Pgad introduction
 
Pgad is chloride-sensitive promoter whichwas first discovered in Lactococcuslactis1, whichis a gram-positive bacterium which canlive in acidic environment. Pgad operon (Fig. 1) provideshydrochloric acid feedback mechanism to adjust intracellular metabolism, inorder to survive in acidic environment2. In thisoperon, gadC is glutamate-gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter and gadB is glutamatedecarboxylase. They are both involved in intracellular pH regulation andco-expressed in the same operon under the control of Pgad2. The genebefore Pgad, named gadR, which is constitutively expressed under thecontrol of PgadR, is a positive regulator of Pgad coupledgenes while intracellular chloride is level elevated2. Whenintracellular pH decreases, the expression of gadB and gadC is enhanced due tothe action of gadR and confers glutamate-dependent acid resistance in L. lactis2.

The Biobrick we used to realize this experiment was firstly designed by the iGEM Team of Groningen in 2010 to simplify the cloning step by detecting internalized plasmids, which self-circularized without integration of the desired insert. Bacteria, which internalize self-circularized Plasmids will produce red colonies, so these undesired bacterial colonies can be avoided in the next steps of the experiment, to be sure of using the right construct.
Experiment Number 2: Glowing Bacteria Lamp
Figure 3: Structure of the Luciferase
In the second experiment students should perform the transformation, which they learned in experiment one, with the ""Luciferase""-Plasmid. The Plasmid encodes genes for Kanamycin resistance and a lux - gene cassette containing a protein-fluorophor called Luciferase. Another very important point is that the lux-gene is subordinated to a L-Arabinose Operon. After the transformation of the DNA-Plasmid has taken place, students should learn how to cultivate bacteria in liquid LB-Medium and how to induce protein expression by using L-Arabinose as an inductor of the L-Arabinose promoter. The glow of the Luciferase can already be observed after a few hours.
Experiment Number 3: Banana Odor Generator
Figure 4: Results of Experiment three
In the third experiment, all aspects learned in the previous experiments come together. The ""Banana-Odor""-Plasmid encodes an enzyme called Alcohol-Acetyltransferase I. This enzyme is able to convert Isoamylalcohol into Isoamylacetat, which spreads the odor of banana. Additionally the plasmid harbors a resistance gene for Kanamycin and an inducible L-Arabinose promoter, which controls the expressions rate of the Alcohol-Acetyltransferase I enzyme. The students should transform the ""Banana-Odor""-Plasmid into Escherichia coli, cultivate the successfully transformed bacteria in a larger scale and in the end, induce the protein expression by using L-Arabinose. In the last step, the students should add the substrate Isoamylalcohol to the cell culture, so the produced enzyme can transform it into Isoamylacetat.
The Biobrick, which spreads the odor of banana, after transforming its substrate, was first established by the iGEM Team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006 . Their aim was to produce different compounds in Escherichia coli that smell fragrant. Another"

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"Model was 0, which means there was no steady-state flux for the objective selected i.e. optimal pathway for PHB. The product (PHB) was shown as a dead-end metabolite. In order to solve this problem, we found that we needed to add exchange or transport reactions for the removal or secretion of PHB from the cell. This will allow the cell to secrete and synthesize PHB at steady-state fluxes.
Figure 3. PHB shown as a dead end product after being synthesized in E. coli.
Future Directions
In order to get conclusive results for finding optimal pathway(s) for the synthesis of PHB at steady-state fluxes, it is necessary to introduce a secretion system into the model. Thus, the solution will be to use fastGapFill , which is used to find missing reactions and metabolites from the universal biochemical reaction database (e.g. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for a given (compartmentalized) metabolic reconstruction. After addition of the transport reactions, the model will have to be validated before it can be used to inform lab experiments.
Kinetic Modelling
We began developing a kinetic model for PHB synthesis via beta-oxidation. We hoped to identify the rate-limiting steps in our reaction pathways and thereby identify whether upregulation of fadD and fade genes would increase the rate of reaction for the PHB-synthesis pathway via β-oxidation. We used Micheles-Menten enzyme kinetics to model the reactions of the beta-oxidation pathway. However, we ran into a number of challenges including lack of reliable data for β-oxidation of fatty acids in E.coli as well as how complex the model was becoming.
Methods
We used the SymBiology toolbox in MATLAB to build the model and used kinetic parameters obtained from literature or online databases.
Figure 4: Visual Representation of beta oxidation reaction pathways
Results
Our online search from literature, databases, and pre-existing models revealed that there was not much information on the kinetics of many enzymes and pathways for PHB-synthesis via β-oxidation pathway. Therefore, we were unable to obtain informative results even when different organisms' kinetic parameters were used to substitute values for key enzyme reactions. While building the model, we also learned that the fadD and fadE genes were most active for long chain fatty acids and therefore we built our model based on using oleic acid as the substrate to test the activity of these genes for metabolism of long-chain fatty acids in human fecal waste. However, due to time restraints and lack of accurate kinetic parameters in"

iGEM Analysis
Summary
We believe that iGEM has proven its added value to the synthetic biology world. However, we also think that there are always ways to optimize the potential of iGEM even more. Therefore, we have written an analysis about iGEM with many recommendations about, for example, new medal requirements and possibilities to increase the scientific impact of iGEM further.
Below you can find an example of, in our opinion, the most important or interesting recommendation or finding of every section:
Competition: Currently, modeling is not a required part of the competition; therefore many teams do nothing with it. Probably, this is partly because many teams have no members with experience in modeling. These teams would be extremely disadvantaged if modeling becomes a hard requirement. Therefore, we propose to add an extra possible requirement about modeling that teams can meet to win a gold medal. Teams will get an extra motivation to do something with modeling in this way, whithout making it an hard requirement.
Technology & Entrepreneurship: Only 35% of the iGEM project is used for further research and less than 4% is used for a business application. We would advise to make it obligatory for iGEM teams that want to win a gold medal, to write a project summary in a specific format that can be bundled after the jamboree. This would give external parties an easy way to see what the results are from the ‘best’ iGEM projects.
Community, Sharing & Responsibility: To increase the collaborations within iGEM, with other scientists and other stakeholders, sharing knowledge is of great importance. Scientists in general should bear in mind that they have some sort of responsibility in sharing knowledge. We have made a timeline with recommendations for collaborations and interactions, for example encouraging teams to meet up with each other and switching to Slack instead of the forum. Besides that we have noticed that the presentation of different iGEM stories is quite different, so to increase uniformity and the understandability on where to find information, we have proposed a way of presenting an iGEM story.
Education & Teamwork: Based on the survey we can conclude that there are many teams that are engaged in educational activities. Some of those teams have developed very interesting tools, that could also be very useful for other iGEM teams. We advise to make those tools more accessible. For example, iGEM could make a page with tools about education, the so called toolbox page. We have made an example of such a page that iGEM can use as a"

When we use engineered bacteria to alleviate IBD in vivo, the growth of bacteria must be tightly regulated. Therefore, we designed a cold shock kill switch that based on the toxin-antitoxin system mazEF. The rationale of this kill switch is relying on the mechanism that when E. coli is under stress, the maz-E will degrade faster than maz-F, so the relatively more maz-F will exert its toxicity. The cold shock promoter PcspA was linked with maz-F, so when the temperature is low, the maz-F will express while the maz-E stop expressing. Thus, we could kill our engineered E. coli when it escapes from human bodies. We inserted the reporter gene amilCP into the pColdI plasmid to characterize the performance of the cold shock promoter PcspA (Figure 9A). Then we inserted maz-F into the pColdI plasmid to build our kill switch (Figure 9B).

= 0.2 and then grow for 2 h at 37 ℃. It was then induced for 6 hours at 16 ° C or 37 ℃ under different concentrations of IPTG conditions (Figure 10). From Figure 10, the reporter gene was efficiently expressed at low temperature, which indicated that the effective expression of the toxin gene mazF and the blocking expression of the anti-toxin gene mazE at low temperature can kill our engineered bacteria in time. Although the cold shock promoter PcspA can prevent the most of the leakage expression at 37 ℃, the weak leakage expression of mazF may still cause the functioning engineered probiotics being killed inside human bodies. Therefore, the introduction of the anti-toxin protein mazE is necessary to effectively antagonize the potential leakage expression of the cold shock promoter PcspA.

Due to the innovative nature of our project to expand the genetic code by adding new bases, our team faced novel challenges.  One major issue was that this kind of project is far-off topic in our home university. Thus, we were grateful to cooperate with more  than twenty scientists from all over the word. This was a great benefit for our work. Besides gaining important insights into important best  practices, we kept in contact to leading experts to evaluate if our project can improve basic research methods. The feedback from  the scientists and partners improved our skills and influenced our work and the planning of our experiments in a great way. The figure below displays the most influential experts we contacted throughout our work. Below the figure, information on who they are and how they helped us are listed.

Assuming this is successful, we would move on to expressing both CDI systems from Enterobacter aerogenes into DH5-α individually and performing the same set of assays. What is different about this set of experiments is that we would have to construct the plasmids ourselves. What we planned on doing was fusing the CDI system from Enterobacter aerogenes with a switched toxin and immunity region and a pSK33 backbone. All-in-all, this would require the use of advanced techniques like: Gibson assembly, PCR (colony and overlap), and electroporation.
Competition Assay
Our main method of testing whether our CDI systems is through a cell-based competition assay. It consists of the following cell types:
Inhibitory strain (CDI+): Bacterial Strain transformed with designated CDI system
Target Strain (CDI-): Native bacteria from which the CDI system comes from
Positive Control: Something that already has the designated CDI system expressed and can properly inhibit the Target
Protocol
Grow all cells to correct growth phase in appropriate antibiotic
Positive control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth (LB) with antibiotic at 37 C
Inhibitor to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C
Negative control to OD600 = 0.35 in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth at 37 C
Target overnight (16 hours) in 50 mL Luria-Bertani broth with antibiotic at 37 C (Target OD600 is not important)
Mix inhibitor (or control) and target cell at a ratio of 10:1 (determined through concentration relation listed below) in LB without any antibiotic
Multiply the Mass Attenuation Constant for the bacteria with the reading obtained from the OD600 to get the cellular density of the target, use this to prepare a 10:1 ratio of inhibitor to target cells.
Incubate at 37 C at 225 rpm while plating samples at 0 and 4 hours after mixing

    Because we use nisA as promoter to express our parts, 0.5 ng/mL of Nisin is required to induce cell expression in all the following steps.
    Demonstration of msmK gene
    Copy msmK gene from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group with PCR. Construct msmK overexpression strain L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK with electrotransformation. Take strains L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 from glycerin tube kept under -80℃, dilute 1/25 in 2 x 10 ml fresh medium (30 °C). Grow until the OD600=0.4. Count their number of colonies per ml at pH 4.0 (More details can be seen in protocol).
    We can get the following results:
Fig 1 Number of colonies at acid stress (pH 4.0).
Fig 2 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.
    Demonstration of composite part msmK-cspD2
    It has been reported that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L. lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation.
    The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer. The process of acid stress and cold stress is similar with the above demonstration process.

AHUT_China,2018,Team:AHUT China#HP FOR SILVER_-_-_TEXT.html," unsaturated solution. The content of carbon dioxide in the solution was tested continuously according to the time of the gas entering, and this was used as the data source of our mathematical modeling.
First of all.By using MATLAB to conduct the correlation analysis of the experimental data,we found that the color readings (five dimensions: B, G, R, H, S) showed a certain linear correlation with the concentration of carbon dioxide.This conclusion is consistent with the other conclusion ,which obtains its conclusion by using lambert-beer's absorption law. That is, there is a certain relationship between the substance concentration and the color reading. Secondly, using the multiple regression of statistics to carry out regression analysis on the data, the relationship between the material concentration and the color reading (five-dimensional) is obtained, and the appropriate mathematical expression (or mathematical model) between them is determined as the empirical formula or regression equation.
A mathematical model for determining color readings and carbon dioxide concentration - a linear regression equation. Firstly, a linear regression model between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading is established. The residual of the model is large and the fitting effect is not good.
Considering establishing a nonlinear quadratic regression model.Using the rstool function modeling in the MATLAB statistical toolbox, and evaluating the pros and cons of the model by residual standard deviation and residual. In the final nonlinear quadratic regression model, the residual standard deviation is small, the prediction model is very good, and the residual of the model is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the multiple linear regression model. Therefore, the linear quadratic regression model is better than the linear regression model. The comparison of the errors of the two models shows that the nonlinear regression quadratic equation has higher precision.
In the process of project communication with each other, we learned that they had a little trouble in modeling. It may be that Northeast Forestry University-China did not fully consider the influence of external factors on the experiment, which led to some errors in the model establishment. Through our tests, we found that the lethal efficiency of their calculations was wrong. After we found the problem, we told them in time and helped them improve the model.
The Northeast Forestry University iGEM team (NEFU-China) also helped us to test the safe reliability of our model. Through this cooperation, the friendship between our two teams was strengthened and the progress of the project was promoted. Both sides regard it as a fairly successful collaboration.

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME"

Our inoculums look pleasantly cloudy, as expected. All except two. We freeze samples of the good ones in glycerol at -80 ºC in a wonderful fridge that could also easily house  a corpse (who knows?).
We start studying the protocols of our mini-prep kit to purify the BioBrick plasmids from our transformed cultures. They don't look that complicated but we have to do about 50; shoulders to the wheel!
We receive several BioBricks and the strains we had ordered: vainillin and rhlR BioBricks, two strains of B.subtilis, another strain containing VanM/N genes... people are being quite kind to us! We seed the bacteria and transform them with the BioBricks, depending on the format they come in.
Our mini-preps are ready at last after a hard day’s work, and we are able to leave some inoculums of DH5-a to prepare competent cells tomorrow.

Figure 1. The cellular neighborhood.
Initial Configuration: A certain number of dogs that have been immunized by our engineered bacteria are put randomly in an area at first moment.
The ability for spreading immunity: A dog has the ability to spread immunity if it is in the process of obtaining immunity or has been immunized. The variable for the expression of this ability is PRO whose values are between 0 and 1.
Value: If PRO increases to value1, the state-1 will  turn to state-2. If PRO decreases to value2, the state-2 will  turn to state-1.
The duration for a cell to maintain its state: The time for a cell to maintain its state in state-1 and state-2 are expressed as T1 and T2, respectively. Staying in different state, a cell has different ability to spread the engineered bacteria.
Evolution rules:
Free Walking: A certain percentage of cells will walk freely before every update. The cells which will travel are randomly selected. The travel distance is a random integer ranging from 1 to 20.
Updating Rules: The state transition of a cell depends on the current states of itself and its neighbors. The impact of a neighbor on the transition rate (PRO) of the present cell is inversely proportional to their Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance of adjacent cells is 1 while that of a diagonal is
. k is the spread coefficient that mesures the degree of impact that the adjacent neighbor cells have on the present cell.The calculation formula of PRO is as follows:
The rules of update are as follows:
We assume that the value of k is 0.01. With the increase of the number of initial immune dogs, the time needed for an area to reach a safe level (70% of the dogs have been immunized) is decreased. If we want the area to reach a safe level in 100 days, the percentage of immune dogs initially put should be larger than 1.2%.

Abstract
The goal of the fifth Interlab is to answer the following question: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD? By using two orthogonal approaches:  Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads and Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample. The experiment was carried out in ECUST under their group members’ help.  The strain we used for cell measurement was E. coli strain DH5-alpha and we transmitted 6 different plasmids, along with a negative control and a positive control in it.
The 8 plasmids are: BBa_R0040(Negative control), BBa_I20270(Positive control), BBa_J364000, BBa_J364001, BBa_J364002, BBa_J364007, BBa_J364008, and BBa_J364009 in the pSB1C3 backbone, all from the distribution kit.
Measurement and Result
Following the calibration protocol, we measured the absorbance of LUDOX CL-X as a reference. We also measured the  〖Abs〗_600 of dilution series of silica beads and fluorescence of dilution series of Fluorescein provided in the Interlab kit. The standard curves as well as OD600 reference points (Figure 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5) reached by these measurements are used to help us check whether our dilution in the cell measurement is in linear range.
Then after the transformation of the 6 devices to the strain, we picked 2 colonies from each culture and incubated overnight. The next day, we measured their absorbance and fluorescence before and after a 6-hour incubation in the 96 well plate. (Figure 2.1 2.2)
The following figures are fluorescene per OD and per particle. (Figure 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4)
The negative and positive control are adjusted to OD 0.1and then serial diluted until there are three samples for each colony with dilution factor 8×〖10〗^4, 8×"

Overview
Gene doping is the administration of exogenous genetic material for performance enhancement. Detection of gene doping requires identifying target sequences and detection windows. Our targeted sequencing method includes our novel dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein and requires a minimal set of guide RNAs aligning with gene doping sequences. As there are 10104 possible codon variations in our proof of concept target, the EPO gene, it is not feasible to target all possible sequences in practice. We therefore implemented a search function to identify areas with minimal variation within the sequence, which reduced the testing set to twelve sgRNAs. Second, we modeled the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood. From this model, we provided the laboratory with the time dependent concentration of the target DNA. Based on our wetlab sensitivity analyses, the model predicts that with microdosing, our detection method could effectively catch gene dopers.
1. Approach
We identified a threat in detecting gene doping that lays in the possibility of modifying the genetic sequence of a gene without changing the protein sequence produced. This allows gene dopers to creatively modify their DNA sequence in several possible combinations and complicates the design of detection methods. To combat this, the exon-exon junctions with the smallest possible variation need to be identified and sgRNA sequences generated to cover all possible combinations of one gene (figure 1).
Figure 1. Modified doping gene with introns removed. Exon-exon junctions are the target sites for the sgRNAs in our fusion protein.
Once the testing set of sgRNAs is generated for our fusion protein, we determined the time during which the detection of the gene doping DNA in an athlete’s blood"

Then we choose the constitutive promoter BBa_J23106 from part registry because it can express protein continuously so that we can have a relative steady co-culture system. The mSA part is from team 2016_Peking that gives us much help. Monomer streptavidin is much smaller than that of wild type and is easier to be used in the circuit. Based on above reasons, we designed plasmid J23106-INP-mSA-pSB1C3 (We call it JIM for short ) and transformed it into E.coli DH5α strain.
Fig.1 Electrophoresis result of expression vector. Lane 3&4 is pSB1C3-J23106-INP-mSA.  Lane1&2 is pYD1-BAP, lane 3&4 is pSB1C3-J23106-INP-mSA, lane5&6 is pYC230-BirA
The sequencing results confirmed that we successfully cloned the J23106-INP-mSA-PSB1C3 expression vectors, we transformed the target plasmids to DH5α for amplification.
Protein Expression Assay
If the protein is successfully expressed, they will be displayed on the extracellular mem-brane of the E.coli. Therefore, we can verify protein expression by detecting whether INP-mSA exists in the total outer membrane protein.
We used the Fractionation Separation to extract three components of the outer membrane protein, the intimal protein and the cytoplasmic protein of engineered E.coli and negative control. Further Western Blot aim to confirm the previous result specifically and We choose to use horseradish peroxidase-biotin because it has the specific ability to bind INP-mSA.

Cornell,2014,Team:Cornell#project#background#lead_-_-_TEXT.html," or above 10μg/dL.[8]
Lead can usually only enter the body through ingestion, which is why pollution of drinking water supplies is of primary concern.  When ingested at high enough concentrations, lead can be acutely toxic causing neurological damage and death. In 2008, 18 children in Dakar, Senegal died of acute lead poisoning associated with the recycling of lead car batteries.[9] Others associated with the recycling facility displayed symptoms ranging from an upset stomach to involuntary convulsions.[9]
Ithaca Gun Factory:
Originally founded in 1883 by Henry Baker, a towering brick smokestack stands as the only remnant of a once-bustling production facility. The Ithaca Gun Company was famous across the world for its shotguns used by Annie Oakley and John Philip Sousa. Throughout its history of production, the factory emitted immense amounts of lead into the surrounding ground. In fact, a 2003 EPA assessment found the need for the removal of 2370 tons of the heavy metal. This mass is roughly equivalent to that of a space shuttle before launch.[6] As a result, the Ithaca Gun Company area underwent a lead cleanup project in 2004. However, two years later, surface levels of lead were tested and contamination was as high as 184,000 ppm--460 times the goal set by the EPA for the 2004 cleanup.    The lead pollution seeped into the Cayuga Watershed and has been a common issue ever since.[10] Even more disturbing, this lead contamination is currently located directly next to Ithaca Falls, a popular swimming and fishing site for locals and Cornell students alike. Cornell University, which use to own this property, sold it to the town from $1, so that the EPA could declare it a national Superfunds site, and pay for the cleanup necessary in the years to come.
Current Remediation Techniques
Water Filters: The main method currently employed in limiting our consumption of lead via drinking water is through the installation of reverse osmosis, distillation, or chemical (carbon, activated alumina) water filters,[11] at scales ranging from industrial to in-home implementation. In homes with lead components in water piping systems, if water has been relatively stagnant for up to 6 hours, it should be flushed through the system to avoid ingesting built-up lead.[12] Increased water corrosivity, influenced by pH,[13] generally results in a higher lead content.
Redox media, non-chemical water treatment: This fluid treatment passes the lead through a proprietary filter, causing a redox"

ACP of class 2 DD is about 40 animo acids shorter than class 1, which cannot form a polymerization area. Having the similar length with class 1 DD, KS of class 2 is   unable to form a spiral structure domain coiled coil due to its strong polarity. Therefore, the class 2 DD have no dimer, even though all of their structures are of   even numbers.
There are two alpha helix existing in the upstream and downstream of the class 2 DD separately. KS has alpha A and alpha B at the head of domain, while ACP has alpha 1   and alpha 2 at its end (Figure. 2). In order to get closer and form tighter combinations, the alpha helices between alpha A and alpha B or between alpha 1 and alpha 2   form a sharp turn (sharp bend). This structure makes class 2 DD different from class 1 [3][4].
Figure 2: Structure of class 2 docking domain
Design:
As introduced, it is obvious that the Class 2 DD has more advantages, such as its shorter lengths, closer combinations, clearer effect of regulating protein   function and higher transfer efficiency in completing upstream intermediate. Therefore, we have selected the Class 2 Docking Domain as our part. Because of its   specificity as mentioned, the connections between different sets of ACP and KS are different. Typical PKS subunits are tightly homodimeric and contain one to six   modules each. They are thought to associate with other multienzyme subunits through contacts at their C and N termini to form the overall PKS complexes. For example,   the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), assembling the polyketide core of erythromycin A, contains three multienzyme subunits as DEBS 1, DEBS 2, and DEBS3, each of   which includes two extension modules [1][5]. We get the interest sequence of six pairs of DDs (DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6) by sequencing synthesis, and we   also add RFC 23 to insert restriction enzyme cutting sizes（Figure 3). At last, we built them to pSB1C3 vector.

Today the core algorithm of reverse engineering is proposed. We discussed possible approaches to realize these system identification requirements.
The very first thing emerge in my mind is Metropolis method and Monte Carol sampling. If we define an error function which serves as 'judging criteria', and a random number generator used for 'correction' or 'exploration', then we can basically get it running from pure theoretical view.

Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power to sweep away all the tiredness and stress, while the fascinating design works are the spring of imagination and creativity.
Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal"

When taking your synbio project to real applications, fast growth is crucial for viability. We took the concept of a DIY spectrophotometer and expanded it to a device that carries out three small scale fermentations simultaneously. With the files provided below you can build your own microfermentation platform, to compare the performance of our modified strain against a wild type or evaluate different growth media.

An important part of our project was the screening for substrates All this data was generated using a Hamilton robot for liquid handling. This robot enabled us to compare the growth characteristics Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisae. Such experiments are generally a great tool, to validate the growth on particular substrates or the degradation of toxic compounds. Furthermore, they can be used to compare different strains. However, we realized that it is a technology not everyone has access to.
To challenge this, we started a hardware project aiming to develop a cheap alternative to the Hamilton robot. A small device, that would enable hackerspaces and high schools to easily acquicire and compare growth data for their projects. To make this device as cheap as possible, we reduced the Hamilton to its key features:
Requirements for our robot
In order to carry out growth experiments automatically, our minimum viable product should have the following features:
OD-measurements
Aeriation
Stirring
Automatation
Data-logging
To provide a tool for higschools and hackerspaces, we imposed these additional requirements:

MT plasmid copy number effect
For the simulations presented in figures 1 and 2, the copy plasmid of each plasmid is assumed to be equal to 1; also, we assume that the concentration of one molecule in the volume of a cell should be approximately equal to 1 nM, so that ""(1 nM)*(plasmid copy number)"" should give a result the concentration of a promoter.
Here we show simulations varying the copy number of the plasmid containing MT (we used copy numbers 1, 5, 10 and 100) at 500 nM extracellular arsenic.

We want to assemble pKH1, which is a pSB1C3-derived plasmid containing pSB1C3-lacPromotor-BBa_B0034-bpsA(pMM64)-
BBa_B0034-svp(pMM65). Single fragments are amplified and cloned using a Gibson approach. We received Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae since S. lavendulae ATCC11924 has been shown to carry bpsA
[Takahashi 2007].
Fragment amplification for pKH1 (Konrad)
prepare TB medium for ON (for comparement with LB)
colony PCR for plated pMM64 and pMM65 strains from 2013-06-16
prepare combinatorial experiment with gibson cloning or CPEC (polysytronic expression of bpsA and svp in TOP10)
prepare primer for bpsA only plasmid for BAP1 validation
0.4 µl template
2x 5 µl Primer (1:10 dilution)
25 µl Phusion MM
14.6 µl H2"

Plasmid Miniprep of colonies from 8/9/17 COlony PCR's
Purpose: To isolate plasmids from colonies with correctly assembled PhoB, OhoR, Plant pho, and TNTR3
Protocol:
Colonies that showed positive bands from PCR were innoculated into broth cultures with chloramphenicol and grown up overnight.  Plasmid DNA was purified using the MST iGEM Lab Manual 2.5 Kitless miniprep protocol and suspended in 40uL of TE buffer.  2uL of sample of was run on Thermoscientific Nanodrop 1000.  Nanodrop results:
