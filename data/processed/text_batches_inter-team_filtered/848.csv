What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been the major concern to the public, to the companies and the researchers. Doubts and worries raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapidly growing of synthetic biology and iGEM community, more and more synthetic biology products are built with the widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service; we are facing unprecedented biosafety issue that unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment may cause an unexpected but definitely disastrous problem.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches[], holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most of the failures of the previous devices were caused by mutation and evolution of immune.
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible Horizontal Gene Transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the entire ecosystem, or the engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.[]
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, by using genetic circuits and logic gates, to establish biosafety devices which can apply to the real-world situation.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute the escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, they are both high and tunable in the ferment"

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," of a high RNA polymerase concentration we would expect the highest turn-off effect of the fluorescence. In Figure 6B we show the results of the real time measurements of the spinach fluorescence. As expected we can show that the ATP signal decreases rapidly in presence of a high concentration of polymerase. In contrast, if less RNA polymerase was applied, the measured fluorescence is much higher. To confirm the results of the fluorescence measurements, we analyzed the in vitro transcription reaction using denaturing acrylamide gels in addition (Fig. 6C). Similar to the fluorescent readout, we were able to identify the most intense bands in presence of high T7 RNA polymerase.
in vitro Transcription Using a Fluorescent RNA of Interest
To substitute the time-consuming analysis of in vitro transcription by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we established a second read-out system. Using this system we want to monitor RNA synthesis in real time (Fig. 7). For this purpose we applied a DNA transcription template which encodes the Malachite Green Aptamer
Baugh2000
. This aptamer binds to the malachite green dye and differs theoretically from the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 in its excitation and emission spectra.
Fig. 7. Real time monitoring of the RNA synthesis using a Malachite Green Aptamer.
A
To analyze RNA synthesis in real time we applied a DNA template encoding for the RNA of interest (ROI) and a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Both fragments are inserted between the promotor (T7) and the Malachite Green Aptamer (MGA). Inducing the hammerhead ribozyme allows cleavage during the in vitro transcription. Hereby two RNA fragments emerge, the ROI and the hammerhead ribozyme fused to Malachite Green Aptamer (HHR-MGA). Using such setup, the emitted fluorescence of the HHR-MGA will be independent on the applied ROI. Thus the fluorescence is induced by the Malachite Green Aptamer that can be applied to compare efficiencies of different RNAs at the same time.
B
As a proof of principle we performed transcriptions and monitored the malachite green fluorescence signal in real time.
C
To confirm the results of the fluorescence measurements as well as the transcription efficiency is not hampered by the malachite green dye, all in vitro transcription reactions were analyzed using denaturing acrylamide gels.
To analyze the functionality and fluorescent properties of the Malachite Green Aptamer we performed in vitro transcriptions and measured fluorescence in regular intervals. We prepared"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#NRPS_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesizes peptides via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The short peptides assembled by NRPS, termed non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), comprise a wide range of secondary metabolites, including commonly used antibiotics as well as metabolic and detoxifying enzymes [5, 6]. NRPs range in size from 2-48 amino acid residues [6, 7, 8] and are of remarkable structural variability. In contrast to the ribosomal synthesis pathway which is mainly restricted to the 21 proteinogenic amino acids [9, 10], NRPSs accept more than 500 different monomers as substrates, including non-proteinogenic, N-methylated and D-amino acids [11]. Although the functionality and structure of their synthesized products are of high diversity, NRPS are characterized by a common structural theme: their composition of distinct modular sections (reviewed in [12, 13]). Therefore, the study of NRPSs allows for the exploration of one of the fundamental principles of synthetic biology: modularity.
NRPS Are of Modular Structure
NRPS Are Organized in Biosynthetic Gene Clusters
The genes encoding for NRPS are organized in a large gene cluster [14], so called assembly lines. These contain i) the genes coding for the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, which can reach a size of up to 1.5 MDa e. g. cyclosporine [15], ii) genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the monomers to be incorporated into the NRP, and iii) tailoring enzymes introducing further modifications in the peptide [16]. Often,  the gene clusters code for more than just one peptide synthetase [17]. These co-encoded enzymes are commonly connected by communication domains in order to keep the structure of the assembly line [17]. Thus, the cloning of complete NRPS pathways is facilitated by the clustered structure of the NRPS encoding genes.
One Module - One Amino Acid
Each NRPS is organized in so called modules, where a single module serves as a catalytic unit responsible for the incorporating of one amino acid in the growing peptide chain. The order of the catalytic units defines the sequence and the chemical characteristics of the resulting NRP where the number and order of the units corresponds precisely to the number and order of the amino acids in the resulting peptide [15]. The modules itself are of comprised of smaller subunits termed domains. Each domain fulfills a distinct function in the assembly of the growing peptide chain [13]. The two levels of modularity - modules and domains are shown in"

COLLABORATIONS
Besides spending a whole summer in the lab and developing an own project, iGEM is about meeting new people, people with the same interests, the same motivation, the same dedication. Collaborations between team ensure the exchange of ideas, therefore helping the field of Synthetic Biology to be interdisciplinary and creative - the best conditions to give rise to revolutionary projects. We are very happy to met some of the team members from Freiburg, Aachen, Tuebingen, Marburg and London.

Michael from the iGEM team Aachen visited us in Heidelberg. Their team worked on the development of a real-time pathogen detection technique for what they have build their own fluorescence measurement camera. We provided our expression vectors to the iGEM team Aachen, which they used to express their part E1010-K1319003 , the human galectin-3 protein fused to mRFP. Nicely seen in Figure 1 and 2 the the intensity of the red color is significantly higher for the induced sample with pSBX1A30 compared to the uninduced ones. To ensure the right molecular mass of the fusion protein, a SDS gel was run as well (Figure 3).

Project goals
Culture the endophytic bacteria in the roots of grass
Characterize the endophytic bacteria to find good candidates for transformation
Develop a transformation system for at least one of the endophytic bacteria
Clone or synthesize an ACC deaminase from bacterial or fungal sources
Transform the bacteria to allow for fluorescent labeling and ACC deaminase expression
Demonstrate that the transformed bacteria could reinfect a grass and persist in roots
Engineer a circuit to regulate expression as a response to abscisic acid
Demonstrate plant growth promotion in a model grass
Goal 1: Culture the endophytic bacteria in the roots of grass
Our team aimed to find bacteria which could promote plant growth through the enhancement of plant growth promotion traits. We collected grasses, both wild and cultivated, and cultured the bacteria inside the roots after surface-sterilization. This gave us bacteria which were intimately associated with the plant and ideally more permanent, as opposed to the more ephemeral association with bacteria on the root surface or soil.
Goal 2: Characterize the endophytic bacteria to find good candidates for transformation
We aimed to find bacteria that could be easily engineered to symbionts within the plant, an affect the plant’s phenotype as desired. We therefore characterized the antibiotic resistance, growth rate, and ACC deaminase activity of the strains we isolated. For our project, we aimed for susceptibility to chloramphenicol and streptomycin (corresponding to the two selection genes we used on vectors). The strain FCP2-01, originating from switchgrass, was ideal based on these characters.
Goal 3: Develop a transformation system for at least one of the endophytic bacteria
We aimed to contribute a endophytic bacteria of grasses as a part to the Registry. The critical component of this goal is a simple and effective transformation protocol . We explored techniques including conjugation and electroporation. After consultation with Peiqi Zhang, a graduate student in Dr. Ken Obasa’s lab at University of Florida, we developed an effective electroporation protocol. Our attempts at electroporation were based on protocol used successfully on other organisms. We"

Thinking Beyond the Bench
Our team at Ivy Tech Community College of South Bend is very diverse. We have team members all over northern Indiana and southern Michigan. Being so close to the great lakes, we immediately thought of the problem of contamination when choosing an iGEM project. Many of us like to enjoy the outdoors and the outdoor water recreations. Activities such as boating, fishing and swimming come to mind. Something that many who do partake in such activities don’t realize is that contaminated water can be an issue to one’s health. Contaminated water cannot be seen nor is there a rapid detection method currently in place that keeps the public informed. The current method involves a laboratory method that can take three days to detect in which many people can become infected during this time frame. Often times water contamination detection does not occur until a problem arises.  We realize that the lack of instant detection can pose a risk for persons who enjoy recreational water, as well as anyone who needs clean water data.  We approached the problem dictated above by developing a fast acting detection method.  We needed to find a way to get the reaction time down to as fast as possible in hopes to keep people from becoming contaminated with bacteriophage viruses. Our approach to the problem of laboratory delivery did in fact create a more rapid detection time for virus specific coli phage. We have managed to take the three day in-lab detection time down to an in-field 3 hour detection timeframe. We have eliminated the need for expensive lab equipment and the time and risk associated with sample delivery to a laboratory.  While working on this project, we always had our local communities in mind. However we realized that recreational waters isn't the only place where safety is an issue. Our device could be used all over the globe. Not only can it be used in industrialized nations, but we could potentially help those in third world countries to make sure local reservoirs are safe to drink from.   We're all proud of the work we've done and the positive contributions it could have to local"

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Laboratory Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,", our spores can not germinate, so the risk of a rapidly spreading epidemic is negligible. Today it still seems ""easier"" to use directly know pathogens like e.g. Helicobacter pylori. Furthermore, the toxin will be the toxic part, not our spore.
Question 2
Our Biobricks contain promotors, regulators, a bacterial toxin and reporter genes. None of them are able to cause illnesses or threaten humans in any other way. All inserts are also derived from non-pathogenic, non-hazardous organisms. The amplified and cloned fragments again belong to the GMO safety class S1.
Question 3
We did an interview with the Safety Commissioner Dr. Schubar who is responsible for the LMU-Munich. He confirmed that we are working with a safe strain (B. subtilis W168 which has a tryptophan auxotrophy) and are only using safe plasmids, genes and promoters. He is not in a position to allow the release of our spores, but according to the present law, it should be allowed. At the moment, there are ongoing discussions for a SynBio law which is not yet established. For details, please have a look at our interview .
Germany has signed and ratified the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol . This protocol ensures safe handling, use and transfer of genetically modified organisms. Furthermore, we have our own laws and guidelines for biosafety here. For example, all laboratories which are handling GMOs have a designated biosafety level, which is stated in a genetic engineering decree ( Gentechnik Sicherheitsverordnung ) and monitored by university officials.
The general safety rules are listed here (This file is derived from Göttingen University, but the rules are identical.)
Question 4
One part is the removal of resistance cassettes (not possible in organsims that have plasmids). We also like the toxin-antitoxin system described by Cambridge last year.
Our project offers a new, safe platform for various applications. Similar to virus ghosts, our spores are non-proliferative capsules and therefore are safer to work with than vegetative cells.   Part of the GerminationSTOP is the Suicideswitch (see GerminationSTOP ) which yields a toxin during sporulation and therefore kills the cell upon germination. This is a device dedicated to make our Sporobeads safe. But if linked to another promotor, the switch could be turned on in other cases and be used to make other systems safer.

When following UCLA's protocols , we were not able to assemble more than three genes corresponding to either one MaSp1 gene or MaSp2 gene (see more on the silk page). Even though we made adjustments to the protocols, we were still not able to make the four monomers, consisting of 12 fragments, which we aimed for. This could be due to the streptavidin beads, which are essential when performing ICA. We found out that the beads had passed their expiration date. Unfortunately, we first saw this mistake too late.
These examples show the importance of scientific reproduction. This is also what research ethics is about: presentation of results and methods. There is bound to be mistakes in the ongoing research and scientific reproduction helps determine these and tries to correct them. As stated above, a falsification does not entail that the competing hypothesis is verified - it just is not falsified.
Philosophy of science
Philosophy of science is concerned with what makes hypotheses strong and how one can confirm theories; Should they be verified, confirmed, disconfirmed or falsified? Verification is rare in natural science since it requires a set of observations that logically lead to the hypothesis in question. Underdetermination will always interfere and make it possible that it’s a different hypothesis that explains the observations. Underdetermination is strongly linked to induction – it isn’t possible to know all the logical possible empirical observations. There is always room for unforeseen observations or explanations. A set of observations can almost always be explained by several different hypotheses. This is exemplified by the story of Horror Vacui. The observations are the same and can be explained both by nature having a fear of empty spaces and that the atmosphere creates a pressure. Therefore, we need more criteria for accepting a hypothesis other than that it explains the observations.
Underdetermination was one of Popper’s concerns with verification as the scientific method. He therefore believed the most secure and productive method was falsification. By falsification he meant constantly trying to prove a theory or hypothesis to be wrong. Every time a scientist doesn’t succeed in proving it wrong the hypothesis or theory has been confirmed. This doesn’t entail it being verified but only that it now is more likely to be true than before – Popper called this that the hypothesis or theory had been corroborated. But falsifying a hypothesis isn’t easy and it is important to remember that there is no form of ‘final’ falsification."

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Procedures in detail
1.1  Experiment reagents and equipment
    1.1.1 Target genes
        (1) Lipase: lipase is the target gene segment of this experiment, and the gene sequence is synthesised by IDT Inc.
        (2)  Oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, abbreviation OAH, is the target gene segment of these experiments. The main function of OAH is to transfer oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid; thus the oxalate acid reacts with the calcium ion to form calcium oxalate that preserves the relics. The target gene segment is synthesised by IDT Inc. after found in gene pool.
    1.1.2 Strain and Plasmid This experiment uses plasmid pET-28a, and the E. coli is TOP-10 competent cell, provided by TIANGEN Biotech CO., LTD.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

--JR--Ran a gel to check PCR products. Looks great!  Did PCR-up of PCR product using GenElute Protocol Kit link Ran restriction digests on vectors and insert. Chose the IGEM plasmids containing a strong, and medium-strong promoter strength respectively)
May 10, 2014
--JR--Restriction digests were run on the following samples: Promoter part plasmids BBa_J23102, and BBa_J23118, and Bla gene PCR product. SpeI HF, and XbaI were used with NEB buffer 4 in this protocol for each of the three samples. Restriction digest protocol
Week of May 17th
May 13, 2014
--JR--Figured out that we didn’t want to use the promoter vectors that I digested. We tried using pIG91 from the freezer, but the RD gel did not show any DNA present. Also did Sigma-Aldrich plasmid prep protocol according to the Sigma-Aldrich kit, for new pIG91.
--CS-- So today we continued work on our primers and Julie’s antibiotic part. We forgot to do plasmid preps over the weekend of the bacteria that we had grown up so we grew up some new bacteria from a colony on our J23108 and J23110 plates. To do so we used a plastic swab thing to pick a colony off the plate and add it to 5 ml LB+Amp in an incubation tube (yellow cap) and put that on a shaker in the 37°C incubator room overnight. For the antibiotic, Julie had already ran a restriction digest for the β-Lactamase part (BLa) and two different promoter plasmids. We then ran the BLa on a low-melt gel and cut out the band of our digested DNA. Since Julie cut the promoter plasmids with XbaI and SpeI we put 1 μl of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase in the digested vector and let it incubate for a while. We then realized that the promoter plasmids are in the J61002 plasmid and not the pSB1C3 plasmid, which is the plasmid backbone required for BioBrick parts. Some of the plasmid is in the freezer (called pIG91 in the plasmids II box) and the prophage group is also growing up more of the plasmid in some E. coli. The prophage pros had pelleted"

Marileen Dogterom
07-07-2017
Since we were in Delft for the European iGEM meet-up we decided to have a meeting with Marileen Dogterom, because of her work on the synthetic cytoskeleton and synthetic cells. It became clear that our project does not necessarily have overlap with her research, but she gave us some good ideas for an eventual application. If the interactions of the gel could also be controlled by (UV)light, the interactions could be screened in such a way that the gel only forms very locally. Furthermore, she also thought that an application of a drug delivery system, in which the gel would break down controllably, could be possible.
Ignace de Hingh
13-09-2017
Ignace de Hingh is a surgeon in the Catharina Hospital in Eindhoven. He is specialized in complex oncological surgeries, like operations on pancreas cancer. We had a meeting with him to get feedback on the application of our gel: the encapsulation of tumors.
Ignace saw some potential in our idea, as it is a new way of targeting/using matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs). He mentioned that in the abdominal tissue it is challenging to get a good image of tumor cells, a laser has to be used to make them visible. To make this process easier, a fluorescent protein combined with our gel could be a possibility. As for our project, Ignace had some recommendations for the details. In order to make our application scenario more viable, it is also important to think about the exact type of proteases that we want to target. Moreover, it is very important to consider that MMPs play a role in a variety of processes. To make our application more viable, it is thus important to think about how to make it selective.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#DiscoveryFestival Communication_-_-_TEXT.html," when talking about the technology. There is only attention for the objective, neutral and factual or “hard” impacts (Swierstra & te Molder, 2012).
Other studies show that scientists and experts shift their identity when interacting with the public, thus displaying personal involvement (Padmos, Mazeland, & Te Molder, 2006). Other studies show that scientists present themselves as ordinary persons first before distancing themselves by which they show their superiority over non-experts (Dyer & Keller-Cohen, 2000).
For my thesis I will analyse interactions between iGEM team members and the public. I will analyse interactions during the Discovery festival , the Transnatural festival and the Meeting of Young Minds during the iGEM Jamboree. In order to get a better understanding of the interaction between scientists and the public. Discursive psychology will be used for the analysis. Discursive psychology tries to understand which actions are performed in interactions and is able to identify obstacles in these interactions (Veen et al., 2012).
The aim of my research is to get a better understanding of how it is possible that the concerns of the public are not discussed during interactions. I will try to find out which actions in talk are responsible for this. My main focus will be on the way identities are used in interactions and what influence this has on concerns and impacts discussed.  With my thesis I want to create a better understanding of the influence of actions in talk on topics discussed in interactions between scientists and the public to improve public engagement activities. I will conduct this research for my master thesis, part of the master Applied Communication Science. During my research I am supervised by Prof. dr. H.F.M. te Molder .

The UCLA iGEM Team has been involved in a number of collaborations which are detailed here. In summary, we hosted the Second Annual South California iGEM in July, in which several team in the SoCal area visited UCLA and engaged in discussions about our projects, received advice and feedback on our work, and discussed the state of iGEM and our respective teams. We provided advice and mentorship to the Brazilian iGEM team on the current silk project, using our expertise and experience gained from our 2015 project. Additionally, we provided significant help to the UCSC iGEM Team with their Human Practices project by providing an extensive interview that they will present as a part of their project.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
The UCLA iGEM Team is committed to being an advocate for the universal advancement and acceptance of synthetic biology, and we believe that progress through the field can only be achieved by informing and teaching the youth of our society.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers

To verify that this circuit can work as expectation, we use GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein, BBa_E0040 ) as reporter protein. Part BBa_K098988 is also designed by Team Harvard 2008. In this circuit BBa_K098988 , we can regard GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein, BBa_E0040 ) as reporter protein to tell us that the gene after previous circuit BBa_K098995 can be induced or not(Figure 3).

Among this circuit, GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein, BBa_E0040 ) is reporter protein to tell us that the gene after the part BBa_K098995 will be induced or not.
First day, we incubated E.coli which contains this circuit ( BBa_K098988 ) with GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein, BBa_E0040 ) at 37℃ overnight. The next day, we transferred them to new three tubes with M9 medium. When the O.D.(optical density) reached 0.08, we incubated them to 25℃, 37℃, and 42℃, respectively. We collected the samples once an hour, diluting them 200x for accurate GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein, BBa_E0040 ) measurements. Here is our experiment original data (Table 1).

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," many hydrolases is the specific recognition of their substrates. A cell can produce more than one hydrolase by independent stimuli and those hydrolases can target and cleave their substrates in solution. Many electroactive compounds (analytes) have different oxidation potentials and conveniently can be bound to substrates of the hydrolases. Therefore, different electroactive substrate-bound compounds could be freed from their substrate by the hydrolase that can recognize them specifically, to elicit independent responses that could be observed electrochemically. Analogous to this is the ability to simultaneously observe independently labelled blue, green and red fluorescent particles in a cell.

CPR, PDP, and PNP were used for analytes. Since we were able to confirm that they could be independently detected (Figure 6, left graph), we went on to observe whether hydrolases from living cells could cleave substrate-bound versions of these compounds. The hydrolase was put into standardized plasmid DNA expression systems in laboratory Escherichia coli, under control of an inducible promoter for testing. Other hydrolases were endogenously expressed in the strains of Escherichia coli used for these experiments.  Peaks in the graphs represent the appearance of the analytes, using the technique cyclic voltammetry. The graphs in Figure 5 (middle and right), demonstrate that they could cleave their respective substrates to produce detectable analytes. With enzymes capable of cleaving the substrate to release analytes with independently observable peaks, we have produced a system with the potential to multiplex output signals.
Figure 6: Enzymatic production of electro-active compounds in live cells.  The oxidation/reduction peaks of the analytes PDP, CPR and PNP are discernible from each other such that they can be observed independently using cyclic voltammetry (left).  Cells expressing endogenous  hydrolases were exposed to their substrates PDPG and PNPG respectively for the indicated times (middle). Oxidation peaks could be observed corresponding to the where PDP and PNP would be expected. Similarly, cells expressing endogenous hydrolases were exposed to their substrates CPRG and PDPG (right) Oxidation peaks could be observed corresponding to the where CPR and PDP would be expected.

UIUC-Illinois,2010,Team:UIUC-Illinois-Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the recommended enzymes for each reaction, and accessing the DNA sequence for it. In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria with the new metabolic pathway to optimize the plasmid design. Finally, it will construct and display, with annotation, the advised plasmid(s) for the user as well as display important information on projected growth. In addition, it will have the option to adhere to the iGEM biobrick standards and will reference the biobrick database.
As a whole, the program will not only give the user the optimal plasmid design for the metabolic process, but it will project growth for the modified bacteria and connect the user with the BioBrick database which can reference the necessary plasmids.
Purpose/Application
The BioMORTAR project was motivated by the need for a systems approach to assembling components in synthetic biology, and to expedite the design process in metabolic engineering. Since the science of synthetic biology is becoming compartmentalized, the design process should keep up with this progress, and allow for a quick and simple way to find genetic parts for a specific purpose, connect the parts, then simulate a novel cell in silico.
One possible application of BioMORTAR is to use the program to quickly design a library of bacteria to combat an array of possible chemical or biological threats. Other applications for this program are focused towards, but not limited to, the design of large scale metabolic processing and any other function requiring the use of novel bacteria cells to carry out engineered metabolic reactions.
BioMORTAR 3-Part Design Suite
Progression of BioMORTAR
IMPtools - The first part of BioMORTAR is IMPtools, a metabolic pathway generator that allows the user to input an input and output compound, then traverse a reaction network, built from the KEGG Database, to generate the optimal metabolic pathway.
Plasmid Designer - The second part of BioMORTAR aggregates the coding DNA for the enzymes used in the metabolic reactions generated in IMPtools, then joins the DNA sections with user selected promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators. The plasmid designer attaches it all to a vector to create the plasmid that would allow a cell to carry out the generated metabolic process. The plasmid designer then searches the BioBrick iGEM parts registry for similar sequences within the plasmid, and references these existing parts to the user.
COBRA Cell Modeling - The third and final part of BioMORTAR is cell modeling using the BIGG database in conjunction with COBRA tools in MATLAB to simulate"

U of L scientists win entrepreneur challenge
By Peggy Revell on June 6, 2013. MEDICINE HAT NEWS
A biotech company started by a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge came out on tops in the ninth annual Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.
“It’s been a really exciting experience,” said Isaac Ward, who alongside Harland Brandon, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham have established Synbiologica a small biotech company based out of Lethbridge that is developing a method of rapid hormone detection.
Ward and Brandon represented Synbiologica Wednesday at the Medicine Hat Lodge for the CEC, competing in the portion of the competition for tech businesses. Competing against MathFileFolderGames.com and PlentyFull Services, they presented their business plans, took questions from judges, and were ultimately named the winner.
“It’s really about supporting local grown entrepreneurs,” said Geoff Rougeau, business analyst/project co-ordinator with Community Futures Lethbridge Region about the annual competition that will wrap up June 12 with judging for those in the general category taking place in Lethbridge. Participants come east to west in southern Alberta, all the way north to Camrose.
The competition starts with eight weeks of free training for interested small businesses, provided through Community Futures throughout southern Alberta including the chance to meet with accountants, lawyers and other resources, Rogeau explained. Participants then have a month to finalize and submit a business plan, and these submissions are whittled down to three finalists for the general and brand new tech business category.
As scientists, Ward said the opportunity to participate in the program to learn about business is “beyond beneficial.”
“Business training isn’t in our course load,” said Ward, thanking all the advisors, Community Futures and everyone who helped them along their way"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

After a few weeks of editing the protocol, a final procedure was developed for the Shewanella growth assay . The results of the most successful experiment are shown below, with an OD600 minimum of 0.06 reached for all three samples, with the sample appearing to still be on the rise. Therefore, a steady flow of 2% (w/v) sodium lactate could likely keep the cells alive and functioning for a long period of time in the reactor, though more testing will be needed to completely verify this claim.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Modeling#Whole cell model_-_-_TEXT.html," achieve steady states, implicitly relating growth rate to protein synthesis rate. The predictions given by the model are found by finding the steady-state solution of the differential-algebraic system. This solution gives parameter averages which are expected to be found in the cell in a state of steady exponential growth.
The model makes the assumption that the ribosome synthesis rate is optimized for highest growth rate. Hence, the model runs an optimization algorithm over this parameter to find what is the best synthesis rate for the given resource influx rate before running the actual simulation for this resource environment.
Solving the system
We tried solving the system with different solvers from Mathematica and Matlab but we couldn’t get any of them to work. The reason is that the system of equations is quite complex, includes algebraic as well as differential equations and a lot of self-dependences between the variables. Some of the solvers didn’t allow for algebraic equations in the differential system, while others failed to solve the system altogether.
We decided to program our own solver based on time step integration. Firstly, we implemented the simplest possible model – Forward Euler – but we got a mathematical problem. For some levels of resource influx, the system never reached steady state, but kept oscillating between different sets of values for the parameters. Since the output of the system is the steady-state solution, the model didn’t give any predictions in these cases.
With help from Nicky from the SDU-Denmark iGEM team, we learned about stiff differential systems and explicit and implicit methods for solving them. We started implementing different explicit and implicit methods. With all explicit methods we had the same oscillation problem, but implicit methods solved the system. So we ended up solving the system with Backward Euler.
With this approach, we were able to reproduce the results reported by Bollenbach in his paper. We also managed to reproduce an array of other results from one of Bollenbach’s sources (Bremer, 1996) within a 5% error margin. We successfully incorporated our model in the platform created by Dominik (described in the previous part).

∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.
Another set of plates with 10-5 and 10-4 dilutions of Chloramphenicol were prepared.
The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.
A fluorinase gene can be utilized to bio-remediate the excess fluoride in water."

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that we still have some cells germinating, so that our population of bacteria can continue to live and grow, reaching a balance, and not simply deplete totally.
Therefore, a mechanism is needed to allow us to choose to turn on germination, when the cell is not a ""metal container"". In order to do so, our team intends to use IPTG as a switch for germination, and the non-germination spores used in our project is the double-knock out mutant, sleB and cwlJ.
Population simulation
Due to our project being based around taking a section of our bacterial population, and making them sporulate, but not germinate again, we need to make sure that we do not kill off our entire population. Thus we need to be able to tune our system, so that we can have a large enough percentage of metal sequestering spores to make a positive environmental impact, but also a small enough percentage, so that the population will continue to live and grow.
The novel part of this sub-project is to model the dynamics of a bacterial population, on the cellular level, as well as integrating this agent based model with biochemical models. Furthermore our simulation is able to run on distributed systems, making use of a large number of computers at once.
This section of the project is a model simulation , which describes a high level working of our complete system. It also includes detail from other models, as it uses these in its decision making processes. The model has been developed in the Java programming language, but also uses other technologies including running CellML models.
Promoter Library
Some of the promoters we intend to use for our BioBricks will require different strengths. Part of our project will involve making a library of Sigma A promoters for Bacillus subtilis and measuring their varying strengths; with this data we will use a sigma A promoter variant for a BioBrick according to the desired strength. As stated in the instructors meeting on the 22/04/09 , we could measure the expression of fluorescent protein.
We designed variances of sigA consensus sequence by degenerating it between and around -35 region and -10 region.

Background
Gut Inflammation
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a kind of autoimmune disease and mainly divided into two types—Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Crohn’s disease can affect any part of gastrointestinal tract, especially in terminal ileum, while Ulcerative colitis only happen in colon and rectum. However, both CD and UC could cause extra-intestinal manifestations such as eye problem and arthritis. Furthermore, the treatment of CD and UC are different—Mesalazine is much more useful for UC while it is better to have an Antibotics for treating Crohn’s disease. Incidence of IBD increased in the last few years and affect a large number of people around the world—over 4 million people in Europe as well as Unite State. Among all the patients, there is a relatively high increasing incidence in children and teenagers. Additionally, IBD is more likely happened in industrializing country like India and China. A survey conducted by Ray, G shows that IBD is an emerging problem in India and also indicate ulcerative colitis is increasingly severe and widespread in recent times.
Noninvasive Treatment with Engineered Bacteria
Nowadays, medicines are transforming from micromolecules to more complex molecules even biological medicines. The reasons of this transforming are that the more complex medicines can make the treatment more targeting, less side-effect and these complex medicines such as some engineering bacteria can have more room for improvement.
These complex medicines can also treat for a wide range like cancer, inflammation, disease of immune system, so these medicines are capable to make lots of profits. However, there are a number of difficulties for biological medicines. These medicines not only have pretty high prices but also are hard to mass produce. What’s more, some of these medicines cannot store for a long time. Therefore, there is high risk of investment on this industry.
Certainly, there are some solutions for these disadvantages such as increasing productions yields in bioreactors using microorganisms, reducing the time and cost associated with the slow growth of mammalian cells, and assisting on the optimization and engineering of biologics thanks to the high cloning capacity of microorganisms and the efficient screening methods of microbial libraries. So base on these solutions, biological engineering has made great progress.

The next day, make two tubes of frozen stocks out of each culture, and also since it is now the end of the week, streak some of the liquid cultures onto agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. If unsure about where frozen stocks of expression cultures should go, consult Mabel.
James and Lychee made frozen stocks out of these cultures on Saturday.
iii)
E* has yet to be inserted into pSB1C3: PCR from gBlock solution.
E* PCR failed. We shall consider PCR-ing directly from gBlocks again, or design long primers to PCR E* out of the completed E# (inserted in pBAD/HisB) plasmid.
iv)
We currently have D# (Lsr Holin), but not an endolysin needed to complete the Holin-Endolysin lysis system. In case our Art-E part (M#) again fails to successfully be cloned, procure BBa_K112806 [pSB1C3] from the 2015 Distribution Kit (Plate 3, Well 12K) and transform into DH5alpha. Subsequently we can potentially insert a promoter in front of it to complete the lysis system.
Colonies formed and the plate was transferred to the cold room.
v)
Since B* failed to PCR to give the Synbiota LasR and pLas parts that we needed, we will instead obtain them from the Distribution Kit as well. They are both in pSB1C3, LasR being BBa_C0179 in Plate 3 Well 6M, and pLas being BBa_R0079 in Plate 3 Well 5C respectively.
Colonies formed and the plates were transferred to the cold room.
vi)
G# miniprep yesterday showed no insert: Using QC G* as template, PCR using primers DspB forward and Post Suffix Holin to make it into G# for cloning into expression vector.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team ( here ) that hamper the success in biosensors development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the IPTG sensing unit present in the Sensynova platform with various synthetic promoters that are regulated by small molecules.
Background Information
Promoter libraries can be created by varying many different as-pects of a wildtype promoter such as the upstream element prior to the -35 region, the downstream element, after the -10 region prior to -1, and its core sequence, between the -35 and -10 regions (Schlabach et al., 2010). In this study, we propose to use the PLac promoter sequence as our wildtype for creating promoter designs varying different areas of its sequence. One of such variation will be the substitution of the -35 and -10 currently found in PLac with the -35 (TTGACA) and -10 (TATAAT) regions found to be the most commonly occurring in E. coli natural promoters (Hawley and McClure, 1983, DeBoer, 1985, Harley and Reynolds, 1987). These were chosen to be the constant region between different promoter designs.
Figure 1: Graph Indicating the Most Frequent -35 and -10 Regions Found in E. coli Promoters. This image was taken from Harley and Reynolds (1987).
By analyzing the findings of Harley and Reynolds (1987) and Lisser and Margalit (1993), the decision to vary the number of base pairs in the region present between the -35 and -10 elements to 17 base pairs instead of the 18 present in the wildtype PLac. Variations of the upstream and downstream regions where the lac operon would normally bind to will also be investigated in this study by the production of three different promoter designs resulting in a diverse promoter library.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," next section. Examples of these constructs include:
Notably, the output module can include either a coding region for a fluorescent protein, DsRed or a toxin, Apoptin ( BBa_K1061001 ), a selective cancer cell killer derived from the Chicken Anemia Virus (CAV) known to cause p53-independent apoptosis in more than 70 human cancer cell lines while leaving normal cells unharmed [ 12 ]. The use of Apoptin instead of hbax [ 4 ] was a change incorporated for increased cytotoxicity and an additional safety fail-safe after discussing with Prof. JD Keasling and interpreting OSIRIS results.
The aforementioned Biobricks can be used to fuse any desired complementary miRNA binding site (target tandem repeats) into the 3’-untranslated region, between the BbsI restriction sites hardcoded into the coding and the terminator sequences to control the expression of each module by specific miRNAs. This process has the following requirements:
(1) Composite Parts in the form of Promoter + Protein Coding Region + BBa_K515105 + polyA signal & terminator, BioBrick compatible format
(2) A number of repeated miRNA binding sites in BioBrick compatible format
(3) A set of standarized Extended Primers which are part of the MetaBrick Platform [ 13 ] that incorporate BsaI restriction sites to the Prefix-Suffix.
If the aforementioned requirements are fulfilled, then the following method is followed:
(1) PCR amplification of the miRNA binding sites BioBricks
(2) Digestion of the  Promoter + Protein Coding Region + BBa_K515105 + polyA signal & terminator BioBricks with BbsI
(3) Digestion of the PCR amplified miRNA binding sites BioBricks with BsaI
(4) The digested products have compatible sticky ends. As a result, one example of the final constructs is:
Dry Lab Input
The multiple architectures that emerge from the pANDORRA toolkit can be evaluated by using the RNAi classifier design model in order to recognize the optimal one for every different classification task, for example for classifying Caco-2 cells. Moreover, in our model, the number of repeats for miRNA binding sites is evaluated. Another point that gets elucidated is the position of the TFF4 binding site. In our models, it is adjacent to the polyA terminator, as Haefliger et al., 2016 [ 14 ] showed that when the TFF4 is upstream of other binding sites, the downstream binding sites"

Pronto, los bloques de construcción orgánicos disponibles libremente se limitaron, y las estructuras cada vez más complejas empezaron a competir activamente por los recursos y el espacio. La vida surgió, y con ella, la evolución darwiniana.  El concepto de vida resultó ser inmensamente poderoso y rápidamente transformó nuestro planeta en lo que ET podría describir fácilmente como un enorme biorreactor. Innumerables rondas de mutación y selección durante miles de millones de años dieron origen a la hermosa diversidad biológica y la complejidad que podemos apreciar hoy en día. La vida parece adaptarse perfectamente incluso a los entornos más duros y hostiles mediante la búsqueda de soluciones inteligentes, siempre y cuando tenga tiempo suficiente para hacerlo. Y aquí es donde empieza nuestro proyecto.  Este año, el equipo iGEM Heidelberg tiene como objetivo aprovechar el enorme poder de la evolución darwiniana para facilitar el desarrollo de biomoléculas para el beneficio humano. Para ello, nos basaremos en el método PACE (evolución continua fago-asistida), que miniaturiza y acelera la evolución, y la dirige hacia un propósito predefinido. PACE acopla la supervivencia de los fagos rápidamente mutantes que llevan una proteína de andamio a la selección dirigida dentro de los huéspedes de E. coli. De este modo, las proteínas con las propiedades deseadas se pueden desarrollar en cuestión de horas en lugar de siglos. Para aprovechar su enorme potencial, crearemos una caja de herramientas completa y estandarizada, y un software de acompañamiento que permitirá la aplicación de PACE en diversos tipos de proteínas, incluyendo enzimas para la producción farmacéutica y de biomateriales.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

NUS 2017 - Modelling our biocontainment system
We came into contact with NUS 2017 as our biocontainment strategies shared many similarities and we thought it would be interesting to cooperate and achieve more together. We offered them the mini Tn7 kit , previously received by iGEM HQ and the pTNS2 plasmid, necessary for the genome integration of their biobricks. They confirmed to have received the plasmids and successfully integrated biobricks into the genome of their bacteria. NUS 2017 offered us their expertise in modelling and they simulated our biocontainment system. Our collaboration was of great help to us as NUS were able to pinpoint a few undesired responses and limitations of our design. To read more about our modelling, please click here .

Bringing our project to the public
Introduction
In our project this year we have focused a lot on informing the public of iGEM and our project in general, furthermore we have taken a more business-like approach to our project. Our goal is to make a massive outreach and spread the iGEM word at the University among the students and throughout the public. We participated in the “start of the academic year” fair. This is a huge fair at the University which attract many people every year. We expect a number of visitors about 3000 people over two days. For this we have made some pens as a promotional gift. Furthermore we have been so lucky to receive a package of different merchandise from the iGEM Foundation. From our point of view it is very important that the visitors have something to remember us by when they go home. It is also a great opportunity to make people stop and talk to them about iGEM and how it is to do scientific research. Read more about it and see the pictures further down. As a part of our Human Practices plan, we have been noticeable in the everyday life at the University in several ways - Indirect and outspoken. You can also read more about this in the outreach section. During September we launched a campaign so that we are certain that the students and professors have seen and recognize the iGEM logo. This is the base for the recruitment campaign. This year we didn't have many volunteers, and we want to remedy this. Just like at the “start of the academic year”- fair we will reach out to people at the University on several occasions and talk to them, telling how great an experience participating in iGEM has been. As a matter of fact, we have already gotten three times the signups for next years iGEM team, as we had for this years team.
Additionally to the campaigns we have had close contact with our opponent group from Bielefeld. Together we participated at the “Street science” in front of the town hall in Bielefeld. The idea was to talk to the laypeople in a fun way showing them how to use a pipette and so forth. Taking them closer to the laboratory. This you can also read more"

cgeA and PcgeA
cgeA turned out to contain an AgeI  site. After mutating that, the NotI from the prefix was dysfunctional due to the insertion of one nucleotide. After putting so much effort into such a small gene, it refused to be combined with any of our promoters, not to mention gene fusions with any of our reporter genes.
It should have been obvious that PcgeA is not better than the gene it regulates. It was not easy to clone this promoter into pSBBs3C-luxABCDE, but when it was finally transformed into B. subtilis, it revealed no activity.
It's needless to say, that of course we had the combination of cgeA with exactly that non-functional promoter.
To complete our confusion, the promoter still seemed to work in combination with the Sporobead construction. Weak, but worked....

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly_-_-_TEXT.html," Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can be found here (BBF RFC 80).
How it works
We have demonstrated that successful assembly of up to six biological parts in one reaction is possible e.g. (BBa_K678068) . The entire process of combining six BioBricks is illustrated in the figure below. The number of BioBricks can be adjusted as preferred and for instance mutations can easily be introduced by customizing the standard.
The procedure of assembly
Please refer to our Plug 'n' Play with DNA assembly standard BBF RFC 80 for a detailed protocol.
Pre-produced PCR products are selected from the Plug 'n' Play kit.
USER enzyme mix and buffer is added. This will remove the uracils, resulting in sticky ends on all BioBricks.  The BioBricks and the backbone plasmid have matching sticky ends, and will self-assemble.
Chemical transformation of E. coli. The time of the final incubation of the transformation mix can be reduced to 30 min when using ampicillin as antibiotic resistance marker and still results in a high number of transformants.     If a part is not included in the Plug 'n' Play kit a simple PCR amplification can be performed on the part intended for the assembly in accordance to the Customization .
Plug 'n' Play benefits
Improvements of BBF RFC 39
No need to use a USER cassette, thereby completely avoiding the use of restriction enzymes and increasing the flexibility of the system.
Standardized linkers
What you get
Rapid assembly of biological parts
A well documented system
Assembly of multiple biobricks in one step
No illegal restriction sites
100% restriction enzyme free
100% DNA ligase free
High fidelity ensured by PfuTurbo® 7x Hotstart DNA polymerase
Directionality of inserts are supported
Any vector can be made Plug’n’Play compatible
Suitable for large scale high throughput projects
Vectors for Plug 'n' Play have been prepared by PCR ensuring 100% linear fragments. This means that the occurrence of false positives after bacterial transformation can be completely avoided (2).
The USER compatible backbone vectors were made by PCR amplification with primers containing the standardized linkers 6 and 1.  For all the PCR reactions it is important to remove the template vector before utilizing it in the USER reaction to avoid inauspicious transformations and false positives. The template can be removed by DpnI treatment or by gel band purification(2).
Previous studies have demonstrated a high level of correct assembly and directionality of fragments (2,3"

Development and construction
Challenges when constructing parts for an FDM printer
In most manufacturing techniques like CNC-milling, casting or deep-drawing we are relatively unrestrained when it comes to what forms can be realized with very fine maufacturing tolerances. Industrial CNC mills are capable of the IT6 standard [2] , which is in micrometer dimensions. Sadly, 3D printers tend to be inaccurate, not due to their mechanics, but because of the fact that liquid plastic is printed, which still changes its form after stacked on the previous layer until it hardens. This forced us to experiment with different settings and sizes to produce fitting parts like the puzzle of the dish retrainer or the rod's holes in the baseplate. Also, FDM printers are not capable of printing big overhangs for the material just falls down when not having any support. It is possible to print with automatically generated support structures, but the affected areas have to be post-processed, which is not always easy at inaccessible spaces. That is why we need quite some creativity and take unorthodox approaches to some elements. Since we decided to use ABS plastic because it is much stronger than the more commonly used PLA, it also brought more frequent printing flaws with it, that result from thermal expansion. For instance warping, that bends the whole part, or rips between the layers. These issues had to be tackled by optimizing the print settings and constructing reinforcements or even thinning the material at some places, resulting in a lot of prototyping, like 12 different versions of the baseplate were printed.
Calculation and analysis
Our first step in developement was taking a look at the aforementioned low cost syringe pump project. The basic mechanics were good, but could still use some work. To get an idea and visualisation of how fast the motor would have to run for certain volume flow rates and how big the occuring forces are, we wrote a Matlab program that calculates all the parameters and visualizes them in diagrams. If you're interested, you can take a look at the code below.

Comparison with Experimental Data
Yet in our model, we do not know the thickness of the nanoparticle diffusion layer. After performing experiments, we can use measurements of our prototype device to find this thickness, and refine our model. A direct comparison of our model with our experiment data is shown in Figure 4.5.
Figure 4.5: Nanoparticle Release - Experiments vs. Model.This is a graph of the amount of GSR left in nanoparticles as a function of time when placed in 37 degrees Celsius. As GSR is released, the amount of GSR in the nanoparticle falls as a decay exponential. We create a model to guide our experiments, and then use experimental data to refine our model.
Multiple Dose: Change in GSR Concentration
Each dose of nanoparticles, represented in the Single Dose model, can be repeated to create the Multiple Dose model. Below is a graph of GSR concentration over time when multiple doses of nanoparticles are added.
Figure 4.6: Multiple Dose of Nanoparticles Concentration Graph. When patients are given GSR-loaded nanoparticles daily, the resulting change in GSR concentrations in their lens is shown. Each curve represents a different amount of nanoparticle concentration in the eyedrop.
In Figure 4.6, all curves approach equilibrium, after which the concentration oscillates about equilibrium. We have three goals, in order of importance for best nanoparticle design:
GSR equilibrium concentration equal to amount we desire (i.e. 43.5 uM from Model 2)
Stability of concentration at equilibrium (Model 4 goes into deeper depth regarding sensitivity)
Time to reach equilibrium (time for full prevention to come into effect)
Figure 4.7: Procedure of Model 3. We will change our inputs, radius, concentration, and frequency, which will change the design of nanoparticles. This will impact the concentration graph shown in Figure 4.6. We alter the inputs until the concentration graph satisfies our three goals.
To do so, we can alter different variables: GSR concentration in nanoparticles, nanoparticle radius, and dose frequency. For a full analysis of how each variable impacts the concentration function, see the collapsible. Below is a summary of the results:

Beta-glucosidase BglX (from Cytophaga hutchinsonii, <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K118028 "">BBa_K118028</a> , iGEM08_Edinburgh) expressed in the middle layer would now work to degrade the disaccharide into glucoses. As the simplest saccharide and the starter substrate of many synthesizing pathways, glucose can diffuse to the upper layer of Sugarfilm and set off the last step of the reaction system.
  The upper layer of Sugarfilm is capable of being designed to host any synthesizing pathway starting from glucose. Except for the versatility, such design can protect cells from being harmed by synthesized products detrimental to the cell. Since the procedure happens in the top layer of Sugarfilm, the undesired by-products in the system could be got rid of quickly, which would lead to death of only a small amount of cells in the biofilm, ensuring the integrity and functionality of other regions of the system.

1. Introduction
FimB inverts the fim switch in [ON] state to [OFF] state and in [OFF] state to [ON] state with approximately equal probability. FimB enable prisoner coli to select its option (cooperation or defection) randomly (Fig.3-3-1-1.).  We showed bidirectional inversion of fim switch by FimB. This is the first case in iGEM to show random inversion of a promoter.
 
Fig.3-3-1-1.In the presence of FimB, promoter in fim switch can be inverted at random.
On the other hand, FimE inverts the fim switch predominantly in the [ON] state to [OFF] state (McClain, 1991). For implementation of tit-for-tat strategy, the most successful strategy for Prisoner’s Dilemma, we used the FimE (Fig. 3-3-1-2.).
Fig.3-3-1-2.Prisoner A with tit-for-tat strategy
Our biggest achievement is that we have established a tripartite relationship between the three fim related parts, fim switch and FimB/FimE (Fig. 3-3-1-3).

Opposition does not equal misconprehension; a well-informed public may legitimately conclude from the information they have absorbed that the risks of a certain project are unacceptable or outweigh the benefits. Equally, support does not equal understanding; it is important to ensure that where the public do back a development, they do so having made a full assessment of the benefits and risks, with realistic expectations and to the likely benefits and limitations of the science.
With this in mind, we thought about methods of communication our team had found useful during the course of our summer project, and how these could potentially be applied in the dialogue between scientists and the public to ensure that DCMation has the level of public enthusiasm necessary for widespread use in society.

Focus Groups
8th August 2014 - Round 1
Our team hosted a group of volunteers, members of the public with no particular interest or prior experience of biotechnology. Our aim was to gain a deeper understanding of public perceptions and concerns regarding the advance of synthetic biology, and in particular to get an idea of how far these concerns are based on misinformation/lack of understanding, and how far they are legitimate, well-founded fears which need to be addressed by the scientific community as the field grows and develops.
Particular issues which appear to be recurring themes in this discussion include:
- Cross-Contamination of 'engineered' genes between synthetic and natural organisms
There is widespread concern that biological machines may evolve, proliferate, and produce unexpected interactions which might alter the ecosystem.
- Use of Bacteria (such as E. coli and P. pseudomonas)
The notion of 'bacteria' generally, and particularly the strains our team plans to use, have strong medical associations and are believed by many to be hazardous to health. E coli is widely understood to cause diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, whilst pseudomonas is best known for causing infections including pneumonia and swimmer's ear.
- Uncontrolled Release of modified organisms into the environment
- Spread of Antibiotic Resistance from synthetic to natural bacteria
- Bioterrorism"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," glucose level. The QSP tripeptide is encoded by RSC1A1 gene and acts on kidney cells to inhibit the expression of a glucose transporter (SGLT2) on the cell membrane which facilitates the glucose retrieval. Therefore, the product acts like anti-diabetic drug canagliflozin and would help people with high blood glucose excrete the glucose via urination.
However, if you take NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan’s product, you may no longer enjoy delicious food. And if you need Stony_Brook’s solution, you’re probably getting some troubles with high blood glucose. Is there any better way to control glucose and enjoy the sweets?
Think about why sweets make you happy
Have you ever thought about why sweets make you feel pleasure?
First, the sugar enters your mouth. When sugar hits your tongue, the carbohydrate molecules are bound to the sweet receptors of cells in taste buds. Then the signal will be transduced to taste center in the brain via taste nerve. And the dopamine reward system turns on and sends pleasure signal to make you feel happiness. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in brain neuron system that regulates how you perceive and experience pleasure. In addition to sugary foods, when doing enjoyable activities, dopamine is being released and make you feel happy.
Next, the glucose goes to digestive system through esophagus via stomach to the small intestine. Glucose in there will be absorbed into intestinal cells by cell membrane Sodium Glucose Co-transporter-1 (SGLT1) and go out to bloodstream into the circulatory system by Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2).
Then, blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to release insulin which enhances glucose entry into the cells and lower the blood glucose level. However, when blood glucose level is out of control for a long time, the cells may become insulin-resistant and that’s so-called type 2 diabetes.
Finally, the excess glucose will be converted to glycogen in liver and muscle, as well as stored as fat in adipose tissue. Extra fat will let you gain weight and eventually be obese.
What will MINGDAO iGEM team do?
Take a look back and think for a while, in which way you can enjoy sweet happiness and not increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. YES! You got an idea! Block the glucose absorption from entry into the small intestine. You highjack the sugar. Next, we will show you how we “crush” sugar in iGEM project this year.

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"inactivation of TORC1) are lethal to yeast. Deletion of TOR1 alone, however, is not lethal, indicating that Tor1 and Tor2 have a redundant role in TORC1 signaling. Several studies investigated the localization of TORC1 and TORC2. Various different localization patterns were observed, which is possibly a reflection of the fact that TOR signaling controls a multitude of processes. TORC1 is mainly found at the vacuolar membrane, which is intriguing knowing that the vacuole is a reservoir of nutrients and that TORC1 signaling is believed to be regulated by nutrients. According to a recent study, TORC1 is also targeted to the nucleus where it induces 35S rRNA synthesis under favorable growth conditions. In our project, increase the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to FAP equals removing the allergy of TORC1 to intracellular FAP. That is to say, to ignore the inhibiting signals from the extracellular environment to maintain normal physiological activity and keep a pretty high growth rate and ethanol productivity so that therefore it won’t trigger severe reactions like autophagy and apoptosis. Since the target has been identified on Tor protein, we should elucidate the corresponding mechanism.
Former transcriptional profiling data showed that inhibitors, especially acetate, would cause a series of phenotypic and intracellular changes induced by TORC1, including the entry of some transcription factors to the nucleus, some cell cycle arrest and entry into G0, general downregulation of protein synthesis, accumulation of the reserve carbohydrate glycogen, upregulation of stress response genes, autophagy and alterations in nitrogen and carbon metabolism. All the phenomena are originally controlled by an TOR initiated phosphorylation signaling network as the following image shows.
A major part of signaling transduction is regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex either via the Tap42-Sit4/PPA2c or the recently identified Sch9 branches. In normal state (ample nutrients and no FAP), nutrients activate TORC1, resulting in the phosphorylation of Tap42-Sit4/PPA2 and Sch9, which would further transfer their phosphate groups to downstream transcription factors like Rtg1/3, Gln3, Maf1, Sfp1, Crf1, Msn2/4 and Rim15.
The precise mechanism how TORC1 regulates its downstream effectors are often not well-understood. As will be discussed in the section below, several processes appear to be regulated via the PP2A and the PP2A-related protein phosphatases. These phosphatases consist of heter"

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html,"-coated membranes led to several membranes being broken while manipulating them with a forceps. We used these membranes as a support for different conductive and biocompatible polymers: PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate), PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts.
Figure 4: Alumina Oxyde Membrane in grey
Figure 5: Alumina Oxyde Membrane (electron microscope)
For PEDOT:PSS, an aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS was prepared[1] and alumina oxide membranes were dipped for 24 hours in this solution. Electron microscopy of the membranes before and after the experiment showed the deposit of a substance on their surface in a cluster-like fashion, indicating an incomplete coating.
Figure 6: PEDOT:PSS-coated membrane
Figure 7: PEDOT:PSS-coated membrane (electron microscope)
Vapor-phase polymerization of PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts[2] also induced a change in the surface of the membranes, in a more uniform way. The surface of the membrane seems to have thickened, but without blocking the pores either, which makes for a high quality homogenous coating.
Figure 8: PEDOT:Ts (left) / PEDOT:Cl (right) - coated membranes
Figure 9: PEDOT:Cl-coated membrane (electron microscope)
Confinement
The first issue to tackle was the confinement of the bacteria. For this purpose, we used microfluidic chips. Microfluidic chips are patterns molded in PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), which can be used to design tiny circuits for liquid flow. We used Institut Curie's design of a microfluidic chip, which has 2 chambers connected by microchannels of 5 micrometers width and 2 micrometers height. We enhanced the design by integrating a membrane filter (gold-coated) to prevent bacteria to pass from one chamber to another. As this technique was quite improvised and new, we didn't had access to the needed equipement for better precision work, leading to many chips being leaky. We managed to conduct an experiment were the chip did not leak and the filter succesfully retained the bacteria introduced in the chip.

Conductivity
The second criterion for a fully functional interface is its ability to conduct a neuron’s influx. Thus, conductivity measurements were made for different types of membranes. Results"

Summary: We validated the promoter function by a fluorescence detection assay utilizing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused construct to BBa_I14034 promoter part.
This construct is produced by combining BBa_114034 promoter part and a GFP coding sequence. This plasmid contains ColE origin and CamR resistance.
Protocol
Liquid cultures
Pick colonies from plate
Multiple controls
Overnight in the 37 incubator
Liquid cultures of already grown liquid cultures
100 uL of grown liquid cultures into 5 mL of media + CamR
Incubate cultures for another 4-6 hours
Spin down cultures
3000 rpm for 5 minutes
Resuspend in 1x Buffer
4 mL of 1x PBS
Pipette or vortex to resuspend cells
Plate reading
Take 100 uL of the resuspended cells
Load into a 96 well transparent plate
Measure absorbance and fluorescence with GFP assay (excitation: 495 nm, emission: 509 nm)
Three negative control constructs containing different promoter sequences were used and compared in this assay: 1) T7 promoter (Invitrogen, USA), 2) pCP25 (BBa_K1509003) and 3) pPA3 promoter (BBa_K2458000). These three promoter do not contain GFP coding sequence.
For the fluorescence detection, we used a plate reader Infinite M200pro (TECAN Trading, Switzerland) which is equipped at the Ellington lab in UT Austin.
Because the part’s description stated that part BBa_I14034 is designed as a constitutive promoter, we did not add Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as a inducer for gene expression.
The plate reader measured the absorbance and fluorescence of each cell containing the BBa_I14034::GFP construct and non-GFP construct. Value of fluorescence was divided by cell density (absorbance) and the final result was shown as a graph in Figure 1 (below). The graph in figure 2 (below) shows a close-view of the fluorescence measured of the GFP driven by the control promoters.

From this model we predicted periplasmic expression to produce the highest yield.
 
This first model was based on the experimental work in the lab. We next produced another model that would predict the behavior of our recombinant insulin under human physiological conditions. From this model we predict that our insulin analogue Winsulin will be relatively fast acting compared to human insulin.
 
Finally, we developed economic models examining the pricing of insulin across different markets.
 
 
DEMONSTRATE YOUR WORK
We performed an assay mimicking physiological conditions whereby cells were tested with the insulins we produced (that were previously confirmed via ELISA assay).
 
We experimented on multiple cell lines, all of which were receptive to insulin, and measured their levels of glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation after treatment. It was observed that when tested with Ecotin-Proinsulin, Cytoplasmic-Proinsulin and YncM-Winsulin all the cells showed more glycogen synthase and glucose oxidation activity than at basal levels with no insulin added.
 
Since this mimics the role that insulin plays in the human body, we have demonstrated the functionality of our parts and the success of our project.
 
Special Medal Criteria
Our team also is eligible for a number of special awards: for Integrated Human Practices , Education and Public Engagement , Model , Entrepreneurship and Applied Design .
 
INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
We utilized input that we received from online communities (insulin users) and professional advisors, to direct our project towards developing a regular Human Insulin due to its ubiquity on the global market, homology to the endogenously produced protein and freedom from intellectual property constraints.
 
Key Communications:
We listened to insulin users (via our survey, and communication with charity organisations involved in the distribution of insulin) who told us that ease of use and accessibility was important. From this we tried to include in our design of a novel analogue thermostability, an increased pI to result in maintenance of baseline blood glucose.
It also motivated us to try and simplify the purification and production of our Winsulin construct in order to reduce the expense associated with insulin, and make it more accessible to those in need
We also used weekly meetings with the OpenInsulin team to educate ourselves on the realities of open-source production, and develop our potential plan for moving forward.
When ReaGent (from Ghent, Belgium) integrated their views into the team we benefited from sharing global perspectives.

By cloning a Staphylococcal selective marker (erythromycin resistance gene) and origin of replication, this part has been improved to be used in both E. coli and Staphylococcal organisms. The Staphylococcal parts have been incorporated into the backbone between the VR and the pMB1 replication origin in pSB1C3.
5. Miniprep
The minipreparation of plasmid DNA, or miniprep, is a small-scale isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria.
6. Restriction
For the  first step of 3A assembly, we made some restriction step of DNA plasmid molecule using EcoR1 and Pst1restrction enzyme. This step a really important in gene construction. According to Wilson (2005) DNA molecule from current organism will give the same set of fragments when digested with a particular enzyme so it is possible to reproducibly divide its genome into a large number of small fragment, each approximately the size of a single gene. we used EcoR1 restriction enzyme, which recognises the 5-GAATTC-3, will produce fragments each of which is on average just over 4 kb. This makes subsequent steps more manageable, since a smaller number"

Human Outreach: SynBio Symposium
General overview
To approach an ever broader public we participated in the organization of a symposium about synthetic biology and its role in society, together with the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute. RIVM is the national institute involved in regulation of safety and environment. The Rathenau Institute is involved in the consideration of technological advancements and their use in society. Both institutes regularly experience the clash that occurs when technical novelties are presented to a poorly informed public. The symposium was organized with the idea to promote dialogue between society and technological researches. Thereby the goal was not only to inform the audience about the existence of synthetic biology, but also to present them to the risks and benefits.  In this symposium several people form the main regulatory institutes in the Netherlands were invited. Not only employees from the RIVM and Rathenau Institute were present. But also people working at ministries and people working for private or governmental research institutes.
Organization
For the organization of the symposium our team and the three other iGEM-teams of the Netherlands had regular meet-ups with Korienke Smit (working for the RIVM) and Virgil Rerimassie (working as legal expert for the Rathenau Institute). In the meet-ups we discussed the program of the day. The first half of the program was filled with some orators from the RIVM, Rathenau and TU Delft. The second half of the program gave us space to present our ideas. In the meetings we presented our projects to one"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2018,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," do an experimental survey where our project is described in two separate ways. The first description could be non-academic and describe our project in an easy but correct way while the other could describe our project in a more academic way and use words such as genomic modifications and mutations. We want to thank Karl de Fine Licht for giving us an opportunity to discuss our project with him and for giving us input on the ethical aspects of our project, and for the great idea about how we could improve our survey.
Experimental Survey
To get a sense of how people would react to our product if it was out on the market, we decided to make an experimental survey based on the advice from Karl de Fine Licht. We created two different versions of a scenario where we described our product and how it potentially could be used, to see how people would react to it. In the first version of the scenario, which we called the academic version, we described our product in a way that may be interpreted as controversial. In this version, words like gene modification, mutation and generally more academic terms were used. In the other version we tried to avoid academic terms as much as possible and to describe our product and its use in an easy way. The aim with the survey was to see if there were any trends or differences in the reactions to the two versions. The survey was written in three languages; Swedish, Italian and English in order to get as varied target group as possible. The English version of the survey can be found here . Below, a summary of the answers to the survey are presented in pie charts where all answers have been translated into English. The blue pie charts present the answers to the academic versions of the scenario and the green charts present the answers to the non-academic versions.
Figure 1: Results from the experimental survey. The blue pie charts summarizes the answers to the academic versions of the scenario and the green charts summarizes the answers to the non-academic versions"">
We received a total of 145 answers to the survey and approximately half of the respondents answered to the academic version and half to the non-academic version. We were hoping to get at least 100 respondents per scenario version in order to be able to statistically verify our results. However, we think that 145 answers can still provide some guidance regarding what people think of a product like ours. When looking at the summarized results we can see that the respondents have answered similarly to the two different versions. We can see a slightly higher acceptance of our product in the academic version, which is opposite to what we expected. Since we do not have enough answers, we cannot establish that there is a significant difference"
