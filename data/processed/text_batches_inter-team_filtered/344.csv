Materials
Reagents
NEB Monarch Miniprep Kit
Make sure that you have enough spin columns and that ethanol has been added to your wash buffer.
Store Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3) at 4°C after opening.
Equipment
Autoclaved Microcentrifuge tubes
p1000, p200, and p2 for subsequent nanodrop afterwards
50mL Falcon tubes for convenient waste disposal in between steps
Procedure
Pellet 1–5mL bacterial culture by centrifugation for 30 seconds. Discard supernatant.
Note: For a standard miniprep to prepare DNA for restriction digestion or PCR, we recommend 1.5mL of culture.
Resuspend pellet in 200μL Plasmid Resuspension Buffer (B1) (pink). Vortex or pipet to ensure cells are completely resuspended. There should be no visible clumps.
Lyse cells by adding 200μL Plasmid Lysis Buffer (B2) (blue/green). Invert tube immediately and gently 5–6 times until color changes to dark pink and the solution is clear and viscous. Do not vortex! Incubate for one minute.
Note: Care should be taken not to handle the sample roughly and risk shearing chromosomal DNA, which will co-purify as a contaminant. Avoid incubating longer than one minute to prevent irreversible plasmid denaturation.
Neutralize the lysate by adding 400μL of Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3) (yellow). Gently invert tube until color is uniformly yellow and a precipitate forms. Do not vortex! Incubate for 2 minutes.
Note: Be careful not to shear chromosomal DNA by vortexing or vigorous shaking. Firmly inverting the tube promotes good mixing, important for full neutralization.
Clarify the lysate by spinning for 2–5 minutes at 16,000 g.
Note: Spin time should not be less than 2 minutes. Careful handling of the tube will ensure no debris is transferred and the 2 minute recommended spin can be successfully employed to save valuable time.
For culture volumes > 1mL, we recommend a 5 minute spin to ensure efficient RNA removal by RNase A. Also, longer spin times will result in a more compact pellet that lowers the risk of clogging the column.
Carefully transfer supernatant to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Disc"

Abstract
Our project aims to improve the loading capacity of yeast surface display system by displaying microtubules and flagellar filaments, respectively, onto the yeast surface. To start with, by using the agglutinin system, we anchored subunits of fibrous polymers which were represented here by microtubulin subunits or FilC, on the cell wall of yeast. Since the particular polymers' self-assembly could take place outside the cell, we provided the engineered yeast with an environment rich of pre-secreted polymers’ subunits. In this way, an extracellular tridimensional display system could be formed, which enlarged the loading capacity by roughly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we remodified the structure of FliC, substituting its D3 domain by an enzyme of interest. By this means of displaying a fusion prtein of FilC-enzymes, the co-display ability was significantly enhanced. As a result, a highly efficient, whole-cell biocatalyst system was established."

Results: During the transcription the Blanks stayed on the same level of signal. We do not have any background in presence of the malachite green dye in the blank. Throughout the assay, no increase of fluorescence of the Malachite Green Aptamer and no decrease of the fluorescence of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 was measured. At the beginning we can see a change in fluorescence for samples containing the ATP Aptamer Spinach2. We estimate that the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 changes its RNA structure when it gets heated up to 37 °C. This will result in a change in fluorescence till the complete mixture has adjusted to 37 °C. In the functional assay containing all ligands, dyes and constructs, we can observe an increase of fluorescence emitted by the Malachite Green Aptamer and a decrease  of the fluorescence signal given by the ATP Aptamer Spinach2/DFHBI complex that is connected to the uptake of ATP that is now bonded to the RNA strand.

Erythromycin Esterase (EreB)
The erythromycin esterase (EreB) is an enzyme found in some strains of Escherichia coli and which was introduced to the Parts Registry by the TU Munich iGEM Team 2013 in RFC[25]. As this BioBrick is derived from Escherichia coli it was to expect that it is well expressing in our experiments on recombinant effector proteins. For further information on the theoretical background of EreB please see our BioDegradation page .
Production and purification of recombinant EreB

Figure D: SDS-gel of recombinant EreB with the marker (M) followed by the concentrated throughput of the streptavidin affinity column and 6 fractions collected from the elution peak
The recombinant production and purification was carried out twice, in a first attempt 2 L of LB-media were used for an analytical purpose whereas in the second attempt we produced enough purified enzyme for all subsequent experiments. This preparation was carried out in 6 x 2L of LB media. Protein production was in both cases induced at OD = 0.8 by adjusting the cell culture to 5 mM of arabinose and was carried out for 4 h for the first and 5 h for the second preparation.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

The enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect results in significant warming of the Earth’s surface and therefore leads to a change of climate. There are many indicators of climate change. These include physical responses such as changes in, for example, the surface temperature, atmospheric water vapour, precipitation, glaciers, ocean and land ice, and sea level.

That's Why We Target Methane
The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
Gases absorbing and emitting radiation within the thermal infrared range in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. They are responsible for the greenhouse effect. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides and fluorinated gases or, in short, F-gases.
The relative contribution of each of these greenhouse gases to climate change depends roughly on three main factors:
1. The amount of a respective gas in the atmosphere.
2. The duration of stay in the atmosphere.
3. The intensity of their impact on the global temperature.
For each of these gases a Global Warming Potential (GWP) has been calculated which is a measure of the total energy that a gas absorbs over a particular period of time compared to carbon dioxide. Besides, it is also based on the degradation rate of the respective gas. Thus, the GWP describes the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere. The larger the GWP the bigger the effect of the particular gas on global warming.
As shown in the figure on the right, the GWPs (100 years) of the primary greenhouse gases differ significantly. Since the GWP is calculated in relation to carbon dioxide, the GWP of carbon dioxide is defined as 1. The 100 year GWP for methane is 25 implying that methane will trap 25-times more heat than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years.

OneProt
The pTet expression system and limonene synthase construct is evolved around one thing: the OneProt. We have made the pTet-OneProt construct in order for us to synthesize a nutritional protein with the  correct ratio of essential amino acids and the correct ratio between essential and non-essential  amino acids. The device is found as Bba_K1475000. Please note that this part was characterized with an illegal XbaI site between the promoter and RBS, this has no influence on the function of the brick, the XbaI site was later removed and the brick has been submitted to the registry.
The protein is self-designed, so we wanted to test if the protein were expressed in E. coli K12 MG1655, by the use of Western blotting. The western blot was blottet with E. coli K12 MG1655 wild-type and E. coli expressing OneProt at different OD measures.
Figure 1: Western blot showing E. coli wild-type at OD600 at 0.3, 0.8 and 1.8 and E. coli expressing OneProt at OD600 at 0.3, 0.8, 1.8 and an overnight culture.
The protein has a 3xFLAG tag and since bonds are showing, OneProt is expressed. However, from this"
Kent,2014,Team:Kent#diary_-_-_TEXT.html,"transformed E.coli into LB and left to grow up overnight ready to make competent tomorrow.
We ran an agarose gel to check that the PCR of R-linalool had been successful. Bands were seen so it had been.
We also carried out another transformation of the blue light promoter.
 
Day 43 (27/08/14):
We carried out a PCR reaction of R-linalool and then ran this on a gel. When ran on a gel there were no bands for R-linalool showing this had been unsuccessful.
We carried out the miniprep of both promoters, J23109 and J23119, limonene synthase and RBS.
We prepared competent cells using the cells that had been grown up overnight.
We also carried out a Gibson assembly reaction to insert R-linalool into a chloramphenicol backbone. These were transformed into E.coli, plated on chloramphenicol agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 44 (28/08/14):
The transformation of R-linalool in a chloramphenicol backbone had been successful, with colonies having grown. Colonies were selected and grown up in LB containing chloramphenicol. Colonies were also replated.
Plasmid of limonene synthase on an ampicillin backbone was digested using EcoR1 and Pst1, and ran on a gel to check we had the correct product. This was successful as the correct bands were obtained.
Promoters J23109 and J23119 were digested and ligated into a tetracycline resistant backbone. These were plated on agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 45 (29/08/14):
The ligation of promoters J23109 and J23119 onto a tetracycline backbone was unsuccessful, and therefore we carried out a digestion of J23119 again. We then re-ligated it into tetracycline and left to grow overnight again at 37°C.
The minipreped R-linalool plasmid was digested, and the fragments ran on an agarose gel to check if the correct fragments had been obtained. This was successful so we now have a BioBrick with R-linalool inserted.
We also carried out a transformation efficiency test on the competent cells we prepared on Wednesday.

Finishing Modeling Paper
Finished writing modeling paper that summarizes what we will be doing once the circuit is completed. The experiments should not take long to accomplished and these results can be tabulated in Matlab quickly.
Plated the week-long ligation of the promoter library in both XL Gold Ultra competent cells and Top 10 cells, but there is no growth.
A reason that we thought of that might have caused minimal colonies is the phosphatase step. The 32 primers that we have synthesized does not have 5' phosphates. If we phosphatase the vector, that might result in no ligation.
Re-started restriction enzyme digestion on vector pCS26 with XhoI and BamHI at 37oC for 4 hours. Then I ligated the promoter with the vector with Quick Ligase for 5 minutes. Then I transformed the plasmids into both XL Gold Ultracompetent cells and Top 10 cells. Incubate at 37oC for 16 hours.

World Situation
A Global Challenge
In the world of today, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure a sustainable future Green Growth Papers (Myriam Linster). Material Resources, Productivity and the Environment. 2013. . Not just for our generation, but especially for the generations to come, as their possibilities should not be limited by our choices.  Our solution, is the development of a green and renewable technology, which offers new advantages to the field of sustainable energy. There are currently certain limitations to the existing options for renewable energy, namely the intermittency and the diluteness problem Alexandre Chagnes JS. Global Lithium Resources and Sustainability Issues.  Lithium Process Chemistry: Elsevier; June 2015. p. pp.1-40. . The intermittency problem describes the discontinuous energy production, along with inefficient storage. On the other hand, the diluteness problem is characterised as the resource-demanding production of technical devices, such as solar cells and batteries. This means that a lack of resources eventually would eliminate some of the  current forms of green technology. As such, we need to introduce a new and sustainable approach to green energy to ensure the continuation of our beautiful world for the coming generations.
In a Local Environment
We are a team of young adults raised with an awareness of climate changes and the potential limitations to our ways of life. As a generation that appreciates open source and shared information, we have been encouraged to constantly challenge the ideas of yesterday. With this in mind, we decided the best solution to the eventual energy crisis would be to seek out experts and the general public, even children, in order to rethink the current notion that the only way to save our planet, is to compromise our living standards.
Fortunately, we learned through interaction with local agents that a great deal of people share our belief: that we ought to pursue the development of low energy cities with a high quality of life. In fact, we even discovered that our own hometown Odense wants to be the greenest, most renewable city in Denmark by 2050 Odense Municipality’s website, regarding their politics on  the current climate changes. .
In the pursuit of this goal we rose to the challenge of creating a truly green solution, which would provide an environmental friendly source of energy.
Please keep scrolling if you wish to read more about our solution, or go straight to bioethics if you are curious why we not only could, but ought to do something about the current and forthcoming energy"

2. Add then appropriate amounts of 10x Buffer and T4 DNA Ligase. Make sure not to pipette up and down or vortex to mix, this will shear the ligase. Gently swirl with the tip of your pipette to mix.
3. Incubate reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. After incubation heat inactivate the ligase by another incubation at 80o C for 20 min.
NOTE: The ligase buffer should smell like wet dog. If you smell nothing from the tube, then the buffer is old and useless.
Can also use the Ginkgo Bioworks protocol:
1. Get the 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer and the T4 DNA ligase from the 20 degree storage.
2. Put them on ice to thaw.
3. In a PCR tube add 11 uL of water.
4. Add 2 uL of each digest to the tube.

Composite Parts
The backbone of the U of Calgary project are the composite parts. Our composite parts are an amalgamation of different registry parts which act together to provide a novel function. The composite parts designed for this project are based around the modified Bowman-Birk Protease Inhibitor (mBBI) and the competency-inducing ComK part that was submitted to the registry by the 2014 UofC_Calgary team.
A variety of different parts were used across all of the mBBI composite constructs. We used Pveg, a constitutive E. coli and B. subtilis promoter, and double terminators to book-end internal genes upon chromosomal integration. To improve secretion and transdermal delivery of mBBI from B. subtilis, we added a secretion (sec) tag as well as a transdermal (TD1) tag. The secretion tag is a localization tag for the Sec pathway in B. subtilis (Fu et al., 2007). TD1 is a part previously developed by the USTC_China 2013 iGEM team, and it is designed to allow for the trafficking of peptides across the skin.
The second major composite part was the ComK construct. ComK is a transcription factor and master regulator for competency in B. subtilis. We modified the original ComK sequence, which was first submitted by the 2014 UofC_Calgary team, to remove unwanted restriction sites from within the ComK gene itself. The ComK gene and xylose-inducible promoter were then flanked with sequences homologous to the amyE locus in B. subtilis, a non-essential gene responsible for the degradation of starch. These flanking sequences were added to allow for the integration of a controllable ComK into the B. subtilis genome. The integration of a xylose-inducible ComK allows for the transformation of B. subtilis to be more time-efficient and less resource-intensive.
Our last construct does not fall into either of the two previous categories. The construct is an integration cassette"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"

ETHICS
Ethics issues
At the heart of the synthetic biology iGEM competition is the modification of           microorganisms and therefore the creation of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), a sub- category of the genetically modified organisms (OGM) that also include higher organisms such as           animals and plants. Although the issues raised by OGM in the public mainly concern plants (GMP)           and more recently also animals (GMA) including Human because of the ease of manipulate           organisms with the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 tools, we need to think about the ethics of our iGEM           project and share our thinking with the public. To fuel our thinking, beside reading few publications,           we were lucky enough to be able to regularly discuss with Dr Vincent Grégoire-Delory, Head of the           “Ecole Supérieure d’Ethique des Sciences” in Toulouse. We have also participated to a workshop on           Genetically Modified Microorganism organized by the “Plateforme Génétique & Société” whose           guest stars were Pr Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent from Paris, members of ethics committees and Pr.           Thierry Magnin from Lyon, Head of the « groupe d’épistémologie et d’éthique des sciences et           technologies ». We have also attended a seminar on genome editing given by the Pr. Père           Puigdomenech from Barcelona, member of European ethics committees, co-organized by the           “Académie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles Lettres” of Toulouse. While participating to an           exhibition on genetics at the “Museum d’Histoire Naturelle” in Toulouse, we also have had the           opportunity to discuss with Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Head of the “Plateforme Génétique & Société” of Toulouse and member of European ethics committees. From all these readings and           discussions, we realized that as far as ethics issues are concerned, there are two main point of views,           anthropocentrism vs biocentrism, that would deeply impact on the outcome of any debate.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Colon, the digested food determines to a high degree the success of nutrients and water absorption. Thus, we considered essential to examine the fluid flow under different dynamic viscosity values.
Velocity Field – Dynamic Viscosity μ=0.6913 mPa∙s
The dynamic viscosity in this section is the value of Water Dynamic Viscosity at T = 37oC. The following diagram shows the velocity field distribution inside the colon geometry.
Velocity Field – Dynamic Viscosity μ=0.01 Pa∙s
The following diagram shows the velocity field distribution inside the colon geometry.
\[\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to \infty } x\]
Velocity Field – Dynamic Viscosity μ=1 Pa∙s
The dynamic viscosity in this section is the value of Water Dynamic Viscosity at T = 37oC. The following diagram shows the velocity field distribution inside the colon geometry.
VELOCITY FIELD MAGNITUDE – TUMOR REGION
In these diagrams, the magnitude of the fluid's velocity field is given with respect to the arc length of the tumor. In the following diagram, we depict the boundary arc chosen.
One could observe that between the velocity magnitude maxima appear a few local minima which we decided to call “Velocity Field Valley Traps (VFVT)” (or Valleys of the Muses). In these regions, the velocity around them has a greater value, thus, the bacteria “swimmers” that will reach these regions will most likely stay there and attach to the tumor rather than being washed out by the fluid. We could consider those regions as local stagnation regions of the fluid. Although the local maxima for each dynamic viscosity value are found at about the same location on the arc boundary of the tumor, the local minima or VFVTs don't follow the same rule. Having said that, the VFVTs for viscosity values 0.01 Pa.s and 1 Pa.s are located on the same regions which implies that for viscosity changes in that range the regions of the tumor on which the bacteria would attach doesn't change. Those regions are:
However, for viscosity value 0.6913 mPa.s the VFVTs seem to have a slight displacement from the other VFVT locations. More specifically, the first and third VFVTs “moved” towards the top arc length which implies that for low viscosities the VFVTs appear closer to more curved regions of the tumor geometry.
DRAG FORCES ON THE TUMOR REGION

Background
IDEA
In molecular genetics, inhibitor is a DNA or RNA binding protein based on its function that it can inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA binding repressor can recognize special operator gene, then it will block the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or prevent RNA polymerase to move along the direction of DNA, thus it can stop genes from being transcripted into messenger RNA.
The RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA to prevent the translation. However, all is fair, this repression can also be relieved by some inducers. If an inducer, which can initiate the expression of gene , is present, it will interact with the inhibitor protein and detach it from the operator. RNA polymerase will have the chance to transcribe.
Corepressor is the molecule which can combined with inhibitor, helping it bind to the operator more tightly and repressing  transcription. An inhibiter that binds with a corepressor is termed “aporepressor” or “inactive repressor”. One type of aporepressor is the trp repressor, an important metabolic protein.
The above mechanism of repression is a type of feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to start if specific inducers are present.
Inhibitor protein is widely used in logical gene circuit construction, controlling the expression of special genes or important metabolic processes
Mechanism
We choose three types of inhibitor-promoter: LacIq-plac, CI-pR and TetR-ptet to regulate the threshold based on our need.
LacIq-pLac
LacI repressor is a DNA-binding protein which can inhibit lac promoter from expressing genes, which are relative to lactose metabolism( from expressing lactose metabolism relative genes).
These genes are repressed when lactose is not available to the cell, ensuring that the bacterium only invests energy in the production of machinery necessary for uptake and utilization of lactose when lactose is present.
When lactose becomes available, it is converted into allolactose, which combines with the LacI and inhibits the LacI’s DNA binding ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of"

The coding DNA for the locks and keys designed before were synthesized as described in the protocols section. Figure F shows the bands for the locks and keys obtained. They were assembled with pSB1A3 backbone.
Figure F. Agarose gel electrophoresis. The corresponding bands of the locks for medium and weak RBS are in the wells 3 and 5 respectively. The bads in wells 4 and 6 are the ones for the respective keys.
2µL of the assembly mix for each lock and key were used to transform electro-competent Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. 250 µL of cells suspension were used to inoculate four plates with proper antibiotic as selection marker. The plates were incubated at 37ºC overnight. A colony obtained from each plate was used to inoculate 5 mL LB tubes. The tubes were incubated overnight at 37ºC an 175 rpm. The resulted cultures were used to obtain miniprep DNA plasmids which were used for the following assemblies (see below) and to send the parts to the registry.
In order to test the functionality of the new boibricks, two parts were designed: for weak RBS K175034 and K175035 for medium RBS (see the design ). The assembly of these parts was successful. Besides, two GFP generators with inducible promoter PLacI ( R0010 ) and weak or medium RBS were assembled, K175033 and K175048 respectively. The K175034 , K175035 and K175033 sequences were confirmed.

What is Biobuilder ? Biobuilder is an open-access website offering informative animations and activities for anyone who wants to teach or learn about synthetic biology.
Through our kit the team wanted to express its sympathy to BioBuilder , because we all think it's an awesome site and because we just love it! It is not only an educative and useful tool, but it is also challenging and fun. Since we share this vision of synthetic biology, we wanted to collaborate with BioBuilder in order to make Swiss high school students aware of this awesome site. As a part of our ""human practice"" for the iGEM competition, we wanted to suggest a kit assembling some basic synthetic biology fundamentals and easy to perform in high schools. We added some BioBuilder ""material"" to the kit: links to their website, some comics and links to their animations . We contacted Professor Nathalie H.Kuldell president of Biobuilder Educational Foundation , who very nicely shared with us some of Biobuilder’s awesome content.
Education that is challenging and fun is really at the heart of what we do- and it sounds like what you do too.

Adventures in synthetic biology comic
All the team agrees that the iGEM competition can be resumed to teamwork, learning, friendship, proper lab practices and, most of all, fun. Our goal is to emphasize what we think to be the four main cornerstones of the iGEM competition in one single kit containing four sections: “Education”, “Safety”, “Sharing” and “Fun”. We had for ambitious objective to include these four aspects in one and single human practice project to have an impact on the student community of Switzerland. Of course, shipping our kits wasn’t really easy for safety reasons. That's why we decided to create this kit so that it could be used in several events organized at our university. For instance, we could use it during high school students visit day or in the ""science bus"" that promotes science amongst"

Protein Expression
The first step of our experiments is to get the target proteins. And we have expressed what we need successfully.
 
Janus Expression
The bacteria ( E.coli BL21) were cultured in 5mL LB liquid in 37℃ for 6-8 hours. The antibiotic we used in inJanus-m and sJanus-m is kanamycin, and for sJanus is ampicillin. Then we used 500μM IPTG to induce in 37℃ for 4h.
Figure 13. Pre-expression. We successfully expressed sJanus, sJanus-m and inJanus-m.
Expression condition:
1. Mix the supernatant after centrifugation with the GST medium and incubate them in the shaker for 1~2h.
2. Add the intermixture to the column. Collect the flow-through and add it to the column again. (You can repeat the procedure for 2~3 times if necessary.)
3. Wash the column by 20ml 1xPBS for three times (more if necessary).
4. Add Prescission Protease to the column (the mass ratio of PP and your protein is 1:10). Then incubate them in the shaker overnight.
5. Collect the flow-through which is your sample. Purify your product by using UPLC.
6. Wash the column by GSH and recover the column.
Neo-Protein Design
Pre-expression:
The bacteria were cultured in 5mL LB liquid medium with kanamycin in 37℃ overnight. After taking samples, we transfer them into 1L LB medium with kanamycin.

The cells were put into liquid LB to recuperate from the procedure, transferred onto LB/amp plates and grown overnight at 37°C.
We also made liquid cultures of the RBS + fcs and RBS + ech cultures so we can miniprep them tomorrow.

Kinetik of the blue light induced receptor
HEK293 cells were transfected using PEI with the blue light system (PKM292 and PKM297) and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003). 24 hours after transfection cells were illuminated for 5 hours with blue light. At distinct time points (after 10h, 12h, 15h, 18h and 24h) cells were analysed with fluorescence microscopy and lysed with RIPA buffer for analysis with Western blot.

As repeat experiments had been performed, where samples of EGFP expression had been taken and purified it would also be possible to perform fluorescence experiments. These would be performed in the same way as was done previously. When analyzing the results of these measurements however it was now possible to normalize each of the emission intensities with the Optical Density of the sample. In this way a more accurate representation of the EGFP expression per bacterium.
Emissionpeaks0 Emission intensity peaks per sample for anaerobic expression at 0% Oxygen
Emissionpeaks5 Emission intensity peaks per sample for anaerobic expression at 5% Oxygen
Looking at it is notable that, unlike the former anaerobic expression experiments the intensity begins to decrease within a few hours of the anaerobic expression, instead of only after 20+ hours as seen previously. however shows that the intensity continues to increase dramatically even after 20 hours in anaerobic conditions.
Discussion and Conclusions
SDS gel analysis of the unpurified samples from the XL1-Blue culture indicate that there are several proteins showing increased expression when the samples are left in anaerobic conditions for longer periods of time. Here the bands of interest were at the height of 45-50 kDa and around 30 kDa. After purifying by the His-Tag, the SDS gel did not contain the clear bands which it had on the unpurified gel, but there are bands at the same height (around 45-50 kDa) and bands around 29 kDa, which do show a slight increase in intensity, even if the relative intensity is marginal. Performing a Western blot on these purified samples does however give a clear indication of EGFP at the expected height of 29kDa. All other bands seen on the purified and unpurified SDS gels had disappeared leaving only the EGFP bands visible, and showing without doubt that EGFP had been expressed. Fluorescence measurements of the purified samples also indicate that there is indeed EGFP expression and that the intensity increases when the cultures are exposed to the anaerobic environment. Here we have to place the comment that not all the experiments revealed the same results and that there was some variation in the EGFP expression. This could be caused by degradation of the proteins. Scattering was excluded by testing other excitation wavelengths each of which resulted in the same emission spectra. It can be concluded that EGFP is expressed under the regulation of oxygen concentration, even though the concentrations are rather low resulting in low intensity bands on the purified SDS gel and a high gain for the"

If we choose pMET25, we might need to use two constructs in order to generate enough product to have decent activity of our device.  However, one will note that we plan to use the activator without fluorescence, which will likely be made in greater quantities than activator that is paired with fluorescence.
Took overnight cultures of  54, 256, 259, CFPx2, and P0661 out of incubator at 5:50 pm.  Thus, they had been in the incubator for about 17 hr 30 min.  Made two glycerol stocks for each part.  Note that both are from the same colony.  Proceeded to miniprep the remaining culture.

So now that you have made it through to the very end of our wiki site, we want to thank you wery much for taking the time to explore our project. Hopefully  it sounds as interesting as we think it is, even though that is most unlikely.
First step is the Giant Jamboree on the 24th-28th of September in Boston, which we cannot be more excited about. We are looking forward to meet all the other fantastic teams, so many of them for the first time and a handfull of them again. And not at least discover all the incredible possibilities of synthetic biology. To take a philosophical approach to what is next we thought of the following.
What are we thinking of when we think of the future? Do we think of flying cars using Shawyer's EmDriveEmDriveelectromagnetic thruster, Global Robot Rights or   human civilization on distant planets? All of the above and all other thoughts of the future are mental constructions inferred from the past. One might argue that the material past and the material future are exactly the same just wrapped in"

Core Idea of Human Practice
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging.
According to the definition of Human Practice from iGEM, each team should interact with the whole society, to figure out what the world lacks and to dedicate our ability to the needs. In our team, the cares of the environment and human health are the ultimate goals. The crisis triggered by Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) has not only been forgotten gradually by us after the Vietnam War since the contaminated regions are narrowed in certain places, few and few people pay attention to these dangerous chemicals.
Illegal Factories
Knowing nothing about Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) perhaps is not the most dangerous thing for everyone; however, when the producers cunningly utilize this ignorance and gradually violate the laws and our right, it could be dreadful. Step by step, things will become irretrievable.
[ Figure. 1 ] The aerial views of Taichung urban area. Numerous illegal factories (signed by red color) erected among the agriculture or aquaculture assigned area. Can we feel more confident about our environment or our food?
According to the data from Council of Agriculture of Executive Yuan, we have found out that there are many illegally factories established outside the industrial zones; most of them are set in the agricultural area where is not under governmental control. The illegitimate planets are usually the sources of various pollutants — heavy metals, the organic solvent, EDCs, and thermal pollution, etc. These situations result from the high price of agricultural lands, and it turned out that the peasants need to sell their lands for the living or transfer them to light industry. EDCs are just generated by this type of light industry and primary industry, like textile industry, paper manufacture, pesticides manufacture, plastic industry, chemical engineering (detergent, surface active agent production, emulsifier, modifier), and lacquer industry, etc.

Next, sporulation was induced through extensive culture (18 h) in DSM . Then, it was used a proper spore count protocol , using a Neubauer chamber.
Use of Neubauer’s chamber to count the number of spores (in red) and vegetative form (in yellow).
     We could achieve a sporulation level of 48.3 %, which is conniving with literature data9. However, it’s important to know spore's viability. Our work showed the efficiency of germination. This is very important from industrial view. Once our circuit is finished, it will be simple and cheap to grow Bacillus subtilis cells and to sporulate them. Understanding both processes in theory and practice, we can achieve a high efficiency approach, which could bring our device to market.
2. Germination
What we tried
     Our original attempt was heat the Spores solution for 15 minutes at 60°C to activate spores and kill bacteria, which would be plated at LB medium. So, at the end, we only would have spores at solution and we could measure the germination by counting the amount of Colony Forming Unities (CFUs) at the plate. Comparing this number with the spore number would give us the viable spore number, showing the efficiency of our germination process.
      In our first attempt, Bacillus subtilis didn’t grow after plated. Experiments were performed in triplicate with three dilutions (10-2, 10-4 and 10-6) and none of them show bacterial growth. Our first thought was that we made some technical mistake, so we redid the experiment under the same conditions.
After plating, the spores did not grow.
     We tried again, and in the second attempt the bacteria grew. However, something was wrong. We diluted the sample to 10-6 and this plate, as all others, was completely full after only 18 hours. Our spores were growing too well to be true, so we started to think about the heating process. Are we sure that all bacteria get killed at 60°C for 15 minutes? Probably they didn’t. So the vertiginous growth was due to the presence of bacteria, not of spores. Thus, we couldn´t say that our germination process was working.
     In the third attempt, we used a different approach. The experiment was performed in duplicate. We exposed the spore solution to boiling water for 5 minutes to kill only the bacteria."

We also made another version of the device containing intein. Intein Intein Intein is a thiol-induced self-cleavable protein that enables the release of a C-terminal fused protein. It also contains a chitin-binding domain, which is an affinity-tag that enables affinity purification on a chitin column. First the target protein fused to intein is loaded and washed on the chitin column. Using a thiol reagent, like dithiothreitol (DTT), an on-column cleavage is induced and the target protein is released. enables affinity purification of the hTrx-based peptide aptamer and self-cleavaging ability, thus releasing the peptide aptamer from the purification column.

So we modified the game rules -- delete the rolling sidebar and immobilize RNA to lengthen the path and make the rolling background picture come true.
In our original vision, Csy4 can only move horizontally. It can not jump or fall down at both ends of the RNA. Refer to the RNA picture we showed in ""The first step of our game"", which is difficult to program such a flexible path, we redesigned RNA and made Csy4 jump.
In this part, we've done:
a. Modified the RNA structure.
b. Modified game rules:
c. Deleted the rolling sidebar.
d. Rolled the background picture.

The picture will be shown before the game starts to help players understand situations clearly. The comic pictures not only help in driving the storyline but also enhance the enjoyment of the game. They are so cute and straightaway that can be really helpful in engaging the audience.

Chip library assembly
Results of library transformation
Colonies grew on all the plates. However there were many colonies on the two control plates as well. There was a small amount of uncut (or nicked) plasmid according to the gel ran earlier, so this may be a result of that. Strangely, there were more colonies on the two control plates, than on the 2:1 and 3:1 10 ul plates. This does not make sense because one would expect that the controls demonstrate the amount of background, and the other plates should have more colonies on top of that in addition to the background noise.
The 5:1 plate had noticably more colonies than the others, including the control plates, making it the ideal insert:backbone for ligation.
Minipreps and glycerol stocks
We performed a 4 2 mL minipreps on the 5:1 culture, eluting in 30 ul of EB, and got the following yields:
1: 86.5 ng/ul
2: 94.0 ng/ul
3: 90.8 ng/ul
4: 94.2 ng/ul
We also made 4 glyercol stocks of the 5:1 culture, using 333 ul of 55% glycerol and 1500 ul culture.
Cross junction PCR of library colonies
In order to see whether our colonies actually had the insert, we decided to run a cross junction PCR on 9 colonies and the CB bottom plasmid (as a control). We diluted each colony in 10 ul of water and used that as our template. We had a 12.9 ul reaction volume.
Attempt at cross junction colony PCR on transformed library‎
Unfortunately, it seems as if the PCR did not work. This may be because too much template was loaded into the reaction. Next time, we plan on dliuting the colony in 50 ul of water and using 0.5 ul as template.

The 2xYT medium that was used for cultivation shows an overall high auto-fluorescence when sfGFP wavelengths were measured. As already mentioned before, this influences the total fluorescent emissions of the supernatant. Likewise, it needs to be considered that the wild-type supernatant has a lower fluorescence than the medium, suggesting a quenching effect caused by B. subtilis. On the other hand, only very low auto-fluorescents or quenching effects could be observed when the mCherry spectrum was recorded. Thus, we decided to carry on with mCherry constructs to prove the applicability of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher systems.
Figure 9: Emission spectra of supernatants and medium. Expression of the multi copy mCherry or sfGFP fusion constructs was induced with 1% xylose and the supernatants were harvested after 16 h of incubation. The sfGFP is N-terminal fused with Spytag, the mCherry is C-terminal fused with mini. SpyCatcher. The supernatants containing fluorescent proteins (pink) were diluted 1:4. Spectra of wilde-type supernatant (blue) and medium (purple) are shown as a control. Excitation wavelength for sfGFP was set to 585 nm and for mCherry to 615 nm. The endpoint fluorescence was measured for each wavelength in steps of one nm ranging from 490 nm to 600 nm for sfGFP and from 580 nm to 700 nm for mCherry.
Purification and SDS-PAGE:
By running SDS-PAGE with the purified supernatants of mCherry fusion protein producing cultures, we could prove the functionality of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher partners. In Figure 10 it is clearly visible, that the supernatants from the production strains (lane 4 and 6) contain protein bands of high concentration that the wild-type (lane 2) lacks. These proteins band are showing up again in the elution after purification, proving that the bands are referring to the his-tagged target proteins, mCherry-mini.

We tried traditional digestion and ligation to construct ACEB but we found that four segments ligation is hard to be achieved and time-consuming. As an alternative, we used Gibson assembly to assemble four segments at the same time. More details on the Gibson assembly can be viewed in Protocol page .

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Parts#Characterization#NewParts_-_-_TEXT.html,".2Kb amplicons of MC-RFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C had the correct length and was much brighter than the other bands.
PCR results with primers P1/P4 (Fig.7) showed that an amplicon of ~2.3Kb was present in all but one screened clones, while the MG1655 negative control showed the expected 546bp length for a non-integrant. MC-RFPflip-C did not show the P1-P4 amplicon because the reaction failed: the tube was damaged and the reaction mix was completely evaporated at the end of the PCR program. For this reason, a PCR was performed again on this clone (Fig.8).
The ~2.3Kb amplicon was consistent with a single integrant of <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo>-PconRFP without the R6K-CmR DNA fragment, thus validating the successful excision of the FRT-flanked DNA fragment containing R6K-CmR and confirming that PconRFP was still present in the correct locus in single copy.
Figure 8: colony PCR with P1/P4 on MC-RFPflip-C clone. The blank is the reaction mix without bacteria. Expected amplicon for correct construct in the correct position: 2.3 Kb.
These results showed that, even if the clones were multiple tandem integrants, they became single integrants after marker excision. This is because the Flp recombinase mediated the recombination of all the FRT sites of the multiple integrants until only a single FRT site was present in the Phi80 locus, thus leaving only the single integrant of interest without the selection marker in the genome.
Validation of the marker-less phenotype:all the 6 clones were assayed as described in the Materials and Methods section. They all showed a low variability and their fluorescence was lower than their two parents, i.e. MC-RFP-A for the MC1061 strains and MG-RFP-A for the MG1655 strains (see Fig.9). This result is consistent with the copy number of the PconRFP construct in the clones, in fact both MC-RFP-A and MG-RFP-A were multiple tandem integrants, while MC-RFPflip-A,B,C and MG-RFPflip-A,B,C were single integrants, as described above.
All the MG-RFPflip showed a very low relative RFP synthesis rate when compared to the other strains, but the signal is systematically grater than the fluorescence of the negative control,"

Making competent Bl21(DE3) cells
The starter culture from 7/11 overgrew to around an OD of 3 (want OD around 0.5) so I am re-picking colonies to make a new starter culture in 7 ml of LB broth.  Put in 37 C incubator t 9:40 AM
Using this protocol.
At 1 pm (3 h 20 m) the OD was up to 0.52, (shooting for between 0.4 and 0.6)
Added 0.5 ml to 50 ml of zymo broth.  Left at RT for an hour and placed into 21 C incubator starting at 2 pm 7/12.
The incubator started at around 27 C at 2 pm and is taking a while to ramp down.
At 5:50 Pm the OD is 0.087, which seems rather high for only 4 hours.  The protocol says 10 to 36 hours.
At 7:50 pm (6 hour incubation time) The OD is 0.45 and I stopped incubating and began the protocol for making cells.
After completion of the protocol, I aliquoted the cells (100 ul) into 50 pcr tubes in the -80C, second row fourth unit from the bottom.

Sensing
Nitrate and nitrite concentration is an important index in aqua quality, so we decided to monitor the nitrate and nitrite concentration in the water. We used the biobrick K381001 from BCCS-Bristol 2010 iGEM team to do the nitrate and nitrite sensing.         The biobrick K381001 is composed of a nitrate-sensing promoter PyeaR, a strong RBS B0030 and a reporter gene GFP. The promoter PyeaR isn’t repressed under aerobic conditions, but it’s inhibited by protein NsrR, which         is native to most E. coli. When nitrate or nitric oxide is bound to NsrR, the inhibition is halted. On the other hand, PyeaR is mainly activated by phospho-NarL, and NarL is phosphorylated by nitrate or nitrite (Lin et al ,2007). Accordingly, we can         use K381001 as a sensor to detect nitrate, whose concentration can be estimated by quantified the fluorescence level.
Besides, in order to enhance the nitrate-sensing accuracy, we also planned to modify the biobrick K381001. By adding an additional nsrR binding sequence to K381001, the fluorescence basal level can be decreased since the additional nsrR         binding sequence can reinforce the repression to PyeaR under no nitrate condition. As a result, the interference to nitrate-detection can be decreased as much as possible, and sensing of nitrate can be more accurate.
Regulation
In aquaculture industry, sickness or massive death of aquatic products may be attributed to virus, temperature and so on. However, increase of nitrate is also a serious problem. High concentration of nitrate may cause not only sickness of aquatic products         but also eutrophication which leads to low dissolved oxygen in water body, and then destroys the water ecosystem. In addition, the discharge of nitrate-rich waste water can have negative influence on water ecosystem. To sum up, high amount of         nitrate can lead to aquaculturing, environmental and ecological problem.
Due to the problem above, we aim at reducing the nitrate ion in the aquaculture water body. Moreover, we expect metabolite could be some valuable products. After literature searching, we didn’t choose the denitrification process which involves lots of         enzymes and toxic intermediate, the nitrate and nitrite respiration [1] and nitrogen assimilation pathway in E. coli [2"
LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#introintro_-_-_TEXT.html," toxic agents, it is motile with the aid of its peritrichous flagella. If starved, some cells even become cannibals that feast on their siblings. If the conditions get too bad for survival, B. subtilis can form endospores. These are very dormant and highly stable stages that are resistant against e.g. desiccation, UV light, heat and pressure. Once these spores encounter better conditions they are able to germinate again. See this section for details on germination.

Suggestions for further improvements
Taking all the feedback into account, our project does not have to end just yet.             We could engineer some improvements to our technique to make it market-ready.
Before we can sell our product to doctor’s offices, we must make some adjustments to the device itself             as well as to the production process. Presumably, we will provide only a few practices with our hardware at first to             get feedback from users before launching our product. Afterwards,             we will be able to write an user-friendly software for the most pleasant user-experience.             It should be as easy to handle as possible to ensure the frequently use of Melasense.
Furthermore, our technique is applicable to more hormones, for example estrogen and cholesterol.             We could engineer a multi-hormone measurement method as a point-of-care-diagnostic to not only redefine melatonin measurement,             but also the measurement of a bunch of similar hormones.
In the future, the measurement of those hormones could be integrated in the regular health check to raise awareness             of the importance of hormone balance.
As our final goal, we want to engineer a bracelet with an implemented chip which could measure the melatonin level             of patients overnight multiple times to quantify the results and to take point-of-care-diagnostic to the next level.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," Indian population, we shared our survey with an ex- iGEMer (Alice LEBOEDEC  from the 2014 INSA­Lyon team) who went to South India at the end of July. She helped us gather information by distributing the survey and assisting people with filling it out. This helped out team to shape our project according to people's preferences. Alice not only returned with the filled in surveys, but also a few samples of idli batter, curd (fermented milk), rice, lentils and condiments for us to analyze.
Among the farmers that filled out the survey, daily rice consumption was universal, being consumed with vegetables as a side dish, while fish and meat are eaten once or twice a week. The people she interviewed were really enthusiatic towards our project and said that they would try the modified microorganisms that make food more nutritious. You can see below the photos of the Idli preparation and the batter.
Online survey :
The same survey was designed online to allow us to have more point of view and information about Indian Citizen food habits. We also made a video explaining the project, that we showed people before they filled the survey:
Download Video
With the help of the different Indian iGEM teams (IIT_Madras, ISER_Pune, IIT_Delhi, IIT_Kharagpur, SVCE_Chennai) that shared our online survey trough India, we could extract interesting information quite important for us (most of the person that answered this survey are students).
For example, we could see that almost every person that filled the survey eats idli daily (see Graphic 1). This information is crucial, since idli is the dish we selected for the addition of the vitamin-producing bacteria. Because a large amount of people eat this dish daily, it is a good target to reduce deficiencies and show our proof of concept for selecting this dishe.
Graphic 1 : Graphic showing the number of Idli eaten per person and per day
This graphic shows that the most eaten ingredient are definitely rice and dal (Graphic 2), the two basic elements we find in most dishes in India (Curd rice, Sambar rice, Lemon rice, Idli, Dosa, etc). On their own, they are not sufficient to meet the needs of the human body in vitamins, it is important to have a balanced diet, but not everyone has access to a variety of food.
Fermented dishes such as Idli or Dosa are not always eaten because it is the only affordable food (meaning they are not the only food basic for some populations), it"

Therefore, they will only add the primers to the gene to facilitate the work for the next group who wants to work on the gene. Even though the gene amplification was not successful in the end, we they emphasized that they are very grateful for the help we provided and the effort we raised to getting fixed their PCR problems.

iGEM goes green
Inspired by this years' iGEM goes green initiative launched by the iGEM Team Dresden , we designed a model that has provided us and will provide the iGEM community with a versatile tool to minimize the amount of medium used in the process of operating Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) to develop enhanced proteins. With the help of this model, it is possible for everyone to calculate the appropriate amount of medium that is needed to operate a successful implementation by tuning all parameters. We also provide information about PACE applications conducted by others in the past to compare the values to. For more detailed information about our iGEM goes green activites and to get more information about our medium consumption model please visit our iGEM goes green page .
Mentoring Stuttgart
iGEM Stuttgart did not only participate in our mutagenesis plasmid inter-lab study but also we helped them according several issues. As they are participating in iGEM for the first time, we gave them general advice accoring time management and helped them to set priorites.
To reach their goal for ""lighting up the pipe"" they also needed to include safety aspects and asked us for some inspirations. They asked us to design a killswitch for their bacteria and we suggested to use an optogenetic-killswitch to ensure, that the E. coli are killed after they ""lighted up the pipe"" by secreting keratinases, lipases and esterases. We are happy that you integrated our ideas and suggestions into your project and that we hereby could contribute to make your project safer for the environment.
Translation Center
Bringing science closer to the public is a major goal in iGEM. As communicating scientific content can be challenging because complex issues need to be unraveled to easy understandable terms, one step could be translating scientific texts into many languages . Following this idea, the iGEM Team KU Leuven started a translation center and asked all teams to participate. Each team uploaded its project description"

In view of module two and three and of the characterization of PccH completely anaerobic conditions are not possible and can not be guaranteed. This is why we have to bring the ccmA-H genes on a plasmid in E. coli to express it under aerobic conditions. Furthermore we bring it under the control of a constitutive anderson promoter by an appropriate design of primer.
The expression strength of both, PccH and ccmA-H, are another challenge because they have to be balanced correctly ( Jensen et al., 2010 ). Therefore we want to express ccmA-H constitutivley whereas the promoter of PccH should be changed to test the optimal ratio between both.

AmyA Clone A had the best sequencing results of the AmyA plasmids, we will use this clone for our future work in cloning AmyA into the iGem backbone plasmid.
We worked today on getting our AmyA and DspB genes cloned into the iGem backbone plasmid. We set up PCRs for AmyA and Savinase using the following:
PCR Protocol
70 uL ddH20     20 uL 5X Phusion Buffer     3 uL 10 mM dNTPs     2 uL Forward primer     2 uL Reverse primer     1 uL Phusion polymerase     2 uL template DNA
Primers
DspB Forward - BI258     DspB Reverse - BI259     AmyA Forward - BI260     AmyA Reverse - BI268
9/12/13
We ran our PCR products from yesterday out on gel, the AmyA didn't work at all. We will have to check those primers and rerun the PCR for that.
We ran plasmid preps on Savinase Colony B and Colony D to see if we can get any kind of product out of them. See protocol page for protocol followed. We then set up PCRs using the purified plasmid prep as our template DNA, but when we ran it out on gel there wasn't any product. Our plasmids containing Savinase are completely unusable.
9/13/13
We ran plasmid preps of the pIG91 and pJG648 plasmids. We then ran the digest for them and ran plate transformations in LB + CAM for AmyA/pIG91 Upper, AmyA/pIG91 lower, and DspB/pIG91. We then transformed DspB into pJG648, plated it to LB + AMP, and put it in the 37°C incubator. All work was done following the protocols listed on the protocols page.
We also purified our DspB and AmyA proteins today following the procedure listed on the protocols page. The purified proteins were placed in the -80°C freezer until ready for use.

Will also refine the media research from the beginning of the summer to create a database. Still trying to trouble shoot pBAD problems. Will digest minipreps from inoculation tomorrow and will use butanol precipitation on ligation on Friday morning.  - Divya - met with Melissa and the IGB communications director Nick Vassi yesterday. Discussed creating a video and writing an article. Nick Vassi said that if we were to write an article, he would review it and send it to his contacts at the Daily Illini. For the video presentation, he said gather as much footage as possible. Will present this video for recruitment among bioe 120, eng 100, and las 199 classes. For high school presentations will use the human practices videos. Starting to think about contacting these high schools and classes. Change in the plan, Divya will focus on the Washington characterization, Isiah will do the PUF biobricking.  - Anthony - transformations from heat shock didn’t work. Desalted and electroporated again and hopefully will see colonies tomorrow. Started another ligation just in case that doesn’t work. Also, everyone should be sure to put away all of their supplies.  - Ligation troubles - is it reagents or the materials?  - Bob - Continued a restart of the BM3 fermentations, now with a control that is not induced. Did colony PCR of 4CL:STS. Want to discuss it with Angela because don’t know how to interpret the results.  - Cara - tried to make comp cells, but need an id and access code to run the big centrifuge and need to talk to brad about that. Will look into it and then make the comp cells as soon as possible. Last piceatannol synthesis, did something wrong. Might have overloaded the TLC plate and also had a weird substance left over from the speed vac. Will also try to further refine the protocol.

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli can express different genes. We also introduced a new sRNA regulated-system that hasn't been widely applied in iGEM before.
E.colightuner is just like a machine that can process different tasks depending on the commands given. In this case, the gene expression of E.colightuner is the task and its environmental condition is the command. By changing the environmental condition, E.colightuner can express different genes. The advantage of building such a machine is to increase the convenience in expressing multiple genes. Instead of expressing different genes with different bacteria, we can express the genes with E.colightuner. This may ultimately lower the cost in expressing different genes.
We tend to apply E.colightuner to agriculture. By expressing different hormones required by different stages of plant growth, E.colightuner can aid plant growth. With that said, we built a device that can flower the desired hormones to plants. This device can be applied to any plantation, and it is simple to manipulate. With more efforts, we believe that E.colightuner can raise the potential values of E.coli.
Light-regulated system
Introduction
Light is an easily accessible energy that can be applied to various fields. Of course, it can be applied to synthetic biology as well. Bacteria can sense light of a defined wavelength through a small light-absorbing ligand called chromophore. By employing this chromophore, light can be used to trigger a certain reaction and even regulate gene expressions.
In E.colightuner, light serves as an activator that can regulate the function of a promoter. Since red light can be easily turned on and off, the activation and repression of the promoter can also be easily achieved. Substrate activators, on the other hand, are harder to manipulate. Substrates can activate their corresponding promoters efficiently, but they might be hard to remove, making it difficult to repress the promoters when desired.
In order to make E. coli, sense and respond to light, we installed a ""two component system"" (cph8) that can respond to red light.
The chimera cph8 is consisted of a phytochrome cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, envz-ompR, that includes a response regulator. cph1 is the first member of the plant photoreceptor family that has been identified in bacteria.  The functional expression of a phytochrome domain (cph1) in E. coli requires the biosynthesis of the respective bilin chromophore PCB. Two phycocyanobilin(PCB)-biosynthesis genes (ho11 and pcya"

TechnoMoral Scenarios for Product Application
Statement of Application Considerations
As previously stated, ""In order to explore the future prospects of our proposed solution to the tailing ponds crisis in Alberta, we articulated a specific vision for the future application of our synthetically engineered bacteria in the oil sands industry. Under the supervision of Synenergene, we explored the potential “hard” and “soft” impacts of the future use of our product in the context of the Albertan Athabasca region. “Hard” impacts broadly correspond to the intended and quantifiable consequences of technological application, such as direct effects on environmental health, regulatory changes, and redistribution of power and risk. “Soft” impacts are less visible, often unintended, social and cultural consequences of technological progress, such as changes in personal relationship patterns, emergence of novel social mobility opportunities, and adaptation of norms and values to the existence of the new technology (Smit & Oost, 1999).""
Our TechnoMoral Scenarios aim to explore the soft impacts of our technology - the way that human-human and human-biosphere relationships will be affected by application of our designs.
Scenario One
Natural scientists seek to understand natural reality by observing the parts that make it up separately. However, to fully understand human reality, individuals must examine the larger structures they are a part of. Individuals often develop an instinctual sense of others’ self by observing, using the individual's five senses, the signals provided by others’ behavior (Blackmore, 1999). Preference is developed as the quantity of signals between selves increases (Zajonc, 2001). Akin to the development of sensory memory, two “I”s learn each other and develop certain kinds of patterned relationships such as bonds (friendship, marriage), ranks (hierarchy, order), competitions (sport, market), and contracts (employment, fife) (Fiske, 1991). These patterned relations are the micro foundation of society, and serve specific functions in organizations, such as the family, community, and workplace, which form the meso level of society. In turn, organizations group to form more complex macro organizations - families group into tribes or ethnicities, communities group"

Our Team
Our team is composed of 15 undergraduates, 1 postgraduate, and 4 guide teachers. We built this team based on our common interest in iGEM and synthetic biology. We have a diverse background with students from School of Life Science, School of Computer Science and School of Journalism and Communication. This is the first year for our university to take part in iGEM competition, and we would like to compete with other teams from other famous universities, share happiness and reap friendship.

Science Palooza
http://www.pittscienceoutreach.com/content/sciencepalooza-2014
To reach a younger audience, we developed a community outreach module, dubbed “Dermalicious,” to teach middle-school children about the structure and proper care of the skin. After an interactive worksheet, the exercise culminates in a candy model, where layers of the skin are represented by marshmallows, fruit sheets, and licorice.
On July 31st, 2014, the Pitt iGEM Team presented their Dermalicious module to a gathering of underprivileged middle-school children at Pitt’s annual Science Palooza event, sponsored by the Clinical & Translational Science Institute. In this day-long event, about 500 middle-school children rotate through 30-minute stations, where they learn about all different areas of science – the Pitt iGEM Team was excited to add “Skin Health” to this list of subjects!
iGEM Collaborations
Greg Poterewicz, founder of the 2014 Stony Brook iGEM Team, reached out to us for advice on general team management, which we were more than happy to offer! Similar to the Pitt iGEM Team, this was the first year for the Stony Brook iGEM Team, and they were struggling with the same issues we were: raising funds, delegating work, staying motivated, etc. We met with Greg on July 11th, 2014, to share our experiences starting the Pitt iGEM Team.
We reached out to the 2014 Montgomery High School iGEM Team on July 2nd, 2014, to collaborate on their project, since Montgomery’s project is also related to acne. We found the 2014 Montgomery iGEM Team had difficulty completing their experiments on time, because their team was new to the synthetic biology lab setting. To help out, we have invited Montgomery iGEM to the 2014 Pittsburgh Meet-Up, and we will offer a crash-course in synthetic biology lab techniques, so Montgomery iGEM can succeed in the 2015 competition!
Early on in the team-creation process, our mentors provided strong support to help us off the ground, and we learned a lot along the way. Namely, we had read about basic management techniques, such as planning distinct goals, and assigning clear tasks with solid deadlines to everyone. We have found if you can ensure accountability, then work flows more smoothly, and deadlines seem less daunting! Our meeting with Greg, as well as discussions with the Montgomery team, were influential in creating"

The first week involved learning all about synthetic biology and what lies ahead in terms of the competition.
Dr Louise Brown and explained all things iGEM including the biobrick system and 3A assembly.
An overview of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, photosystem II and hydrogenase activity presented by Professor Robert Willows since our project would focus on one component of this bigger picture.
Our project being to use biosynthetic techniques to create the hydrogen producing hydrogenase.
We started planning for creation of  complete hydrogenase plasmid by combining the Ferredoxin/Ferredoxin reductase biobrick with the Hyd1 biobrick.
From this we expect some preliminary production of hydrogen however, with the addition of maturation enzymes this production would be maximised.
Discussion on construction of the maturation plasmid in which HydEF biobrick would be combined with HydG biobrick then the two larger constructs would be ligated together to create the complete plasmid coding for the total Hydrogenase"

Sumbawagen,2014,Team:Sumbawagen#overviews#Econey_-_-_TEXT.html," involves synthetic biology and the development prospect among  Sumbawa society.
Eventhough Sumbawagen team consist of sophomore and in shortage condition to the facility and accessibility such as,  inspite of using the refrigerated microsentrifuge for the transformation process we using minicentrifuge inside the refrigerator. We also created home made shaker for our cultivation project. Those condition did not made our team lost the spirit to participated in the prestigious competition of IGEM (International Genetically Enginereed Machine) 2014. We encourage ourself to overcome the obstacle in front of us, like the quote from our Rector “ When there is a will, there is a way”.
Project Idea
Sumbawagen 2014 project is ECONEY (E. coli for Honey). ECONEY is engineered E.coli that capable to measure different level of glucose consentration in honey. BBa_J04450 has a lac promoter and mRFP gene, thus E. coli harboring this plasmid will give red color when the bacteria were grown with lactose or IPTG. Oppositely, the expression of mRFP will be decreased when glucose was present in medium through a mechanism called catabolite repression. We use this phenomenon to measure the concentration of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium using android-based mobile phone. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E. coli, which shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.

WHU-China,2012,Team:WHU-China#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," successfully endured the monotonous life. Sometimes the enzymes just don’t function well. Other times the PCR never get right for some unclear reasons. We just survived those really despair moments and made one step closer to our goal.
And those heart-touching scenes are clear as if they happened yesterday. Regardless of our persuation to wait for the rain to stop, our captain determined to fetch the induction cooker in his dormitory to perform an reaction as soon as possible (We don’t have an appropriate heater in our lab). When his figure disappeared in the dark and rain, words failed me; when I got a message at 3 o’ clock in the midnight, the excited tune claiming that we no longer needed to worry about our competent cells overwhelmed me with tears; when I heard that our “artist” having caught a cold but promised that he would complete all the pictures of the web site in time, I fell into silence again; every time when Xian Xia stayed overnight in the lab, the room would be quite tidy and all the reagents would got replenished. When I saw this in the next morning, I was greatly touched.
Most of us has sacrificed much time to pursue personal interest. We just decrease the time for required exams for going abroad, for working in our own labs, and for some courses we are really interested in, let alone our hobbies. No time for travelling, reading lasted paper on interested topics, shopping, chatting with friends and so on. However, after the complaints and anguish, we finally reached such a peaceful and simple spiritual state that we just want to try our best to get the best result.
A man who never experienced iGEM in WHU can never really understand the complex of feelings: glory and dream, perseverance and persistence, joy and tears. You can never image how brave and respected my teammates are, how many efforts and love they have put in the team, and how strong the relationship we have built since the team has been organised.

Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HumanPractice#wikiAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," the other profits abusively from it.
A first idea that could allow the bridging of concepts is a compromise that would ease up the research of future iGEM teams which has been put forward by UQ_Australia 2011 . They feel that making an overarching license for all competitors as long the patented sequences are used uniquely within this framework. In this context, patent holders (most likely multinationals) would become sponsors but there are chances that most will refuse based on mistrust and lack of control; yet it could be a good start for iGEM's sake. Furthermore, this does not apply to the larger SB community.
It appears that another model that would satisfy our needs as iGEMers is Virginia 2011 's since it is based on public beneficence. The less extreme version of the model would be a direct funding reward model whereby the governments finances specific research and development if the inventor decides to put his invention in the public domain. This team goes even as far as suggesting that a total socialization could be the key to the problem. In practice, there would be no more patents but financial rewards for researchers in the form of research funding and/or percentage on the sales generated by the invention. This could ironically also allow free market -liberal approach- models to function since no patents could open the door to competition, secrecy or trade strategies thereby lowering prices and improving accessibility to lower classes and to non-industrialized countries. Albeit an extreme model, it would fulfil most of the goals of synthetic biology. For iGEMers, this would also be a guaranteed protection against troll patents.
Sparking debates within the team
We also would like to present our own discussion, it was interesting to discover that very different opinions are held even within a single iGEM team. For example, for some of us genomes should not be patented whatever the organisms, a thought that may not be shared by everyone in the team.
Research first!
That is the main point I want to focus on, indeed as future researcher we are maybe going to be confronted with patent issues. I see no reason why any form of retention should come up in research even if patented material is used. It seems that usually University researchers do not encounter such difficulty 4, however in a preventive manner it should made explicit in biotechnology patents that every bit of information concerning the “invention” should be made public, freely available and threat of going to court forbidden. This is just extending the Synthetic Biology principles already exposed by Jimmy Huan of the 2008 UCSF team but applying them to the whole Living and all genomes"

To obtain our goal of an accelerated clotting process, we have deployed the venom serine protease “Cerastotin” which will act on the thrombin, bypassing multiple factors in the clotting cascade and cut long fibrinogen strands into smaller fibrin “monomers” which will stop the bleeding at a greatly accelerated rate. In order for the venom to stay localized at the wound site, we have augmented a short fibrin peptide with the venom that will polymerize with the other fibrin monomers at the wound site. With the polymerization of the venom within a permanent clot and with blood pressure directing flow to the wound, the venom will not be traveling throughout the body and initiating a clot other than that of the wound site.   We chose a constitutive medium strength promoter (J23107) and a medium/strong RBS for our construct in order to produce an ample amount of venom, but also allowing our Thiol isomerase time to stabilize the multiple disulphide bonds in the venom, so the protein will fold properly and its enzymatic activity increases.

How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
