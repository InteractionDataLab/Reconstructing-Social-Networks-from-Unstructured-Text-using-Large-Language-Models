Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Bacteria have proven to be a valuable resource in their capacity as model organisms in research, and their use has been well documented and studied to ensure that the public’s safety is never in harms way, as a result of an experiment that has gone amiss.
This leads to our conclusion that in the advancement of science, the examples provided above have illustrated that the negative public perception of scientific breakthroughs can be changed over time if the public is informed on proceedings and are given all the relevant information regarding potential benefits and costs so that an informed decision can be made. The public has proven to be very influential in decision making regarding the kind of cloning research that is conducted.  Governments have developed ways to ensure that high quality research continues but not at the price of moral decay.
Take Home Message
The recent emergence of synthetic biology has revolutionized our way of thinking scientifically, but, as was expected, it has also raised a lot of ethical debates due to its wide scope of applications in the field.  It is important that all parties involved in synthetic biology research actively participate in educating the public on this new field, ensuring that all parties are made aware of the infinite possibilities and applications available in synthetic biology.  Just as with any other type of scientific research, the public needs to be reassured that their safety and that of other animals and the environment are not at risk and that rules and regulations have been put in place to ensure that ethical values are represented when conducting research using synthetic biology.

Antibiotics
The spread of disease and sickness caused by microorganisms brought about widespread death for many centuries, and it wasn’t until the discovery of antibiotics that the medical community was finally able to fight off infection and bacterial growth. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin from the mold Penicillium notatum which inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium common in many diseases (1).  Modern chemotherapy originated in Germany in the early twentieth century under Paul Ehrlich who began looking for a “magic bullet” that he speculated would selectively destroy pathogens but not the host organism (1). Originally, antibiotics were seen as a “"

I will also be finishing up the list of core keywords that Clotho core tools will use - this will be based mainly on the JBEI data model but also incorporate some fields that Chris wants.
Some other things that came up during this weeks database meeting:
Every tool that uses the database should have some path selection piece
Need to talk to Chris and Josh about how to represent composite parts in a database
talk to Davidson asking for read access to their database
Week Five
Sixpi 00:14, 1 July 2009 (UTC)
At the beginning of this week, I had the data core working the the JCA database. The main goal for this week is to finish the mapping manager, and hope that we can start on the code generation piece next week. I've also just had a meeting with Chris and Josh about the core keyword list - their opinion is that as long as the list is easily extensible there shouldn't be any problems. We also talked about how to represent composite parts in the database - my opinion is that we should also store a flattened list of the basic parts as a field, so we're not required to store the entire construction tree of a part just to know its components. To compromise, both options will be in the core data keyword list.
Sixpi 00:59, 3 July 2009 (UTC)
Its now more than halfway through the week, and I'm almost halfway done...I should be farther along, but Monday and Tuesday were completely filled with meetings, and there were quite a few meetings yesterday too.
Week Six
Sixpi 23:17, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
This week will the last week of formal meetings - next week Doug will be helping produce code on various projects. The mapping manager is still not complete - its taking longer than I thought it would, due to various difficulties in obtaining metadata from the database.
Week Eight
Sixpi 00:07, 22 July 2009 (UTC)
This week I am continuing work on the path finding problem. I've found a java graph library, JGraphT, that I'll be using as a graph framework. I also found the java Preferences library, which I think we should use for Clotho preference data, instead of having a bunch of scattered files.
I emailed the Davidson database contact, Bill, and he's replied that he'll implement foreign keys in their database, and he'll send me an updated copy of their sql dump next week.

Another signal molecule we are fascinating with is D-Dimer. What we have found is the crystal structure of D-Dimer (PDB ID: 2Q9I), and the amino acid sequence of D-Dimer scFv. SWISS-MODEL helps us to model the structure of D-Dimer scFv. Next is docking, finding out the interface.
Figure 14. D-Dimer scFv local docking RMSD
After rounds of docking, finally we found the interface (Figure 14). As has mentioned before, this RMSD plot shows a reliable result of docking. The final step is RosettaAntibodyDesign. Here, we made a bold attempt, execute the command -random_start. This will start graft design with a new set of CDRs from the database, not biasing the run with native CDRs. The result is successful. The binding energy has been optimized from -31.561 to -54.875 (unit:REU). Since the CDR region is totally different after mutation, we can claim to create a new antibody. Merely, the position of interface is the same.
tTA promoter
DNA Sequence before and after mutation:
WT:
T C T A T C A C T G A T A G G
After mutation:
T C T A T C A C T G C T A G G
We can also redesign DNA sequence. Here is an example, a promoter and transcription factor complex, tTA. In fact, the structure of tTA has not been tested through experiment. However, TetR, another transcription factor that has the same sequence on the protein-DNA interface, has known structure (PDB ID: 1QPI). So it is equivalent to redesign the interface of TetR.
Figure 15. Vacuum electrostatics plot of interface near base pair 11
(A)Before mutation
(B)After mutation
The transcription factor is colored to show its electrostatics distribution. It should be mentioned that the area with less electric charge is always hydrophobic.
After mutation on base pair 11 (A to C), the interface energy has decreased from-37.467 to -38.411 REU, tested by RosettaDock. The most significant improve is lk_ball_wtd"

The whole system is set on three levels. First is the processor; second is the IoT and third are demonstrators. In the first level, we connected the demo-board to temperature meter, PH meter and our EDCs detector, which collect data and undergo a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and then the proofread results will be transferred to IoT network. The data can be sent to a various receptor or memory like automatic control system, Node-RED, and MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. Take automatic control system for example, when the water quantity increases too fast, the controller will receive real-time data and changes its position to reduce the feed water so that the following reaction section could have sufficient time to react. As for the Node-RED system, after receiving data from demo-board, it will decide where they should go. The destinies could be a newsletter, FB Messenger, Email, Twitter or alert and Node-RED will also categorize who is authorized to receive based on the water condition. Finally, the data grabbed by cloud will be sent to our smartphone APP so that the users could supervise the real-time water quality.
[ Figure. 5.1-3 ] The blueprint of our IoT system. This branch chart describes includes every important element that we integrate into.
So far, we have built up the whole framework of the system but there are still some functions that haven’t been completed including Two-way ANOVA, connection with an automatic control system and integration of our EDCs detector. Two-way ANOVA is one of the crucial parts which needs a huge database to eliminate every effect from all the other variations. However, we cannot catch up to the deadline this year but we will build up this database in the future. Besides, since we need more data and experience to integrate EDCs probes and automatic control system, this part of work has not been executed. Nonetheless, this arduous work will be done in the near future as well.
[ Figure. 5.1-4 ] The Node-RED system. We utilize it to perform our IoT idea. Each green box on the right-hand side is a single IP of the user. The three main boxes on the left-hand side are three different parameters like temperature and PH value. As to those boxes in the middle, they are the categorization machine which will define who is authorized for these certain data.
[ Figure. 5.1-5 ] Our MediaTek Cloud Sandbox will save the data uploaded by demo-board there and synchronize with the smartphone real-time monitoring APP.

We further developed a qPCR assay for future use in determining the level of gene knockdown in vivo.
To test the efficacy of gene silencing in vivo, we designed a qPCR assay around the target genes of interest, Hfq, and two reporter genes: 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). These reporters were chosen as they are part of crucial metabolic function, and expression levels are expected to be constant, even if gene silencing is occurring at other sites. Furthermore, these genes are genetically distant from the genes of interest, and thus have no probability of being expressed on a polycistronic mRNA.

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

④  Investigation Results
This year, our team UESTC-Software has conducted many human practices to disseminate iGEM and our project. One of them is a questionnaire that gathers the information of public awareness of knowledge on synthetic biology and our software. The pie chart shows the proportion of number of different students and social elites who are participate in our human practices.
Conclusion
As a result of our hard work and research, it’s very fortunate that our software is attractive enough to draw the professors and entrepreneurs. In addition, through our efforts, our software has attracted many students majored in Bioinformatics and Qt developers as well, for the reason that we follow the basic principle of KISS (keep it simple, Stupid).
In the future, we will pay much more attention to coding standardization and document perfection. We also wish there are more and more people reuse our software, join us and continue our work.

The resulting hybrid serves as guide for the Cas9 protein that generates double strand breaks at the position the RNAs guide it to (Figure 3). By this double strand break the invading DNA is destroyed. The last years, researchers discovered the CRISPRs as a method for genome editing.
Figure 4: CRISPR/Cas technology description ( Addgene.org ).
   By designing the spacer sequence, specific sequences in the genome can be targeted. With the provision of a sequence with homologous sequences, easy insertion can be done. This method can be used to insert mutations or new sequences nearly everywhere in the genome.
Recently many papers have been published for genome editing in bacteria (Jinek et al., 2012, Jiang et al. 2013 ), yeast ( DiCarlo et al. 2013 ) and mammalian cells (Mali et al., 2013, Cong et al., 2013). They describe how to use the CRISPRs for different purposes. One requirement to target a sequence is a NGG at the end of the sequence. This NGG sequence is called PAM - protospacer adjacent motif, while the target sequence itself is called the protospacer, which should have a length of around 12 to 20 bp.
In our approach we test two different systems, the systems of DiCarlo et al. 2013 and Jiang et al. 2013. The system of Jiang is a system developed for bacteria and especially for E.coli. The system of DiCarlo is based on a paper of Mali et al. 2013 and adapted to yeast.
Different from the Jiang paper, the DiCarlo paper uses a gRNA (guideRNA) to guide the Cas9 (Figure 5). The gRNA is actually the RNA that results after transcribing and folding is the same complex as you get after the processing of the tracrRNA with the crRNA. It is hence an improvement, which makes the design and expression easier. But as the system hasn’t been tested before in bacteria, we will use both systems to make sure we get the desired results.

Plated these plates on level 0 Chl plates and grew overnight. -ve control shared between no insert and no ligase.
Plates from transformation
Plates from 01/08/17 failed to transform. Current thought is that 55 degrees is too hot for the ligation to occur.
Therefore, digest and ligation carried out separately when investigating TSH and TSHH gblocks. Digest took place at 55 degrees for 2 hours using buffer 3.1 (10x) BSA, insert (TSH/TSHH gblock), BSMBI, water and P6-18J plasmid. A negative control was also included.

CH2.2.5 - NEW APPLICATION
“We're guessing that you have great ideas that nobody has ever thought about, or if they have they forgot to tell somebody else. Can you imagine an entirely new application area for biological technology?”
Example:
In the body, the enzymes are not directed to the substrates, and catalysis only occurs when they meet each other after randomly moving around.
Like shortening the distance of each working section during the industrial revolution for a higher efficiency of the entire production, the stable DNA chain can be used as an assembling line for catalysis. Each enzyme can be fused onto DNA china and line up in order, so they can carry out the catalysis one after another. This application shortens the distance and increases the efficiency of the reactions.

Cleaning an oil spill comes at a hefty price; costs can snowball up to $21.47 per liter oil (Etkin, 2000). A big spill is next to              impossible to deal with; since it is impossible to mobilize the body of labor needed and the technologies to clean up soon enough              (Suzuki, 2016). Available ""technologies"" consist of burning the oil or using chemical dispersants (Suzuki, 2016). Such techniques              are crippled; they can't get rid of large spills, nor they work in icy waters, or where waves run amok (Nikiforuk, 2016).
Figure 2: Efforts to clean an oil spill. Retrieved from: https://www.wired.com/2015/05/oil-spill-off-santa-barbara-going-kill/
Oil spills are disastrous, they kill all the aquatic birds they come in contact with by sticking to birds' feathers, making              them heavier which limit their movements, causing either their inability to catch prey or reducing their mobility in water leading to their death (Nikiforuk, 2016). They also wreck the marine organisms' habitat (Moore, 1974).
Fossil fuels and their combustions in energy conversion devices are the primary causes of the pollution of the atmosphere (Radovič, 2006). This pollution can be divided into two; primary and secondary (Radovič,2006). Primary air pollutants, which are COx, SOx, NOx, and particulates of very fine soot and ash particles, are all harmful to the environment (Radovič, 2006). Whether it's the potentially fatal CO or SO2's strong acidity causing acid rains, these pollutants are immensely harmful (Radovič, 2006).
Carbon emissions are so harmful that, in 2010, 4,5 million people died from it (Rathi, 2015). This makes air pollution related to carbon emissions more deadly than wars, murders and traffic accidents combined (Rathi, 2015).
Carbon monoxide; the most poisonous gas that is a product of incomplete combustion of any fuel (Radovič, 2006). Urban cars and vehicles are the culprit, since fossil fuel combustion vehicles are incapable of burning fuel fully when cold, which make up the majority of their use scenarios, they incompletely burn fuels the most (Radovič, 2006). It's estimated that some 100 million tons of CO are emitted every"

David and Kristi made competent cells. However, the results of our gel showed that our PCR g-block wasn’t PCR’ed correctly, so we decided to do everything again the next day.
8/5 We did the same thing as said for 8/04, and the gel indicated that the PCR worked. We also presented to a CTD biomedicine class about synthetic biology.
8/6 David and Sharon checked for colonies on the plates, and restreaked 10 colonies onto new plates. Abdullah and Kristi did colony PCR on the restreaked colonies. Mitch and Sharon restreaked the environmental samples. We were supposed to run a gel for colony PCR, but decided to do it the next day.
8/7 We performed colony PCR which proved to be unsuccessful.
8/8 Abdullah and Mitch retested the PCR while Sharon and David did PCR purification. Adam ligated, transformed and plated the gBlock. Kristi and Sharon, meanwhile PCR’ed each clone, one with a forward primer and one with a reverse primer.
Week 10
8/11 Adam ligated, transformed and plated the gBlock and backbone. Kristi and Mitch did colony PCR for the old clones while Abdullah and David made YTPG. We also prepared a presentation for the weekly meeting we had the next day.
8/12 Adam selected 5 colonies from the 10 we made and miniprepped them. Abdullah and Kristi did colony PCR on them. David and Mitch kept track of the growth of Pseudomonas in LB and before leaving transferred some to YTPG. We also ran a gel/test digest of the 3 colonies out of the 5 which actually had DNA.

Problems with information flow between scientists, politicians and the public
As another part of the human practices side of our project we wanted to investigate how information is passed from scientists to the public. We investigated how problems in this information flow chain can lead to the public being given inaccurate or misleading information and how this can lead to public opinion of a scientific topic being formed without a good understanding of the topic.
Our Investigations:
To investigate the problems with information flow between scientists and the general public, we looked at how information is passed from scientists to members of parliament (MPs), who are involved in the creation and passing of scientific policies and practices. Information is then passed to the general public, very often through the media.
We used an information flow game to investigate this.  In this game the first player (a 'scientist') had a list of objects. The scientist had to mime a word for the middle player (an 'MP') to guess, without talking. This highlighted how scientific language is not understandable to people with no scientific training, as most MPs do not have a scientific background. The MP then had to describe the word he had guessed to a third player (the 'public'), without using the word. The public were not allowed to see the scientist mime the word, highlighting how although scientist often have all the information, they do not often engage with the public. However the MP has the voice and acts as a bridge between scientists and the public. Playing this game highlighted how if the MP does not understand the scientist, incorrect information is passed to the public. It also highlighted that even if the MP understood the scientist, it is very easy for them to incorrectly word their description to the public again leading to inaccurate information being passed on.
From this game we concluded that scientific language is needed to accurately convey scientific topics, but that this makes passing information to people without scientific training very difficult as scientific language is difficult to understand. It highlighted how clearer methods of communication between scientists and non-scientists are needed so that inaccurate information is not passed on. We concluded that scientific organisations should have one or a small number of people dedicated to communicating with non-scientists. This will allow them to specialise in communicating ideas without using too much scientific language and also prevents confusion caused by too many people trying to communicate"

Presentation of the phenomenon of quorum-sensing : intercellular communication in bacterias
The phenomenon of quorum sensing was first discovered in Vibrio fischeri. This bacteria only expresses luciferase when the density of bacteria is very high (1011bact/mL). Typically, the bacteria does not express bioluminescence when they are free living in the ocean. At the contrary, they express luciferase when they are highly concentrated in the photophore of Hawaiian bobtail squid.

The genetic cascade
In this system, LuxI and LuxR control the expression of luciferase operon luxICDABE, necessary to produce bioluminescence. LuxI synthesize small diffusible molecules called Acyl Homoserin Lactone (AHL). LuxR is the intracellular receptor to AHL.
The AHL freely diffuses into the extracellular medium. Its concentration increases as the population gets more dense. When the concentration reaches a critical level, those small molecules bind to their receptor. LuxR bound to AHL and the complex activate the operon that code for luciferase (Figure 1.).
Quorum Sensing and Synthetic biology
This system has already been used in the field of synthetic biology to create new behaviors. For instance, Lingchong YOU et al. (2004) designed a bacteria that regulates the maximum density of bacteria inducing a controlled suicide via intercellular communication. With this system, even if the population is stable the genome is expressed as if they were in exponential growth.

Other quorum sensing systems has been described in different species of baceteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The system has the same architecture with protein LasI that synthesize the AHL that binds"

Polytechnic University of Valencia
Our university, founded over five centuries ago by the Juries of Valencia, has become a modern, public university that teaches all areas of knowledge: social,  economic and legal sciences, experimental sciences, engineering, health sciences, educational sciences and humanities.
The university community is committed to being a university of reference: we are ranked second in Europe in receiving Erasmus students and fourth among Spanish  universities in research. According to the most prestigious international rankings, we are ranked fourth in Spain.
The Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)is a public educational institution that offers modern, flexible degrees that are designed to meet the demands of society,  as well as official postgraduate programmes that are subject to demanding educational quality control systems.
It has three campus sites: Vera (inside the city of Valencia), Alcoy and Gandia, with a total of 36.186 students, 2.843 members of teaching and research staff, and 2.396  administrative and services staff.
University of Bergen
The University of Bergen is Norway's urban university who is intricately woven into the geographical, historical and cultural framework of the city, with 14,500 students and 3,200 faculty and staff.
UiB has most of its premises concentrated in two areas. Årstadvollen is the University's ""health campus"", where dentistry, medicine and health-care lie close to the Haukeland and Haraldsplass university clinics. Natural and social sciences, psychology, the arts and law are taught at Nygårdshøyden, a mixture of houses, shops and seats of learning.

We have completed biological system design part of BioGuide and enabled wet lab teams to use it.
You can watch the ""how to"" video of BioGuide to see what and how you can do with it;
Here is how METU ANKARA wet lab team is using BioGuide;
This year we are using it while building one of our devices, kill switch composite. Kill switch composite consists of 4 main parts which are in 2011 kit plate distributions; T7 promoter, RNA thermometer, GFP and lysis casette. The upstream part of this composite is T7 promoter  (BBa_I712074) which is strong promoter from T7 bacteriophage mostly used expression system and so for strong transcription T7 promoter expression system is chosen.
We also tried the inducible promoters (pLac-IPTG inducer) to design and express the lysis casette. We desired to use a promoter that could be induced and enhance the expression to control and manipulate the translation of device. When we typed IPTG on input box of Bioguide we had reached the possible promoters that could be induced by IPTG. This program gave their standard biobrick codes and finally we got these parts by knowing their location in kit plate.
In downstream of promoter there is RNA thermometer(ROSE) coding region which determines the transcription of our lysis composite part. We had reached this part by coding the temperature 42 C in input box of BioGuide. RNA thermometer (BBa_K115001) is temperature sensitive at which 42 C translation initiates.
In downstream of RNA thermometer, green fluorescence protein(BBa_E0040) is ligated. This ligation is done to measure expression level and to comment on RNA thermometer efficiency. We typed GFP in output box since we wanted to measure fluorescence.

The 100 percent reference point may be a little subjective, we therefore decided to put it in perspective by comparing it to other key words.       As an example, the key word “biological engineering” is more used in China than anywhere in the world.       In addition, it has been REALLY more often requested than “synthetic biology” despite a loss of popularity since 2004.
What would happen if we compare those words to the key word GMO?
The graph is speaking by itself as we can see that there is far less research about biological engineering and synthetic biology than GMO!       In France, GMOs are a real topic of concerns as people tend to be reluctant about genetically modified organisms that they assumed to be dangerous.       If these data do not show if the global opinion on GMO is negative, it however underline an interest or a concern in the area, and that most people do not seem to be willing to go deeper by understanding more about the technology behind modified organisms.
So people seems to care about GMOs, but how much?
Well, far less than they care about Batman.
In our perspective, if it’s a right to have access to knowledge, it is our duty to be well informed when talking about such cutting-edge technologies.       However, scientific articles do not aim citizens in general, and a lot of media, willing to facilitate the comprehension of those breakthrough, failed to keep them scientifically true and objective by preserving their context. We have then decided to take a look at the free, reliable, and emerging source of knowledge.
So… What are the free resources available to become more aware of synthetic biology?!
From beginners to advanced level biologists: MOOC!
MOOC stands for Massive Online Open Classrooms, what does it mean? Well, that you can take online classes on almost every topics that come to your mind!       Advantages of MOOC: first, it is online and just an internet-connection is required for attending the class. You can work in the morning or late at night: it is up to you!      These classes can also fit the various learning style of students: if you have trouble learning alone, the community will be there to help you, but you can also learn totally on your own.      Many MOOC provided are free but you can still pay in order to get a verified certificate of accomplishment, therefore, knowledge and courses from prestigious university are now open to anyone.

This included testing the sensitivity of our methods and testing the target in a cleavage assay using Cas13a. We also put effort into constructing a centrifuge ourselves. Lastly, we used our ‘ motif finder ' to design primers that could be used to amplify resistance genes from mastitis pathogens (blaZ genes).
Achievements
Easy DNA isolation
To see if we were able to use the easy DNA extraction method described by Dashti et al. 2009 , we repeated the control steps of the paper. We tried the boiling- and microwave- method on bacteria of the KEIO-strain (JW0729). We used PCR primers that anneal to the kanamycin resistance gene to test our DNA extraction method.
We used the microwave and boiling method described in the DNA isolation protocol. Next, we amplified a specific DNA-sequence of the KEIO-strain with primers IG0014 and IG0015 ( GoTaq PCR ). If the primers annealed, a band of size ~750 bp was expected. To be sure that the amplified fragment was the right one, we did a digestion with BsrBI, to obtain DNA-fragments of sizes approximately 250 bp and 500 bp ( Digestion ). We checked the sample on a gel ( DNA electrophoresis ), as shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11: Digestion of PCR product on DNA extracted by DNA isolation methods. The number of cells are indicated in each lane. The microwave extraction entails using the microwave for 10 seconds, while the longer microwave extraction was for 20 seconds.
We can conclude that both methods are suitable to isolate DNA from gram-negative bacteria. However, the boiling method was more user-friendly. This is because the settings of different microwaves are not always the same. For example, when we tried our protocol with another microwave, the tubes containing the samples burst open.
Easy DNA amplification and transcription
Amplification of DNA, which follows the isolation, is possible by Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). This isothermal alternative of a PCR reaction, can be applied at constant temperature. In this way, no thermocycler is required.
The RPA reaction was tested on pSB1T3, a plasmid with a tetracycline resistance gene, following the RPA protocol. We used the designed primers IG0016 and IG0017 , with an expected amplification product of 167 bp. After purification of the samples ( PCR product purification ), the samples were checked on a RNA"

For this reason, they were replaced with electrodes made from another kind of carbon material, which were obtained from University of Readings National Centre for Biotechnology Education . However, the material is not very strong and easily ruptures, especially when wet. This made it difficult to connect the copper wires and to hold the electrodes in place within the chambers. The design also lacked means to drive out the oxygen from medium with nitrogen, an important prerequisite to establish anaerobic conditions within the fuel cell.

The Third Generation Fuel Cell
The fuel cell consists of six plastic parts. The overall design is similar to 2nd generation cell, but the frames are split up into two parts each. This allows for the carbon electrodes to be mounted between two frames, as was already the case for the membrane before. This ensures the fragile carbon cloth is fixed in the center of each chamber and can be tapped by squeezing a wire between the gaskets. Since the material is highly porous, bacteria and medium can diffuse through the electrode and travel between both halves of a single chamber.
The second important change from the previous design is the introduction of four tube connectors on each frame. This allows aeration of the anode chamber with nitrogen gas and, e.g., introducing fresh medium in the system. The copper wire connecting the electrodes is replaced with platinum, because of the rapid copper-oxidation, resulting in a decreased conductivity.
Dimensions per chamber:
height: 50mm
width: 50mm
depth: 12mm
volume: 30 mL
Figure 11: The Third Generation Fuel Cell. This advanced design allows nitrogen aeration and the easy refill of the cell through the newly introduced tube connectors. The anode and cathode compartments were furthermore split into two plastic parts each, jamming the electrodes inbetween to prevent their rupture.

Additionally the metal sensing team prepared for transformation in Bacillus subtilis by carrying out the evening steps of the protocol - this will mean that if the midi-preps are a success then B. subtilis can be transformed with cotC-GFP-smtA in pMUTIN4 today!
Today's lab work will focus on midi-prepping colony 8 (which is a potential cotC-GFP-smtA transformant E. coli colony). The DNA will then be analysed by digesting a sample with BamHI and HindIII and running it on agarose gel through DNA gel electrophoresis. If successful, the DNA will be used to transform B. subtilis cells; if unsuccessful the ligations of pMUTIN4 to cotC-GFP-smtA will have to be repeated on another day.
Practical Outline
The tasks the Metal Sensing team hope to carry out by the end of the day include the following:
Midi-prep colony 8 of the potential cotC-GFP-smtA transformant E. coli DH5-alpha cells.
Digest the midi-prepped DNA with BamHI and HindIII
Analyse the digested products through DNA gel electrophoresis:
If successful, use midi-prepped DNA to transform Bacillus subtilis
If unsuccessful, prepare to carry out a second attempt at ligating cotC-GFP-smtA to pMUTIN4.
Procedure
1) Midi-prep of potential cotC-GFP-smtA transformant E. coli cells
To carry out the midi-prep we used Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute HP Midi-prep kit (and the protocol attached to it). We conducted steps 1-6 and then steps 7b to 11b (the Spin Method) followed by the DNA concentration step. There was only one major change to the protocol:
For the DNA concentration step instead of transferring the eluted DNA to one centrifuge tube, the DNA was transferred into two Eppendorf tubes. This change means that we now have access to a centrifuge capable of reaching 13,000rpm; if we had stuck to using the centrifuge tubes described in the protocol then we wouldn't be able to reach the required g-force.
Once the midi-prep process was completed the DNA was placed in the -20ºC freezer.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Even if genetically modified microorganisms were to escape into nature, they can be programmed with sophisticated kill switches, making them  unfit to survive outside a controlled environment. Genetically modified microorganisms  are especially used in the medical industry.

Through these experiments, we fully demonstrate that our BiFC system works and prove the improvement of BBa_E0020 is a success. And BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005 can used as labels for interaction of two target proteins and the location of two proteins in subcellular level, tremendously expanding the usage of the original part and equipping iGEMers with another powerful tool for biological visualization.
BBa_K2886007
BBa_K2886007 encodes VEGF-165 with His9 tag. VEGF is a big family including lots of types. VEGF-121 was firstly introduced to iGEM by Slovenia in 2012 (BBa_K782061) and then was improved by SYSU-CHINA in 2017 (BBa_K2298001). VEGF-165 was also firstly introduced to iGEM by NYMU_Taiwan in 2012(BBa_K896922). However, there is no detail in the part wiki at all except for the part name, and actually we find this part using registry blast. This year, Fudan-CHINA makes new improvements to VEGF-165 to make it more useful and accessible to enrich the choices of iGEMers.    We perfect the description of VEGF-165 to make more iGEMers can know about and search for VEGF-165 expediently. And to test our STEP system, we need a large amount of VEGF-165. However, buying VEGF from companies will be really expensive. The average price of 1mg VEGF-165 is as high as 10,000 yuan (nearly 5000 dollars). Thus, we decide to construct plasmid and express VEGF-165 by ourselves.

Figure 2: Cultivation of moss in a Bioreactor
P. patens stands out among the whole plant kingdom as the sole exception where gene targeting is feasible as an easy and fast routine procedure, even with an efficiency similar to S. cerevisiae, due to highly efficient homologous recombination. [ Reski et al., 2004 ] For that reason it is very easy to create knockout mosses by precise mutagenesis following the approach of reverse genetics in order to study the function of genes. Performing functional genomics in higher organisms is very important to understand biological functions of proteins in a multicellular context, e.g. in the context of cell-cell-contacts.
As mosses mainly are in a haploid stage during their life cycle they are very straight-forward objects for genetics because complex backcrosses to determine changes in the genotype are not necessary
Moss development starts with a filamentous tissue, the protonema, which is growing by apical cell division and, therefore is perfectly suitable for cell-lineage analysis since development of the plant can be pinpointed to the differentiation of a single cell. [ Reski, 1998 ] Also the simple life cycle makes P. patens a very useful item for developmental biology
P. patens is increasingly used in biotechnology as a study object with implications for crop improvement or human health. Moss bioreactors (see Figure 2) can be used as an alternative to animal cell cultures (e.g. CHO cells) for the easy, inexpensive and safe production of complex biopharmaceuticals [ Reski and Decker, 2007 ] . For example it is a successful tool to produce asialo-EPO, a specific variant of Erythropoetin, which can perform its protective role by inhibiting apoptosis but has lost the potential doping activity. This safe drug is hard to produce in animal cell culture but easy to produce in the moss without impacting its growth or general performance [ Decker et al., 2012 ].

Plasmid was isolated from overnight cultures of cl lambda (two colonies – four tubes each) and PQ-B-R-OU-B in AK (4 colonies) using the QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit (QIAGEN).  Plasmid purity and concentration were measured using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer. The four tubes per colony of cl lambda were pooled and then vacufuged for two hours to increase the concentration of plasmid. RD was then set up with XbaI and PstI for 2 hours at 37 degrees for all the isolated and pooled plasmid.
Sequencing results of LuxPQ-B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 in psB1AC3 came back and the construct appears to be in the plasmid! Now we will be able to clone the PQ-OU construct into the Surrette vector and eventually start testing the promoter library.

Completion and Addition to Molecular Cloning and Transformation Activities
Construction zones one and two have been completed for the molecular cloning activity and are now going through testing. The third and final construction site will most likely be completed tomorrow since the most difficult part was determining the substrings required within a single note card that contains all the circuit parts to use for comparison purposes. This activity has a lot more ways to construct circuits then what they may do with the lab mission given so it is possible that other possible circuits may be included in case a user would like to test out the activity further.
The order of the tasks within the DNA extraction activity have had their order set so it is not longer possible to go to the end or middle of the activity and still obtain the results you would like. The activity is reset every fifteen minutes or when an avatar completes the activity, which may be changed depending on how long it takes for an average avatar to finish the activity.

Du fait d'avoir un messager découplé du strate chimique, notre projet rend la communication assez facile entre des systèmes organiques, et des systèmes au silicium, tels les ordinateurs.
Le Nom
Vous avez sans doute reconnu le jeux de mots à l'origine du nom du projet. Le Wi-Fi est un standard de communication basé sur IEEE 802.11 très connu au monde. Non-officiellement, on pense Wi-Fi est né du Wireless Fidelity. Donc, parce que notre système permet la communication sans l'utilisation des fils, il est alors wireless. En ce qui concerne la fiabilité, on verra...
Or, avant de faire l'incursion au domaine du copyright, il faut clarifier deux aspects:
Notre nom es WiFi, et non pas le Wi-Fi du Wi-Fi Alliance (notez le trait d'union).
D'autre part, une enquête rapide du Système Électronique des Marques de Commerce , du Bureau des Patentes et des Marques de Commerce des États Unis a révèle que le mot WiFi était une marque de commerce en 2006, mais elle est listée comme ""Morte"" actuellement. C'est pour cela qu'on n'enfreint personne en utilisant WiFi.
Les Détails du Projet
On définit le phénomène de communication comme le transfert d'information par un moyen spécifique d'une entité émettrice à une entité réceptrice. Les entités biologiques dépendent des temps immémoriaux en messagers chimiques pour transmettre leurs informations. Cela est vrai tant pour des populations d'organismes unicellulaire, que pour des organismes multicellulaires. Parce que ce sont des messagers chimiques, ils sont alors contraints à l'intérieur d'un système chimique. C'est la raison pour laquelle même des messagers de portée longue comme des hormones ne dépassent pas le système chimique qu'est le corps humain.
Notre objectif dans ce projet s'agit de rendre la barrière chimique obsolète avec l'implémentation d'un système indépendant du strate chimique. Cela nous a conduit à l'utilisation d'un messager non-chimique, c'est-à-dire des photons. Nos"

3. Views on cigarette and tobacco industry
Generally speaking, we do not support smoking. According to the data, more than 74% of people never smoke, and,even so, most of the smokers investigated are concentrated in adults over 30 years old. This data is still very gratifying. People from all walks of life have basically the same views on the advantages and disadvantages of the tobacco industry. Very few people think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The descriptions when they choosed the options show that everyone knows the disadvantages of smoking, but some smokers are also very straightforward to write that they can’t help smoking. Smoking has become thire habit very early. This seems to be the same as the tobacco industry in society. In China, the taxation of the tobacco industry exceeds the total tax by 7%. Its existence seems to have become an indispensable part. When we collect statistics on how to reduce the harm caused by cigarettes, “Limit The scale of the tobacco industry”is the option that elected the least. The people are quite rational about the tobacco industry.More than 44% of people think it's hard to say that the existence of the tobacco industry is good or bad, and their reasons are also the relatively high angle of “existence is reasonable” and “the tobacco industry provides countries with extremely high taxes”,etc. Reducing the harm of cigarettes to people is undoubtedly a long way to go.
4. The Knowledge of Tobacco Waste
This part of the data is not unexpected. The public does not know much about the waste of the tobacco industry. Fortunately, our other HP work will show this knowledge in detail. I believe those who have already done the questionnaire and are concerned about our subject can definitely have a deeper understanding of tobacoo waste and tobacoo industry.
5. The propagation of iGEM
Among minors under the age of 18 and adults over the age of 30, the proportion of people who know iGEM is really small (less than 25%), but in the 19-29 age group (more than 92% are college or undergraduate),the proportion is quite high (more than 50%), indicating that iGEM's promotion among college students is quite successful. Expanding its influence throughout society is a further advocacy work for iGEM. (At the beginning of the questionnaire and tips for some questions, weposted the iGEM official website hyperlink and continue to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge.In other words, the promotion of this questionnaire also greatly promoted iGEM and synthetic biology.)

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

The check if the seven proteins, chromoprotein red/blue, ccdB, mazF, ccdA, mazE and dam methylase were expressed we used SDS-PAGE. It was also important to see, if the proteins especially the toxins were secreted to the media. The chromoproteins can be found at about 25kda, at the size of 32kDa we can find the dam methylase. The ccdB has a weight of about 11kDa.

We can a little lower than the 35kDA standard the dam methylase. At the size of 25kDA we find the chromoproteins from the differnen strains. At 11kDA the ccdB toxin of the blue strain can be detected.
The two antitoxins and mazE are smaller than 10kDA, when seeing the picture in real we could find small bands lower than 10kDA. Unfortinately no time was left for puring a higher concentrated SDS gel.

Since we were going to be using NPs in our research, we needed to make sure that we were disposing our waste properly.

Prototype
We have chosen to use a safe and common lab strain of E. coli, K-12, as our chassis (Environmental Protection Agency 1977). In both approaches, our constructs do not express proteins associated with virulence. PR is a membrane protein that commonly exists in marine bacteria. As for biofilm production, we were careful to avoid known virulence factors such as alpha hemolysins (Fattahi et al. 2015). However, biofilms are sometimes associated with health problems, so we plan to only use our biofilm in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Biosafety is built into WWTPs; before treated effluent is released back into the environment, it must go through a final disinfection step, where chlorine, ozone, or UV radiation are used to kill microbes still present in the wastewater (Pescod 1992).

The underlying mechanism hereby relies on the creation of an instable, highly excited intermediate under the consumption of energy. This high-energy intermediate then spontaneously falls back into a state of lower energy, emitting the energetical difference as visible light. While mainly being used as a folded, stabilizing element at the N-terminus for the construct containing the biotin acceptor peptide, the nanoluciferase could also be used for advanced binding studies via luciferase assays. [11]
Figure 5: Reaction scheme of the reaction catalyzed by the NanoLuc nanoluciferase. Taken from the NanoGlo Assay Kit manual.
Luciferases have also found their way into biotechnological applications. [12] The simplistic concept of creating visible (and thus easily measurable) light makes luciferases ideal reporters for the expression of secretable proteins via a corresponding assay. This project also made use of a luciferase for the determination of expression levels of the BAP surface receptor while providing a stable and folded domain at the N-terminus, as well as having been used for the choice of signal peptide. The monomeric luciferase used in this project, the so-called ’NanoLuc™' [13] (due to terms of simplicity referred to as ’nanoluciferase’ in the following), can be fused to other proteins in order to make their expression visible and quantifiable. This engineered luciferase emits a steady, easily detectable glow when exposed to its substrate, while being only 19 kDa large and being brighter, more specific and steadier than other luciferases commonly found in nature. Using luciferases for the quantification of expression levels offers several advantages over fluorescent proteins, including higher sensitivity and smaller size.
CMV promoter
Last but not least, high expression levels of the receptor, so that a high avidity for the interaction may be reached. The CMV promoter (taken from the parts registry, BBa_K74709 ) therefore enables constitutively high expression of the receptor - and, in the case of the BAP-construct, the biotin ligase BirA.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," - the feces passed through a series of filters which gradually decreased in size. The recovery past 0.2-micron filter was very small - 10% of the water present in synthetic feces. However, this was also a result of losses of liquids due to transfer between containers.
For this week's HPLC experiment, samples were diluted by three different dilution factors. The HPLC results were more reliable. The optimal dilution rates were determined from this experiment and will be used in the future.
Week 13: July 24-28
This week a couple of group members worked on developing a large-scale method for VFA extraction based on conducted experiments. The proposed technologies included screw dewatering system, centrifuge, worm centrifuge and self-cleaning filters.  We have also looked into the wastewater processing technologies employed on the International Space Station and the technologies proposed for Mars missions by NASA. This research generated new ideas such as multi-filtration, distillation, and torrefaction. Torrefaction can be defined as a thermochemical treatment of biomass in the absence of oxygen. The two methodologies that the team chose to explore further were the screw press followed by multi-filtration and the torrefaction processing unit.
This week, we also focused on feces collection on Mars and fermentation of feces to increase the concentration of VFA, which would then be consumed by engineered bacteria to produce PHB. In our proposed system, astronaut’s feces would be collected using a vacuum toilet into a 10L storage tank. Although a vacuum toilet requires a small amount of water, it can be recovered at the end of the process. The volume of the storage tank was selected based on NASA requirements of accommodating production of up to 150 grams of feces per event for 2 events per crew member per day and also accommodating for potential diarrhea events that can result in up to 1.5L of liquid. In the next stage of the process, feces would be fermented with naturally occurring bacteria to increase the concentration of VFA. Although higher VFA production is expected to occur at 37C, experiments will be conducted to determine whether VFA production can also occur at room temperature.
Week 14: July 31 - August 4
To compare the two proposed methodologies for VFA and liquids extraction for large scale, the ESM parameters were found/estimated for different systems. Since the torrefaction process is a novel solution to solid waste management the ESM parameters for the equipment are not yet developed, so it was chosen to make estimations based on the vapour compression"

As one application of our project, we would like to offer a simple drug test based on           our system to help men and women identify danger when going out. Redesigning the Tar           LBD to bind Rohypnol takes us one step closer to achieving this goal.
Figure 7 and figure 8 demonstrate the library we obtained for Rohypnol after running several cycles           and filtration.
Fig. 7: Alignment of the ligand binding domain (LBD).           The alignment presents the 4 variants in the library with the native Tar (wild type).

Ampicillin
Targeting bacteria towards antibiotics may seem redundant as the bacteria will simply die,           however it can be also used as an effective kill switch - a small dose of antibiotics can kill           more bacteria if those are attracted to it. To expand our novel approach we redesigned           the Tar LBD to bind Ampicillin antibiotics.
Figure 9 and figure 10 demonstrate the library we obtained for Ampicillin after running several cycles and filtration.
Fig. 9: Alignment of the ligand binding domain (LBD). The            alignment presents the 13 variants in the library with the native Tar (wild type).

Histamine results
The Rosetta’s design process for Histamine ligand produced 870 results, out of which 11 variants remained after filtering.           Induction of point mutations was performed on the native Tar LBD in order to build those 11 variants,          and out of them only 6 exhibited the expected sequences in sequencing and were subjected to chemotaxis tests .          The tests consisted of placing the cloned bacterial solution in a commercial ibidi chip. The chip was then placed under a microscope and the attractant Histamine was added to start the experiment. The interaction of the bacteria with the attractant was observed over time and one frame was taken every 30 seconds for 20 minutes.          The control consisted of the same conditions, with motility buffer being placed instead of the attractant, Histamine. Out of 6 tested variants only one (variant number 9) was discovered to be attracted to Histamine.          The results of the chemotaxis test for variant number 9 are presented in figure 2.

Waterloo
uOttawa has historically collaborated with Waterloo iGEM . This year, Waterloo helped us to construct and analyze a mathematical model for our genetic network. They also helped to compare this model to existing ones from literature, and to find parameters that make tri-stability possible.
We helped Waterloo by improving their DNA assembly workflow, and attempting to assemble a troublesome plasmid. However, a crucial DNA fragment chronically failed to PCR. Nevertheless, we continued to assist Waterloo by troubleshooting their own DNA assembly with particularily problematic parts.
Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Five iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team.
uOttawa, being a rather senior team among oGEM, contributed with many years of experience to improve the work of the other teams. We mentored other teams on how to assemble DNA cheaply and efficiently, how to select protocols and chassis organisms, and how to present the project effectively to iGEM. In particular, we helped McMaster, a team new to iGEM, on how iGEM works and how to most effectively perform the cutting-edge science that we do all summer.

Campus Lectures
Since students are a curious group with a strong thirst for knowledge, we went to Tieling Middle School and gave some lectures on campus to students of different ages on the topic.             At the end of the talk we had time for some Q&A, and the students and their teachers asked a lot and shared their dreams with us.             We also surveyed them in order to know what they are interested in, and what is the best way for them to learn more about Synthetic Biology.
SynBio course and iGEM recruiting
We negotiated with some elective teachers and gave a 20min class to students in Tongji University. In this course we introduced basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology, and, since there were students who majored in other specialities, we used metaphors to make them understand what Synthetic Biology is.
After that, we used social media to share recruiting information and introduced iGEM to students in Tongji. We hope iGEM will show them a bigger world!

S.T.E.A.M Education
The FabLab Shanghai’s movement is closely aligned with the DIY and open source hardware movement, and shares its philosophy and technology with people from several groups.
We get established a long-term friendly relation of cooperation with the Shanghai FabLab, and we worked together on the Bio-FabLab. We are now preparing a kit for STEAM Education with a simple and practical bio-toolbox and APP. We are thankful to Fablab Shanghai, which helped us with the industrial mapping and making the instruments.
The bio-toolbox is aimed to children, we are developing an open source biological instrument which is low cost and much easier to operate. It may let more people do an experiment without being limited by the experimental environment or professional knowledge. The toolbox is in the making and will be presented to primary schools and middle schools. The toolbox has been designed well and will enter the trial soon.
In order to give a better user experience we introduced our project and toolbox to students from the School of Design and got a lot advice on the user experience and possible new applications.

Also, as a financial strategy our team also got involved into a crowdfunding campaign. To explain our project to a wider public, we made a video which was released together with the campaign. Carla did the drawings shown on the video and the voice-over. The video equipment was provided by Martin and filmed by him.
Laboratory
Without our sharp lab team, our project would have never seen the light of the day. The teammates working during the months of June, July and August were: Laetitia, Naiane, Mathilde, Caroline, Marion, Léa, Charlène, Terrence and Alice. During the months of September and October Maxence and Mahnaz continued the experiments and they were the ones who assembled the final biobricks. Furthermore, the instructors (Claire, Marie and Olivier) and the PIs (Philippe and Sylvie) have guided the team during all the lab work.
During the lab work, we've met several people who willingly helped us:
Emmanuel Dassa for providing the lab itself
Isabelle Hatin and Olivier Bugaud for the cytometry
Dr Annick Jack for the Western-Blot
Sylvain Pendino and Myriam Swist for helping us with the medium preparations and sterilizations
Chantal Bohn for help us with the many sequencings
Model
This part of the project was almost entirely done by Marion, our bioinformatician. During the summer she worked hard to build our models. Fabrice Leclerc, Claire Toffano-Nioche, Emily Drouineau and Matthieu Sarazin helped a lot and gave very important feedback for this aspect of the project.
Wiki Design
The Design of our Wiki was done by Gaetan and Carla with the help of Maxime Schaffhauser, a web writer student and it has been programmed by Fabio. Furthermore, Marion and Terrence, who have the best skills in IT, gave a strong support on the Wiki design development. The Wiki construction was supervised by Maxence.

We exemplified this scenario by using a Tet Repressor fused with a perfect binding site for miRNA 122, a liver-specific miRNA (Jopling et al., 2005). At the same time, the promoter expressing the GOI would be under control of a Tet Operator. Upon presence of the miRNA 122, the Tet Repressor would be knocked down, release the promoter and expression of the GOI could be established.

The miTuner Plasmid  (driving the measurment BBa_K337038 luciferase from CMV_TetO2 promoter) was cotransfected with a TetR expression construct tagged with 4 perfect mir122 binding sites. Rescue of gene expression occurs in case of coexpression of shmir122. In the control experiment (coexpression of miRsAg) did not lead to Luc2 expression rescue, inicating that the on tuning is working.
Fig. 7: On-Tuning construct pBS_sv40_TetO2_Luc2 was cotransfected with a TetR tagged with 4 perfect miR122 binding sites and either an hcr (mir122 expression) construct or a mir155 control plasmid. Furthermore, a renilla construct was cotransfected also for normalization purposes. Transfection with hcr leads to higher Luc2 expression (rescue of expression) compared to the control, due to TetR knockdown. As positive control for the rescue, DOX was applied for avoid binding of the TetR to the Tet operator.
Fig. 8: On-Tuning construct pBS_sv40_TetO2_Luc2 was cotransfected with a control TetR NOT tagged with mir122 binding sites and either an hcr (mir122 expression) construct or a mir155 control plasmid. Furthermore, a renilla construct was cotransfected also for normalization purposes. Transfection with hcr or mir122 lead to comparable expression ratios (NO rescue of expression via hac), indicating that the control TetR construct is not affected by either shRNA. As positive control for the rescue, DOX was applied again in order to avoid binding of the TetR to the Tet operator.

For many species of bacteria this is done through a molecule called AI-2, which signals the coordination behaviour when at a specific concentration. Quorum sensing can be very beneficial because instead of a few bacteria trying to tackle a big oil spill, many of them could be doing it at the same time making it more effective!

Meetings and preliminary presentation preparation
Our modelling and lab teams met and delegated tasks, so that everyone knows who is responsible for what in terms of coding, data collection and writing procedures. Once that was done, our matlab modelling team went to prepare a presentation (for which I'm responsible for compiling slides and writing the system characterisation section). Our lab team also met to plan a presentation, for which I am responsible for making a flowchart that illustrates the mutant slides.

Message sequence in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930001 )
The iGEM team Groningen 2016 worked on bioencryption in order to safely store data in DNA. In our project we were mainly working with two sequences of DNA which were the encrypted message sequence and the encryption key sequence. The message sequence was created by our software. It is therefore artificial DNA. We ordered the encryption message sequence as gBlock from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies). To submit our message sequence as BioBrick ( BBa_K1930001 ) we cloned it in the pSB1C3 standard iGEM backbone.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: The message sequence was amplified from pDR111+message plasmid.    Primers used for the amplification were message prefix and message    suffix (primer sequences can be found here ).
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .

Conclusion:
Amplification of the message sequence and addition of the prefix and    suffix to this sequence was successful. It was verified by DNA    electrophoresis. Correct size of a band could be seen and    that was 599 bp.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit – (Jena Bioscience) .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
07/10/16: On this day restriction digestion of PCR product of the    message sequence and pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was done. Message    sequence as an insert was cut with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes.    The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations as red    colonies and the correct ones as white ones.

Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.
You can download our spreadsheet here .
The model showed that is is cost effective to screen most people who have smoked.
The American Cancer Society recommends screening for people: [24]
between 55 and 77 years old,
who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

The mutant having a AtSultr1;1-knockout showed up a phenotype similar to the wildtype while the AtSultr1;2-mutant showed differences in the phenotype compared to the wildtype relating to root length, growth and sulphate uptake. This confirms the assumption that AtSultr1;2 plays a major role in the sulfate uptake system [61] [62].

Overview
Our team thought that presentations would be an effective method to fulfill one of our goals that our human practice team set up: provision of information for the public. Our team originally planned to do one presentation for freshmen School of Science students at HKUST, but we ended up being involved in five different presentations. Three of the presentations have already been conducted, while the other two presentations will be conducted after the wiki freeze.
Presentations with other iGEM Teams
This year our team had the opportunity to interact with other universities: South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC), and Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). On August 17th, we met SUSTC team members at our university. We hosted a semi-formal event where each team had a chance to present and share their project. We also had a Q&A session after each project so that we could discuss the projects in more detail. After the presentations, we ate lunch together and had a tour around our campus. We also participated in a similar event in CUHK on 24th August. This time, three teams – the HKUST, CUHK, and SUSTC teams – participated.
Presentation for HKUST Students
Our team did a presentation for HKUST freshmen from School of Science on September 27th. During the presentation, we introduced synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, briefly described our project, and encouraged students to join the next iGEM team. We also did another presentation for freshmen of the School of Engineering after the Regional Jamboree on October 9th with similar content. Both presentations received enthusiastic response from the students.
Innocarnival
Our team plans to hold a workshop at the Hong Kong InnoCarnival event on November 10th. InnoCarnival is a flagship event of the InnoTech Month organized by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC). It aims to let members of the public experience scientific and technological discoveries at a more intimate level. Our talk will introduce synthetic"

gBlock Sequence for 6xHis-PAM-SnoopTag
gBlock Sequence for 6xHis-TycA-S563A-SpyTag
gBlock Sequence Design for Assemblase Enzyme Scaffolding
The following method will result in a DNA sequence which can be synthesised, digested, transformed, cloned and expressed to produce Spy/SnoopTagged Enzymes for use with the Assemblase scaffold.
Get the enzyme sequences for the two enzymes from the enzymatic pathway to be scaffolded.
Determine which enzyme is rate-limiting.
(Optional) Open a DNA sequence viewer, such as Benchling, so the sequence can be visualised and annotated.
To both sequences, add the following sequence directly before the start codon: GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGCACCACCACCATCATCATGGAAGTGGC. This sequence contains:
iGEM prefix
6xHisTag
GSG Linker
To both sequences, delete the stop codon and any DNA which follows.
To the rate limiting enzyme, add the following sequence: GGATCTGGCAAACTTGGGGATATTGAATTTATCAAGGTCAATAAGTAATACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAG. This sequence contains:
GSG Linker
SnoopTag
iGEM suffix
Before proceeding with synthesis and digestion, check the DNA sequence to ensure that it does not contain the restriction sites in the iGEM prefix and suffix (EcoR1, XbaI, SpeI or PstI). If these restriction sites are present, mutate a base in the unwanted restriction site which will result in the same amino acid being produced (synonymous mutation).
Synthesise the DNA.
Follow protocols found on the lab pages , specifically:
Digestion
Ligation
Transformation
Protein Production
Minomic Visit
Having investigated the areas in which our Assemblase scaffold could be applied, the team decided to get a broader understanding of the commercialisation path we would have to follow. We did this by meeting with Dr. Brad Walsh, the CEO of Minomic, an immuno-oncology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Brad’s significant experience in the Australian biological commercialisation space made him an ideal candidate with whom to discuss the plausibility of our team commercialising our synthetic biology tool in the future.
Brad explained some Minomic’s key products in development, focusing on MiCheck, a prostate cancer diagnosis tool, which works via antibody-mediated analysis of serum samples. Brad informed us that from Minomic"
