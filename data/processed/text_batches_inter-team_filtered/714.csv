USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#human practice.php_-_-_TEXT.html," will change the frequency and pattern of research results updating of biology, and even show every single change of biology real-timely like Wikipedia. Every researcher can share the progress of biology, and biological research will stride into the information age.
We have already reccomended BioPano to many biological researchers, and received great feedbacks.
Summer Vacation Meetup
Since local competitions are not held this year, iGEM foundation encourages every district to organize communication activity themselves. We responded to the call and organized  summer vacation meetup at University of Science and Technology of China.
This summer, we invited several iGEM teams from China to USTC from August 15th to August 17th for project showing and ideas interchanging. SJTU-Software, SJTU-BioX-China, SYSU-Software, XMU-China, HFUT_China, USTC_Software and USTC-China paticipated in this activity.
The meetup was successful. Firstly, iGEM teams from China got to know each other, and developed profound friendship. Secondly, we understood each other’s project, which would benefit the improvements of our projects. Thirdly, the meetup simulated the real competition segments. We felt the atmosphere of the competition and found the deficiency of our presentations. During the meetup, we also discussed a lot about iGEM, hoping that iGEM could get better and better.
All teams attending the meetup make positive evaluations to the activity.

4X Sucrose Solution
.
Introduction
This is the recipe to make 472.5 mL of 4x Sucrose Solution.
Procedure
Add 1 cup of Sucrose to a bottle
Fill the bottle with distilled water until it reaches a final volume of 472.5 mL
As the bottle is being filled, swirl the contents so that the sucrose can begin to dissolve
Autoclave the solution
Conjugation with DAP
.
Introduction
This is the protocol for conjugating a plasmid using a DAP dependent donor strain and a targeted recipient strain.
Materials
.3 mM Diaminopimelic Acid (DAP)
DAP Auxotroph strain with a plasmid
This plasmid should have an antibiotic resistant gene, an origin of transfer and a gene of interest.
Recipient Strain
LB+DAP Plates
LB+Antibiotic Plates
The antibiotic should be the one that plasmid has a resistance to.
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
Procedure
Grow up the donor and recipient strains
For the donor cells, inoculate liquid LB+antibiotic+DAP (the one that the plasmid is resistant to). Depending on the amount of liquid media used, the volume should be divided by 1000 and then multiplied by 3 in order to determine the amount of DAP used. Ex. 5 mL of media will need 15 µL of DAP.
For the recipient cells, grow them in the required liquid media and an antibiotic if needed.
Wash the donor and recipient cells
After sufficient growth, transfer 1 mL of each strain into a microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge the tubes at 3,000 RPM for 1 minute, for a pellet to form.
After centrifugation, decant the supernatant, add 1 mL of PBS to the tube, and resuspend the pellets by vortexing it.
Centrifuge these tubes again at 3,000 RPM for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellets with 1 mL of PBS.
Combine the cells into a microcentrifuge tube
Take an OD600 for both cell types and make a 1:1 ratio of donor and recipient cells
Combine 50 µL of each cell type at a 1:1 ratio into a microcentrifuge tube
Spin down the solution for 3 seconds in a mini centrifuge.
Plate the solutions and incubate
Transfer 100 µL of the solution onto a LB+DAP"

May Festival
On the 14th and 15th October, 2016, we ran a booth at school festival in the University of Tokyo, named  ""May Festival"", in collaboration with four iGEM teams in Japan;
Tokyo-Tech, Kyoto, Gifu and KAIT.  Almost 150,000 visitors came to this festival, and we had a good opportunity to explain synthetic biology and our project to them. At the same time, each team gave some advice on the other teams' project.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the"

Improving Flip Flop
The Final Construct
The Final Construct
The Improved Flip Flop (Part: BBa_K510019 and Part: BBa_K510036 ) is based on the basic flip flop (Part: BBa_K177038 ) and was built with devices which are in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Here we show the final structure of our improved bistable. As well as the two operons with their protein fusions and the promoter with the asRNA, we show the different restriction sites we have introduced and the enzymes that target each site. Finally, the total length of our construction is indicated in the figure. As for the different sequences used in our construction, here it is a brief description of each one:
cI promoter (Part: BBa_R0051 ): The cI regulated promoter is based on the pR promoter from bacteriophage lambda. The promoter has two DNA binding sites for lambda cI repressor BBa_C0051. cI binding results in repression of transcription. The specific sequence used here is based on the cI repressible promoter used in the Elowitz repressilator (and references therein).
Lac promoter (Part: BBa_R0010 ): This part is an inverting regulator sensitive to LacI and CAP. It contains two protein binding sites. The first binds CAP protein, which is generally present in E.coli and is associated with cell health and availability of glucose. The second one binds LacI protein.
RBS.3 medium (Part: BBa_B0032 ): This part is a weak RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis.
LacI: Our LacI was taken from E. coli strain K-12 substrain MG1655 chromosome genome and it has a total of 1083 bp.

We used as phage 10 µL of 1L, 10L, 40T4, T4DOS, and T4 infected phage and placed them each in one of tubes labeled -1.
We performed a dilution series taking out 10 µL each time and placing it into the next tube, 5 times. The total volume in the last tube was 110 µL.
We added 4.5 mL of 1X top agar to .5 mL of broth and plated it on LB plates.
We spotted each concentration on the plates and incubated it overnight at 37°C.
-Results from 04/08:
Phage 10L w/ w3110 had large scale infection every concentration
Phage 10L w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
Phage 1L w/ w3110 had infection in very large concentrations
Phage 1L w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
Phage T4 DOS w/ w3110 had infection in very large concentrations
Phage T4 DOS w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
Phage 40 T4 w/ w311o had no phage infection
Phage 40 T4 w/ BL21 had large scale infection at every concentration
Phage T4 inf w/ w311o had large scale infection at every concentration
Phage T4 inf w/ BL21 had large scale infection at every concentration
We had a significant amount of running that occurred on almost every plate, so the results were a little difficult to read. We concluded that the phage is a high enough concentration that we would have to do another phage titer to a smaller dilution in order to determine actual concentration. The controls were all a lawn of bacteria.
4/10/13
-We performed titers of T4 infected phage from off of two separate E. Coli strands, BL21 and W3110.
We added .1mL of the liquid culture to 1 mL of both strands of bacteria.
After allowing infection to occur overnight, we centrifuged the tubes to separate the bacteria from the phage.
We separated the supernatant into a new eppendorf tube, and used 10 µL as the 0 concentration.
We then performed a phage titer using five tubes of 90 µL LB each, adding 10 µL from each one to the next.

And finally our primers arrived!! (after 3 weeks). We did PCR of the different parts that we need to build our first construct (the Working Plasmid). For that we:
a) Obtained the parts necessary to make the Working Plasmid and transformed e. coli with them.
b) Did minipreps of all the constructs to purify the DNA from the transformed bacteria.
c) Amplified the constructs in the thermocycler.
d) Did electrophoresis of the PCR amplicons.
We had several problems with the electrophoresis, but after some attempts it worked. 5 of the 7 PCR were successfully amplified. The two parts that didn´t work are HIV cleavage site (2kb) and vector backbone pSB1K3 (42kb).
April 16-22, 2012
We did electrophoresis with HIV cleavage site and pSB1K3. This time, we added more of them (4 μL template in PCR) to ensure that they were present in our tubes.  We had now all the parts that we need to proceed! We made our first Gibson Assembly to build the working plasmid (see constructs). We need this plasmid to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid. But unluckily our colonies resulted to be red. This is not what we expected… later we did an analytical digestion to the DNA of those colonies, but we obtained strange results. Something went wrong.
This week we had the great opportunity to assist to a lecture of Dr. Aldo Leal. He is a Chilean biochemist that currently works in Germany studying the interactions between cells and biomaterials made of spider silk proteins. We learnt a lot of information about the production of recombinant spider silk proteins and the possibility to easily create films. Then, it’s not necessary to utilize other sophisticated spun methods like electrospinning. Later we met with Dr. Leal, and he recommended us the following very important paper: Cooper et al.  2009 – “A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like proteins for artificial fiber spinning”.

Groups
New technologies and ways of thinking also have a social effect. Products create gaps between the have and have-nots, while changes in employment patterns and sectors can create a need for new skill-sets. The field of synthetic biology is becoming more widely recognised as a group (and a degree title!) that more and more people are becoming part of. Shuna, Siming and Viv looked at how colours could effect social groupings and cultures, especially given that different cultures will have very different associations for each colour.
Laws
Synthetic biology, and the parts registry is open source, and yet the world of products and services relies heavily on ownership and property rights. This creates issues of property and patents; which may require new laws. Megan, Mike, and Tom took this to an extreme with a sketch from a world where the colour orange was patented, and it's use under strict control (much to the anger of coutries whose national flags contain the colour, as well as a certain well known mobile phone provider!)

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#secondtry#TeamCom_-_-_TEXT.html," INPC. Peking iGEM 2014 helped them standardizing a BioBrick BBa_K1405002. As for microbes motility is another shared point in our projects, how to establish a proper model became the same concern.WANG Chenggong introduced Peking’s models, from the insight to the methods, and analysis results. Binding model was explained in detail. Later, they discussed Beijing Normal University’s project and WANG Chenggong gave some suggestions on constructing  a dynamic model of E.coli and peanut root system, which quantitatively simulates the process of engineered organism moving.
Team communication is an undeletable part of human practice. Tens of Meet Ups were held before the Giant Jamboree around the world. By communicating, teams exchange their ideas and problems.
For instance, Peking iGEM and OUC-China had pleasant communication experience in the past years. This time, we both used holin/endolysin system as an induction suicide system, we discussed experiment protocols and results for weeks. Peking iGEM later provided these two genes with their primers to OUC-China due to the difference between the genes we used. Also, OUC-China sent their gas vesicle plasmids to us and did a confirming test.
Some fresh iGEM teams received Peking’s assistance included advice on modeling, providing experiments equipment, and constructing a standardized BioBrick (BBa_K1405002).
It is 7 years after iGEM Competition was introduced to China. More and more universities even high schools established their iGEM teams. Synthetic biology as a novel tool has been improving our life, many ideas from iGEMers came into application. It is undeniable that team communication did a lot for this. China iGEM teams have been working together to promoting synthetic biology and iGEM Competition. Education based on research impelled passion from young undergraduates, some of them would surely become specialist in some areas. Peking iGEM believes that team communication is a key assay enhancing synthetic biology development.

We were also there to observe how the BU iGem team did their work using Eugene during the design process. The meeting did not wind up being super useful as they didn't have many examples, and Traci was not there. The meeting was not also design heavy, so was not very useful for observation.
Wednesday: Willy Lensch from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, and director of the HSCI summer internship that I participated in last summer, came to speak about stem cells and the ethical questions that arise from developing experimental therapies.

Friday: We continued to work on drag-and-drop in Eugenie through the day. We have also been thinking about the backend programming that needs to go into Eugenie. As a lab bonding event, we went out to dinner at TGIF's, and then watched Monster's University.

Monday: We continued to work on Eugenie.
Tuesday: We have until Monday to complete a working copy of the web application of Eugenie before we move the project to a Microsoft Surface. Pressures has begun to mount because we all don't want to see our hard work and struggles in HTML/CSS/JQuery/AngularJS go to waste because we still can't get drag-and-drop to function properly.

Place all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius.
After 20 minutes, take only the tube labeled C from the shaker. Take 1mL from this tube and pipette it into a cuvette labeled C. Using 1mL of LB in a cuvette, blank the spectrophotometer at 600 OD. Then measure the absorbance of the cuvette labeled C. (In the actual procedure, 2 readings were done on the tube labeled C to check for consistency.
Remove the other three tubes after 30 minutes of incubation and add 900uL of T7 phage from the 8.24 stock to each tube, except C. From this point on, tube C is irrelevant and can be discarded. (There should be a 1:10 phage to bacteria concentration. The calculations are as follows: The spectrophotometer reading was 0.315, which indicates there are 1.58E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 1.585E9 bacteria per tube. This means that we need 1.58E8 phage added to each tube. Because the 8.24 stock is concentrated at 1.5E8 phage/ml [3E6 phage/20ul], 1053uL of phage stock will provide 1.58E8 phage. Only 900uL of phage stock was added to account for estimation error.)
Incubate all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius for 80 minutes.
Remove all the tubes and add 1mL of chloroform to each. Gently shake each tube and centrifuge it at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 7 Celsius. Remove the supernatant from each tube with a pipette and place it in a new tube with the same label. Be careful not to get the chloroform or bacteria when you remove the supernatant.

This would allow us to detect a greater breadth in the strains of E. coli that we can detect.  Finally, he put us in touch with E. coli vaccine manufacturer BioNiche, who gave us some great insight into the applications of such a sensor as we explain more in depth on our Informed Design page. Importantly, Dr. Armstrong also offered to provide us with DNA to test our final system, which would be critical once a final prototype was developed. Although this would get around our problem of not having the shiga toxin gene, this still left the issue of our positive control unsolved. After some thinking, we identified a small, 18-base pair region of the gene that we could use for this purpose. Based on our TALEs, this should be enough to see binding, however such a small fragment of the gene would not pose toxicity concerns to the public.
Assessment of Accuracy
Outside of safety for the tester, we also wanted to consider one other aspect of safety: safety for the industry. When talking to the feedlot, they brought up the issue of false positives. Although any false positives would hopefully be caught during factory screening, they would have the potential to devalue the cattle that they were found in. This would pose economic risks to not only the feedlot, but to other parties in the chain, including the consumer. In order to mitigate this risk, our test, when and if it reaches a commercial stage, would need to have an absolute minimum rate of false positives. This was part of the reason that we chose to use an in-vitro system, as we hoped that it would decrease variability and improve the robustness of our test.
Although false negatives are also very important, as they would lower the overall quality and reliability of our final product, they would not necessarily pose any new safety risks, as our system is designed to work in parallel with current industry practices. Regardless, we included a line for negative controls in our strip to verify the accuracy of each individual test. This negative control line would contain a sequence of DNA that is not homologous to our stx2 target. If a colour change was observed on this line, this would indicate our system is non-specifically binding to incorrect nucleotide sequences, indicating a problem. In order to have a quality product however, the rate of false positives and false negatives will need to be assessed.

Unfortunately for us, this is quite exceptional. Yet another way of the bomb emitting TNT is under stress our partial explosion, but this is very rare.
We can conclude from this that our TNT-sensing module will probably not be very suitable for the detection of the kind of unexploded ordnance the KMRD ususally deals with. However, there are still possibilities for the detection of other kinds of explosives, which are not sealed that well.

Visit to the Explosieven Opruimingsdienst
Summary: The Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie is a branch of the Dutch military responsible for the disposal of explosives in the Netherlands and on military missions. We learned from Luitenant Kolonel Bergman, commanding officer centre of expertise EODD, that our ELECTRACE system is particularly well suited for the detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), since these usually leak a lot of TNT.
We visited the Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie (EODD) in Soesterberg. The Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie , which literally translates in Explosive cleanup service from the department of defense, is a branch of the Dutch military responsible for the disposal of explosives in the Netherlands and on military missions in foreign countries. We had a meeting with Luitenant Kolonel (Lieutenant-Colonel) Bergman, commanding officer centre of expertise EODD. We discussed the activities of the EODD, our landmine sensor and possible applications of the sensor in their operations.
“Our activities can be split in two equal parts,” Lt Col Bergman told us, “fifty percent national operations and fifty percent of what we call “out of area” operations. The national operations mostly consist of removing unexploded ordnance for World War II, but also the disposal of possible improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as bags left at the airport with wires sticking out.” The discovery of unexploded ordnance still happens very often. In 2013, the EODD received 2300 notifications of such findings. “We have five teams on the road every day for the disposal of"

Comparision of motility between E. coli MG1655 and MC1000
The motility of both strains was tested under different conditions:
- agar concentration: 0.3 % and 0.5 %
- incubation temperatures: 25oC and 30oC
The OD600 was adjusted to 1.25 and the bacteria were inoculated in the middle of an LB-plate without yeast extract, but with streptomycin. After an incubation overnight there was no growth of MG1655 visible, because only MC1000 is resistant. Therefore, the experiment should be repeated.
The motility comparison experiment was repeated, but this time only the plates for MC1000 contained streptomycin. None of the 0.5% agar showed growth. Overall MG1655 swarms were possibly slightly larger than MC1000 (in Cambridge 06' MC1000 had much greater motility than MG1655). The growth/motility of MC1000 might be disturbed because, in contrast to MG1655, the bacteria had to deal with an antibiotic. Thus, the experiment will be repeated without any antibiotics in the agar.

Briefly, we will couple the expression and secretion of soluble variants of the IL-6 signal transducer (i.e., sgp130) to a promoter that is sensible to increases in local nitrosative stress. This soluble receptor has shown to bind with roaming complex of IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sgp80) and selectively inhibit IL-6 trans-signaling. For this, we will use a strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a natural gut probiotic that has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of a variety of intestinal and extra-intestinal pathologies. Moreover, we have been actively working in the human practices component of our project, by organizing different events to promote awareness about depression and anxiety. Currently, we are seeking collaborations with other iGEM teams from all over the world to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychosocial stressors that affect students at the undergraduate level. This is mainly because this demographic shows an increased risk of developing depression owing to sustained exposure to stressful environments.
Alterations in the interactions between the gut microbiome, the intestinal epithelium, and the immune system have been linked to a wide range of pathologies, which include autoimmune diseases, cancer, neurodevelopmental conditions, and psychological and cognitive disorders. The paramount role of the microbiome-epithelium-immune axis in human health has brought forth the need for the development of models that can be used to explore how these complex interactions. Although in vivo models still constitute the gold standard for the study of complex hetero-cellular phenomena, the use of animals for experimentation is associated with numerous technical, scientific, and ethical limitations. Because of this, significant efforts have been made towards the development of physiologically relevant in vitro models that can be used to circumvent the need and the limitations of animal models. Recent developments in the fields of microfluidics and microfabrication have led to the development of microphysiological models of human organs (i.e., organ-on-a-chip) with unprecedented human-relevance. Although these models can be used to study complex heterocellular interactions in biomimetic microenvironments, the incorporation of bacterial cells to study microbial-human interactions in vitro remains largely unexplored. This is mainly because of the lack of experimental platforms that can be used for the maintenance of mammalian-bacterial co-cultures in vitro. This is particularly important in the context of the human gut, owing to the key role of the microbiota in"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"strate Droplets could then be merged with Amplification Droplets containing MDA mix and Reference Nucleotides.
Each merged droplet now contains a specific ratio of Product Cytidines to Methylated Cytidines. Such information can then be recorded by initiating MDA reaction. After the reaction, the amplified DNA molecules now have the specific ratio of nucleotides, wherein the ratio of those nucleotides depend on the specific esterase mutant activity.
6.  Reading the activity information - sequencing and data analysis
General description
The last step of the CAT-Seq is the retrieval of recorded activity information from the amplified DNA. In theory, this may be achieved by any sequencing method that can incorporate a DNA modification recognition step. Yet, CAT-Seq uses Nanopore Sequencing for several reasons:
1. Nanopore sequencing allows to sequence long molecules, which eliminates the need of biomolecule fragmentation. This is an extremely important characteristic to us because when working with large libraries of mutants in single droplets, fragmenting amplified DNA in those droplets means that all of those fragments in droplets would need to be barcoded. While in theory, this is a possible thing to do, it would require an extra merging and amplification step which would immensely decrease the accuracy of the activity determination. That is because in general, every step of the biotechnological method never is one hundred percent efficient. In turn, the lower amount of steps your system needs to take in order to produce results - the more accurate it will be. That is why reducing the number of steps in CAT-Seq by omitting fragmentation and barcoding was extremely important for us.
2. Secondly, nanopore sequencing can detect and discriminate different modified nucleotides with ease, because nanopore can detect slight changes in nucleotide structure and assign a different value to that signal.
Going back, the droplets containing the amplified DNA molecules can then be broken and the amplified DNA is purified. The purified DNA from water phase can be directly sequenced using a nanopore sequencer. As the library passes through the nanopore, it retrieves the biomolecule’s sequence and the information about its activity that is encoded in the form of Product to Reference Nucleotide ratio.
Using the same principle, billions of different catalytic biomolecule sequences and their corresponding activities can be recorded.
Proof of concept
The last step of the proof of concept story is the sequencing of amplified DNA using the nanopore. This is an important step, because it can provide the information about the CAT-Seq system precision. In this case, nanopore must accurately distinguish mutant sequences that contain"

Professor Marco Fraaije is an expert in the fields of biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and in particular enzyme engineering. His group published an extremely useful article for our project describing a fast and sensitive method for the detection of cellulase activity. We had a fruitful discussion about the assay described in the paper. One of the subjects that we discussed was the feasibility to detect cellulase activity with the assay while using our intact yeast cells instead of purified proteins. Finally, professor Fraaije provided us with the possibility for assistance, usage of the lab and supplied the materials required for the experiments.

Dr. W.C. Szymanski (27th September 2018)
Szymanski is an assistant professor, at the department of radiology and imaging, at the UMCG (University Medical Center Groningen). His fields of interests are molecular medical imaging and photopharmacology. Wiktor Szymanski was willing to help us optimize the protocol for the phosphorylation of cellulose at the 6th position. Furthermore, he was of great help performing the experiment and provided us with a lab and equipment for the experiment. The phosphorylation of cellulose was performed to increase the solubility of the polymer. The improved solubility resulted in an improved accessibility of the cellulosome complex towards the cellulose polymer. The cellulosome complex chops the cellulose polymer into glucose molecules. These glucose molecules are obtained by the yeast cells, as carbon source, and converted into styrene molecules.

proof of conjugation
For this test E. coli Top10 cells harboring our helper plasmid pUB307 which were not able to grow on ampicillin or chloramphenicol were used to conjugate this plasmid in E. coli Top10 infected with our modified phage which therefore were able to grow on chloramphenicol. The culture of cells infected with the phage did only grow in chloramphenicol but not in ampicillin or kanamycin what proofs that our insert was introduced in the λ phage and did not still exist in its cloning vector pBluescript SK II since this one should also provide the cells with a resistance to ampicillin. The conjugation leads to cells able to grow on kanamycin and chloramphenicol but not on ampicillin. In another conjugation step it could be shown that the λ phage can be transported by conjugation in E. coli Top10 harboring the part BBa_T9002 on pSB1A3 since the resulting bacteria were able to grow on chloramphenicol and ampicillin. Summarizing we could proof that our modified λ phage can be transported by conjugation in presence of the helper plasmid pUB307.

Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.

Program Description
User Guide and API Reference
The program produced by Vanderbilt's 2014 iGEM software team is named darwin, a Unix command-line tool to produce what are known as ""diffs"" between two genomic data files. The command to produce the diff is dwndiff, typically invoked by using:
dwndiff <file1> <file2>
This creates a file with the extension .vcscmp which can be used in typical version control systems.
The current version of the project can be found on the project's github page .

Design of the trap
Based on the input of specifications by experts in the field (entomologists, mosquito control officers, virologists..), and the impact of the economy and sociology of the places where we will apply our project, namely mostly tropical and developing countries, on the scientific process of detection (ecosystem of the mosquitoes, state of the samples containing pathogen antigens, safety,…) we were able to generate a trapping device with the help of ideation, prototyping and 3D modeling software. The device is easy to use, safe and efficient in the detection of mosquito borne pathogen antigens. The trap was subsequently materialized through the 3D printing process. The prototype model tested for egress of sample of mosquitoes (n=200) showed a 2% rate of escape (98% retention rate). However, capture using the Biogent® pheromone bag was not efficient as no mosquitoes were captured after 24h of exposure. This second aspect needs to be improved, by changing attraction systems including CO2 generation.
C1 or C2 fusion protein (Si4-CBPa-BpA)
The fusion protein we designed contains the silica-binding peptide (Si4), the cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa), and the antibody-binding B domain of staphylococcal protein A (BpA). It is a 25 kDa protein (Fig. 1).
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the C2 fusion protein. The C2 fusion protein is composed of the silica-binding peptide (Si4, in red), the cellulose-binding domain of Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa, in green), the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (BpA, in blue).
Once we received the sequence encoding for the protein (named construction C1 or C2, size 921bp, with a C-ter or N-ter His-Tag respectively), we amplified it by PCR by using specific primers (For, Rev, see PCR protocol)"

NEXT STEP
Since our final probiotic will be with a C. striatum strain, we want to see if this bacteria can also be grown in medium which is easily found in grocery stores or something that one interacts with in their daily life. It turns out that C. striatum can actually grow very well on soymilk. Therefore, our next steps are to determine if soymilk needs to be supplemented with other nutrients or if we need to have other steps (such as boiling or filtration) in order to create the media to grow our final C. striatum strain which can then be emulsified with the beeswax and jojoba oil for our final formulation of our probiotic cream.

OUR TEAM
We are a team uniquely composed by students from the Polythecnic University of Valencia with the support of the Spanish National Research Council. In this iGEM edition we dare to work with plants and hope our work will encourage other teams to do so in the future.
PROJECT UPDATE
Avoiding damage in crops caused by pests, using pheromoneproducing plants that disrupt insects mating and therefore avoid laying and damage caused by larvae.
During the last few weeks we had some amazing results. We finally obtained pheromone production satisfactorily and tested the specific expression in glandular trichomes using GFP as a reporter. The rest of the components of our circuits are still under development and should be finished soon. By the way, keep summoning the demons of the failed PCRs please, we’re gonna need some extra help with this.
NEXT STEP
In the next few weeks, we’re doing some extra trials combining our pre-existing elements and performing the firsts tests for the newly constructed elements. We are very happy about the results obtained so far and feel optimistic about testing the new components! You’ll hear about us soon.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"U IGEM team, said that FDA is an institute offering expertise related to regulations and examination processes. He suggested that we may get what we need from FIRDI (Food Industry Research and Development Institute). After doing some researches and preparations, we successfully reached Dr. Chu in FIRDI. 
Highlight
The bellow are some advice he gave us:
You would do well to use E. coli without a plasmid.
Make sure whether E. coli is able to survive in the intestine.
Remain balanced nutrients when growing lactobacillus instead of just adding sugar. 
Conclusion 
After Doctor Chu’s detailed introduction, we found that it seems too late for us to know what FIRDI is. We solved the difficulties we faced in our experiment in the end, but if we had discussed with Doctor Chu earlier, the progress of our experiment might have been faster and more efficient. Thanks to this interview, we realized our insufficient, knowing we still have a lot to improve as well. Here, we appreciate all the instructions Doctor Chu gave us and professor Chen for recommending us visit FIRDI.    
FDA - Record
Records 
We: We want to know the current situation of the obesity problem in Taiwan.
FDA: I suppose the question could be more probably answered by the Health Promotion Administration. The point is that the public shall be more aware of the negative effects of consuming too much sugar. Therefore, we have started to take notice of the amount of refined sugar consist in health supplements six years ago. In order to avoid people who aim to have a healthy life from consuming too much sugar, we have required more than 30 manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar added to their products. 
We: So, what’s the point of regulating calorie from refined to 10% of daily sugar intake?
FDA: The institution is based on the reference from WHO. For we normally eat many other kinds of food every day, we regulate that refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 50 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, if a product contains over 1/3 of the limited amount mentioned, it should be labeled. 
We: What examination do we need to go through if we are to commercialize our product? 
FDA: If it is positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if you are to make it a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients. The list of ingredients that could be added is now available"

Dr. Mark Bieda
Bioinformatics (Assistant Director)
My overall research areas are in bioinformatics and epigenetics. I’m particularly interested in roles of epigenetic modifications in controlling processes in neuroscience and cancer. Here, I use epigenetics in the “modern” sense (some would say incorrect sense) to refer to modifications of DNA and histones to control gene expression. I’d add in transcription factors here, too, with the risk of diluting epigenetic to just mean “transcriptional regulation”.

Input from Industry
Over the summer, the team traveled and spoke with various companies and experts who work with biofuels.  One such person is Scott Fenwick, who is the technical director of the National Biodiesel Board. He expressed concerns about having more microbiology in the fuel, and he gave us many big picture ideas about how he believed that the contamination of tanks would be eliminated within about ten years. In light of this concern, we decided to try to use our microbe to prevent biofilms from forming to keep concentrations both of the organisms in the fuel and of our engineered microbe as low as possible. This proposal did allay some of his fears, but he still emphasized his earlier points about adding more microbiology, and he said he would feel better about adding our microbe if there was some control over the growth of the engineered microbe.
The team also visited Beckett, a Cleveland based company that manufactures combustion burners. We spoke with them about how the push for biofuel is causing a number of problems because the current infrastructure is designed to accommodate traditional fuels, not biofuel. Because of this, many pipes, tanks, or other parts that come into contact with fuel will experience a loss in longevity or function when used with biofuels. Changing this infrastructure is one of the hurdles that would have to be overcome to implement biofuels. One of Beckett's main issues was the contamination of B20 or 20% biodiesel that accelerated the aging of many components they use in their burners. Our team discussed our solution with a Beckett representative, and also asked questions concerning what Beckett or any other company would want to see in a solution to biofuel contamination. Within our project, we spoke about trying to prevent microbial growth early on instead of trying to kill the mix of bacteria and fungi that make up the biofilm.
Finally, the team traveled to a refining plant owned by Marathon, a national petroleum manufacturer, in Cincinnati, Ohio to speak about biofuels. The company in recent years has had an interest starting to manufacture biofuels. The team talked to a chemical engineer on site at Marathon about some of the problems the biofuel industry is facing with contamination. Interestingly, the staff at the plant conveyed that all of the contamination that was happening occurred during the transportation and storage of the fuel. This made us consider when our microbe should be implemented, and, after talking to the refining plant staff, we realized our engineered microbe would not need to be added before the"
Lund,2018,Team:Lund#Design#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," one is a loop connecting the segments, denoted by AB, BC, CD etc., corresponding to each pair of helices. The pocket in which heme is located is formed by a hydrophobic cavity, created by the distal E-helix and proximal F-helix, in  which the conserved proximal histidine F8 coordinates with the upper portion of the heme group.
The VHb monomer is illustrated in fig. 1 along with the sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) which is commonly considered as the reference monomeric hemoglobin. The globin fold is clearly visible and the similarities are apparent, with the heme residing in the pocket enclosed by the E and F alpha helices. However, while the globin fold of Mb consists of eight alpha helices, the VHb has only seven as there is no apparent structure in the expected D-helix region [19]. This gives rise to a more hydrophobic CE transition in contrast to the usual CD, which along with the initial hydrophobic and disordered E7-E10 segment of the E helix is believed to be one of the key reasons for the high lipid binding propensity of VHb [11][19].
Figure 1: Upper: monomeric sperm whale myoglobin illustrating the globin fold. pdb: 1JP6 Lower: VHb momoner, showing the globin fold and the heme pocket. pdb: 3TM3
Role in oxygen delivery
It seems that the way in which VHb enhances oxygen uptake is by acting as an oxygen transporter, directly binding oxygen and delivering it to the respiratory chain. This claim is supported by several studies covering different mechanisms of VHb. More specifically, there are two key observations that motivate this.
First, it has been shown in vitro that VHb has a high binding affinity to lipid monolayers extracted from E. coli and that once bound, the oxygen affinity is reduced by more than 20-fold [11]. This is believed to be caused by the hydrophobic region between the CE-corner and the E-helix at the distal pocket serving as an anchor to the acyl chains of the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Due to the interaction between VHb and the membrane, a conformational change would occur around the heme pocket and the oxygen binding affinity would immediately be reduced.
Secondly, it has been shown by immunogold labeling in electron microscopy that VHb is localized in the cytoplasm and to a large extent near the cell membrane in both Vitreoscilla and E. coli ["

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#freedthefrogs_-_-_TEXT.html," Some species have more interests than others, for example they need forms of society, communication etc. As the principle is too privilege the maximum of interests, might seem to be better treated than simpler. This theory implies to rethink our relation to food production, drug and cosmetic test on animals for developing a less excessive system respecting as much as we can the interests of the beings we are living with. As this theory is utilitarian, what we can and cannot do can be, to some extent, negotiated. We have to “calculate” the interests involved in our actions and established if there is a gain or not.
These two approaches of animal ethics, despite their differences, have in common to emphasize on the political aspect of the animal question. Taking seriously animals as beings that deserve a moral care implies changing many of our habits of consumption. These required changes are quite close in their quality to those recommended by many ecological theories: being less excessive and more attentive to the world in which we are living. All this get quite interesting if we rapidly sum-up the ambition of animal ethics and ecology: making life better, one being at a time. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Animal biotechnology and human/non human relationships
Melvin Kranzberg, professor of history of technology and founder of the Society for the History of Technology, reached posterity through the formulation of six laws concerning technology which he called “The Kranzberg’s laws” . We will use the first law as a starting point on the relation of animal biotechnology and ethics. The first law states: “technology is neither good nor bad; nor it is neutral” . This statement is crucial to be well understood by engineers and bioengineers, one can’t state that technology is neutral. Once we are bringing new artifacts or entities into the world we can’t declare that we don’t have any responsibility of what will be done thanks to them or because of them. Technology is generally presented as a solution to a problem and most of biotechnologies could be said to be produced in the same state of mind, making the world better. This will be, at least, the way they will be presented to the public. This aim of technology has many impacts on our ways of being. It changes our relation to time, space and society (through clocks, trains and social-networks), it gives us the possibility to be related to any part of the world and organizing international contests with real-time communication through internet.
It also profoundly modifies our relationships with nature. Nature, which was once declared as an enemy, a dangerous force threatening the human race, is now more and more perceived as"

In this section we would like to express our achievements and justify with more detail our judgment form.
We succeeded in transforming yeast with the prionic switch. The resulting transformants, as expected, grew on selective (SD+Ade+His+Ura) medium. The behaviour of the circuit, as deduced by the presence of white and blue colonies, was obtained. This indicates that both phenotypes (theoretically resulting in an albedo change that would regulate the whole Mars temperature) can be obtained through this system.
We successfully transformed E. coli with the PM2 gene (which encodes for a LEA protein) and triggered its  expression with IPTG. After comparing  survival of LEA transformed E. coli and control E. coli by means of non-parametrical statistical analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) we demonstrated  a surprisingly  high  protective effect of this  protein against harsh temperatures(p_value < 0.0001 for the four different treatments).   Two observations could be made: LEA protein generally has a more protective effect than glycerol. Also, when both factors are present,  they have an unexpected synergic effect. We can extrapolate these results to yeast.
We got to send to the registry the first biobrick composed by the coding sequence of a protein with a potential prion behaviour. The capability of using a constitutive transcription activator whose function is dependent of this particular mechanism can be very useful in many different conditions. The system allows the simultaneous presence of two phenotypes, conferring an intrinsic diversity in the population that can lead to an evolutionary advantage or to a very interesting dynamics.
We also sent another interesting biobrick (the PM2 gene), that can confer a well-documented ability to resist and improve the grow rate under different stressful conditions in bacteria and probably other organisms"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Biotinylation Tag brick
Description: The sequence codifies for the biotin ligase recognition peptide (BLRP) ( 5’ GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE 3’) which can be biotinylated in the presence of the biotin ligase BirA enzyme native from Escherichia coli. This Biotinylation process allows a strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin that can be used for protein purification purposes, specifically as an extraction method for the Carboxysome. The sequence is preceded by a methionine start codon along with a second codon consistent with efficient translation in E. coli and a terminator of transcription.
This part is an adaptation from the INTACT method (“The INTACT method for cell type–specific gene expression and chromatin profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana”. Roger B Deal1 & Steven Henikoff)

Results: The data shows that the transcription buffers generate the biggest yield and the highest ATP consumption. The Tris HCl buffer and the BSA buffer also show an increase of Malachite Green Aptamer and a decrease of the fluorescence of the ATP Spinach2. But both signals are less steep than the changes of signal in the transcription buffers. The HEPES buffer shows no signal. Hence, we expect no transcribed RNA.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project#Lemon Scent_-_-_TEXT.html," to characterize the limonene synthase biobrick constructed by the Edinburgh team (BBa_K762100) and verify whether it is functional by replacing the intial (S)-limonene synthase by the biobrick.
We managed to construct two plasmids, the plamsid containing the β-pinene synthase gene and the plasmid containing the geraniol synthase gene. Due to lack of time, we could not obtain the other plasmids.
Introduction
The lemon scent is due to many volatile compounds, but the three main components are the (S)-limonene, β-pinene and citral molecules. All these molecules belong to the terpene family of metabolites.[1][6]
Limonene
There are two isomeric forms of the limonene molecules: Odor of these two isomers are  different: the (R)-Limonene has a orangey smell whereas the (S)-Limonene has a strongly lemon scent. [2]
Pinene
There are also two isomeric forms of pinene: α- and β-pinene. In the lemon oil, β-pinene represents between 10-17% of the total compounds [3]. In contrast, there is no trace of α-pinene.
Citral
This is the principal component of the lemon grass and lemon smell and it is present in many other plants such as orange, verbena... Here again there are two stereoisomeric forms, geranial and neral. The trans isomer, geranial or citral A, has a strong lemon scent. Whereas, the cis isomer named neral or citral B has sweaker lemon scent. These compounds are often used in the perfume industry to reproduce the smell of lemon.
All these compounds come from a common precursor, the geranylpyrophosphate (GPP). This precursor is converted in one or two steps in the molecules we are interested in obtaining.
The desoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) parthway is the common pathway used by prokaryote cells to produce GPP. E. coli synthesizes GPP using the DXP pathway but in low quantity [4]. However, another pathway called the mevalonate pathway (MEV) exists in eukaryote and some prokaryotes. Moreover, plants can use both pathways to produce GPP in higher quantity. To copy the plants' strategy, we chose to add the MEV pathway to our engineered E. coli in order to produce higher quantity of GPP"

ENGINEERING SCIENCE QUEST (ESQ)
Community Brick Available for Protocol and Slide Deck
Outreach took a part in the Engineering Science Quest at University of Waterloo by holding a lab activity for high school students (ages 14-17). The idea was to show students that it is easy to do Science at home.
Gel Electrophoresis was performed using all supplies available at home (except for agarose- but one can use Jello too). We performed this activity with 3 different groups of ~10 students each time over the span of 2 months. We paired students together and gave them a chance to work in a team and learn some basic lab techniques such as pipetting, understanding the idea of having a medium for the electrons to flow in and much more.
Students were also given a formal presentation at the end of the activity where the theory of Gel Electrophoresis was explained and were at the end asked a few questions for small prizes.
Students were able to separate food dye (based on their  charge) successfully; as 4 out of 5 groups, on average, did see a proper separation of colours.
HOT CHOCOLATE EVENT
The purpose of this event was to bring the UW campus community together and educate them about the field of synthetic biology through iGEM.
The idea was to serve hot chocolate to individuals wishing to buy it for 50 cents a cup. While they are getting their drink served to them, iGEM members will be there engaging in conversations with the various students and faculty, discussing with them the history of synthetic biology and how it has evolved over the years.
Hosting such an event especially a one that involves serving food to the local public, requires a lot of permission seeking for various personnels.
The following protocol must be followed at UW in order to serve food publically anywhere on campus:
When serving food publically, one must first contact Feds and let them be aware of your ideas to host such event well in advance (estimated 4 weeks prior"

General safety in the lab is very important, but it is also important to make a design that is inherently safe. The term for this is safe by design. With help of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) we formed an opinion about safe by design and how it could be implemented in our project. More information about safe by design and our collaboration with the RIVM can be found here .
The concept of safe by design is to make sure the health and safety risks of the product are addressed from the beginning of the design process. This way, risks can be prevented instead of considered afterwards. Especially in synthetic biology, safe by design is very important. As multiple changes are made, organisms are further deviated from what nature has created. So, we think safe by design should be used in every design or research regarding synthetic biology. To get a better understanding of the term safe by design and how it fits in the current legislation, we did a stakeholder analysis which can be found here .
Our project is also connected to safe by design. We are not developing a bacterial system in which various safety mechanisms can be included, but a whole protein. For proteins, safe by design can be applied in a limited way. We made sure our protein was not toxic, or harmful for the environment. However our scaffold proteins can be used as a tool to implement safe by design in other, bigger researches. See for example our future application scenario T cell therapy in which one of our scaffold proteins can function as a kill switch, thus providing safe"

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," dilution event creates minor artifacts on the simulations that manifest as discontinuities on the graphs.
Figure 12 left: The growth curve (blue) of a bacterial colony on a tiny agar disk (3.4mm across) without the lag phase. The simulation follows the quantized version of the growth curve (red).
Figure 12 right: Quantized growth curve for a small agar disk 34mm across. Notice the much higher final population. It simulates growth on agar with few added nutrients as described in [ 2 ]. Mean relative quantization error: 4.9%
Results
The basic question that we want to answer at this point is if and when will the bacterial colony exhibit QS behavior on an agar plate - faster or later than in a liquid culture with the same number of bacteria? We present 2 simulations that differ in scale. The first is a tiny agar plate measuring 3.4mm across and .551mm in depth, for a volume of 5μL ( figure 13 ). The second is much larger in scope and computational effort: agar in a small petri dish 34mm in diameter and 5.51mm in depth. The larger scope allows direct experimental evaluation of the model, but to make it more computationally friendly the growth happens in a more spread-out fashion than normal and the colony appears to “walk” across the agar.
Progression of [AHL] dynamics on the tiny agar plate of simulation 1. Left: spatial distribution of [AHL] on the agar cylinder as it evolves in time. Same geometry as on [figure 13a][here] (cylinder axis on the left, rim on the right, surface on top). During the first 6sec (video time), the dynamics are dominated by the colony’s outwards growth. This expansion phase prevents AHL from reaching critical concentrations and delays QS. After the colony growth slows down, the spatial maximum in [AHL] stops moving and the QS transition quickly follows. Right top: total amount of AHL in the agar plate. Right bottom: maximum [AHL] from the left graph at each time step.
The tiny disk is inoculated with 7e4 bacteria, which gradually grow to a final size of 8.12e6 bacteria over 11 growth steps ( video ). Quorum sensing is indeed triggered early under these conditions, at 11 hours ( figure 14 ).
The small agar plate (which, despite its name, is the large simulation!) is inoculated with 8.2e4 bacteria that grow over the course of 15 hours to become "
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Engagement-Hande_-_-_TEXT.html," spora, which were separated from soil near the root of wild yew tree, around the roots of young yew seeding, and that shows a improvement to yew growth.
B A: There are two kinds of harvest pattern. One is whole tree exploit and the other one is like picking tea. It’s a kind of recycle. For a kind of small yew in Sichuan, people exploit their whole trees, but harvest pieces of field a year and harvest other pieces next year. The whole tree exploiting occurred mainly on chinensis var.mairei, whose taxol mainly distributed in roots.
Q: We learned that you have two methods to produce taxol. One is half-synthesis and the other is extracting from the natural materials. And we have learned how are the two methods going. So what do you think is the advantage of the two ways respectively? Which one is better to the company?
A A: It depends on the costumers who will pay attention to the curation. The drugs will take activity examination. And costumers would choose products based on the examination. Company prefers to use half-synthesis for it is easier than extracting.
C A: If you test both taxol from natural and synthesis, there would be a little difference. The activity of the natural taxol will be little higher. So half-synthesis product is cheaper. When we synthesis taxol, we get some byproduct which can be machined chemically to agents with similar curation. And the impurity of natural taxol and synthesized taxol is different, in both variety and quantity.
The half-synthesis takes 9 days for a batch, and produce 4-5 kilos taxol, but natural way needs 50 or so days and 2 kilos a batch. And both methods will generate many by product which can also make profits. We prefer to chemically synthesize. But people usually prefer nature medicine. So natural way takes larger ratio. And we also need to improve quality of our synthesized taxol
Q: Have you thought about some improvement about these techniques? What about PCF (Plant Cell Fermentation™)
A: We haven’t thought about this question. This tech is not mature now and the cost of fermentation is very high. The impurities of this tech is too much to discard and there is no clear standard about it. There are some new method to produce taxol but we will do experiments only after sufficient assessment about them. Maybe when someday it becomes clearer, we ‘ll think about it.

Transformation of B. subtilis
As B. subtilis and E. coli are model organisms, they have established genetics. The advantage of B. subtilis is that it is naturally competent, so it is very easy to conduct genetic manipulations. It can replicate plasmids as E. coli does, but there is a much more elegant way of bringing in exogenous DNA fragments. When flanked by regions homologous to the B. subtilis genome, it will be integrated at high efficiency via homologous recombination at this locus and subsequently be replicated with the chromosome (Fig. 2). This leads to stable, single-copy genomic alterations, thereby avoiding, copy-number artifacts occurring with replicative plasmids. This different way of genetic manipulations requires the use of integrative vectors as provided by our BacillusBioBrickBox . For this reason, B. subtilis is an ideal genetic platform for Synthetic Biology. But so far, very few iGEM teams have worked with this model organism due to the lack of suitable BioBrick-compatible genetic tools.

New for this year is the WIKI and graphical design collaboration with Aalto Helsinki, where a common SLACK channel has been set up for close communication between the members responsible for the WIKI and graphical design in respective team.
Nordic iGEM Collaboration
iGEM Uppsala 2018, also participates in a common SLACK workspace for the project manager of each Nordic team,                 'something that has been proven to be very useful in the sense of advice and support from people in the same position. Besides an easy way for direct communication, this year iGEM Uppsala has participated both in the Biobrick Tutorial Weekend arranged by the Technical University of Denmark and the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund. Both events have been very useful and fun, socially and practically. In summary, both events proved to be wonderful opportunities to connect with other nordic teams.
Another collaboration that we are planning on with other iGEM contacts is a webinar later this summer.                 This would give us the chance to train in presenting our projects as well as share our experiences from working on iGEM.                 The general public would have access to the webinar as well.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," difficile from a pathogenic (toxic) strain into a non-toxigenic strain. Rather than killing the C. difficile population in the gut completely, the creation of competition between non-toxic and toxic >em>C. difficile can stop the infection as well as preserve natural gut microbiota to prevent other opportunistic bacteria from populating the gut. CRISPRi has been shown to effectively decrease the production of proteins in cells and can be easily engineered to target different DNA regions making it a good candidate to target the promoter region of TcdA (PtcdA) and the promoter region of TcdB (PtcdB) with the aim of reducing toxin production. Moreover, multiple sgRNAs can be expressed and directed to each promoter thereby improving the tightness of the system.
Initial planning/preparation
C. difficile infection (CDI) symptoms range from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudo-membranous colitis and toxic megacolon. They are essentially caused by the production of two toxins: TcdA and TcdB. The two toxin genes are part of the PaLoc gene cluster encoding three accessory proteins: TcdR, TcdC and TcdE. TcdR is a sigma factor essential for the initiating the translation of tcdA and tcdB. Besides controlling toxin expression, TcdR is also involved in the regulation of many other genes in C. difficile. Repressing the expression of TcdR might have an effect on the general cell fitness, therefore it was decided to target the promoter regions upstream of tcdA and tcdB instead thus minimizing the effect on other cell processes. Moreover, it has been shown that Cas9 binding to the promoter to inhibit the initiation of translation results in stronger repression of expression when compared to prematurely ending translation by targeting Cas9 to the gene sequence. Therefore, in this project, the sgRNAs are designed so that they direct Cas9 to the promoter region to inhibit the initiation of translation.
Potential dCas9 targets within the PtcdA and PtcB promoter sequence were selected using the Benchling platform and converted into sgRNA sequences. For PtcdA, six sgRNAs were designed and, for PtcdB, five sgRNAs were selected. In order to treat CDI, both toxins should be repressed simultaneously because each toxin individually can cause CDI symptoms. Therefore it was decided to first test the sgRNAs for toxin A and toxin B separately in E. coli after which the best repressing sgRNAs for each toxin would be taken forward and combined in C. difficile.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," auxotrophy, as in this case, a compound will induce the death of the modified bacteria, while it will not affect natural organisms. Among the death-inducer, we can find IPTG, heat, sucrose or arabinose [3]. There is research [6] suggesting that time could be also used as an inducer. This way, the expression of a lethal protein would happen after a determined number of cell cycles.
Although this biocontainment method avoids the problem of environmental supplementation, it does not escape from mutagenic drift and horizontal gene transfer. A genetic modification inactivating the toxic protein would not have any impact on the fitness of the cell and it would greatly be selected by evolution once the toxic protein is active in other cells. Due to leakiness of regulated promoters, an inactivating mutation in the toxic gene might grant a growth advantage even in the absence of the lethality inducer.
Orthogonal life: Synthetic Auxotrophy
The orthogonal life will be a result of the manipulation of the genetic code (the rules by which DNA is read), that will give place to an artificial language that the synthetic organisms will not be able to share with natural organisms. These modifications can be made both at the DNA level or at the protein level.
At the DNA level, artificial bases can be used, as well as artificial backbones with threose or glucose instead of deoxyribose.
At the protein level, synthetic tRNAs can be engineered to recognize unused codons such as TAG (non-sense codon) or to recognize quadruplet codons instead of triplets.
Although these alternatives are quite recent, there are already successful examples of using orthogonal life as a biocontainment technique. Mandell et al. [4] developed a mechanism called ""Synthetic Auxotrophy"" which consists of re-coding the bacterial genetic code so that the codon TAG can be assigned to an artificial amino acid, biphenylalanine (bipA). For this, a bipA-tRNA synthetase had to be engineered and introduced into the bacteria, so that bipA could be used by the cellular machinery.
Furthermore, essential proteins were engineered so they would require bipA in their amino acid sequence to be functional. The proteins were chosen so that their deficiency could not be supplemented by compounds in the environment.
The synthetic auxotrophy has several advantages over the engineered auxotrophy and the induced lethality:
Resistance to the mutagenic drift: Engineering proteins to require bipA for functionality means that several residues will have to mutate to render a functional protein that does not need bipA"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Population_-_-_TEXT.html," have to consider the replication         and death mechanism for P because the rates are balanced for S and N.
Because we could not conﬁrm the reaction constants for lox66 and lox71, we decided to proceed with the model using         the simpliﬁed reaction kinetics for lox.
Diagram illustrates a plasmid (S) undergoing recombination process (the knockout of origin of replication), resulting in proportion of plasmid (P) that consists of GOI but does not undergo plasmid replication and another proportion of plasmid (N) that only has origin of replication and undergoes plasmid replication.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In this model, we consider P separately from N as a diﬀerent entity. That is, P is a GOI plasmid and an ORI plasmid,         while N is an ORI plasmid that does not have a corresponding GOI copy. We make this simpliﬁcation so that we may         use the ﬁtted model from the Cre module.
2.2 Constant Cre Recombination Rate Approximation
In this model, we assume that Cre is constitutively produced, and that the forward and reverse reaction constants remain         constant. In reality, the concentration may have changes, such as during replication, but because the amount of time         spent under such conditions should be short, we decide to simplify the model by not considering them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the model as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
The ﬁrst two reactions come from considering the death and replication of P respectively, while the second two come         from the ﬁtted result of the Cre model.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
Fig. 1 Simulation of knockout efficiency with cell death and replication
As we can see from the graph, the concentration of both S and P gradually approach 0 over time.
This is because the replication of P only produces N while cell death would reduce P. As P decreases, the reaction         equilibrium between S and P is pushed in the forward direction in accordance with Le Chatlier’s principle, and so         S will also decrease. Meanwhile, N’s proportion is being increased do to the replication of P and eventually all         of the plasmids are in the form of N.
This model suggests that if our construct"

Some cakes and beverages later,  Dipl.-Ing. Michael Kuhn started to give a short introduction about the center. Professor Susanne Bickel then explained the VBIO association, with their goals and tasks and made some advertisement for it, showing the advantages for students.
After the students came back from a tour that led through the center, it was our turn to present. We explained the iGEM competition in detail, presented efforts and project ideas of other teams, showed what our current work in the laboratory looks like and presented goals we have in mind for our project. Afterwards, we were drilled with questions. The students showed a lot of interest in the iGEM competition and were curious about possible teams to join. Even a few teachers chimed in.
In the end we had an interesting discussions with some teachers and students regarding our project ideas and our progress. We left feeling happy about the motivation and inspiration we were able to give.
Visit of Fabian Nienhaus - Karl-von-Frisch Laureate
At the Karl-von-Frisch award ceremony we got to know a high school graduate who was awarded for his excellent achievement in biology. He wrote an outstanding term paper, in which he co-cultivated Bacillus subtilis and the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. One of the hypotheses he offered for the behavior he observed is that the co-cultivation forced one population to produce an antibiotic substance as a defense mechanism.
At the Karl-von-Frisch award ceremony he expressed interest in the iGEM competition and our project. Because he still had numerous questions regarding our co-culturing project after the event, we invited him to visit our university and our lab. That is why Fabian traveled the long way from the Münsterland to Düsseldorf to get more insight into our project.
In order to give him a tour of our working places and laboratories, we gave him a complete safety instruction, as required by the lab we work in. Armed with a lab coat and safety goggles we explained to him, among others things, general techniques used in laboratory work with nucleic acids and microorganisms and showed him our beautiful cyanobacteria.
Since our project and his term paper cover closely related topics we had a great discussion about similarities like the use of co-cultivation, but also differences, for example symbiotic vs. combating combinations for co-cultivating. The time flew by fast and soon Fabian had to start his way home"

We could see from the below picture (Figure 1) that the quantity of the expression protein was increasing with the time increasing. Concerning the obvious death of bacteria beyond 16h culturing, we recommend NEFU-China to induce the protein around 16h.

In order to compare with the control apparently, we contrasted the 16h induced protein and not induced protein. The result we got was illustrated as below (Figure 2) . We put these results together and send to NEFU-China, hoping what we did would helped them.

we also asked NEFU-China to help us detect the function of a plasmid which could express GFP. That really saved us amount of time. The final effect was pretty good, we had build a closely cooperation relationship! Both of each sides were looking forward another collaboration!
Abstract:
To exchange ideas with others, to cooperate with each other, you can broaden their thinking, improve the efficiency of the experiment. We hope to have more opportunities to contact the team around the world, we suggest that the headquarters could establish a more convenient platform for the communication among iGEMers, not confined to their own country. Because of the limited time, we have not been able to try more cooperation, but we cherish the friendship with the above team. We all learned from the collaboration that: help each other and make progress together!

We kept this reaction mix at 50C for 60 seconds to let the ExoIII digest our DNA, then heat inactivated it by keeping it at 75C for 20 minutes. When cooled down to 60C at a very slow ramp rate the now-single-stranded parts anneal to one another, allowing the Phusion polymerase and Taq ligase to fill in and closed the gaps. Because the yields are too low to clone directly from this reaction we PCRed full constructs using BB prefix and suffix primers and high fidelity polymerase which could then be cloned into a biobrick-compatible plasmid.
To ensure that we actually had our construct of interest we ran a diagnostic PCR to see what parts had actually ligated together in our reaction. Because we already obtained forward and reverse PCR oligos for each part, it was relatively easy to visualize the stepwise progression of the assembly by making PCR reactions with a Biobrick forward primer and each part reverse primer. A typical (successful) diagnostic PCR looks like this:
Then all you need to do is make a larger PCR reaction using the Biobrick forward and reverse primers and you're set!

- tRNA synthetase specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli → Y-RS This is the wild type tyrosyl synthetase derived from Methanococcus janaschii to be used as an orthogonal tRNA synthetase in E. coli. It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate tyrosine in response to an amber stop codon. Incorporation of ncAA with amber codon supression: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon contains was mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. While working with amber codon supression, the Methanococcus wild type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is present even in minimal media. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of (n)cAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. Recognition between tRNA and (n)cAA-synthetases derived from Mj: The Methanococcus janaschii wild type tyrosyl tRNA consists of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA.

""I think there needs to be more work in establishing a framework before making decisions or judgments, this applies to religious and civil organisations as much as scientific ones.

Although I admit I don't know much of the area, the concept of ""artificial life"" that is being worked on could hardly in my view be called an all encompassing definition of life.  People have to be careful of the language they use, I think this has caused problems for this kind of work in the past.

“The ethics depend on what you’re working with, if bacteria then what species? And of course the purpose is key.  There also has to be a greater dissemination of knowledge, working with H.I.V. proteins, like I do, is actually largely harmless, but just the mention of it makes people outside this work uncomfortable.  Any regulation of the field would have to try to maintain an even playing field, as everyone needs funding and such economic incentives can lead to neglecting controls in the name of competition.  Everyone has their own ethics and a right to say and select what they want.  Often, I think those with a vested interest may marginalize dissent.  However I also think that people have to be more open to accepting authoritative sources for information on a particular area of research.”
Steve, 24, Molecular Biologist
""The frontiers of genetic engineering research present a goldmine for moralists looking for the next cause to obsess over and debate endlessly. As new possibilities become available to shape and manipulate nature, people worry about scientists recklessly playing god and interfering with the ""natural order"". This and other fearmongering is oft short-sighted; similar behaviour has been occurring for thousands of years, with humans modifying their environments endlessly to their will with whatever technology is available at the time. The genetic research going on today has the potential to benefit all species on the planet, and even if this potential is not fully or quickly realised, the science"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," lipolytica [2] and inverted it. Glutamine requirement for Synechocystis proved harder to find a source for, so we did some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the approximate percentage of cell dry weight that is proteins, and the percentage of amino acid residues in proteins that is glutamine. Naturally, this provides only a rough estimate.
As we got our Synechocystis strain from Josefine Anfelt in Paul Hudson’s group at KTH, information on its acetate export rate was readily available in one of their articles [3]. The closest thing we could find on arginine export rates in Y. lipolytica was the same information for C. glutamicum [4]. Obviously, this is not optimal.
Finally, substrate affinity also proved difficult to find information on. Since no measurements seem to be available for either of the organisms and their limiting substrates, we decided to use the Michaelis-Menten constants for uptake of the relevant substrates as approximations. For substrate affinity to be equal to a Michaelis-Menten constant, we have to assume a very rapid equilibrium. This is most likely not quite true, but it will suffice for this approximation. We could only find the desired constant for Synechocystis [5], so we used that value for Y. lipolytica as well. Naturally, this might not be a good approximation, but as we need measurements of our own to get the model to be predictive anyway, this just serves as a first step to see the model in action.
Collaboration
At this stage we collaborated with the Manchester iGEM team in order to get help with parameter estimations. They helped us with feedback, as well as with a way to make more accurate estimations based on values from other organisms using a weighting system. Unfortunately, we ended up not having time to incorporate this last part in the project, but we’d like to direct a big “thank you” their way for all their help!
Model Results
With this basic model we can study the ratio between Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica that stabilises over time, as can be seen in figure 1. In our case, the final ratio between the organisms is 350:1, even though they started at 1:1. Since we have not had a chance to measure the necessary parameters ourselves, this value should not be trusted. However, it does show how a reaching a stable, albeit different ratio could look.

6.Measuring the expression of miR-134 in transformed RKO cell line
To confirm our findings, we measured the expression of miR-134 in transformed cells (with the transfer vector carrying mi!-134 as well as the empty vector backbone). After total RNA extraction, reverse transcription and RealTime PCR, we found that our miRNA showed significant overexpression in the transformed cell lines indicating the success of our experiment.
Conclusions of Metagenomics Analysis
This extensive meta-analysis provided us with extremely important data about colorectal cancer regarding changes of microbiota environment of the colon and its excretory products. For instance, we have identified the abundance of  Some bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, E. coli, and Fusobacterium, which can be used as potential biomarkers for normal, adenoma, and cancer groups, respectively.
Regarding E.coli, we have found key signatures that denotes lower levels of E. coli in cancer patients (6.76%) than in health controls (18.80%) and adenoma patients (22.33%), which made E.coli a potential candidate for adenoma-associated biomarker which could be explained by altered host immunogenicity to bacterial products, mutagenesis or gene transfer in which all these pathogenic acts could lead to a typical driver-passenger model for CRC by colonizing-related adenomas that could favor carcinomatous transformation and by altering the microenvironment of the tumor then fade away by passenger bacteria which explains lower levels of E.coli in carcinoma samples versus adenomas.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"To achieve a productivity level that is as high as possible increased levels of CO2 is also needed. The co-culture system itself could provide this since the production organism is using the carbon excreted by the cyanobacteria, closer calculations are however needed to evaluate the balance in this reaction. Another possible solution is to couple a production facility such as this to a fossil carbon burning power plant and capturing the released CO2 and feeding it into your bioreactors. Furthermore, the transparency of the culture is important to maintain lighting conditions for the cyanobacteria; this severely limits the biomass concentration achievable in the culture. A possible solution to this problem is separation of the two organisms by a permeable membrane or even into separate reactors with a shared volume of media circulating both cultures.
It is clear that a viable chemical production industry based on biosynthesis still has many hurdles to pass. However, with the rapid progress the field of synthetic biology is making we are confident these problems can be solved; and as discussed previously in this section the need for them to be solved is great, and growing quickly.
Viewing possible futures to find our own
The science of synthetic biology can arguably be described as one of the most powerful technologies that humankind has ever conceived. Granted, this technology is still in its infancy, but as many other branches of science it carries the burden of incredible destructive capacity. But in contrast to many other scientific fields, the tremendous potential for productive and life-saving uses are even more evident in the field of synthetic biology. With both of these potentials follows several ethical and philosophical questions on how to advance the frontier of this technology.
Its destructive capacity is, in our opinion, undeniable, but equally so is its potential for good. Both of these are of course dependent on how the technology is applied and used and just as with most of our modern technology, it can be abused. The question is, can we allow tremendous good to be held back by an imaginary situation where the technology is misused? How do we balance its creative power with its destructive ability?
Like many questions it comes down to people. Do we trust the character of ourselves as people to handle this powerful tool? One could also look to history: Have we done so in the past with other scientific discoveries? One could argue that our track record is questionable to say the least.
But what about the future? Of course learning from the future is hard since we do not know it, but imagining it can help us find out where we want to go.
To try to encourage reflection and debate around these questions, our team has applied speculative design into our integrated human practices. In contrast to"

General approach
After demonstrating the feasibility of our synthetic consortium, we needed to understand further its operation, and in particular to characterize some emerging properties that drive its functioning to ultimately improve its efficiency. We have implemented and performed global sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the system under real life conditions (such as fluctuations of some parameters that can arise from several steps, as detailed below). Then, to optimize its behavior and guide its design, we carried out more detailed analyses by extending the Metabolic control analysis framework classically used in the fields of metabolic engeneering and systems biology.
Global sensitivity analysis
All parameter values cannot be measured experimentally 1 , and our experience in this project, with a model composed by nearly fifty parameters, confirms this fact. As an additional concern, many sources of variability may perturb parameters and ultimately impact the efficiency of the system. Variability could emerge from the system itself (living systems exert some variability by nature) or during each step of the process (manufacturing, transport, storage, etc). Facing this problem, a global sensitivity analysis approach was applied to evaluate the impact of random parameters fluctuations on the response time to reach non-pathogenic concentrations. 1
To perform this analysis, we generated 10,000 sets of parameters randomly sampled within ± 10% of their reference values, using a uniform distribution, and the response time of the system was calculated for each of these sets (Matlab code available below). Simulation results were analyzed with RStudio (R code available below).

TARGET ORGANISM: Yarrowia lipolytica
Shortly after the choosing the project, searching for a potential host began. Initially, we held a meeting with Tom Sousa, a 1st year graduate student in the Bioinformatics Department at UCSC, and an expert on yeast. Tom recommended that we look into using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aka brewer’s yeast. S. cerevisiae is special because it is extremely well studied and is ideal for biological research because of its short doubling time, ability to be transformed, and can be grown as a haploid.
In order to ensure that we were picking the best possible strain of yeast, a few team members continued research on different strains of yeast. Soon after, we discovered Yarrowia lipolytica, another “Generally Regarded as Safe” (GRAS) organism [1,2] . Although less studied than S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica has several benefits that led us to believe that it would be a better choice for our project:
Y. lipolytica outperformed all alternative hosts in heterologous protein expression and high transformation frequency during homologous recombination of linearized plasmids [3] .
Y. lipolytica can survive on unconventional carbon sources like milk, glycerol, and oil [4,5] .
Y. lipolytica exhibits low side-product formation and high substrate specificity, which is ideal for producing a single product like progesterone [6] .
Yeast that use the DNA repair mechanism homologous recombination (HR) are commonly chosen for engineering purposes because HR is efficient for inserting genes. Y. lipolytica has a propensity for a less favorable DNA repair mechanism, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). To circumvent this problem, we searched for a strain that had the NHEJ mechanism, which is is usable when the KU70 gene is knocked out.
Our project required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we"

After our Gibson assembly of the 11 chromoprotein+CBDs+his-tags and DT+his-tag we transformed these into chemically competent E. Coli. We then plated these onto LB+chloro plates and placed them into the 37 °C incubator overnight
Tuesday, 10/4
●
There was cell growth on all our plates except for SO, and SP. We will re do these Gibson and transformations when we also do DT. Although the colonies did not have colors yet we have seen it takes a couple days for them to gain colors so we are not concerned at this point.
●
Because of the cell growth we colony PCRed from the 10 plates that worked using VF2 and VR and also started 5 ml liquid cultures from these colonies.
●
We plan to run 2 ul of the colony PCR on a gel to confirm the sequence is the correct number of base pairs and then order sequencing tomorrow.
●
The 5 ml liquid cultures we started we will mini prep tomorrow morning and use as biobricks if our sequencing is clean.
Wednesday, 10/5
●
We ran 2 ul of the colony PCR on a gel and saw bands in the correct spot (~1500 base pairs for chromoprotein-CBD-his-tag proteins and ~1000 base pairs for DT+his-tag)

Here is the gel we ran of our chromoproteins with CBDs and DT with just a his-tag. The order from left to right: ladder, PP, VP, CP, VV, BB, LO, TP, MP, DM, DT. The chromoproteins with the CBDs show up around 1500 base pairs which is what we would expect. VV and LO do not appear to have the bands at all so we do not think enough DNA was loaded into the gel. DT (in the last well) shows a band around 1000 base pairs which is what we would expect for a chromoprotein+his-tag. This gel helps to confirm our constructs and we will send in for sequencing.
●
We ordered sequencing and performed a PCR clean up and then sent in both forward and reverse sequencing

We  thought of making E. coli act as a bank by taking things in and out. We had two scenarios for this  theme:
• Exchanging  things between Bank E. coli and Consumer E. coli
• Making deposits and withdraws by a group of Bank E. coli
Other than these stories,  recreating the bursting of the bubble economy with E. coli was also in the  plan.

• Fertilizer
 
 
 
Micronutrient fertilizer is very important to the growth of crops. However, more than 70% of the fertilizer goes unused in soil. Phosphorus included in the fertilizer becomes insoluble by binding with metals, such as aluminum and calcium. Since plants cannot absorb these immobilized phosphorus, the phosphorus accumulates in the soil. To solve this problem, we decided to use E. coli to degrade the immobilized phosphorus into phosphoric acid, which plants can absorb. After producing phosphoric acid, E. coli stores it in its body in a polymeric form. By collecting these E. coli and extracting the polymer, we can retrieve the phosphorus left in the soil.

2-2 Results
After introducing what iGEM is and our projects to the visitors, they gave us many suggestions and opinions. We prepared blue and yellow blank Post-it notes, and asked them to write down their opinions. Expressions of agreement or support were written on the yellow Post-it notes, while critical points or suggestions were written on the blue Post-it notes. We reflected the feedback and comments from the visitors to make our projects better (The comments that visitors gave for each project are listed in Table 1). We thank all the visitors for cooperating us in this poster session.
Many visitors, especially those lacking a scientific background, reacted negatively to E. coli at first. However, by introducing the properties of E. coli, we were able to change their mind. On the Post-it notes, there were many opinions saying that they were looking forward to new inventions using E. coli. We can say that our goal, which was to inform people know and change their negative thinking about synthetic biology, has been achieved.

The Hill equation is used for the kinetic equation of the production process and mass action kinetics for the degradation. Once all the promoter-gene pairs forming the circuit have been added, a model in SBML format can be generated by pressing the “Create Model” button.
Features
1. As a web tool, no download is required.
2.      Easier to use than complex software tools.
3. The users can directly type in the MIT registry parts IDs used in their circuit design to build a model. This is especially useful for the iGEM teams.
4. Generating models in SBML format which is supported by over one hundred software tools for model analysis.
5. The users have options to generate models with different levels of complexity for the same circuit. (to be completed)
6. Supported by a background database which includes literature based kinetic information (such as kinetic equations and parameter values) for the regulatory parts,  thus allowing users to build models based on previously published data. (to be completed)
Software Interface
Further improvements
1. Currently only supports genes being regulated by one transcription factor through binding in the promoter region.  Support for combinatory regulation will be added later.
2. The users still need other software tools for modeling analysis. We are developing a sister website called SBML toolsets which will include functions of a SBML model editor, visualization, time course simulation, steady state analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, etc. Through these two site, the users will be able to do all the model related analysis on line.
3. Support for metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathway models will also be added.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," diagnose Q fever early and accurately can lead to the manifestation of chronic Q fever (see Figure 4).
Figure  4: After contact with Coxiella burnetii, the pathogen enters the cell. After an incubation period of 2-3 weeks, 40% of the patients begin to show symptoms. These symptoms manifest in a wide range of forms, but pneumonia is by far the most common. The other 60% of the patients do not show acute symptoms. If the infection goes untreated, it may become chronic. This can lead to multiple complications, including abortion and endocarditis.
Diagnostics
Currently, diagnostic tools available for Q fever are aimed at a few biomarkers. The first biomarker is the DNA of C. burnetii. By amplifying a part of the genome of C. burnetii within the patient’s blood trough PCR acute Q fever infection can be detected [8] . The test is highly specific and very sensitive, but only as long as DNA remains detectable within the patient’s blood. The DNA can approximately be detected until two weeks after contact with the pathogen within blood samples of the patient. After these two weeks, the patient has typically become immune against the pathogen and the DNA of the pathogen can no longer be found within the patient’s blood. This is problematic as Q fever’s clinical polymorphism impedes doctors to rapidly recognize Q fever. Therefore, prevention of Q fever infection is often easier to accomplish than cure.  The second biomarker is a direct result of this built up immunity. Two types of antibodies become detectable in the blood. In contrast to the DNA of C. burnetii, these antibodies remain detectable within the blood for longer periods (Figure 5) [9] .A drawback of serological tests is the lag phase in antibody response: it takes up to two weeks before a patient’s blood gives detectable levels of Phase I-antibodies. Therefore, these tests can only be used to detect previous Q fever rather than acute Q fever. Additionally, serological tests and skin tests suffer from a higher variability and show long return times. Besides that, the success of skin tests relies on trained personnel. As an alternative to these tests, interferon gamma detection has been developed [10] . In this test, a blood sample from the patient is taken which is incubated with C. burnetii antigens. Rather than testing for the presence of antibodies, however, the immunity of the patient is tested by interferon gamma detection, a signaling molecule which is secreted by immune cells upon recognition of the path"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.
