Several IMAC and SDS-pages were run, see (Read more). In all cases eluent 1 was found to be empty. This is not surprising because the eluent volume is so small that the proteins will not come out until eluent 2. Because of this we decided to skip eluent 1 for the negative control in the presented SDS in fig. 3. Eluent 2 consists of several proteins; every protein that does not bind to the IMAC should come out in this step. Eluent 3 seems to be where our colicin Fy is eluted, since it shows a band at the correct length, 50kDa. The negative control did not show any band in 50kDa and expression could therefore be confirmed. Since the colicin was eluted at elution 3 no band can be seen at elution 4.

Appendix 1 displays an earlier SDS-page that was run with more constructs. Since there were more constructs we could not try all elutes, since they did not fit on one gel. The existence of colicin Fy in the construct with J23106 could be seen. Due to this we continued to try further characterization with this construct (SDS-page gel before).

Figure 7 shows the results of the Q5 PCR with this primer set. The PCR was done according to Table 1, but with an annealing temperature of 52 degrees Celsius and an extension time of 90 seconds. It went wrong once; afterwards, I repeated it with and without DMSO and incubated the PCR mix without polymerase but with template and primers at 10 minutes for 42 degrees Celsius.
Figure 7. Photo of a 1% TAE gel loaded with PCR products containing chiA and chiB with old RBS. The chiB with old RBS was necessary to correct for the 500 basepair deletion, while chiA was included as a positive control. For chiA, the 3A assembly with terminator was also used as a template to test the new primer. The gel was run for 30 minutes at 100V.
I needed one extra PCR to correct the chiB RBS; this worked, but not for chiA with only the coding sequence. Therefore, I purified chiA with terminator as this had the fixed RBS. The chitinases were ligated into pSB1K3 and transformed.
Week 6
Did 3A assembly of the chitinases; chiB + BBa_B0032 was ligated to BBa_I0500, chiA + BBa_B0032 + BBa_B0015 to BBa_I0500.
Week 7
Week 6 transformants were used for plasmid purification, sequenced and another 3A assembly was done: chiB with RBS and promoter was ligated to chiA with terminator and to terminator only (BBa_B0015). They were cloned into pSB4K5. I also tried to clone them into pSB1C3 right away, but the vector had not been linearized correctly. The transformants were checked with colony PCR, but that was not too conclusive; plasmids were digested with EcoRI and PstI and loaded on gel to confirm size (Figure 8).

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#NUPACK_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity. In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to measurement data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the lower methylation score is assigned, due to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing method and in standard sized reactions (in bulk) spectrophotometric data (Fig 1.) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the in kinetic measurement data perfectly. The activity of each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove and conclude, the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the activity of millions of enzyme sequences and assigning the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.
Regulatory part activity and cross-interaction assessment
We have then adjusted the CAT-Seq for regulatory part characterization and showed that we can successfully record characteristics of different regulatory parts. The constructed Ribosome Binding site library ( BBa_B0030 , BBa_B0032 , BBa_B0034 , BBa_K2621038 with a downstream CAT-Seq esterase gene BBa_K2621000 ) was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different RBS were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio). The collected activity data was normalized to BBa_B0034 data and is shown in Fig. 2.

Finally, the proteases were                                 designed to cleave an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal from target proteins, which                                 results in secretion of premade proteins.
Enhanced mechanosensing:
Sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound or other mechanical stimuli was enhanced by the introduction                                             of mechanosensitive ion channels and/or by the expression of protein gas vesicles from bacteria. Influx of                                             calcium through channels is sensed by formation of a complex between calmodulin and M13 peptide that can                                             result in a rapid light emission by cells (used for cell painting) or reconstitution of a split protease.
Protease based signaling
and information processing:
Combinations of proteolytic activities against specific targets resulted in activation of a reporter or another                                             protease, which forms the basis for the design of a new type of rapid signaling pathways and construction of                                             logic functions.
Orthogonal site-specific proteases:
A collection of orthogonal                                             site-specific proteases that recognize different targets was prepared as split proteins, whose activity against                                             selected targets can be induced by stimulation with an external signal such as light or chemicals.
Protease-triggered rapid secretion
of therapeutic proteins:
A rapid cellular                                             response by secretion of a protein is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of an endoplasmic reticulum retention                                             peptide. After the cleavage the cargo protein is moved from the ER, and secreted as therapeutic protein.

ASTWS-China,2018,Team:ASTWS-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"food safety induced by soil pollution”, it is astonishing that with more than half of the informants are “very anxious” towards the issue of food safety (Figure 2) (85.5% of the informants are either very serious or serious about the food safety issue), unlike our expectation which their life will also be largely affected by “soil pollution”, they are way less serious about that issue.
Figure 2
It could be reasonably argued that people are more attentive towards the food problem that is directly relative to the health problem than soil pollution problem which is more distant. But generally, they are concern about soil pollution by heavy metal as a whole. And thanks to the issue and their concerns, the outlook of our project seams bright.
Concerns (expectation) over the biological products
However, as a new form of purging product, the biological method to decompose soil pollution will probably be resisted by consumers. Based on our research, we could conclude several reasons why the consumers would have negative attitude to ameliorate polluted soil by biological methods.
The imparted micro-organisms may be unmanageable.
As shown in Figure 3, about 26.3% informants fear that those micro-organisms would remain in the soil (or water) and then be indirectly brought into our human body, causing unpredictable disease.
Figure 3
Even if the product does ameliorate the soil, people fear that there are insalubrious micro-organisms remaining in the soil, leading to further new pollution (Figure 4).
Figure 4
Field Trip and Professional Interviews
From our initial idea to a clear research plan, in order to have a picture on design of our working parts and our prototype to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work. In one hand, we took two field trips to the sewage treatment plants, one is treating domestic sewage and the other is treating industrial wastewater; in the other hand, we went to College of Environmental and Resource Science of Zhejiang University and interviewed two professors, and a visiting professor from MIT.
Field Trip to Local Urban Sewage Plant
Four team members including wet team leader Rongjian Tang visited Hangzhou West sewage treatment plant, to learn the modern treating methods of sewage by bacteria. This urban sewage treatment plant uses bacteria to process the sewage from west of Hangzhou, which gives us inspiration in designing our own processor for our product. For example, when designing our prototype, we extra added the use of germicidal lamp and the settling basin to eliminate the public fear of bioengineering methods. Moreover"

The peptides can then be tagged with radionuclides to enable the diagnosis by imaging techniques. The results of such a diagnostic method will give more information about the localization and spread of the fungal infection inside the patient's body than any of the currently available diagnostic methods.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#11 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," industry can overlap.  For me personally, I found an area of interest would be the seperation and cooling of the bitumen/steam/water mixture; it has to be cooled, processed, then re-heated again.  Surprisingly, the heat energy from the cooling/heating of fluids in the CP site is not really conserved or recycled.  Finding a way to reduce the need for temperature fluctuations would be a big step up for the industry up in Fort McMurray.  To end on a random note: YMM aka the Fort McMurray airport is TINY...and the single cafeteria there overcharges immensely.

ConocoPhillips, the Oil Sands and Synthetic Biology
Julie, Bob, Andrew and Pat, all representatives from ConocoPhillips, were able to give our group an amazing tour of their site today. Whereas Suncor’s site was devoted to mining the Oil Sands, ConocoPhillips’ site at Surmont used a different approach: Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). This method involves the injection of steam through a horizontal pipe through the oil sand in order to reduce the incredibly viscosity of the bitumen. The heated bitumen then flows by gravity down to a pipe lower and parallel to the steam injection pipe to be pumped back up to the surface. The production of oil appeared to be a byproduct as most of the plant was devoted to the recycling, heating and cooling of water.
Although ConocoPhillips employed a different method of extracting the oil from the sands, we can see many similarities between the two extraction methods, the largest being the large dependence on incredible amounts of heat energy. Whether it be heating massive amounts of water up to over 300ºC or processing the oil by “cracking” it at incredibly high pressures and temperatures, it appears we cannot avoid this energy demand, yet.
This is where iGEM Calgary and synthetic biologists come in to play. The entire purpose of these past two days was to get people in our field thinking about how we can use the tools and techniques in biology to benefit these energy giants. And that we did. We are bound to find and exploit a gene that allows for the processing of oil, whether it be an enzyme that catalyzes the cracking process at 20ºC instead of 700ºC, or an enzyme that allows for a decrease in viscosity of extracted oil. In any event, I am starting to think that a collaboration between iGEM and the oil sands will inevitably happen in the near future.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#CEA_-_-_TEXT.html," their functionality would be severely impaired by the lack of nutritional supplementation, and they would be quickly outcompeted by wild-type strains.
This brings to the table a second research priority for field-deployability: engineer an auxotrophic strain of Shewanella to contain our constructs, and ensure that the likelihood of survival without nutritional supplementation is very, very low. We would also need to ensure, from a practical standpoint, that auxotrophy would not interfere with any other aspects of the physiology of the cells.
Evolutionary Prediction
Due to the relatively simple nature of our reporter system, we find it highly unlikely that our strains could evolve to possess any dangerous function if somehow released into the wild. However, it is still possible that the promoter regions of our constructs could mutate and alter the expected patterns of promoter activity, or that the functionality of mtrB would be impaired by a deleterious mutation. The former possibility could serve to make the strain more genetically similar to the wild-type, and thus more able to compete; this presents us with another reason to pursue auxotrophy as a solution, basically in order to ensure that our strains are not alive for long enough for mutations to accumulate.
However, we would also need to conduct extensive testing to ensure that our strains remain functional and responsive to analyte for the full 6-month period.
Gene Transfer
Perhaps the most pressing concern with any synthetic biology project is the possibility of horizontal gene transfer from engineered to natural strains, and vice versa. Again, our first line of defense is physical containment, but barring that, what can we do to reduce the possibility that our strains would transfer unnatural functions to natural cells? The biggest shortcoming of our current system is that antibiotic resistance is used as a selective marker on our plasmids, thus allowing for the possibility that antibiotic resistance could be spread among natural populations via conjugation or passive transformation. While we could explore the possibility of using another form of auxotrophy as a selective marker on a plasmid, we believe that a more viable solution would be to eliminate the need for a selective pressure in the first place, namely by chromosomal integration. The transfer of chromosomal DNA is much less likely than the transfer of a plasmid, and, as mentioned above, chromosomal integration would solve other problems in the functionality of our reporters.
Limitations of CEA
CEA allowed us to think about crucial future work for our project in order to make it suitable for field-deployability. However, in our interactions with environmental groups, public officials in water quality management, and industrial groups, we encountered several important questions that were not built"

Sunnymorning Organic Farm is located on the boundary of Hsinchu and Miaoli in Taiwan, about a 40 minute distance from NCTU. ""Due to the diversity of crops in the farm, hundreds of moths are attracted to the opening flashlight during summer evening"", said the owner, amusingly. Thus, they are struggling hard by harmful insect problems.

However, they are not pir+, so the R6K pir+ dependent origin does not work for them. S. oneidensis MR-1 grows at 30 ºC, can be electroporated (see protocol in our Notebook ) and forms round orange pink colonies on plates.  It is resistant to ampicillin, but other resistance markers, such as gentamycin and spectomycin, can be used (Saffarini).  Together, these characteristics make S. oneidensis MR-1 a genetically tractable organism good for exploring the possibilities of regulated bacterial electrical output.

Chassis and the Registry
To facilitate easy manipulation in different organisms, it may be advantageous for the Registry to standardize a chassis specification sheet. Below, we provide a quick summary of S. oneidensis MR-1 following what we think may be a suitable documentation format. Since iGEM teams frequently work with species other than E. coli, if only to clone some interesting gene product, a set of such sheets could be built up to facilitate synthetic biology in a more diverse set of organisms.

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook-Progress_-_-_TEXT.html,"hr.  Bacteria appeared to be repelled by both the serine (see below)and aspartate at this concentration compared with the control where no chemoattractant was present in the plug.  Research group page (Professor Jong Yoon, Micro/nanofluidic Bio MEMS group) indicates that serine becomes chemorepellent 1M concentration (the same may be true of aspartate).
Control
1%Serine in plug
We have been attempting a 'dead bacteria' control, but have been unable to successfully kill our bacteria without using a method that physically alters them.  We have tried sodium azide (bacteriostatic)- but resuspension allows them to recover.  Kanamycin and chloramphenicol were also used, but only for a few hours.  We might try leaving a culture overnightin these two antibiotics - this should be sufficient to kill them!
BioBrick Transformation
The transformation efficiency should be increased. It was assumed that the quality of the BioBrick DNA is the most important factor to improve. Thus, two punched paper discs of the same BioBrick were incubated overnight at two different temperatures: 37oC and room temperature. The room temparature DNA resulted in 63 colonies (compared to 14 colonies with the 37oC-DNA), but it was not comparable since the 63 colonies were a result from a double electro shock. This may enhance the transformation efficiency. Thus, further tests should be conducted considering different incubation times and temperatures of the paper disc in water and as well single and double electroporation.
Electro competent cell of E. coli MG1655 were made and tested with pUC19. This resulted in zero colonies and may due to the high OD600 of the cells when they were prepared. New cells should be made.
DH5α cells were transformed with pRZ1 (pRS415 containing cpxR responsive promotor). The efficiency was very high and 15 colonies were isolated.

Unfortunately it was discovered that the Cpx response (activated by adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces) actually downregulates, via CpxR, chemotaxis through a number of genes. This means that our initial plan of using the Cpx system to detect adhesion to the beads will not work in its current form as the bacteria adhered to the bead will stop chemotaxing. Indeed, bacteria that adhere to the bead because of short or long-range co-"

Human Practices
In our human practices section, we investigated the economic, social, environmental, etc. applications of biomanufacturing. We talked to experts in astrobiology to get a sense of how this balloon might be used in that community. In addition, we talked to companies at various stages of commercializing different biomanufacturing processes: from small start-ups to Genentech, currently the largest biomanufacturing operation in the world. We then examined what we learned and tried to extrapolate our findings to the context of our latex production process. To read about these efforts, see the Integrated Human Practices and Interviews sub-project page. The other main component of our human practices was educational in nature: the team presented at both the Bay Area and New York City World Maker Faires to help educate the public about the work that we did and about synthetic biology more generally. To read more about that and our other outreach activities, see the Outreach sub-project page.

Ecuador,2018,Team:Ecuador#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Printeria is able to automate the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria and is as easy to operate as a common printer. It uses a system of digital microfluidics that creates small droplets that can be mixed and moved through predefined electrode trajectories. This box lab is combined with Golden Gate technology, sensors and low-cost electronics and an easy-to-use software application.
Just like that the user is able to assemble parts  of DNA domesticated in a one-step reaction and can control all biotechnological  steps, from the assembly of parts and transformation to cell culture, with high  precision.
The initial idea was to try the production of the fusion proteins and bacterial cellulose in Printeria. Can you imagen that hospital would produce his own bandages when they need it? But both teams have problems with the size of the parts, so we change plans and decided to evaluate the opinion of researchers, medicians and artist.

MEETUP LATIN AMERICA
The past July, we had the chance to attend online at the Latin American Meetup hosted by team TecCEM. There we heard about the other Latin American's projects, sharing experiences and learning from each other. We got the opportunity to present our project and received good questions from experts that had helped us to be prepared for the Giant Jamboree and gives us experience. The eight teams that participated in the meetup were: TecCEM, Tec-Chihuahua, Tec-Monterrey, TecMonterrey-GDL , UChile_Biotec, Ecuador, USP-EEL-Brazil, USP-Brazil.
The  feedback provided by the specialists was crucial for the proper development of  the projects, and beyond the scientific issues, we were able to get to know  each other, get along and create bonds of collaboration and support between the  teams.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," measurements that have been done. The next step, then, is to develop the appropriate strategy for responsive action to mitigate that risk (Beck 1996; Giddens 1999). The aforementioned studies therefore suggest in their scientific publications that a language of risk is necessary to understand the problem:
""The water used for human consumption presented mutagenic activity related to nitro-aromatics and aromatic amines compounds probably derived from the cited textile processing plant effluent discharge. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the possible risks involved in the human consumption of this contaminated water"" (Alves de Lima et al. 2007: 53)
""...human and ecological risks associated with the release of dye processing plant effluents should be more fully investigated, especially where the resultant water is taken for human consumption"" (de Aragão Umbuzeiro et al. 2005: 55).
So what is typical of the modern industrial society is that it has created the knowledge in the areas in which a risk is manufactured from statistical inference. This leads to a situation where “the blinkers of individuali[s]ation drop off”, meaning that the emergence of hazardous effects, that harmed an increasing number of individuals, could finally be attributed to a source that posed a threat to a whole group of people. Prior to this, there was no way of explaining why individual cases began to suffer from something that was instigated beyond their knowledge and action. In other words, the prevalence of cancer in the area of the Cristais River ceased to be a matter of accumulating but unrelated individual cases, but could subsequently be explained through the risk that was measured. Team member Georgia also stated that this has been important to uncover an environmental problem without which they as a team would not even have been made aware of an issue they could work on:
“It’s really just because azo dyes have been around for so long, I feel like the problem hasn’t really been discovered enough, because they’ve been there since we’ve started diagnose cancer properly so they’ve kind of like been travelling along this road together and we haven’t even been able to separate them before. Now we are kind of like zooming in on the problem and we can do like “hey, wait, maybe cancer is more prevalent because of the way we’re dealing with these dyes that literally just split into the worst carcinogens we have””.
Participating in the Risk Society with Synthetic Biology
The team’s discourse on the hazards of classic industrial society is of considerable importance because, at the same time, they are also confronted with a public environmental discourse that relates to their"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

Teaching Module ""Synthetic Biology"" for Highschools
Fun with fluorescence
Students at Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium preparing vanilla pudding solution for fluorescence measurement.
In the course of our cooperation with the grade 9 biology-chemistry class at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Aachen, we developed a teaching module about “Synthetic Biology”. The scope of the module is 8 school classes 45 min. each. Topics include sources and exposure to microorganisms in our environment, antibiotic resistances, quorum sensing, fluorescence and measurement thereof, as well as the biomolecular aspect of our iGEM project. To wrap up the module we do some career-exploration in synthetic biology and related fields.
The teaching module is suitable for the subjects biology, biology-chemistry and sciences. The students should have completed grade 8, and know about the central dogma of biology as well as protein biosynthesis. Because our work is going to be evaluated based on this wiki, we would like to take photos during the lessons. In order to publish the photos on our homepage and our wiki, we need a consent form signed by the students’ parents. If you are interested in collaborating with our team write us an email at igem@rwth-aachen.de
We already carried out this teaching module in cooperation with Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium. For each of the lessons we have recorded our experience in a blog entry.

As our technology is developing, new intellectual property will be generated, and this is reflected in our profitability analysis in the legal section.
Costs for patenting were based upon a rough estimate of $10,000 per provisional patent and $50,000-$70,000 per utility filing.  This assumes that our first provisional will be filed in 2014, and two patents will be issued by 2016. Miscellaneous legal fees would include the drafting of all documents relating to customer agreements, non-disclosure agreements, sales agreements, etc. These will begin to increase as our first product hits the market. Cost were based on hourly rates of $250-$500.
Regulatory approval costs will include, in 2015, approximately $21,500 for Environment Technology Verification (ETV) approval and an additional $10,000 dollars for necessary toxicity and growth assays as required for general safety verification by CEPA. In 2016, this will increase to $43,000, accounting for new approvals for subsequent technology and an additional $50,000 to begin USA Environmental Protection Agency assessment.
Travel costs will occur between labs, as we will have research and development activities occurring in both Calgary and Edmonton.
Travel for promotional related events will be highest in the early phases as we try to network and seek advice from potential customers.
Telephone and fax services are based on current prices in Calgary. These will commence in 2014 when we begin to rent office space.
Insurance increases annually as the business grows and sales commence. Key insurance for our venture will be business liability insurance as well as product liability insurance.
The budget places emphasis on numerous components of the company's development, namely those listed above the detailed expenses list.  The budget requires that we raise significant capital funding for our business, requiring $2 million to bring our product to market by the year 2016.  The budget reflects a number of assumptions.  These include being able to supply ourselves with numerous laboratory equipment through government granting programs and university technology transfer programs available in Alberta.  This also assumes that for up-scale of our prototype towards commercialization, we have the ability to partner with a manufacturing group to supply the  equipment required to produce our product.  Additionally, the expenses of becoming certified through numerous government programs may be variable depending on the particular legislation.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Yap1p response element). Some of the best characterized promoter regions that these transcription factors bind to are those for the genes TSA1 (thioredoxin peroxidase) and CCP1 (mitochondrial cytochrome-c peroxidase) (He et al. 2005). The gene that was reported to have highest response against microcystin was CTT1 (cytosolic catalase T) (Valério et al., 2014). We chose to look into these three promoters more deeply, and this led us to the idea of creating a sensor by fusing one of these promoter areas with fluorescent protein production and implementing this in S. cerevisiae .
This sensor would produce a fluorescent signal when the activation of the transcription factors Skn7p and Yap1p has been induced – in other words, when the S. cerevisiae cells encounter stress. As microcystin is a rather effective stress-generating factor, and as most sources of oxidative stress (such as xenobiotics and heavy metals) are rare in nature (Farrugia et al., 2012), we can assume that it is the main stress producing factor found in Finnish lakes. This leads to our hypothesis: fluorescent colour produced by our engineered S. cerevisiae is proportional to microcystin concentration in measured water samples.
Transporter
An important prerequisite for the function of the stress promoters is that the toxin must be imported into the cell. Microcystin-LR doesn’t pass the cell membrane without the help of specific transporter proteins. In human liver cells, the membrane bound OATP transporter (organic anion transport peptide) was identified to imports MCs into the cell. OATPs belong to the superfamily of solute carriers and mediate the uptake of endogenous compounds such as hormones or bile salts but also a variety of xenobiotics (Faltermann et al., 2016). In yeast, the QDR2 transporter has a similar function. It has a broad substrate specificity and can transport many mono- and divalent cations as well as a variety or drugs.  According to Valerio et al., the QDR2 transporter from the yeast strain VL3 is the most similar to human OATP out of all S. cerevisiae strains.We also did a BLAST search to confirm this data and come to the conclusion that QDR2 transporter from VL3 corresponded best to the human OATP transporter out of all yeast transporters. Transporters from all other common S. cerevisiae strains differ significantly from these.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFuture_-_-_TEXT.html," development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

Protein purification with IMPACT
Figure 1: Bradford-Assay. The protein concentration was measured by a Bradford-Assay. With the fitting of the known BSA-samples the concentrations of the purified SH2-cI protein (red) and of the purified HA4-RpoZ protein (blue) could be measured. The purified proteins were diluted by the factor 100 to accomplish evaluable results.
The first step for the interaction control of HA4 and SH2 required purified proteins. For the purification we used the IMPACT (Intein Mediated Purification with an Affinity Chitin-binding Tag)   Kit from NEB (New England Biolabs).An intein-tag and a chitin-binding domain were translational fused to our protein of interest and integrated in the vector    pTXB1. After cultivation of the pTXB1-carrying E. coli strain ER2566, we did a cell lysis via French Press to prevent the from being damaged. The actually purification happens in a chitin column.   The chitin binding domain, which is fused at our protein of interest, mediated a binding between our protein and the chitin beads in the column. After some wash steps all other"

Figure 4: Figure taken from Song et al., 2011. Illustrating the proposed mechanism of the uirS two-component UV-A photosensory system in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.
The uirS system possesses structural and functional homologies with the ccaS green-light photosensor system, also from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which has been characterised by several previous iGEM teams (Edinburgh 2010, Wash U St Louis 2014). Both sensors are two-component systems where a bound Phycocyanobillin chromophore detects light within a transmembrane sensor protein (CcaS, UirS), leading to phosphorylation of a DNA binding regulatory protein (CcaR, UirR), which binds upstream of a promoter region (PcpcG2, PlsiR) inducing transcriptional activation. A 2014 paper by Schmid et al. “Refactoring and Optimization of Light-Switchable Escherichia coli Two-Component Systems”, detailed the optimisation of the ccaS green-light sensor system. We hoped that the investigations into optimised plasmid assembly for ccaS could be applied to our uirS UV-A light sensor system due to their homologies. The paper reports that for the ccaS sensor, the most effective assembly is a two plasmid arrangement; where the sensor and PCB synthesis genes are placed on a low copy number p15A origin of replication plasmid, while the response protein, associated promoter, and reporter genes are placed on a high copy number ColE1 ori plasmid. Figure 5 is taken from Schmid et al and shows their optimised green light sensor assembly.

We replicated as closely as possible the two-plasmid assemblies with our uirS system biobricks, creating two composite parts: K1725430 (J23101.B0032.uirR.B0015.PlsiR.GFP) and K1725445 (J23106.B0032.uirS.K322122(ho1 and pcyA)). To emulate copy number, in testing we utilised the pSB"

Where GFPi is the data that we obtained, IC is the initial mercury concentration and t is the time.
Therefore, our equation for the fitted model is
With this equation we can infer the intensity of GFP given any time or any initial concentration of mercury, then using the equation reported by JCBRAFF(BBa_E0040) which is
Where y = GFP intensity and x = GFP concentration in nanomolar, we can infer the amount of GFP protein produced by the cell and finally have the ability to predict the concentration of our bioremediation proteins since the concentration of GFP is the same that this proteins. By the equation:
Since the GFPi is given in µg/ml, we have to divide the equation for the Mol weight of Hg.

A time course experiment was performed to test the growth of 10-ß cells in BG-11 supplemented with leucine.  Growth was tested in BG-11, BG-11 with NH4Cl, BG-11 with leucine, and BG-11 with NH4Cl and leucine.  In all cases the media was also supplemented with 50 mM glucose.  The results indicated that leucine made no difference in the carrying capacity of our media, and NH4Cl had a marginal benefit.
Next, testing will be done with different cell lines with the intent of finding a strain that can be readily cultured in BG-11 with minimal supplements.

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the parts individually with the bacteria. This will allow for further experimentation with the full bacteriophage construct including the other parts.
ELASTIN-LIKE POLYMERS
The purpose of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) is to remove the metal ion-laden phage from the solution[4]. At a specific temperature, ELPs will aggregate and precipitate out of solution. This transition temperature (Tt) is influenced by factors such as the heavy metal concentration, concentration of ELP, the length of the ELP chain, and the variable amino acids in each monomer. We will be altering the length and the concentration of ELP to achieve our goal Tt. We plan for the ELP to have a Tt between 45οC to 50oC as this will allow the ELP to remain in solution while maintaining the optimal efficiency of our chosen bacteria[4]. The length and the Tt have an inverse relationship; when we increase the length of the ELP, the transition temperature decreases. Using this information we intend to keep the guest residue the same while altering the length to achieve the goal Tt.
To influence the characteristics of our ELP, we can also experiment with the variable amino acid in each monomer. All ELPs contain the amino acid sequence Val-Pro-Gly-X-Gly, with X representing the variable amino acid. For our project, we want to use a hydrophobic amino acid, specifically valine, glycine, or alanine. By using a hydrophobic amino acid, we can destabilize the ELP and it will more readily drop out of solution. There are several residues that are found to work well with the precipitation of ELP; valine is found to be the most effective for protein aggregation. We will add standardized linker sequences to the N- and C-termini of the ELP to allow for easy fusion to other functional proteins. In our case, we will be fusing the capsid protein of the bacteriophage and the metal-binding peptide to either end of the ELP.
Figure 3. Schematics of different variants of elastin-like polymers[4]. The Tt for both ELPs is 50oC but the ELP that uses valine as the guest residue in the 40 pentapeptides is much shorter and therefore more efficient in precipitation as it uses fewer resources.

Engineering Principles
While planning our project and putting it into practice, we always kept in mind some fundamental principles of engineering. Firstly, our project was well planned and all available information was collected and evaluated beforehand, allowing us to adjust our construct before actually starting in the wet lab. Also, we kept the whole construct as simple and made use of as many standard biobricks from the iGEM registry as possible. Those parts not available in the registry (see our new parts ) were built into the assembly standard making them available to all users of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Additionally, we ensured the functionality of each subunit by building His­-constructs of all mmo genes to test them separately. This allowed us to evaluate their functionality and, if necessary, to adjust them for a better performance. Furthermore, as it is the duty of an engineer to not only take responsibility for the positive but also the negative consequences of a construction, we never left safety and ethics out of our equations.
Expert Interview
After successful and functional expression of the sMMO-complex, we encountered questions addressing the practicability of our project. Can E. cowli survive inside the inhospitable environment of the cow's rumen or is the activity affected by it, are just two of the many questions we had to face. To address these question we talked to Dr. Ulf Prüße of the Thünen-Institute Braunschweig, an expert in immobilization of enzymes and bacteria.
1. Our findings suggest that E. coli is inhibited by conjugated fatty acids in the rumen. Is there a possibility to avoid this inhibition using, for example, immobilization?
No, that’s usually not possible. The immobilization matrix allows the transport of low molecular weight substrates, products, nutrients etc. through the matrix by diffusion. Otherwise the cell would die. There is a molecular cut-off of the matrix which depends on the matrix material itself and partially also on the immobilization procedure, but this cut-off is much higher than the molecular weight"

Overview
fishPHARM first started as an iGEM summer project motivated, but has quickly evolved into a novel start-up company with potential for immediate application and long-term impact. We have engaged in several entrepreneurship endeavors to facilitate the growth of fishPHARM as not only a synthetic biology based project, but as a locally-based business venture capable of curing BCWD worldwide. We have also partnered with a variety of fish hatcheries and research institutes in the New York State Finger Lakes Region to help take our discoveries from the lab bench and meet the demands of a growing consumer market. Through conversations with these hatcheries, which deal with bacterial coldwater disease daily, we are able to analyze the safety implications of deploying our product in the fish farming industry and compare the economic costs of our product to current solutions. fishPHARM is designed directly with the needs of your everyday fish farmer in mind. By collaborating with our consumers in the initial stages, we aim to develop a product that is not only safe and effective, but also is practical for treating BCWD in the real-world.
Hatchery Collaborations
Economic Analysis
Oxytetracycline (branded as Terramycin) costs roughly $0.70/gram. Since the total amount of antibiotic required for a 10-day treatment is 25 g/100 lbs, treatment of a fish stock with Terramycin costs about $0.025 per dollar of fish [1]. However, Terramycin is already becoming obsolete as a treatment protocol due to the rapid formation of resistant strains [2]. While the antibiotic may appear cost effective, it cannot be relied upon as a long-term solution due to the rise of antibiotic resistance. Bacterial tolerance of chemotherapeutic agents could obligate fish farmers to use more potent antibiotics, which could have undesirable side effects on their stock. Furthermore, the evolutionary capability of Flavobacterium to overcome antibiotics suggests that reliance on such agents in the future is a questionable proposition.
The total production cost of a fishPHARM has been estimated to be roughly $2.00 per "

Collaboration
This year FAFU-CHINA team has siginificantly collaborated with other universities in various ways, including lab troubleshooting, modeling, functional verification and so on.
Lab troubleshooting
There are loads of teams using Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis as their chassis this year. So do we. Compared with E. coli and many gram-negative bacteria are transformed easily by pretreatment with divalent metal ions before the addition of plasmid DNA, it’s notoriously difficult to manage the condition of transformation for those lack of experience. Nature transformation of gram-positive bacteria is only know to occur among Bacillus subtilis and few species of Staptococcus. What the point is many protocols now in use must be painstakingly adjusted for individual strains to achieve satisfactory results. Actually, we were stuck into the transformation of our chssis as well, before we made it, a lot of blank vector control experiments were done to find out the best condtion, electroporation by adjusting all walks of parameters. It took us so long time, finally we made it by protoplasting and the we helped SCU-WestChina and WHU-China . For more information about protocol, pleas click here .
WHU-CHINA also helped us to measure the organic acid secreted fromour hyperaccumulator qualitatively HPLC. Thanks a lot.
Modeling
Based on the data and information we provided, BNU-China helped us to construct a PSB-assisted phytoremediation dynamic system mathematical model for the implementation. The whole system was separated by three main processes——the phytoremediation process, the organic ptoduction process and the bingding of heavy metal ion with MBP secreted by modified Bacillus megaterium. The effect factors of the system are complex under lab condition not mention to physical circumstances which refers to the soil properties, the concentration of heavy metal ions, the population and equilibrium of bacteria, the degradation rate of protein and a series of chemical reaction. Although in this case, BNU-China helped us predict the feasibility of our project in almost perfect way. And according to the positive feedback done by them, our projected is worthy of further"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," require covalent attachment to ACP, and likely to have broader substrate specificity.   The use of CAR did require a second gene from N. iowensis called Nocardia phosphopantetheinyl transferase (npt) to append a 4’- phosphopantetheine prosthetic group to CAR required for its full function (Venkitasubramanian et al., 2006).
Figure 6: Mechanism of CAR catalysis. Taken from He et al., 2004.
Another enzyme with the potential to remove carboxyl groups from NAs is olefin-forming fatty acid decarboxylase ( oleT ) from Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456. OleT of the cytochrome P450 family acts on fatty acids, but does have low substrate specificity (Rude et al. 2011).  Using oleT was beneficial because this single enzyme could do the job of the entire PetroBrick! Given that our decarboxylation approach was valid, we started testing and comparing oleT to the PetroBrick.
Progress so far
Genes car and npt were cloned from the host organism N. iowensis (NRRL 5646). car was ligated into the pET vector and verified by a restriction digest while npt was cloned into pSB1C3 ( BBa_K902061 ) and similarly verified.
car was cloned into pET47b+ plasmid to remove six illegal cut-sites (one XbaI site, two EcoRI sites, and three NotI sites), as it was unsuitable for the BioBrick construction vectors. We first attempted to use a multi-site mutagenesis derived from the QuikChange® Multi-Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit, but had little success. Instead, a more time-consuming but effective series of conventional single-site mutagenesis procedure was used with the KAPA Hi-Fi polymerase. The XbaI and EcoRI sites were eliminated first so that car can be moved from the pET Vector and ligated into the PSB1C3 vector ( BBa_K902062 ).
The oleT was successfully amplified from the Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456.
Like car, oleT was inserted in a pET47b+ (Novagen) vector before placing it into a BioBrick vector, as two illegal cut sites adjacent to one another needed to be mutagenized.  This part is now being ligated into pSB1C3.  We are currently in the process of"
UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Bactomithril#notepad_-_-_TEXT.html,", we know that sfGFP expresses in our e. coli. But we don’t know if it is attached to the external side of the membrane, or if the HIV-1 protease works as expected. As this secretion system seems to be failing, we chose to try other alternatives.
June 25 – July 1, 2012
The Gibson Assemblies of our iGEM team had been failing in the last weeks. This week new enzimes arrived. We hope that this will solve our problem.
Also, this week we tried to redesign our project. Our first task is to continue with our attempts to make a biobrick with the spider silk monomer ADF-3. We ordered the primers that we need to do that.
Now we are exploring the possibility of improve the product of the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig in his paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”. One idea is to attach a growth factor (e.g. recombinant human BMP-2) to the molecule of ADF-3.
But the problem with the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig is that it works on salmonella, and we cannot work with such an infectious bacteria.
July 2 – 8, 2012
This was a week of exams. Therefore, no major advances were accomplished during this week.
July 9 – 15, 2012
This week we made important advances in our wiki. We will start with the template of the iGEM team Johns Hopkins 2011 as a base.
Furthermore, we studied carefully the paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” and its supplementary information. We realized that each protein secreted with this system comes with a 3x FLAG (DYKDDDDK)3. It is a priority for us to find if someone can share us a little of the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Cat# F3165). That way, if we use this secretion system we will be able to quantify the production of our protein of interest. But, if we want to use Voigt´s system, we need attenuated salmonellas with their pathogenicity island 1 intact.
Something similar to Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. After some research we found a professor of our University that works with salmonella (Dr. Susan Bueno). But she was out of the country and we could only send her some emails asking for the salmonella.
July 16 – 22, 2012
Finally the primers necessary"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," our construct to be synthesised by DNA 2.0 being over 3kb we have not had any experience with the success of this assembly method. For future teams we recommend careful planning and serious consideration when using this method of construction. Although you are guaranteed a high quality construct, long production times can undesirable for short time-spanning projects, and costs (thus potential losses) are high.
Modelling results
Preliminary results suggest that the mix of colours in an individual e.coli is very unpredictable. The model was run multiple times with all sensors having the same activation rate. The mix of colours is very unstable with successive runs producing varying greatly. However the average for a cohort of cells is more stable. It is due to the relatively small number of DNA agents with which the RNAP interacts. This amplifies the effects of chance and causes the instability observed in the model.
This shows the pigment populations during 5 runs of a cell given the same initial conditions each time. It demonstrates the instability in the gene expression and also inequality in the magnitude of expression. The 'x' character lines represent the average of the 5 runs and are more stable as a results.
This will serve reduce the spacial control of tri-chromatic control system in E.Coli as a predictable average expression of a gene will require many individuals. For a biocamera this will reduce the pixel density and therefore the resolution. One solution to this potential problem could be to introduce many copies of the light light regulated genes. This could also serve to prevent one pathway dominating by having greater numbers of less prolific light regulated genes to compensate.
Planned ""Post-Freeze"" Work
The sequence coding for our blue light system was sent off to be synthesised by DNA 2.0, however despite the expected delivery date of 28/8/13, we are still awaiting its arrival.   When delivered we plan to transform this into E.coli and experiment with its response to blue light. We would expect to see the inhibition of yellow pigment (amilGFP) when the light sensor is exposed to blue light.
In order to determine if our 3 light sensors are specifically responding to the correct light we plan to use acetate light filters. Using these filters will allow the E. coli, containing the specific light sensors, to grow in the presence of monochromatic light (either blue, green or red). We would expect to see the production pigment when grown in the presence of either of the 2 colours that the light sensor does not respond to. However, when grown in the presence of light that the sensor is responsive to we would expect"

Conclusions
In the same way as with the proteolysis system, here we are repressing both State 2 reporter and State 1 repressor when State 1 is the dominant. The conclusions of this mechanism are the same that with proteolysis: RFP residual signal will be minimized while PcI expression will be enhanced, as it won’t be repressed. By doing this, we will shorten the switching time between states and obtain the clearest signal difference.

To carry out the midi-prep procedure, the team used Sigma-Aldrich’s GenElute Midi-prep kit and with it, the enclosed protocol. We chose to follow the Spin-method and carried out steps 1-6 and 1b to 11b missing out the DNA concentration step and also missing out DNA quantification. This is a summary of the steps:
The two falcon tubes, each with 50ml of E.coli culture, were spun down for 10 minutes (under 4,500g); once centrifugation had finished the supernatants were discarded. To the pellets 4ml of resuspension solution (with RNAse included) was added and used to resuspend them.
4ml of lysis solution was applied to both samples (with both tubes inverted gently 8 times) and left for 5 minutes. As soon as this time had expired, 4ml of neutralisation solution was added. The 2 falcon tubes were gently inverted 6 times for mixture.
3ml of binding solution was added to the two solutions. Once the two falcon tubes were inverted twice, the solutions were placed into separate syringe barrels. The two culture solutions were allowed to remain in the barrel for 5 minutes.
During this 5 minute waiting step, 4ml of Column Preparation solution were added to two Binding Columns, with the columns centrifuged for 5 minutes. When finished the eluate was removed.
Half of the two culture solutions were syringed into the two binding columns. The columns were then centrifuged for two minutes and the solution eluted removed. The remainder of the two solutions was then placed into the binding columns and further centrifuged for 2 minutes. Like before the eluate was discarded.
4 ml of Wash Solution 1 was then added to both Binding Columns, which were then centrifuged for 2 minutes under 3,000g. The eluted solution was then discarded and to the 2 empty Binding Columns, 4ml of Wash Solution 2 was added. The columns were then centrifuged for 2 minutes again with the eluate removed.
The binding columns were then transferred to clean collection tubes and to each column, 1ml of Elution Solution was added. The columns were then centrifuged for 5 minutes under 3,000g. THIS TIME THE ELUATE WAS RETAINED AND THE BINDING COLUMNS DISCARDED!

Collaboration with the iGEM Stockholm
The iGEM team from Karolinska Institutet (KI)/Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) has a similar project and we want to thank them for always being open to discuss ideas. As part of our project regarding bacteriocins, we wanted to check the bactericidal effect on different bacterial strains. Stockholm (KTH/KI) contributed with that by performing a MIC test of crude cell extract containing our bacteriocins. Three different strains were used namely S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. Cloacae. Stockholms contribution with the MIC test made us able to compare their results to ours. For further information check out Demonstration & Results.
Collaboration with the Danish Technical University
We assisted the iGEM team from the Danish Technical University with the selection of a BioBrick. Their BioBrick did not express the desired gene, we suggested the use of K880005 instead.
Collaboration with Copenhagen University
Birka chaired a workshop on mathematic modelling, held at the Danish Technical University.
Collaboration with Chalmers University
At the Human Practices workshop in Copenhagen, our philosopher began a collaboration with Chalmers University. The iGEM team from Chalmers had made sci-fi novels as a way of presenting problems that could occur when working with GMO's. Our philosopher then made a sci-fi story for them, in dialogue style. The dialogue is focused on the Precautionary Principle.
Collaboration with the University of Virginia
The iGEM team from the University of Virginia asked us to help them by answering a survey, which we were more than happy to do.
Collaboration with the LMU and TUM Munich
We helped the LMU and TUM Munich iGEM team out by answering their survey about entrepreneurship. They had some great thoughts concerning the possibilities in creating a business through iGEM.

Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below are the Results corresponding to each subproject.
To view the methods and experiments that correspond to the following results, please see our Experiments page linked here.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Substrate Tests
The results of our substrate tests indicate that the mycelium can grow on any organic material––even Martian regolith mixed with supplemental nutrients. We did find, however that there were factors that impacted the success of mycelium colonization. First the moisture level greatly impacted how quickly the mycelium could grow and whether it entered a dormant state or not(entering it if the material is too dry). Second the particle size also impacted colonization rate; with particles that were too fine or too large being harder to colonize than particles of a medium size.This information was important to formulating our mission architecture;helping us to determine what could be used as a substrate on Mars and how coarse or fine the particles of the substrate would need to be.
Temperature Tests
Based off the results of our temperature test (see the tables 1 and 2 and graphs 1 and 2 below), we concluded that the optimal growth temperature (based on the temperature settings available to us) was 30°C and that the dikaryon variant grew faster than the monokaryon variant. After linearizing the raw data (see graphs 3 and 4) we found that the dikaryon grew at approximately 7.7 cm2 per day at 30°C while it only grew 7 cm2 per day at 24°C. The monokaryon grew at approximately 5.6 cm2 per day at 30°C while it only grew 4.2 cm2 per day at 24°C. Our results also allowed us to conclude that at temperatures close to 4°C and 37°C growth is limited,"

Background
Biosensing Water Contaminants with Genetically Engineered Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
As one of the most important natural resources, the declining quality of fresh water is a world-wide issue. Pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to interact with electronics. The Mtr pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 is an external electron transportation pathway that is able to transfer electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode, thus generating electric current that is utilized in bioelectrochemical systems. We are utilizing S. oneidensis MR-1 △MtrB, the MtrB gene is removed, to prevent electron flow to an outside source through this key protein. We are then inserting a plasmid into this strain that contains the MtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and metals in the water. This will allow for controlled electrical expression that can be used in microbial fuel cells to create a biosensor for the detection of these compounds. This biosensor will then be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is currently in development.
Why?
As a Michigan team, water quality is an issue that hits very close to home. The Flint Water Crisis gained national attention for the extremely elevated lead contamination in the drinking water. This crisis began in 2014, however the Flint residents are advised to continue using filtered or bottled water until the pipes are fully replaced by the year 2020. Another famous American case of poor water quality is the Hinkley groundwater contamination made public by Erin Brockovich in 1993.
Mtr Pathway
The mtrB pathway harnesses electrons through metabolized lactate and transports the energy from mtrA to mtrC which is then capable of donating the electron to an external acceptor molecule. MtrB is"

""Catalase is an enzyme that effectively scavenges the toxic reactive oxygen species. Low levels of catalase have been demonstrated in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo.[3] UV irradiation of the skin is known to trigger free radical generation and resultant melanocyte damage. Human melanocytes in cell culture are especially sensitive to exygen radicals and melanocytes from vitiliginous skin require the addition of catalase to the culture medium to grow. The melanocytes from healthy skin proliferate without addition of catalase enzyme. Histological examination of involved and uninvolved epidermis in vitiligo revealed evidence for peroxidative damage to both keratinocytes and melanocytes."" - Efficacy of antioxidants as an adjunct to photochemotherapy in vitiligo: A case study of 30 patients

DNA Purification
After desphosphorylation the vector DNA was purified using the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit.
Ligation
For ligation of the constructed plasmid 50 ng vector DNA, 3 times as much insert DNA, 2 µL T4 Ligase Buffer (NEB), 0.5 µL T4 Ligase (NEB) and water added to a final volume of 20 µL were mixed in 1.5 mL reaction tube. Ligation was carried out at 16 °C overnight. The reaction was stopped by inactivating the enzymes at 65 °C for 20 min.
Transformation of chemocompetent cells via heatshock
One -80 °C glycerol stock of chemocompetent cells was thawed on ice. 10 µL of the ligated DNA was prepared in a 1.5 mL reaction tube. 50 µL of the cells were added and incubated for 20 min on ice. The mixture was then heat shocked at 42 °C for 1 min and cooled on ice for 2 min. 1 mL SOC-medium was added and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C while shaken at 600 rpm. 100 µL of the cell suspension were plated on a 2xYT agar plate with the according antibiotic (chloramphenicol or ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C overnight.

We also noticed that both the Basement and BLUE LINC mentioned the importance of intellectual property protections. To get further details, we talked to Parth Majmudar at the UCSD Office of Innovation and Commercialization and he helped us understand the nuances of filing for a patent application and how to safeguard our research and innovation when presenting to the outside world.
In order to communicate what we learned, we kept notes from our meetings with these resources, and also used the 24 Steps to Disciplined Entrepreneurship as outlined by Bill Aulet to come up with a guide about how to bridge the gap between the innovation in synthetic biology and the resulting entrepreneurial knowledge and ecosystem.
Reflection: Because some of our team members were extremely invested in the entrepreneurial angle of science and synthetic biology, it was an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary learning. Although some members were involved with CS-based ventures, looking at all these methodologies such as 24 Steps and Stanford Biodesign (BLUE LINC) allowed us to understand some of the additional challenges inherently present for the synthetic biology community. For those of us who were less exposed to entrepreneurship, it was an eye-opening experience to learn about this seemingly alternate side of the equation about how to deploy our newly developed technology int he real world. Scientists are often poor communicators for non-technical information, but it is this approach that is essential for successful implementation.
Activity 6: High School Presentations and Synthetic Biology Workshops
People: As students ourselves, we understand how we felt coming out of high school wishing had more knowledge of the vast array of options that there are in STEM. Many students have only been exposed to a fraction of STEM fields at best, and still most likely have not witnessed real-world applications within these fields. We discussed how we could best use our iGEM project to teach students about synthetic biology in the present as well as its future. While we believed that these presentations were useful to students, we also wanted to do something that would continue to impact students in our community beyond this summer. We spoke with members of Tritons for Sally Ride Science and saw that their goal of getting young students excited and involved in science participation and education aligned with our vision and decided to design a workshop for their use.
Design and Dialogue: We designed our presentations at Torrey Pines High School to really engage the students in a discussion about what synthetic biology is and how we have used it in our iGEM project. In each classroom, we got to"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Monday, 6/4: Jumping right back into research, after so much background readings over the weekend!  Today we went to the Microsoft Research Cambridge to get a tutorial of Windows 8.  It was particularly interesting because I hadn't had contact with C# nor Visual Basic before, but only got a crash course on it this morning.  The new UI was especially interesting, especially the new metro-apps style and the start menu style change.  There were also a couple of new gestures that were used with the tablet, such as swiping to corners or gesture-based log-in, that were particularly interesting.  It would be great if we could take all these innovations and put them in the ELN design as well.

We used a standard assay for each construct.  We characterised cultures transformed with the amplifier constructs in exponential phase at the following arabinose concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 500 uM.  The controls that we ran for each assay included LB, untransformed BW27783, and J59691, the standard promoter.  With the data we gathered, we were able to update the Registry pages of the Cambridge 2007 amplifiers, and also illustrated the ability of our Sensitivity Tuners to modulate the transcriptional system downstream of pBad/AraC.

Discussion
Using the plate reader data, we were able to successfully characterise a wide range of Sensitivity Tuners. The switching point varies across the devices by a factor of ten, showing that the constructs would be suitable for their purpose.
The size of the response is shown to depend to a large extent on the activator. The choice of promoter has has less of an impact, although a discernible one.
The basal rate was consistent across the constructs, with the exception of BBa_I747381."

Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which"

Open Source for synthetic biology
Some notes for the license agreement of open source software.
Open source is originally a philosophy promotes a universal access via free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone.(Wikipedia)
Nowadays, the concept of open source has grown more complex. It becomes a rule, an agreement, and a way of which we work every day. A free soft could be no open source software, meanwhile a commercial software could also be open source.
For the open source software, there are many license agreements, 4 licenses among these is quite popular. They are GPL、LGPL、BSD、Apache. GPL : GNU General Public License LGPL : GNU Library or ""Lesser"" General Public License BSD : Berkeley Software Distribution Apache : Apache License
There are 2 basic types for open source software license: first is Reciprocal Licenses, for instance, GPL and LGPL; the other is Permissive Licenses, such as BSD, Apache. 70% of open source software use GPL or LGPL, include Linux core. (Source Forge) All GPL/LGPL license software, under the premise of providing code source, is reproducible, utilizable and distributable for no matter commercial or no commercial purposes. But, the source code must be complete, besides the source program, the compiled script and binary executable program are also demanded in the same package. The current distributor of software is the only subject who is responsible for his act of distribution in despite of the original author and former distributor.
A program and all derivation of this programs which is based on GPL/LGPL must keep the license term. We call this “copy left” which The GPL version 3 gives a clear definition for the copy right of GPL based software. The user and the distributor of GPL software"

Brainstorming a project idea
Deciding on a project was a difficult, albeit fun process.

Enzymatic cleavage of antiobiotcs in the environment

Allergy test for mice and rats
Home detection-kit for vaginal yeast infections
After brainstorming, it was time to take restrictions such as time, economics, and feasibility into account. We wanted to create a home detection-kit for vulvovaginal Candida albicans(C. albicans). However, during the course of our project we decided against a consumer-based product, in favour of one operated by a health professional. The reasoning for this is elaborated on in our Integrated Human Practices page.
Inspiration
Since 30 % of the women who purchase over-the-counter antimycotics do not have an ongoing C. albicans infection, a fast detection kit for this infection could potentially aid in the fight against antimycotic resistance by helping people to treat only when they have an infection [A].
The first step in designing our project was figuring out how we wanted to detect C. albicans. We considered using either CRISPR/Cas9 or TALENS for specific detection of DNA. In the beginning we wanted to try both detection systems in parallel. However, after consulting literature one of our team members brought up that by using CRISPR/Cas9 as our detection system, we would be easily able to exchange the guide RNA to detect any pathogens with our system. We therefore decided to use CRISPR/Cas9 as our DNA detection system.
During our research into common fungal detection methods our supervisor pointed us to the UiOslo_Norway 2016 team, who played with the idea of linking CRISPR/Cas9 to a visible signal for DNA detection [B]. After further investigation we found that the Peking 2015 team employed a similar system using dCas9 and split luciferase [C]. Taking inspiration from these previous iGEM projects, we decided to use dCas9 coupled to split β-lactamase to detect specific C. albicans DNA sequences.  Since we are detecting C. albicans, we named our project Canditect.

The fantistic KcsA* channel protein can absorb K+ under the high concentration of K+ and allow the Na+ get though when the K+ concentration is low.
Extend the codon
The mutated channel protein includes a D-Ala, so we decided to generate a path to introduce a non-natrual amino acid into the protein expressing system[4].
We design a new path with tRNAD-Ala D-AlaRS Alr KcsA* .

Here are the parts we design:
Experiment
We will connect those part into psb1c3 and then introduce into the bacteria to express the protein.
After then ,we will test the ability of absorbing ions of bacteria.
We will extract the KcsA to test the function by Patch Clamp and a new method.
We will also extract the D-AlaRS to test the ability of specifically select D-Ala.

Construct Design
Composite part Plan A:
This construct is optimized for E.coli BL21, it constitutes our “Plan A” for our psychobiotic, which consists of producing the soluble form gp130 attached to novel signal peptides, which will allow the secretion of the sgp130 to the extracellular media. In order for our construct to work the IL-6 will bind to its receptor also known as gp80, these dimer will then bind to the  produced soluble sgp130 which will form a highly stable trimer that sequesters IL-6, effectively inhibiting IL-6 trans-signaling, the inflammatory signalization.
Both the IL-6 and the soluble form of the IL-6  receptor are present in the human body specifically in the gut, where our construct will work.  In general, soluble receptors for several cytokines have been detected in different body fluids, these are believed to help modulate cytokine response by binding the ligand and thereby reducing its bioavailability. Since the of soluble gp130 can act as an antagonist vs the cells with membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R) [1] , the Plan A strategy was developed as a first approach towards developing our psychobiotic.
The system contains  an inducible promoter that will be regulated by nitrosative stress. When this stress is present, the transcription of the soluble form of gp130 will be initiated.  Additionally, a inducible pBad promoter will be activated with arabinose in order to control the production of NsrR, the protein that blocks the transcription of the Pyear promoter, these will be a form to control the amount of nitrosative stress needed for the Pyear activation. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and M-Cherry will help us corroborate expression of both systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and M-Cherry to the PyeaR-sgp130 system. The sgp30 have a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it  for purification.

Tuesday
""Eureka"" day! First thing in the morning we checked the tubes stimulated overnight and there was aesthetically-pleasing GFP  expression in C1A (qualitative result).  Surprisingly, the ""control"" with GFP constituively expressed does not have a significant fluorescence. Also there is no difference between stimulation with oxidising potential and negative potential....might be that we stimulated it overnight, and not for 20 min as in the paper. Perhaps a redox coping mechanism counterbalances the oxidative force at the electrodes? Lunch in farmer's market. Webinar with Promega. Meeting at 5 with Rodrigo and then setting up a growth curve with C1A and controls for tomorrow's electrode in solution experiment, for more quantitative results.  Dry lab: It's important to prove that we can oxidise and reduce the solution. Sofar we still havend demonstrated it with color changes... we managed to do it however in agar... so perhaps diffusion is a problem ? It's time to escape from equilibrium.
Wednesday
No one is in the lab until 11, so we cannot start with the experiments. As soon as the lab doors opened, we checked the growth curve experiment, which are not summarised here but they are interesting.  Also we observed the plate containing C1A (bottom plate) and it is fluorescent. However, there is no patterning (yet). Josh is still sick. We performed other PCRs and gel extraction of C1A + degradation tags. We are meant to do Golden Gate but it's postponed for tomorrow. We prepared the sequencing primers for C2.  Lidia and Diellza went to VWR store to do some lab stuff shopping. Also we prepared more LB and water.  In the dry lab we thought about doing another electrode set up with the salt bridge. We had a group dynamics problem in the team between Yutong and Shivang. This was brought up during the 5 pm meeting and we discussed all together as a group. Hopefully it is solved now, or at least exposed to the group attention.
Thursday
In the moning we set up a new electrode stimulation experiment with both Pyo and FeCN. We also performed Golden Gate Assembly for the next constructs. We collected results from the plate reader experiment number 2 and they look good again (they weere replicates from yesterday and we got the same output). Tonight we are setting up a new plate reader experiment (a plate reader a day keeps the doctor away). After lunch we met with Francesca Ceroni and she was amazing to be honest"
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"TE. Based on fact that single domain have independent function[3], we assembled domains in some order to create new module of PKSs that can synthesize new polyketides[4]. We chose a part of PKSs of erythromycin and obtain its sequence DEBS1, DEBS2 and DEBS3 to begin our project[5][6]. We first standardized every domain from DEBS1 and TE domain from DEBS3, and then assembled the DEBS1+TE as its original sequence(figure1). At the same time, we exchanged the some domains with the same function to compare their efficiency. Further, the heterologous loading modules were selected to substitute AT-ACP which is the loading module of DEBS1 so as to produce different kinds of triketide lactones[7]. In order to fulfill Programmed Polykitide Synthesis (PPS), we try our best to establish the database which can provide the proposal and protocol for choosing the functional chassis and the standardized domains you need for synthesizing novel polyketides.
Figure1:We arrange the DEBS1 as its original sequence.
Functional Chassis
These biomolecules, polyketides, are synthesized from some simple build blocks compounds such as coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA[8]. The DEBS1+TE utilize propionic acid or propionate to start the synthesis of polyketides chain. To make sure the substrate of building block is enough to produce polyketides, we first deleted the prp operon that is responsible for propionate catabolism in E.coli BL21(DE3), so that the catabolism of propionate in BL21(DE3) was destroyed. In this way, the ability of DE3 to utilize propionate as a carbon and energy source was eliminated. The prp operon include prpRBCDE, but the prpE gene is thought to convert propionate into propionyl-CoA, so we just have to delete the prpRBCD[2]. After deleting prpRBCD, we engineered the pathway of (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis, which is the another building block of polyketides chain. The propionyl CoA carboxylase (pcc) genes from S. coelicolor which can synthesize the correct isomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, are transfered into the BL21[5].  Besides, domain ACP requires the gene sfp to transfer the"

It has been proved that LuxR has evolutionary conservation in many gram-negative bacteria, which enables E. coli to receive AHL from other bacteria. Thus we engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentailly amplified results.
To achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters. And in Bacteria II, LuxR will be directly expressed regulated by lac operon, triggered by IPTG. With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be consitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex will intiate the expression of required genes.
Second Level Amplification Module
In addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.
In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from λ phage. Since cI is a highly effcient repressor that is a low concentration of cI will completely repress the effiency of λ promoter. As a result, EGFP will be drastically and negatively regulated when treated with antibiotic substances.
It is notable that this second level amplication module won't directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients. Our theoratical modeling also illustrate a higher resolution implementing this amplification circuit.
Integrative Modification on Bacterial Permeability
Our ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic amplication, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin. Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.
Porin: OprF from Pseudomonus aeruginosa Porins are beta barrel proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able to diffuse.
In E. coli different porins, for example OmpF and OmpC is expressed endogenously in different situations for different molecules. But these natural occurring porines are only permeable for molecules like sugars smaller than 600 Da. And more importantly, implement of micF, an"

After confirming the vector, Mer TPBA sample was digested to release the insert (~3197 base pairs) and other digestion was performed on a random sample, to obtain the vector at equal length as the one cited before. The samples were purified, linked and transformed; the transforming clones were selected, inoculated and the plasmids were extracted and digested, to confirm the cloned construction.

CMer R construction with constitutive promoters
For this one, we chose a biobrick containing promoter J23100 from Anderson Promoters catalogue (Berkeley University, 2006). Beyond this promoter, other one was utilized, with average expression, I14033 (Penn State University). These promoters were transformed and the clones were selected and inoculated to, later, be extracted and digested in test. After confirming, a new digesting reaction was performed with bigger volume of sample for purification. Alongside this sample, MerR was digested with greater volume as well, to release the insert, while promoters were linearized, along with its plasmidial vectors.
Constitutive promoter construction + Mer R + regulated promoter + RFP
This construction used the previous one and a part from the laboratory parts bank. This laboratory part contained a regulated promoter with strong expression and RFP sequence (Red Fluorescent Protein – Bba_E1010), which already were in pSB1C3. This sequence was digested in test to proof the insert. Next to confirming, Mer R samples with constitutive promoter were digested alongside regulated promoter sample (BBa_K2123104 or PJK26) with RFP. Samples were purified, linked, transformed and the clones were selected, digested in test and, alongside the confirmed insert, the test kept going.
Mer R construction (containing constitutive promoter) with regulated promoters in RFP;
The already purified Mer R samples were stored and new regulated promoters (besides PJK26) were used. The promoters were BBa_K2123101 (TacMer3) and BBa_K2123102 (TacMer2), which were already linked to RFP. These promoters were linearized upstream and purified, for further linking in the already purified Mer R. After the linking, the sample was transformed  and the clones were selected, extracted and digested to confirm the samples.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment works in North West England run by United Utilities . Sara Lyons, the technical officer in Davyhulme, led us on a tour around the treatment plant. From the tour, we were introduced to the basic process of water treatment and the different stages that the water have to go through, from separation of sludge to water treatment through biological means.
Throughout the tour, we gained a lot of insight and information that we would not have known otherwise. In Davyhulme and other water treatment plants, the system works 24/7 every single day and there will always be workers in the site regardless of time. We realized that a lot of energy must have been used up by the plant every single day. We noticed that Davyhulme had solar panels to try and reduce the energy cost. In addition, the treated water were checked with a microscope in the laboratory each day to ensure that there are no abnormalities or foreign microorganisms present in the processed water.
Although we did not have time to visit the sludge process, we were told that sludge from the treatment is processed and converted to fertilizers which are given away for free to farmers. This was an interesting point because we also thought about harvesting our phosphate accumulating bacteria and to sell the phosphate as fertilizers to reduce cost. We learned from Davyhulme that the fertilizers are given away for free because they have no use for it and eventually would have to get rid of them. We were told that it was much cheaper for them to give them for free than to throw them away in a landfill or store them somewhere else.
We also discussed our project with Sara and talked about its possible implementation at Davyhulme. Sara suggested to think about other ways our project can be used outside of the treatment plant. She explained to us how most of the phosphate usually originates from detergents and perhaps it might be more feasible if we can reduce the phosphate levels of the wastewater before it reaches the treatment plant and before it gets mixed up by other wastes. We discussed this with the rest of the team and thought about doing some experiments to test the viability of this idea. Check out our experimental page to see what we did!
In addition, we also learned that Davyhulme does not treat phosphate in the facility. We asked Sara whether it would be possible for us to obtain phosphate level data from Davyhulme in the last 12 months. We figured that the phosphate level in Davyhulme will be a reflection on the phosphate level we can expect in wastewater. After asking for permission to the people in charge, Sara was able to send us the data"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Recombinant Expression#5 August 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," to previous 9-mer expression. This might have been because IPTG was added 3 hours after initial incubation whereas IPTG was added 4 hours after initial incubation for 9-mer cells. This hour would be significant since E-coli population doubles every 20 minutes. A cell pellet was not seen possibly because the cells were still pretty dilute in the LB growth medium, and the 1mL sample was extracted near the surface of the liquid. (Although a shaking incubator vigorously shakes the entire contents of the flask, a higher concentration of cells would most likely be found near the bottom of the flask.) Also, it's possible that a 12-mer protein, which by definition is three monomer units longer than a 9-mer, requires more time for the cells to assemble and replicate. We will consult the Silk Genetics team on this, and it will be interesting to see if these observations reappear when preparing the 15-mer proteins next week."
