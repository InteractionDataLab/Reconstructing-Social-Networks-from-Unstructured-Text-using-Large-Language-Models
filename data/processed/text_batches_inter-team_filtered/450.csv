SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," engineering department section chief of hospital products division of Sichuan Nigale Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Nigale has extensive experience in design and production of devices related to dialysis equip, so we consulted Mr. Li Fei about the design, patent application, the later production promotion of our device.
We firstly introduced our project and the device in our project to Mr. Li Fei, and asked him for advice. He thought our idea and design is outstanding, but we should pay close attention to quality and security of our device. Because security is of critical importance, and the performance could be improved in the process of using. We posed a question that how to deal with problems could happen in the hemodialysis pipelines, such as infection, Mr. Li emphasized that the quality and the matching of products is the factor that should be consider primarily. Then we asked Mr. Li what we should take care while we were to apply for patent, He told us that the patent includes two kinds, one is patent of the method, one is patent of the device, the former is invisible while the later is tangible. We can try both parallel. Although the later can not get results quickly, as long as this method is feasible, patent of it can be applied firstly. The others could apply for another patent by changing something on the basis of our original design, which means the value of patent of device is limited. The method, nevertheless, is constant, and the application of patent of it could be better. At last, we asked Mr. Li if he had some suggestion for the promotion and going into market of our product. He pointed out that dialysis consumables are in great demand in China, and if our project is mature enough and possesses investment value, there must be companies purchasing our patent and putting the product into market. He thought our product has market potential.
Through the communication with Mr. Li, we got his affirmation of our device, and we also got suggestion that we should focus on the quality and matching problems of the device, and we should improve our device by miniaturization and ensuring safety. In addition, we learned about detailed methods, domestic status, laws and regulations, and strategies related to our later application for patent and promotion of product. Mr. Li answered our questions seriously and discussed with us on our doubts, which benefited us a lot.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#Knockout_-_-_TEXT.html,"2: Plates of germination mutants. Plates contained heated (to kill vegetative cells and leave only spores to germinate) cultures and unheated (where colonies may come from germinated spores and the vegetative cells) cultures. The mutant spo0A::tet is unable to form spores, and should therefore show no germination (our negative control). The mistake of photographing empty plates against a background of spots was realized after plates had been discarded. Presence of colonies is noted below, for clarity. Mutants used were:
W168: Wild-type 168; Heated plate: colonies present; Unheated plate: colonies present
spo0A::tet: A sporulation-deficient strain; Heated plate: no colonies; Unheated plate: colonies present
B42: cwlD::kan, cwlJ::spec, gerD::cm; Heated plate: colonies present; Unheated plate: colonies present
B47: gerD::cm, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec, cwlD::kan; Heated plate: no colonies; Unheated plate: colonies present
The table below shows the maximum number of spores from heated cultures plated which yielded zero colonies. In the case of B30, the germination assay was performed only once, and as visible in Fig. 2, contained viable, germinable spores. The numbers shown here are the highest number of spores plated, excluding B30. This means that we do not have data for higher concentrations of spores which would suggest any spore germinability. The mutant strain B42 contained germinable spores when 4x107 were plated, but contrarily, zero germinable spores were found when 9.83x107 spores were plated in another round of the germination assay.

Finally, our project would consist of testing for the binding affinity of the spores on the cellulose before we could construct our bioHYDRAs. To do so, we used the cellulose binding affinity protocol that the 2015 Edinburgh team sent us in light of our collaboration.
Data and Results
Our results show promising initial results for future teams to expand on this project.

Vid. 1 HYDRA from 50% humidity to ~0% humidity (in the desiccator)
Recreating HYDRA: We were able to successfully create HYDRA by expanding on the work of Chen et al. . This was done as a proof of concept that this technology works and can be easily reproduced in a small lab setting. We constructed full lengths HYDRAs as described in Chen et al. [1].
Fig. 4. above shows our first functional HYDRA. On the left is a video of the HYDRA in action.
BioHYDRA: We were able to successfully create the fusion protein cotZ-aeBLUE-CIPA in E. coli . This construct was ligated into the pSBbs1C backbone ( BBa_K823023 ). We then transformed E. coli to grow our plasmid. We are excited to have been able to use our newly developed CRATER technique to better select for our plasmid when transforming, which accelerated our project substantially. By running the plasmid through a gel and by sequencing, we were able to confirm that we had the right size (8 kb) and sequence for the plasmid.
We then transformed our construct into B. Subtilis. This was our main setback for this project, as many protocols did not seem to function. We believe that our 8 kb construct was very large and thus was hard to transform. After trying Xylose competence induced cells and electroporation, we decided to use the LMU Munich's MNGE transformation protocol. by picking certain colonies and undergoing colony PCR, we found that certain colonies seem to contain our part, which was confirmed by sequencing. Below is some data showing differential absorption between"

Tsinghua,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html,"Esophageal cancer (ICD - 10: C15) is a common cancer in China. According to the international agency for research on cancer in 2008, the world cancer incidence and death report (Globocan 2008) estimated that 481600 cases of esophageal cancer in the world, China's 259200 cases, accounting for 53.82% of the world, global 406500 cases died during this period, the China of 211100 cases (51.92%).
In China, around the Taihang mountain area of Henan, Hebei and Shanxi provinces border region, especially in Linzhou, Anyang, and Huixian, esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates are the highest in the world, high and low rates area arranged in concentric circles, only hundreds kilometers apart. This phenomenon is prompt environmental factors play an important role in esophageal cancer occurs. The lack of nutrient elements [vitamins such as riboflavin, etc.) and trace elements (such as zinc, etc.)] , nitrite, virus (HPV) and some toxins (such as mycotoxin) is considered to be important risk factors of the disease.
Diagnosis and Treatment
Preventive Tips
1. Eat less hot or irritant food, such as hot pot, pepper, etc. Long-term consumption of such food will result in esophageal mucosa injury.  If the stimulation last for some time, it may cause inflammation of the esophagus and esophageal cancer.
2. You must be chewed before swallowing the food and eat slowly so that food will be better digested, the poisonous substance will be neutralized and bacteria will be killed.
3. Maintain comprehensive nutrition intake, to prevent malnutrition. Because if we often avoid certain food, our human nutrition won’t reach the standard. Esophageal cancer maybe occur after the lack of protein and vitamin A, B.
4. Prevent carcinogens. While carcinogenic substances mainly nitrite, a lot of food contain this kind of material, such as vegetables or meat after curing, leftovers that remain overnight and  salt will generate into nitrite at high temperature. In addition, such as mildew grain, corn, peanuts contain large amounts of yellow aspergillus. Eating many moldy food will be very easy to cause the esophageal cancer.
In addition to developing healthy eating habits, we should be patient with poor swallowing or foreign body sensation and do gastroscopy as early as possible in order to find early esophageal cancer or precancerous lesions. Remember"

During the first rounds of evolution, the enzyme suffers from poor conversion rate, which may lead to a total elimination of the library. Even though enzyme activity is expected to increase in the next few rounds, intercellular D-psicose concentration could still be no match for the extracellular IPTG level. In all, a tuning mechanism is necessary.
Coupling Circuit
The Tl-Cp cassette is the solution. The Tl-Cp cassette includes a series of 4 basic parts which are homologous but differs quantitatively. Questions that this cassette tackles with are the most crucial ones underlying directed evolution and as well as synthetic biology itself: How to match the input and output of cascades of regulatory elements and how to determine the level of final yield, in this case, of the antibiotic resistance proteins.
The design of Tl-Cp cassette takes advantage of the helicase activity of ribosome. When ribosome approaches the end of upstream CDS, it will unwind the hairpin structure between two CDS and make the downstream RBS available. The length of this hairpin structure corresponds to the optimized distance that a ribosome can unwind.
From the mechanisms above and previous researches (Mendez-Perez, 2012), we can presume with more confidence that through such hairpin structure, the downstream translational level is quantitatively associated with the upstream (which is actually driven by its own RBS).
Evolving Circuit
Evolving Circuit summarizes all regulatory mechanisms used above and acts to quantitatively convert different productivities of DTE to a spectrum of growth rates. Utilizing the characterization from Selecting and Coupling circuits, we achieved the suitable antibiotic concentration to exert growth pressure in evolution.

IIT Delhi  had  sent  three representatives  of  their  team,   while two of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During   the  first  day  (16th  July),  there  was  an  informal  discussion  session  amongst  all  the  teams,   followed  by  IISER  Pune’s  project  presentation  in  the  afternoon.  While  the  second  day  (17th   July)  had  the  presentations  of  our  team  (in  the  morning)  and  IIT  Delhi’s  presentation  in  the   afternoon. IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in   awe,  and  in  a  way  left  the  other  teams  with  no  choice  but  to  further  improvise  their   presentations. All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive   presentation, which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer   simulation based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work,   and had it divided into three sub­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet­lab work.   While  IISER  Pune  wishes  to  compete  in  the  Health  and  Medicine  track  of  iGEM,  IIT  Delhi   wishes to compete in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation   of  their  idea,  which  was  appreciated  by  the  audience.  After  each  of  the  team  presentations   (which  typically  lasted  about  an  hour),  there  were  question­answer  sessions  held,  where  the   clarity and idea of each of the teams’ projects were scrutinized. Very  useful  suggestions  and  points  were  raised  for  each  of  the  teams  post  their   presentations,  and  all  the  discussions  (both  formal  and  informal)  were  very  productive  and   propitious  for  the  teams,  in  general.

The 3’ UTR is always involved in stability, so if our PUF binds on the loop it would be more susceptible to the nuclease. Cara’s phat project - Buy resveratrol and a cytochrome P450 (several have been found, a human one and a mutant Bacillus one. However the Bacillus one may not be available for purchase online.) Sigma Aldrich is our potential vendor. - Resveratrol ranges in price and available styles (approx $100 for 100 mg, approx $300 for 500 mg) - The goal is to create mutant piceatannols. So we mutate the cytochrome P450 to see if we can get mutant piceatannols. - It’s hard to work with cytochrome P450 in the prokaryotic system because it’s made to work in eukaryotes. That’s why we can the bacillus cytochrome. - Three available ways to make mutant enzymes: site specific mutagenesis by a company, arichrome PCR, chemical mutagenesis - Overall idea for a lab plan: We put the mutated cytochrome in the e. coli and feed it resveratrol. We get a chip that binds to the insulin receptor and see what has binded to our chip to see what is happening. - Is this too ambitious? Or is it totally possible? There are conflicting opinions. - Biggest problem is the low solubility. So all of the assays and screenings are not easy. - Our ideal mutant would be more soluble, because then it would avoid degradation is the bloodstream. This random mutagenesis is a bit of a game of luck. How many mutations do we need to go through before we find something good? How many residues are there? - If we have directed group addition or the making of derivatives, it might be better and faster and potentially yield better results for our mutated piceatannols. - Feedback inhibition occurs when resveratrol and piceatannol inhibit the cytochrome that creates the mutants. - The painful part is where we need to evaluate each clone by an individual assay. Is there a way to create a florescence detection method? This is much easier. That way if the chemical is modified we see a color. Then we can do a ton of wells and only examine the wells that have changed color. - What is our desired endpoint? We don’t know what our final product A is. We’re just looking for the best"

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"
Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to produce the substances whose genetic code we inserted into the genome in the outside world.     Besides to this face-to-face work outside we also investigated what impact our project could have on environment and society. The most important questions to us were:
Where and how could our project be used in the future?
What changes are necessary to provide this?
Where and how could our project be misused?
What can we do to prevent this?
Due to the fact that our project is assigned to basic research and can therefore not be directly transferred to daily use, it is hard to clearly answer those questions from today’s point of view.  We imagine both of our projects being used to produce several substances in industrial standards e.g. pharmaceuticals, food additives or other biotechnically fabricated materials – preferably faster and/or cheaper as before.  LLPS is the more promising approach because it is less synthesizing and cloning (time saving) and already proven to work in HeLa cells, E. coli and now in yeast[1][2].
To achieve this additional changes in the project design are needed, that link the enzymes involved in the substance’s pathway either to the droplet causing protein Ddx4 (LLPS) or to a therefor specifically designed sgRNA (for further information see our Vision ).
If our project, that until now mostly consists of an idea, could be misused is hard to say. It depends on what someone is making out of it. Out of our own experiences with the project we can confirm, that it is not (yet) possible to secretly produce tons of harmful substances in a short time with our approach. A patent might help to keep control on what is happening with our idea, once adjusted to industrial standards.

Vitamin A overdose, also known as Hypervitaminosis A, can cause birth defects, liver problems, osteoporosis, coarse bone growths, skin discoloration, hair loss, and other adverse effects. Prevention of these effects is as simple as quantitatively determining the efficiency of the enzymatic pathway in yeast and making sure that only the correct amount of GMO yeast is used in consumer products. Additionally, intermediates in the pathway must be tested for toxicity in case increased B-Carotene production also leads to the production of harmful chemical byproducts.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The local EHS division is very active on the Washington University campus. Before we began lab work, the entire team completed an EHS training course in order to proactively encourage safety in the lab. Our project was approved by the biology department which is held accountable directly to the EHS representative.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
When dealing with lab safety, one can never be too careful. Every lab should have well-established protocols for working with every chemical in the lab and every technique. If a researcher is ever unsure of the PPE required for a certain technique or chemical, always ask someone and do not perform the procedure until one is sure of the risks and precautions that must be taken. Safety is an aspect of laboratory research that must never be neglected.

A: We have now contacted Dr. Bohlmann and Dr. Rosado to meet with them to ask more questions about our project. We are also meeting with a graduate student of Dr. Bally, Kent, tomorrow at the Cancer Agency.
YANAL MURAD
Senior Scientist at ViroGin Biotech.
A: We contacted Dr. Murad for an interview because we were hoping to learn about the drug development process and what is involved in communicating science to investors. His work involves developing novel therapeutics for cancer treatment so were were anticipating that this would give us insights into potential directions to take our project in the future. We are trying to produce Kaempferol, a compound with observed anti-cancer effects. Consequently, we were curious about what would be required to further develop this compound as a cancer therapeutic.
R: Dr. Murad gave us a lot of useful information about the general process of bringing oncological therapeutics to market. He did not go into detail about our specific compound but did give us a very good general testing/development pipeline that most compounds would follow while being brought to market. He also gave us good general advice about science communication. This interview helped us understand the bigger picture of drug development beyond simple proof-of-concept tests.
E: To start, Dr. Murad led us through a simplified drug development approach. He recommended looking up the patent landscape to see whether an idea is legally feasible. Next, he advised researching who is working on similar ideas. If an idea were popular or unheard of it probably would have a low chance of success. The ideal situation would be to find a niche that’s unique but not too competitive or unheard-of. If no one else is working on similar ideas, that may because their initial investigations were unsuccessful and unpublished. Following this, he recommended looking through the literature for how easy the compound is to work with and whether it is water-soluble or fat-soluble. These details would affect your plan for the drug’s delivery. With this background information, the next step would be to perform in vitro experiments on a large number of cell lines including toxicity assays. This would allow you to identify the most promising ones and proceed with them in xenograft animal models. In this set of experiments, you would test the efficacy, toxicity, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and organ function of treated animals. At this point, if all previous steps had been successful, you would apply to make your compound an investigational new drug in the regional body of your country of interest."

There is no doubt that iGEM needs a communication platform to share our idea, ask for and receive help. Though we have Meetup, iGEM CC, Facebook and Twitter, indeed, these platforms fail to became popular.
 
We are committed to build an open and easy-to-access platform, on which iGEMers can share their information and exchange resource conveniently within the shortest time.
 
Based on this suggestion, iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and we cofounded an information exchange platform named Newsletter on July 28. As a biweekly electronic journal, it is in PDF format and free for readers. Till now 34 teams from Asia and Europe have participated. In general this electronic newsletter includes two major parts: project update and the introduction of team members. We sincerely hope that through this platform, every team will have a better access to share information and progress, gain feedbacks and favors on their own projects from their peers and even get to know some young promising synthetic biologists. In addition, there are also going to be special issues publishing with interviews of iGEM alumni and advisors from part of college teams in competition.
On this platform, iGEM teams from all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. In addition, special issue offers access to peripheral issue, such as interviews to teams and experts, case analysis, experience in team construction and popularization of synthetic biology. We excavate the quintessence of the past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," are people with burn wounds. In the Netherlands, the number of patients hospitalized with severe burns is approximately 650 annually, but many more suffer from smaller burns. During our visit to the largest burn wound center in the Netherlands, we learned that sterile burn wounds do not exist. Treatment is thus about maintaining bacterial levels within an acceptable range. Burn wounds are in that respect comparable in terms of risk with the chronic wounds discussed above. Both wound types are most commonly infected with Staphylococcus aureus. For burn wounds, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comes second, whereas Streptococci and Pseudomonas are both commonly found on diabetic wounds according to the medical professionals we talked to.
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus was unanimously mentioned by our stakeholders as the most problematic bacterial strain to remove from wounds. S. aureus is even found on over 90% of the chronic venous ulcers, which is the most common type of chronic ulcers (8). The exact numbers differ per country. S. aureus is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics (5). The most well-known antibiotic-resistant type of S. aureus is methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which has been emerging since the 1960s. In the United States, MRSA causes  approximately 11,000 deaths annually, which is more than HIV/AIDS, emphysema, Parkinson’s disease, and homicide combined (9,10). The Netherlands have been more successful at preventing MRSA dissemination, but MRSA still occurs (11). Furthermore, other antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus are encountered, such as vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (9). Multi-resistant strains are also becoming a common phenomenon (12). Dr. Dokter from the Maasstad Hospital additionally emphasized that he increasingly encounters toxin-producing and resistant strains of S. aureus, which are more aggressive than ‘regular’ strains.
Current treatments
Figure 1. A skin wound with different treatment approaches: antibiotics delivered locally from a cream or systemically from the blood.
Unfortunately, the treatment of diabetic wounds as well as burn wounds is hampered by the mentioned surge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Additional to the rise of resistance is the problem that pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotics research over the past decades. From an economical perspective, it is not interesting for them (13). As the discovery of new antibiotics has drastically slowed down since the 1980s, new types of antibiotics cannot be expected to overcome this problem (10).

Original Part: BBa_K1189019
The Calgary 2013 iGEM team used the human ferritin wild type ( BBa_K1189019 ) as reporter protein on a test strip. They expressed the human ferritin heavy and light chain heterologous using Escherichis coli.  In the cells, the ferritin produced its characteristic iron core. With the help of fenton chemistry they were able to dye the iron core by producing the prussian blue iron complex. Beside the function as reporter, the team mentioned the capability of ferritin to produce nanoparticles with other metal ions.
Figure 1: Ferritin is suitable for metal recycling, since it can form e.g. iron, silver and gold nanoparticles in its cavity.
This capability of human ferritin to bind different metal ions makes it suitable for the recycling of different valuable metal ions (Figure 1) (Ensign et al., 2004; Domínguez-Vera et al., 2007). When nanoparticles are formed inside the ferritin, they have the advantage that they are easily soluble in water due to the protein shell. Furthermore, the maximal inner diameter of 8nm causes a size restriction of the nanoparticles inside the human ferritin (Butts et al., 2008). This restriction is desirable for various applications (Castro et al., 2014). The wild type ferritin has reactive amino acids on the outside and inside of the protein shell, causing nanoparticle synthesis at both surfaces. An optimization of the wild type human ferritin can therefore favor a unified production of different nanoparticles (Butts et al., 2008).

To improve the ferritins capability to direct metal ions to its inside and to increase its ability to form gold and silver nanoparticles, we constructed"

The ratio of mRNA which is translated into proteins to whole mRNA with toehold switch (the rate of mRNA whose hairpin structure around RBS is broken by triggerRNA) is proportional to the following formula including the Hill equation. $$[\mathrm{triggerRNA}]/(K’’ + [\mathrm{triggerRNA}])$$ $K’’$ means the dissociation constant between triggerRNA and hairpin structure around RBS. The decomposition rate of a certain substance whose half-life is HL is log2/HL. Here, we assume that the maturation rate of a certain fluorescent protein is proportional to the concentration of it. The proportionality constant of maturation rate of a certain fluorescent protein whose maturation time is MT is log2/MT, on the analogy of decomposition rate. We represented the activation of Pnrd which is the key of this circuit as a short pulse wave occurring once a cell cycle. Without considering activation of Pnrd in detail, we represented it as the change of way to express of triggerRNA. Paying attention to these policies, we expressed the behavior of genetic circuit by 26 nonlinear differential equations below.
$$\frac{d[\sigma_A]}{dt}= \alpha \cdot\left(R_A+\frac{R_{td,A}\cdot [\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}{K^{\prime\prime}+[\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}\right)-\frac{\ln2}{\mathrm{HL}_{\sigma_A}}\cdot[\sigma_A]$$ $$\frac{d[\sigma_B]}{dt}= \alpha\cdot \left(R_B+\frac{R_{td,B}\cdot [\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}{K^{\prime\prime}+[\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}\right)-\frac{\ln2}{\mathrm{HL}_{\sigma_B}}\cdot[\sigma_B]$$ $$\frac{d[\sigma_C]}{dt}= \alpha\cdot \left(R_C+\frac{R_{td,C}\cdot [\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}{K^{\prime\prime}+[\mathrm{triggerRNA}]}\right)-\frac{\ln2}{\mathrm{HL}_{\sigma_C}}"

USTC-Software,2011,Team:USTC-Software#tech&algo_-_-_TEXT.html," annealing (SA) is a generic probabilistic metaheuristic for the global optimization problem of locating a good approximation to the global optimum of a given function in a large search space. It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities).  For certain problems, simulated annealing may be more efficient than exhaustive enumeration — provided that the goal is merely to find an acceptably good solution in a fixed amount of time, rather than the best possible solution.
Principle of the algorithm
In the simulated annealing (SA) method, each point s of the search space is analogous to a state of some physical system, and the function E(s) to be minimized is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state.  The goal is to bring the system, from an arbitrary initial state, to a state with the minimum possible energy.
Steps
At each step, the SA heuristic considers some neighbouring state s' of the current state s, and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s' or staying in state s. These probabilities ultimately lead the system to move to states of lower energy.  Typically this step is repeated until the system reaches a state that is good enough for the application, or until a given computation budget has been exhausted.
State transition
The neighbours of a state are new states of the problem that are produced after altering the given state in some particular way. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, each state is typically defined as a particular permutation of the cities to be visited. The neighbours of some particular permutation are the permutations that are produced for example by interchanging a pair of adjacent cities.  The action taken to alter the solution in order to find neighbouring solutions is called ""move"" and different ""moves"" give different neighbours. These moves usually result in minimal alterations of the solution, as the previous example depicts, in order to help an algorithm to optimize the solution to the maximum extent and also to retain the already optimum parts of the solution and affect only the suboptimum parts.  In the previous example, the parts of the solution are the parts of the tour.
Probability function of the state transition
The probability of making the transition from the current state s to a candidate new state s' is specified by an acceptance probability function P(e,e',T), that depends on the energies e = E(s) and e' = E(s') of the two states, and on a global time-varying parameter T called the temperature. States with a smaller energy are better than those with a greater energy. The probability function P"

Abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that worked with riboregulators
The usage of the riboregulator system can be versatile; Different teams utilized the system in different ways. In general, introducing the riboregulator system to a certain circuit allows another level regulation. The new level of regulation then can give possible outcomes such as: specific interaction/communication (UC Berkeley 2006/ Caltech 2007); minimization of leakage by introducing post-transcriptional repression (Calgary 2007); and modulation of different concentrations of desired outcome (K.U. Leuven 2009).
One drawback of riboregulator system in the context of iGEM is that teams that originally have riboregulator incorporated in their systems drop the use of riboregulator of because of time restraint (Calgary 2007). This is because when riboregulators are used to introduce another level of regulation, it becomes a supplementary part of the project; Usually, even without the extra level of regulation, the teams can prove the functionality of their systems. Therefore when the time is limited, and when the teams prioritize the things they need to do, they end up dropping the riboregulator system.

Abstract: “Networks of interacting cells provide the basis for neural learning. We have developed the process of addressable conjugation for communication within a network of E. coli bacteria. Here, bacteria send messages to one another via conjugation of plasmid DNAs, but the message is only meaningful to cells with a matching address sequence. In this way, the Watson Crick base-pairing of addressing sequences replaces the spatial connectivity present in neural systems. To construct this system, we have adapted natural conjugation systems as the communication device. Information contained in the transferred plasmids is only accessible by ""unlocking"" the message using RNA based 'keys'. The resulting addressable conjugation process is being adapted to construct a network of NAND logic gates in bacterial cultures. Ultimately, this will allow us"

KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven#Model#Filter_-_-_TEXT.html," of the ribokey compared to the lifetime of the T7-protein, guarantees that the AND-GATE always works perfectly fine: when there's no more input, the ribokey will rapidly decrease (and disappear) and makes sure that the AND-GATE is not activated anymore, even when the T7-protein is slowly decreasing.
2. Filtering in practice
In the simulation three kinds of inputpulses have been used:
First pulse: 300s
small peak of lactonase
no influence on the timer
Second pulse: 1000s
medium peak of lactonase
influences the timer by levelling the timing capabilities, but it doesn't reset the timer
Third pulse: 5000s
huge peak of lactonase
reset of the timer: amount of complex goes to zero
3. Proof of filtering capacities
As proof of the filtering capacities, we'll compare the maximum amount of GFP with the maximum amount of Lactonase as a function of the pulse length of TetR. We've chosen Lactonase and GFP because they differ only in the absence or presence of the filter, all other parameters are identical (eg. degradation rate). The model used here consists only of the filter, the output and the lactonase productions subsystems.
The left figures shows us a clear difference between the amount of GFP and lactonase for almost every pulse length. The explanation for the (almost constant) big difference for pulses longer than 1000 seconds is the following. For such long pulses, the filter can be considered as fully active, such that the only differences between the output and the lactonase production are characteristics of the ribokey/lock and the difference in transcription rates between E. coli's RNA polymerase II and phage T7's polymerase.  For a pulse shorter than 1000 seconds the filter is not fully active. This creates a filtering effect. If we just look at the first 1000 seconds (right figures), we see that the amount of Lactonase remains more or less the same while the amount of GFP increases very fast.
Another way to see the filtering effect is to look at the ratio of GFP to Lactonase. This figure clearly shows the disproportionality between GFP and lactonase for the pulses shorter than 1000 seconds. The best filtering effect occurs for pulses around 100 seconds. This figure also shows that placing the filter in front of a signal wil lower this signal with a factor of at least 25 (full throughput in the filter). This base factor should be multiplied by"

BBa_K1913025 and BBa_K1913026 are FixK2/plac hybrid promoters, which were functionally validated in combination with a light sensor generator( BBa_K1913034 ).
Considered safety in our project by implementing a optogenetic kill switch system and a synthetic amino acid system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. By implementing these systems, we will reduce the environmental impact of BeeT.
Collaborated with the TU Delft and Groningen iGEM teams.
As human practice activities, we discussed our project application scenario with Synenergene and we wrote a future scenario involving BeeT application in collaboration with them. We also organized the national Dutch iGEM conference with other iGEM teams to share our experiences.
Gold Medal Requirements:
Improved and verify several previous parts:
We improved the characterization of BBa_K546000 , a quorum sensing composite part that we tested together with BBa_K1913005 , resulting in these fluorescence graphs .
Based on the original FixK2 promoter ( BBa_K592006 made by Uppsala-Sweden_2011), we designed and provided new FixK2 promoters by adding a core control element and operons to the canonical FixJ binding sites, making them controllable by different input signals.
Integrated Human Practices:
We consulted several stakeholders and specialists such as beekeepers from the Dutch Beekeeper association and researchers from Wageningen University to get suggestions in order to make our BeeT product more feasible and acceptable. According to their suggestions, our product should fit with the hobbyist character of beekeeping and never affect honey production. We amended our project design following their suggestions. In addition, we collaborated with Design Academy Eindhoven to design a tea bag-like product that beekeepers can easily apply.
Demonstrate:
We demonstrated some of BeeT's functionalities in conditions which simulate its real-life application.

What are the Oil Sands?
The Oil Sands
The Canadian oil sands  are the second largest proven crude reserves in the world and continue to be developed to meet  the energy demands of North America.  The IEA lists the proven reserves of the Athabasca oils sands contain more than 170 billion barrels. However, the processing of oil sands is much more energy and resource intensive than traditional extraction methods. The sands are a heavy mixture of rock, metals, organic material, and a very viscous form of petroleum known as bitumen. Bitumen must be separated out and heavily processed using steam, heat, and mechanical methods. This presents a major challenge to engineers to produce this resource on a large commercial scale in a responsible and sustainable way.

Summary:
Through their RT-PCR expertise, NTU Singapore aided us in gaining a better understanding of the transcription rates within our composite Hydrogen Gas Producing Gene Cluster plasmid.
Our efforts have successfully purified their dCas9 mutants and suggest that all are functional in vitro. This has provided in vitro evidence for the NTU Singapore team that these four mutants are no longer functional nucleases, but retained their ability to bind the gRNA and targeted gene sequence.
Purification of dCas9 mutants
The plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli and expressed under auto-induction conditions. Cells were then harvested, lysed and purified using a Ni-NTA resin with standard His-tag purification protocols. Eluates were then ran on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). The largest band in each of the eluates corresponds to the various dCas9 mutants with its respective truncations based on NTU’s design, suggested that the expression and purification procedure was performing well.
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE gel of the His-tagged dCas9 constructs. Lane 1 contains a 198kDa ladder. The cell lysates and the corresponding eluates were loaded next to each other. Intact dCas9 proteins can be identified as the slowest migrating protein band in all the 4 constructs as the band with the highest intensity, showing a successful expression and purification of the His-tagged proteins. The 2 other bands could be observed in each of the eluate (and also observed in the previous year in Cas9 mutants) were suggested to be cleavage products during the protein synthesis.
In vitro CRISPR assay + EMSA
To test the dCas9 constructs, we adapted our in vitro CRISPR assay from the previous year to include in electrophoretic migration shift assay. As the dCas9 constructs were designed to not have nuclease activity, while retaining the ability to bind to the gRNA and target DNA, we set up variations of the in vitro CRISPR assay to track the progression of the target DNA, gRNA, cleavage products, and protein migration on a DNA retardation gel (6% acrylamide in TBE, ThermoFisher Scientific), while comparing to a commercial Cas9 with nuclease activity.
The four purified samples were subjected to three treatments (Figure 2, 3 consecutive lanes within the green lines for each sample):

IDEA & DESIGN
Host cell selection
After literature research, we found that yeast was widely used in aging research for the                         following reasons:
● It has the process of apoptosis, which can accumulate ROS.
Like mammalian cells, yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) undergoing apoptosis                             show                             characteristic markers such as DNA cleavage, apoptosis-typical chromatin condensation,                             externalization of phosphatidylserine, ROS accumulation, and Cytochrome C release                             from                             mitochondria.[1][2][3]
● As unicellular organism and an excellent model of genetics, yeast is useful for oxidation                             research.[4]
● It has a short growth cycle and relatively simple culture conditions. The protocols of                             yeast are mature, too.
Thus, S. cerevisiae constitutes an interesting model for studies of the oxidation process,                         which makes possible experimentation not easily available in higher eukaryotes.
Therefore, we choose it as our host cell. [5]
Regulator
ROS accumulation
As mentioned before, we need to keep yeast under the stress of oxidation.                                 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), known as free radicals, play a key role in the aging and disease by creating vascular oxidative stress. Particularly, ROS account for more than 95% of the total free radicals in the human body. In hence we simulated cell oxidation                         state through accumulate ROS to finish the test work. As we mentioned in Background part , ROS are mainly divided into                         four categories: hydrogen                         peroxide(H2O2), superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl                         radicals(OH-), and single-line oxygen(1[O2]).
Fig. 1 Here shows the mutual conversion relationship between ROS.
All of them are eventually transformed into hydrogen peroxide, in that case we simplify our                         work to accumulate hydrogen peroxide.

What are human practices? Why do we need to do them? Human practices are doing reaching out activites and incorporating ethics, sustainability, education and more. Human practices mean make connections with the community so that we can accomplish our project from many dimensions. Our team thinks education and public engagement is one of the most important activities we should do. In Japan, students only learn basic parts of biology if they don’t want to learn more. Even in some university’s medi cal faculty enter exams, students can choose using chemistry and physics over biology. We feel that not many people are studying biology. So we wanted children to know what is biology and what possibilities biology can have.
＜Education＞
We have been working on to spread out how important and interesting the biology and science are.We tried to make connections with local people who have not studied biology in details yet; mainly children in primary school and middle school.
On November 20th and 21st of 2016, our team, botchan lab participated in our university festival. We held an event where many children came to do some experiments. We conducted experiments of lighting Escherichia coli by introducing GFP genes and also DNA extraction from broccolis.
On April 9th, we visited children’s center and held an experiment event. We prepared several easy experiments that children can try. We tried to let children feel what science is and let children think how those experiments work. At the same time, we taught children how researchers think when conducting an experiment, first, think of a consequence and then conduct an experiment, then think why you get those results. We also talked about iGEM and about our project to children. It seems li ke children are very interested about iGEM and that a lot of bacteria are functioning in our stomach.
On June 10th, we participated in the event in the local shopping center.   In this event, more than 100 children came to this event.   In this event there are shows and presentations done by other students from Tokyo University of science.   We conducted several experiments in this event as well.   Most children seemed to had fun and they told us that they spent a great time there.   In this event,not only"

Transport and accumulation
Before us, team iGEM Groningen 2009 made a model for an arsenic accumulator at the population level; that is, they set some ODEs that represent the change on the total intracellular arsenic (considering not a single cell, but the whole culture, or more exactly, the total cell volume) with respect to time. Nevertheless, as the precise value for some parameters were unavailable, specially for the ArsB effect, part of their model remains aparameterized and they perform a quasi-steady state analysis.
After considering the effect of their metallothioneins (As-binding proteins), GlpF, ArsB and ArsR, they ended with the following time derivative:
\begin{equation} \large\frac{\mathrm{d[As(III)in] } }{\mathrm{d} x} = -ArsR_{As}-MBPArsR_{As} -n_{f}\cdot fMT_{As} -k_{1} ArsB_{As} + \frac{k_{2}V_{s}GlpF_{As}}{V_{c}}  \end{equation}
Where As(III)in is the total intracellular arsenic; ArsRAs, MBPArsRAs, fMTAs, ArsBAs and GlpFAs are the arsenic bound proteins; nf is the Hill coefficient for the interaction between As and fMT; k1 and k2 are the kinetic constants for the interaction between As and ArsB and GlpF, respectively; finally, Vs/Vc represents the proportion between the total solution volume (Vs) and the total cell volume (Vc).
Core model
We built upon their model and made the following modifications, which we'll call the ""core modifications"" from now on:
We assume that ArsB is non functional, so that the only protein affecting As transport is GlpF.

Introduction
In an uncontaminated environment, bacteria and other microorganisms are constantly using and sharing the same organic matter as source of energy for metabolism. However, what happens when an inorganic pollutant, as a metal is present on the environment? How could microorganisms survive? The answer is that some would die and others would be able to utilize the inorganic matter to survive without being affected by it. Through this, bioremediation arose: environmental problems solved by biological organisms.  During bioremediation, microorganisms such as bacteria are able to use inorganic matter for oxi-reduction reaction, metabolizing the target inorganic pollutant. This specific and complex system is part of bacteria survival mechanism that became resistant to contamination. The generated products released by bacterial metabolism, are typically less toxic form of the initial pollutant.
One of the principal pollutant in Amazon region is mercury, known worldwide for its toxicity. Conventional methods have been used to remove Hg from contaminated environments. In general, laborious treatment systems, with high cost. In order to solve the environmental problem regarding to mercury, and make its bioremediation, we built a bioremediator using Escherichia coli DH5α through the protein mercury reductase (MerA).
Why Mercury reductase?
Mercuric ion reductase (MerA) is a cytosolic enzyme, responsible to convert thiol-avid Hg2+ to its volatile form H0, using NADPH as electrons’ source. Mer A is an homodimeric enzyme, and has similar properties to pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase family, by the presence of active site region with two cysteines, which confers the ability of redox-active disulfide/dithiol.
However, differently from other members of this protein family, MerA has two unique regions that prevent inhibition by Hg. The C-terminal region of one monomer, containing two cysteines is close to the redox-active cysteines of the other monomer,"
XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," approved by FDA in 2011. FDA-related information shows that D-psicose is sufficiently safe to be used in food. In China it is not approved yet.
D-psicose has been industrialized out of China since FDA’s approval, and hundreds of foods have been added with D-psicose as a sweetener.
The global market of sugar is more than $10 million per year, of which more than 80% is sucrose. In China, the demand for sucrose is also large and the yield is insufficient.
Thanks to Prof. Sun, it can be concluded that D-psicose is safe to be used in food and has unparalleled advantages over other sugar substitutes! The large sugar market in the world including in China reveals D-psicose will be in a huge demand as a healthy sucrose substitution especially with low production cost. So we are trying to find out the possibility to commercialization of D-psicose in China.
Dr.Shang-Wei Lv
An expert in the transformation of knowledge into practice
We discussed with Dr Lv to explore the possibility of the industrialization of D-psicose to the market as sweetener.
Keypoints
Lab-scale production process and techniques are the basis for industrialization.
More detailed analysis of cost, price, market share of D-psicose needs to be conducted before commercialization.
To start a business, funding, employees, supplies, regulations, property rights issues, etc need to be taken into account, besides techniques.
From Dr. Lv, we have learned that there is still a long way for industrialization of D-psicose, which requires a lot of efforts and collaborations. Our project about directed evolution system of key enzymes for D-psicose and our proposal concerning advantages and market share of D-psicose will also be beneficial to the further commercialization of D-psicose, contributing to a healthier life style.

Overview
For most cells, the molecular mechanism of sensing mechanical force starts with mechanical sensitive (MS) ion channels. The key objective of this study is to explore the possibility of using MS channels to sense sound instead.
Here we adapt synthetic biology approaches to engineer non sensory neuron to detect different aspects of sound, such as frequency and intensity (Fig. 1). Mechanosensitive channels TRPC5 and Piezo1 were chosen as putative receptors of sound. We engineered downstream calcium sensor to visualize channels’ response to sound. Different channels might have different responses even exposed to the same condition. Quantitative characterization of these channels will help us to comprehend the MS channel expression cell as a whole. The downstream NFAT reporter can be used to regulation extrageneous gene expression for further cell function control, as well as for functional selection of mutant channel library.
Figure 1. Overview of responses to mechanical stimuli with our engineered CHO cells.
1. Establish indicator of channels’ response
To visualize channels’ response, we established the systematic characterization tools to analyze the response of MS channel-expression CHO cell to mechanical force. Mechanosensitive channels will induce calcium influx into cells after receiving stimulation. Cytosolic calcium increase is visualized by R-GECO, a genetically encoded calcium sensor which can emit red fluorescence upon calcium binding. Red fluorescence can be captured and analyzed by live cell imaging system.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Chemotaxis Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," chemotaxis pathway will determine the threshold chemoattractant concentration for bacterial detection and the level at which the bacterial chemoattractant detection becomes saturated, decreasing the efficiency of the bacterial response to the chemoattractant.
Collapse
2. Modelling of the chemotaxis pathway
2.1 Objective
Use MATLAB to model the chemotaxis pathway and thereby determine the detection threshold and saturation level of chemoattractant for bacteria with 8 μM chemoreceptor. As it is believed that the auxin should be placed close to the seed (< 0.25 cm[4]) for optimal growth. It is therefore crucial to determine whether our bacteria will be able to stay close to the seed.
2.2 Description
Figure 1[1]: Chemotaxis signaling components and pathways for E. coli.
The chemotaxis pathway in E. coli is demonstrated in Fig.1. Chemoreceptors form stable ternary complexes with the CheA and CheW proteins to generate signals that control the direction of rotation of the flagellar motors[5]. The signalling group's currency is in the form of phosphoryl (p), which is made available to the CheY and CheB effector proteins through autophosphorylation of CheA[1]. CheYp initiates flagellar responses by interacting with the motor to enhance the probability of ‘run’[1]. CheBp is part of a sensory adaptation circuit that terminates motor responses[1]. Therefore, studying the methylation and phosphorylation levels of CheB and CheY is important to understanding chemotaxis of a single cell. The model based on Spiro et al. (1997)[1] was used to study how the concentrations of proteins in the chemotaxis pathway change over time.
In addition, the quantity that links the CheYp concentration with the type of motion (run vs. tumble) is called bias. It is defined as the fraction of time spent on the run with respect to the total movement time. The relative concentration of CheYp is converted into motor bias using a Hill function (Equation 1).
2.3 Results and discussion
Based on the Spiro model[1], the methylation levels of receptors and phosphorylation levels of CheY and CheB were studied (Fig.2).
Also, we studied the dependence of the run/tumble decision making, which is based on the relative receptor occupancy. It means that the probability of any particular chemoreceptor being occupied depends only on the external concetration of the chemoattractant, but not the total number of the"

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

We had a meeting with Luitenant Kolonel (Lieutenant-Colonel) Bergman, commanding officer centre of expertise EODD. We discussed the activities of the EODD, our landmine sensor and possible applications of the sensor in their operations.
“Our activities can be split in two equal parts,” Lt Col Bergman told us, “fifty percent national operations and fifty percent of what we call “out of area” operations. The national operations mostly consist of removing unexploded ordnance for World War II, but also the disposal of possible improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as bags left at the airport with wires sticking out.” The discovery of unexploded ordnance still happens very often. In 2013, the EODD received 2300 notifications of such findings. “We have five teams on the road every day for the disposal of unexploded ordnance,” Lt Col Bergman mentioned. Those teams are available 24/7 to prevent the sometimes life-threatening situations that occur.  Lt Col Bergman: “This work is not without danger. A colleague of mine lost a part of his arm when removing a bomb attached to a traffic enforcement camera.”
For the detection of unexploded ordnance in national operations, first a screening is done. This kind of area screening is mostly done in the preparation of large building projects. Such a procedure consist of the research of historic documentation and doing sample measurements with a metal detector. Bergman: “We increasingly also “walk in the area digitally”, making use of explosives detecting robots.”
For the out-of-area missions, people of the EODD are deployed in foreign countries (often war zones) to remove explosives hampering military operations or endangering civilians. “We have been active in recent conflicts such as the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Currently, people from the EODD assist special forces deployed in Mali, West-Africa. Also, the EODD is investigating the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 [plane with about 200 Dutch citizens shot down above the East of Ukraine], trying to resolve how and by whom the plane was shot down.”
“In Afghanistan we encountered a lot of IEDs,” Lt Col Bergman continued. “At first they were made with a lot of metal, which we could easily detect with a metal detector, but then the Taliban started to make IEDs with less or even no metal at all. This rendered our metal detectors useless, so we used dogs to detect the IEDs. Dogs are very good at detecting explosives, but"

BACKGROUND
What is ROS?
Fig. 1 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) refers to substances that have strong oxidative properties in                         living organisms. ROS are mainly divided into four categories: hydrogen peroxide(H2O2),                         superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl radicals(OH-), and single-line                         oxygen(1[O2]). [1]
The harm of the ROS
Fig. 2 ROS can cause oxidative damage
The overproduction of ROS in body organisms could lead to the damage to nucleic acids, lipids                         and proteins, impede normal cellular metabolism, worse more, those oxidized substances can                         attack bodies too. The accumulation of oxidative damage will eventually induce kinds of                         diseases, such as aging, initiate cancer, arteriosclerosis and heart disease. [2]
What are antioxidants?
Fig. 3 Glutathione, one of Antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation.
Antioxidants can scavenge the excess ROS in the organisms. The antioxidants mentioned here is                         not antioxidants for food preservation, nor reductants, but working in organisms. [3]
The classification of antioxidants
To better study the performance of antioxidants in the market, we divide them into two                         categories: direct antioxidants and indirect antioxidants, according to the mechanism of                         antioxidant action. Direct antioxidants exert antioxidant effects by redox reaction to                         scavenging or inhibiting free radicals, such as vitamin C, vitamins E and proanthocyanidins.                         And indirect antioxidants achieve antioxidant activity by regulating gene expression and                         intracellular metabolism in cell endogenous antioxidant system, such as the natural                         antioxidants oleuropein, [4]quercetin, and the synthetic antioxidant probucol. The                         antioxidants that are commonly found in cosmetics and health products on the market today are                         vitamin C, vitamin E, tea polyphenols"

The 2011 iGEM Calgary team would like to thank the following people for helping us throughout our project:
Deirdre Lobb
Our lab tech Deirdre has been invaluable to us. She has been able to help us from providing advice on procedures to helping us pick out a colour scheme. We were very lucky to have Deirdre on hand this summer.
Cobb Lab
We would like to thank the Cobb lab for providing us access to a sonicator and a real time PCR machine. One of our TA's, Maggie, came from the Cobb lab, and we were very glad she was allowed to join our team.
Moorhead Lab
The Moorhead lab provided us with access to their HPLC as well as various reagents. Our second TA, Dave, came from the Moorhead lab, and we were lucky to steal him away from his research this summer.
Gieg Lab
The Gieg lab was extremely helpful this summer. They gave us our first strains of Pseudomonas and instructions on how to grow them. We were also allowed to use their HPLC and analyzing programs as well as their reverse phase C-18 column. A huge thank you to the Gieg lab!
Birss Lab
The Birss lab was extremely helpful with the electrochemical detection side of our project. They managed to answer so many of the questions that we came up with over the summer and were always able to direct us to the best places to learn more. They also allowed us to test some of our methods with their equipment! We wouldn't have been able to get started without them!
Moore Lab
The Moore lab was responsible for publishing one of the main papers we based our project on. They also graciously provided us with the two strains of Pseudomonas that were used in that paper.

The need for an innovative bioreactor design was born in conjunction with the concept of reducing perchlorate to oxygen on Mars. The genetically modified E.coli require an environment that would both optimise perchlorate reduction and protect them from the extremes of the Martian environment. Being located in the isolated, hostile environment of the Martian surface the bioreactor design had to be low maintenance, energy efficient and most of all: largely self sufficient.
Below, you will find a timeline of design steps that were taken in order to reach our final bioreactor.
Design 1
Initially we had two bioreactors, one for removing perchlorate from water on Earth and another for producing oxygen on Mars. They were to be identical apart from an attachment for Mars which would allow the input of regolith rather than water.
We wanted to improve upon the bioreactor designed by previous iGEM team, Leiden 2016 , so this was where our bioreactor started. It was very simple with mobilised bacteria being mixed with perchlorate in a single chamber.
Design 2
We decided to try and have the two reactions (perchlorate to chlorite, and chlorite to chloride and oxygen) taking place in separate areas of the bioreactor. Because the operons involved the whole process is so long, we were hoping that this would allow us to insert less DNA into E. coli, making expression more likely.
However, this idea didn’t last long enough for us to come up with a design, as we discovered that chlorite is toxic to E. coli *source* and so it would all have to take place in one chamber and with one operon.
Design 3
After reading Biotechnological Applications of Microbial (Per)chlorate Reduction (Ouwei Wang and John D. Coates, 2017) we considered the idea of growing E. coli on a cathode in order to provide it with more electrons and speed up the reaction by up to 12%. The paper proposed a bioreactor in which DPRB (disparate perch"

Overview

LovTap
Figure 1: The figure shows in blue the Lov2 domain, in yellow the TrpR and in dark blue the linker helix.
LovTap is a protein fusion of the LOV2 domain from Avena sativa phototropin1 and trp repressor from E.coli.
Phototropin is a plant blue-light receptor, with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and  conserved cysteine residues responsible for the conformation change upon blue-light exposure[Christie1999]. The LovTap fusion makes use of this conformational change.  In the dark state the LovTap is not able to bind to DNA. After light activation the deformation of the TrpR domain is reversed and TrpR is able to bind to the trp operon [Strickland2008].  
We are using the LovTap construct to be able to calculate the intensity of the UV light in combination with our UV-B sensor UVR8. Also we are using it in our Decoder as an input signal for blue light.

We also liked the possibility to, at least to a certain extent, work without internet           connection, as it meant we could make some changes almost everywhere, for example the subway. However, a current problem is the need of an initial connection so the local server can be set up and that, sometime after the server is set up, it           seems to expire. We would like to see IDE running 100% locally without needing a starting internet connection other that, say, the very first time is used.""
•  University of Sydney
""Since none of our team had experience with python, we had some difficulty setting up the IDE but once we understood how python worked it was a bit easier. Maybe you could use something simpler than python in the future?
""One way you could make the set-up and use of IDE easier is to include more screenshots in your explanation for setting it up on github.
""You've designed the IDE tool very well overall! Although our team had some difficulty with python, the way it was designed through python was very clever.
""For our team, I think the most useful thing would be to make the tool easier to use for people who have no experience with coding, particularly by providing more detail in your instructions and explanations.""
•  University of Warwick
""Your tool was able to accurately display what the site would look like (including our bugs on the page). This was helpful in identifying errors and making changes without having to constantly upload the site to test it on the iGEM wiki.""
Warwick also pointed out a number of issues they found with IDE and with the instructions for how to use it, which allowed us to rectify these issues to make IDE easier to use for future teams. For example, they discovered an issue with running the build script on Windows, which we were then able to correct.
•  CCA San Diego
""Although we did not use the IDE for the bulk of our wiki development, CCA iGEM tested the IDE, and found it very convenient to use when uploading content for certain pages of our wiki because it is much faster than the default iGEM wiki environment. In addition to providing us with the IDE, Bristol iGEM recommended a software tool, Bootstrap, which was also useful for us.""

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," a large pharmaceutical company facing the problem that today’s models for drug discovery and testing, namely 2D cell cultures and animal testing, fail to reliably confirm the impact of the drug on the human body. 2D cell models are not dependable because cells exhibit their typical functions and behavior only under conditions that mimic those in the human body, for example they need to be surrounded by specific cells in all directions as is the case in an organ. Furthermore, animals are, for most applications, not sufficiently similar to humans to obtain meaningful insights about the effect of the drug. Nevertheless, many animals are still used for scientific experiments, especially in the area of drug testing. According to a study, 95% of drugs that work in animals are ineffective in humans (Appendix Ref. 1).
The main problem of our customer is that they are forced to spend millions or even billions of dollars to assess drug candidates that often do not work in humans or even expose volunteers for clinical studies to serious health risks because there are no reliable models for the pre-clinical drug development to verify safety and effectivity. In order to reduce these enormous costs for the development of drugs, our customers need dependable systems that can distinguish drug candidates with high chances of success from candidates that will likely fail in humans. Our solution for the customers problem is providing a reliable 3D-structured cell culture test systems with a new level of quality to investigate the effects of drug candidates. With our modified printer, we are able to precisely print and connect cells to 3D structures without harming the cells.
Reducing costs and time during the drug development process by means of our product is the most important benefit for our customers. Moreover, the number of animals used for experiments is reduced because several drug candidates will be excluded early on. As decided by the EU parliament in 2010, it is planned to reduce the amount of animals used for drug development within the next years (Appendix Ref. 1). Since 1980, the German government has financed over 500 projects to find alternative ways to reduce the amount of animals used for experiments with over € 160 million (Appendix Ref. 2) Our product contribute to this goal and is an opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry to meet upcoming governmental guidelines and improve their reputation. Furthermore, the number of expensive clinical studies in humans, which put many volunteers at risk, may be reduced as well. A suitable measure for the impact of our product on the industry is, for one, the amount of money saved from identifying substances that will fail market approval. For another, we can consider how many animals are saved. Additionally,"

RhamCOLIpid: Engineered E. coli producing rhamnolipid for green enhanced oil recovery
Surfactant is a compound that lowers surface tension between two liquids (e.g. oil-water) or liquid-solid. One example of naturally occurring surfactant is rhamnolipid. Rhamnolipid has a broad application, starting from enhanced oil recovery, oil spill and pollutant management, to industries such as food, cosmetic, and health care. But unfortunately this biosurfactant is produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia utilises optimised rhlAB gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for rhamnolipid production, combined by LacI control and reporter protein for controllable and observable production in E. coli. This rhamnolipid-producing E. coli is named RhamCOLIpid. Produced rhamnolipid is further tested for one of its usages, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). EOR using rhamnolipid is expected to serve as a green alternative to increase oil production in Indonesia.

Fine-regulation Circuits
Basing on basic regulation circuit, three fine-regulation circuits are designed for application in different fermentation situations. Recombinases are constructed downstream pH-responsive promoters to invert direction of constitutive promoter J23119, achieving automatic switch between acid and alkali production.
Main processes in these models are similar to basic regulation circuit model, including induction of the promoters, transcription, translation, catalytic process of enzymes and the effects of products on environmental pH. We also considered reversible reaction and materials’ production and degradation.
To simulate the inversion function of recombinase, we set several groups of equations and made cyclic processes. By determining some key values of pH, the model could switch different groups of equations.
The assumption we made are:
(1) J23119 is firstly in the direction of alkali production, as normal fermentation environment tends to be acidic.
(2) P-atp2 promoter is directly induced by hydroxyl ion, while P-asr promoter is directly induced by hydrogen ion.
(3) To prove the function of circuits, initial pH is set up to 8.0, where circuit led by p-atp2 has already be activated. This process is regarded as the first step of the model.
Cre/Flp Regulation Circuit
Fig.1 The gene circuits of Cre/Flp regulation system
The first fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinases Cre and Flp (Fig.1). The cyclic processes are described as followed:
(1) When pH is higher than 7.0, P-atp2 is induced and activates the production of Cre, which inverts J23119 from alkali production to acid production. Environmental pH begins to decrease.
(2) When pH is between 5.0 and 7.0, both P-asr and P-atp2 promoters are repressed. Because acid production circuit is open, pH level keeps declining.
(3) When pH is around 5.0, p-asr promoter is induced and leads production of Flp, which starts to change the"

Four things stand out from this table. First, the industrial services cell has the most businesses. Second, the number of companies that produce goods, services, and platforms are roughly equal. Third, the number of companies that make products that feed back into further production is roughly twice those who market their product to the general public. And fourth, teams in the entrepreneurship track tended to create businesses that feed input markets rather than final markets and provide services rather than goods or platforms. Below is the same table as above, but with team names instead of business names.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.

5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
I) Purpose
Test the size of plaques formed from x6 and x8 top agar
II) Expected outcome
As top agar increase in concentration, the number of plaques/plate should decrease and individual plaques should become smaller.
III) Reagent record
T7 + phage: -5 dilution from 4.26; E coli BL21; Agar: ×2 prepared by Jordan in 500mL glass bottle; LB: prepared by us on 4.3; overnight bacteria culture: set up on Thursday at 2:00pm using 4.6 streak; ×8 top agar stock: prepared by us on 4.3
IV) Actual procedures / observations
i) Six test tubes were labeled control, ×6, ×6, ×8, ×8, x8, and ×8. To each of the test tubes, 0.5mL of E coli overnight liquid culture was added.
ii) To each test tube 20 μL of -5 phage solution was added. This mixture of E coli and phage was left sitting for 20 minutes before proceeding.
iii) In a separate set of test tubes, top agar was diluted to give ×6, and ×8 concentration.
iv) 5mL of top agar was added to each test tube so that the concentration of the agar added matches the labels on test tube. For the control tube, ×8 agar was added. The contents of these test tubes were then plated on LB plates."

The Day 9 biofilm was recultured by pipetting a proper amount of LB media onto the side of the Petri dish. This was then pipetted back into the 5 mL LB media tube along with 5 µL of KAN.
This was then incubated in the shaker for 24 hours at 37 ˚C.
The biofilms that were treated with the antibiotics KAN (x2), AMP, TET, CAM, IPTG, and water which was used as a control, were recultured 15 minutes after the antibiotics had been removed. They were recultured in the same manner as mentioned above.
These were then also incubated in the shaker for 24 hours at 37˚C.

July 15, 2010
iGEM team member Justin Vigar displays a sample of oil sand which the group will be using, along with a sample of tailings pond water, to help refine a bacteria than can feed on petrochemical residue
A group of University of Lethbridge undergraduate chemistry, biochemistry and neuroscience students has been awarded an international research grant to help solve a challenge posed by a consortium of leading energy companies -- Find a biological solution to improve the environmental sustainability of Alberta’s oil sands bitumen extraction, upgrading and refining.
The students are members of the multiple-award-winning International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team at the U of L, and each year take on a synthetic biology research project which they present at an international competition held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, MA.
The group was the only team in the iGEM world-wide membership to receive $20,000 from the Oil Sands Initiative (information attached, below) to study how a petrochemical-eating bacteria their group plans to design could be used to help clean up water in tailings ponds – a byproduct of the bitumen refining process in which water that cannot be recycled is deposited into large ponds to settle.
“As a team from Alberta, we know of the economic benefit that the oil sands have brought to the province,” team spokesperson Justin Vigar said. “Many members on our team have friends and family employed around the province in the energy industry.""
""However, we are also aware of the environmental impact of the oil sands, specifically the tailings ponds. We feel it is important not only to clean the tailings ponds, but be able to extract the potential energy of the residue bitumen at the same time.”
Vigar added that the iGEM team has previously worked on many related projects, which gives them a significant advantage when facing this new challenge"
