Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," though antibiotic resistance is still the most commonly used selection marker in biotechnology other options are emerging for both selectable and screening markers [21] [21] .
Firstly, for the mere identification of successful transformants, fairly established screening methods are available, most popular among them the blue-white screen. This method is based on successful integration of the recombinant sequence interrupting the lacZɑ gene, leading to loss of β-galactosidase. The untransformed colonies will continue producing the enzyme which catalyses the transformation of X-Gal into a blue substance while the transformants lacking the enzyme will appear white.
However, a plethora of alternatives for selection markers are also available, the most relevant ones in this context are based on either one of two principles:
the deletion of an essential gene from the bacterial chromosome and re-introduction of the gene on the plasmid
introduction of a negative regulator in front of an essential chromosomal gene and subsequent abrogation of the negative regulator through an element on the plasmid [21]
Unfortunately, those antibiotic-free screening methods have a major disadvantage: they are not yet sufficiently established and generally require the use of specific plasmid backbones and bacterial strains that are not available for purchase at major companies.
At this point in time, replacing antibiotic-based selection in bacterial biotechnology is a hard task to achieve with plasmids and bacterial strains for antibiotic-based screening readily available in most labs. However, times are changing: antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly problematic, leading to tightening regulations concerning the use of antibiotics in research. Moreover, advances in biotherapeutics and food biotechnology have cause an increasing demand of safe, antibiotic-free screening techniques and will hopefully lead to well-established and characterised alternatives in the near future [22] .
Dispose
After using antibiotics in your lab, disposing of them safely is a prime concern to avoid contact with the ecosystem [23] . Resistance development may persist long after antibiotic exposure, and cross-resistance may occur which can be difficult to foresee and handle [24] . Antibiotic waste is treated differently depending on the antibiotics' degradability [25] . Some antibiotics can be directly poured down the sink because they will break down before reaching the ecosystem whereas others should be degraded and inactivated by autoclaving or pH treatment beforehand. A third group of antibiotics is not degradable using these methods, or the characteristic is uncertain, and should be treated as hazardous chemical waste destined for incineration [25] . If the antibiotic waste contains other chemicals or organisms it must be disposed accordingly. Guidelines and regulations can vary among institutes and nations, so it"

The model based on Spiro et al. (1997) [1] was used to identify candidates of the chemotaxis receptor pathway. The methylation level of receptors, phosphorylation level of CheY and CheB were studied from Spiro’s model(Figure 2-Figue3). With receptor concentration per cell equals to 8x10-6mole/L, the lower threshold concentration of chemoattractant that the bacterium start to detect is 10-8mole/L. The saturation level is 10-6mole/L  in which concentration or higher the bacteria’s movements to chemoattractant are less efficient. In addition, the relation between chemoreceptor concentration and the lower threshold and staturation level were also studied (Figure 5).
The quantity that links the CheY-p concentration with the type of motion (run vs. tumble) is called bias. It is defined as the fraction of time spent on the directed movement with respect to the total movement time. The relative concentration  of CheYp is converted into motor bias using a Hill function (Euqation 1)[5]. A graph describes bias against CheY-p concentration was shown in Figure 5.

Simulation of chemotaxis of bacteria population
The part of modeling focused on creating the movement model of bacteria population for chemotaxis. In order to accurately built this model, the following assumptions are made based on literature:
1) During the directed movement phase, the mean speed of an E. coli equals 24.1 μm/s, varying speed between 17.3 μm/s  and 30.9 μm/s [7]. Whereas during the tumbling phase, the speed is significantly smaller and can be neglected.
2) E.Coli usually take previous second as their basis on deciding whether the concentration has increased or not. Therefore, in our model the bacteria will be able to compare the concentration of chemattractant at t second and t-1 second.
3) In our model, we ignored that E.Coli do not travel in straight line during run, but take curved paths due to unequal firing of flagella.
4) Our model did not consider the size"

Thus, researchers need to passage cells every 3-4 days, diluting them and transferring them into new dishes or flasks so that they are actively dividing and healthy.
The process of cell passaging requires expensive reagents such as:
FBS (fetal bovine serum) - promotes growth of mammalian cell culture
DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Modicum) - media that supports growth of mammalian cell culture
Penicillin Streptomycin (Pen-Strep) - helps prevent contamination in mammalian cell culture
L-glutamine - amino acid that promotes cell growth in mammalian cell culture
Sodium pyruvate - acts as an additional source of carbon and glucose for cell
Trypsin - protease that cleaves mammalian cell surface peptides to release adherent cells from a tissue culture treated plate
DPBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline) - provides a buffer system to maintain media at optimal conditions
We purchased most of these Corning products from Fisher Scientific.
Parts
Because sharing and submission of standardized parts to the common Registry is a core mission of iGEM, we sought to identify how mammalian part submissions might play a role in hindering teams from using mammalian cells.
Lower Number of Registry Parts
We searched through the iGEM registry for functional parts that we could potentially use in our mammalian systems. iGEM teams generally tend to work in E. coli because it is easy to work with, grows quickly, and functions as a good host for foreign DNA sequences. Because of this, the vast majority of parts are designed to operate in E. coli. There is not a significant number of parts designed for optimal function in mammalian chassis. As a result, it is difficult for teams that are working with mammalian chassis to use and characterize old parts, as many of may not have full functionality in mammalian systems. This dissuades many teams from using mammalian chassis.
More Difficult Submission Standards
There are two current avenues for teams performing mammalian research to submit their parts to the iGEM registry.
The first is to submit parts as classic BioBricks. This ensures that parts are cloned and submitted in the pSB1C3 backbone for consistent iGEM handling, as well as that parts are flanked by proper restriction sites for subsequent cloning. One issue with this standard is that mammalian parts are quite large, and with many internal restriction sites it is difficult to remove these so"

UPF_CRG_Barcelona,2018,Team:UPF CRG Barcelona#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"AS (Generally Recognize As           Safe). We used antibiotic resistance just to select the bacteria who had incorporated the desired genes.           However, this approach was only used as a proof of concept for our system. In this way and thinking further           in our project as a possible probiotic, we are planning to integrate these modifications inside the           bacteria genome. For this reason, we used MAGE (Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineered).
Genetically Modified Organism
In the design of our system we plan to overexpres the own E.coli genes related           to the LCFA degradation metabolism. As it has been mentioned, even though antibiotic resistance was used as           a way of selection, it was only a step before genome modification.
When assessing our GMO risk the following was considered:
Characteristics that potentially could result in             harmful effects.
Assessment of possible consequence of these harmful             effects, if they occur.
Assessing the probability of the occurrence of the             individual potential harmful effects.
In our case, the unique possible harmful effects derived from our GMO would           be           the antibiotic resistance genes and their spreading, but as mentioned, this problem will be solved with           genome integration. When considering the genes that we were expressing in our device, any of them would           constitute a danger for the human body.
Safety expertise
In order to consider the ethic implications of our proof of concept we had a           talk with Cristophe Robaglia from Aix-Marseille Université. He aware us about the need to consider possible           allergenic when overexpressing membrane receptors. He also aware us of the possible risks and the           regulations that our probiotic will need to consider.
Project specific laboratory safety
We have used some chemicals and substances that need special mention of           biosafety. We consulted our instructors and checked the Safety Data Sheets provided by the purveyor           beforehand.
SYBR safe DNA gel stain: We chose SYBR safe because is safer compared to Ethidium bromide. It is less             mutagenic, and its sensitivity is excellent. Referring the Safety Data Sheets classifies the substance as             not hazardous for health nor for the environment. However, if there is skin or eye contact needs rinsing             with plenty of water. Ingestion and inhalation are not expected to present significant presence under             normal use.
Antibiotics: We used ampicillin, chloramphenicol and             kanamycin as the main antibiotics. It is needed to take into account that these chemicals can cause acute             toxicity and mutagenicity, so when working with them safety measures were considered.

Project design:
•Each member of the team received a free SnapGene license
•Our Secondary PI and protein expert, Jacqui Matthews, helped us design our     own single chain insulin analogue which we called Winsulin.
•The team narrowed down our research on insulin analogues and expression     and finalised which parts we plan to submit into the registry and/or     express.
•We planned to express 3 different insulins: Human Proinsulin, a single     chain insulin found in a paper called SCI-57, and our own single chain     insulin Winsulin.
•We plan to express each of these insulins in the cytoplasm of E. coli, the     periplasm of E. coli and to be secreted by Bacillus subtilis.
•Our parts each included a 6x His tag for purification. Insulins that will     be expressed in the periplasm will have an Ecotin ‘periplasmic-expression’     tag, and insulins that will be to be secreted will be fused to a YncM     ‘Bacillus-secretion’ tag.
•This leaves 9 parts to be designed and synthesised. As a team of 8, each     team member was assigned a part. Our lab guru Jamie was assigned two of     these gBlocks to design as he was especially enthusiastic.
•We hope to order them next week.

•The team worked really hard last week to finalise our gBlock parts. Rough     draft of the parts were made. Unfortunately, these still needed work. The     team spent the week fixing up the minor details such as codon optimisation     for E. coli and Bacillus subtilis and restriction enzyme recognition sites     in our gBlocks.
Education and Public Engagement:

The next morning, the congress started at 9:00 with a great breakfast and subsequently at 10:00 the symposium started with excellent speakers presenting about various topics within synthetic biology.
After a coffee break, the poster presentation session started. We even had the opportunity to present our poster among others to Randy Rettberg (president of the iGEM foundation) and to Thea Chrysostomou (iGEM ambassador). Furthermore, a lot of cool pitches and great posters varying from personalized identification/treatment of cancer till an E. coli based mosquito trap were presented. Valuable discussions with groups that had similar themes were held. During the meet-up collaborations were initiated with the Bordeaux and Toulouse iGEM team.
The Bordeaux team could use our Chemistry knowledge to guide them with their project. In return they could help us with the ethics part of the project through showing new insights. The Toulouse team promised to send some of their own bacterial synthesized cellulose for us to use.
In the afternoon workshops were scheduled from companies and iGEM teams regarding synthetic biology, entrepreneurship, teambuilding etc. The day was secluded with an arranged barbecue in a restaurant with some drinks.
On Sunday morning two other scientific talks were given, the award for the best poster was given to ETH Zürich and to end up the congress a wrap-up movie was shown of the time at the congress. After the movie it was time to pick up our stuff, say goodbye to our new friends and wish everybody all the best with their projects.
We decided to stay another day in Munich to play tourist and see the beautiful parts of the city. Fortunately a couple of the other teams decided to do this as well. After some sight-seeing, we scheduled a dinner all together at the typical German restaurant “Hofbrauhaus Munich”.  This turned out to be an excellent completion of the weekend. We had life music, German food, beers and lots of fun.

In addition to that we ask respondent how likely they are going to participate in a future scientific research. Again to our surprise, more than 70% of the respondent says that they are moderately to highly possible to be involved in a scientific research in the future. Consider the fact that most of the respondent’s parent are not researchers, we think that the influence caused by the  surrounding people is low. In fact, we think what is more likely to be a reason is the sufficient and comprehensive STEM(Science,Technology,Engineering and Mathematics) education in our school and in Hong Kong. This is because the Secondary school curriculum includes STEM as a compulsory subjects from Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, and elective subjects for Secondary 4 to Secondary 6.
Conclusion
As a conclusion the the questionnaire conducted, we think that Hong Kong government has done a fairly good job in terms supporting the scientific research. We think that the government has done a really good job in terms of promoting scientific research in  STEM Education although supports for existing research project is still a lackluster. However, we believe the government can still focus more on the scientific research environment by introducing and giving out more financial aid for those small projects that are currently not funded.

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Editing Trial3_-_-_TEXT.html," also conducted a survey about synthetic biology at the same time.
Team USTC members and Team USTC-software members worked together to give presentations to the public, including  professors, students, children and the citizens. Everyone showed great interest to our projects, and we had lots of discussions about the cutting-edge research of biology.  During the presentations, we surveyed the public about their knowledge of biological science, gene engineering, bio-safety  and in particular, synthetic biology.
Before holding the presentation, we had done a lot of research and basically determined the theme of our project. So, besides introducing the work of Team USTC in previous years, we also introduced our result of investigation and the rough direction of our project. So the public could know what we were doing.
Experiments for Kids
Bacteria and DNA are what we commonly work with in synthetic biology. And we also frequently talk about them in our daily life. However, the public usually don't have accesses to know them closer,so we managed to make them accessible.
Attempting to attract more citizens, especially children, to know more about biology, we designed a simple experiment to extract DNA from fruits with kitchen materials.
Experiment procedures:             1. Grind the fruit(strawberry, watermelon, peach or kiwifruit) with NaCl into paste.             2. Add 5ml domestic detergent and keep stirring for 1min.             3. Filter it.             4. Add 10 ml EtOH into filtrate.           5. Nodular DNA shows.
We do hope our human practice can attract kids to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become new scientists one day. It turned to be a great success. The experiment taught kids basic konwledge on synthetic biology and molecule biology. In the experiment, children have to choose the finest fruit to extract DNA. So it also stimulates their interests on the process of research.
""With this experiment we--both me and my kid--have learned a lot about biology. I have never expected that I can SEE DNA with my own eyes."" said a parent,""It's quite amzing. I'll do it again with my kid in our own kitchen!""
Plastic for Plants The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments.Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also linked to sustainable development.

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," hemocytes, and plasma play important roles in eliminating the fungi that are present in the hemolymph,[6] But arm race between parasitic fungi and their insect hosts never stops. The fungus has mechanisms to overcome the immune systems of insects.,for example, the lower level of β-1,3-glucan in the cell surface does not stimulate the host immune response[7]. We extract a gene named MCL1 from Metarhizium robertsiiARSEF 23, which encodes collagen-like protein to combine and block β-1,3,-glucan.[3]This gene works like putting an “invisible cloak ”on the fungus so that immune avoidance can happen.
In this part, PgpdA is a strong promoter that allows MCL1 to be expressed without induction. of hemolymph.

We transferred the expression vector MCL1-pBC by CaCl ₂ -PEG induction method, then screen transformant by G418 resistance genes and colony PCR.PCR product was identified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.14)

Welcome to Exeter iGEM's 2015 diary!
Following this diary will give you an insight into the progress of our project.
June
Starting the Interlab Study
Week One   1/6 - 7/6
Our first week was extremely busy as we all began to get to know each other as a team. We began work in the lab focusing on the Interlab study, in order to learn important lab techniques and also gain some all important iGEM credit. Beginning to understand transformation techniques, PCR and ligation was interesting to say the least, especially for the non-biologists among us.
As the week progressed the intensity of our research sessions increased. Any ideas were welcome no matter how far fetched or bizarre they seemed at the time. Naturally as we researched further the ideas were narrowed down, mostly as we discovered some were unviable for a number of reasons. We kept a focus on the time constraints of the project, the budget of the project and also facilities we have access to at the University. By the end of the week we had a handful of ideas that we split between our interdisciplinary team to research over the weekend.
Week Two   8/6 - 14/6
We started week 2 with a huge focus on the presentation we had to give on the Wednesday. Furthermore we worked out a timetable to re-do the Interlab study following some technical difficulties. We began engaging in some really good brainstorming sessions and also started to get to know each other personally. A chair was broken in a hilarious manner – still funny now.
The presentation was a success and all ideas were received well with the academics. After feedback we decided to take forward three of the ideas to give a second presentation in week three. This became the focus of the rest of the week. Going into the weekend we went on a team social that was very fun. Once again over the weekend the focus was to"
Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," considering the issues concerning genetic engineering. We took this as an opportunity to also address this problem, especially since next vivo tries to tackle this problem in both federal regulations and an education setting. The event also gave us the chance to network with Amino Biolabs who agreed to help us with our event, whereby giving out demonstrations of their own machines.
Gairdner Award Winner, Dr. Lewis Kay
We had the wonderful opportunity to share our history as an iGEM team with one of this year’s Gairdner Award recipients, Dr. Lewis Kay (professor, Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Chemistry, University of Toronto; senior scientist, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). The Canada Gairdner Awards acknowledge the best scientific minds and are internationally respected. Dr. Kay was recognized by the foundation for his profound work in modern NMR spectroscopy. Members of our team discussed with Dr. Kay projects from the past ten years, including the focus of this year’s team.
Education
For education, we incorporated it as an application of our cell-free system. We included educators as one of our main user groups (novices) . We spoke with educators from a variety of grade levels to inform what system would best their needs for teaching scientific concepts and what qualities we would need to include in our final design.
Novices Summary Table
Need simplified protocols and kits that are easy-to-use
Standardized parts for learning one system
Modularity for simple experiments
Promote good safety practices
From these interviews we designed an education kit schematic and education modules that align with the Alberta Biology 30 curriculum. We developed teacher and student versions of a transcription and translation experiment that relies on physical indicators. We decided to make separate teacher and student versions of the experiment based on our research and suggestions from Justin Pahara and Julie Legault. After our conversation with the Public Health Agency of Canada, we also developed a biosafety module to inform students about microorganisms and safety practices they should use if they were to work in a laboratory setting. The content in these modules were developed with input from members of the Lethbridge High School iGEM Team, team member Keith Aiken who is in the faculty of education, and Patrick Shackleford, a biology 30 teacher at Winston Churchill High School.

Thermostability of GRFT
In order to improve the stability of the monomeric (3LL2) and homodimeric (2HYQ) griffithsin proteins, we used the amino sequence found on the protein data bank and mutated  residues that contributed to structure destabilization. Using the YASARA and ZDOCK modeling packages, we were able to identify residues with high B factors and predict which amino acid changes were required to improve the stability of folded structure. After changing these amino acids, we simulated the interactions and binding interfaces between our thermoengineered proteins and antibodies and glycoproteins. Through this, we determined that our thermostable variants were predicted to have higher melting temperatures and have preserved binding loops. Please check out our modeling page for more information on the process of thermoengineering! (LINK HERE)
Because of the engineering and significance of this part, the part numbered BBa_K2464004 is the best part we added to the registry this year. All of the other parts we submitted to the registry are basic parts. Click here for our comprehensive list.

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and faster than farming [18] .
Two obtain two natural UV-protecting compounds, Shinorine and Porphyra-334, we decided to use as gene sources two different organisms, which synthesize target MAAs in vivo. Enzymes of MAAs biosynthesis are encoded either by MysA, MysB, MysC, MysD or amir4256, amir4257, amir4258, amir4259 in cyanobacterium Nostoc Punctiforme and actinobacterium Actinosynnema Mirum, respectively. Two different organisms were chosen to increase a chance of successful heterologous expression in yeast..
Shinorine and Porphyra-334 biosynthetic pathway comprises four enzymatic reactions catalyzed by 4 different enzymes:
The intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, is converted into dimethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) by demethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase encoded by mysA/amir4259.
DDG is then converted to 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG) by demethyl-4-deoxygadusol methyltransferase(O-MT family) encoded by mysB/amir4258.
The (ATP-grasp family) encoded by mysC/amir4257 catalyzes the addition of glycine to 4-DG to form mycosporine-glycine.
D-ala-D-ala ligase homolog (ATP-grasp family) encoded by mysD/amir4256 catalyzes the last reaction, in which serine and threonine are added to mycosporine-glycine forming Shinorine and Porphyra-334, respectively [10, 19, 20,21,22].
Figure 2
Yeast and yeast extract
Our team decided to synthesize MAAs in S.cerevisiae, since yeast cultures have some valuable properties. First of all, S. cerevisiae is a standard model organism and there are a lot of well-developed lab techniques for yeast cultivation and genome manipulation. Yeast is widely used as producers since they have high growth rate and production of the target compound can be relatively easy optimized [23] [24] .
Our idea is to produce MAA-enriched yeast extract.
There are several reasons why we think that yeast extract is a good component for our sunscreen:
It does not cause irritation [25] .

Vilnius-Lithuania,2017,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Lithuania iGEM team of 2017 opened my eyes to the world of Synthetic Biology. It was a truly outstanding experience mainly due to the vast knowledge and extreme proficiency in their study fields from the whole iGEM team, which I was able to observe and learn from. During discussions about the lab and the fundamentals of the idea I was astonished nearly 100% of the time because of the intense flow of new concepts and ideas. Furthermore, aiding the team in other fields such as HP was very new to me, I was never part of such a big group project and was certainly never appointed to help design scientific activities and even take part in sharing the responsibility of the project. I now see the iGEM competition as something great not just because it helps to form and characterize synthetic biology, but of what it helps others to achieve through hard work, determination and, most importantly, teamwork. I aspire to become competent enough in my field over the course of couple of years and then attempt to give another shot at the iGEM competition, but this time as a proper team member to experience everything first hand.""
Science Espressos
In order to reach a bigger part of the general public and involve as much people as possible in the science communication activities, we organized interactive discussions on topics from cellular ageing to XenoDNA.
Our team was invited to collaborate with the Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology in order to bring the SPARKS Project to Lithuania. This initiative aims to involve the citizens in rapidly developing fields of science, as well as promote and communicate the importance of Responsible Research and Innovation.
At our first Science Espresso, ""The Control of Cellular Ageing Mechanisms: an Everlasting Youth"", we addressed the issues of cellular ageing with Mantas Matjusaitis from CellAge - a disruptive synthetic biology start-up aiming to increase human health and lifespan. An introduction on what is ageing and what kind of cellular mechanisms control it was made. Attendees discussed various issues, such as ethical aspects of living forever. The general public explored the beauty beyond bioinformatics together with Linas Tamosaitis from the University of Kent at ""Bioinformatics: the unity of numbers and art"" in our second Science Espresso. In our third discussion, the DNA was taken beyond the limits by Prof. Dr. Rolandas Meskys from Vilnius University at the discussion ""XenoDNA: New Generation tool for treating diseases"". The lay public was not only introduced to classic DNA structure and functions, but participants were also acquainted on how XNA differs from DNA. Moreover, they explored how it broadens disease treatment options, as well"
Duke,2017,Team:Duke#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," in. We have not yet collected data for Gibson assembly into pSMART with upstream homology of pSB1C3_Gibson, which is how the data for pSB1C3 was collected. See Duke iGEM 2017’s Contribution page.
Because iGEM vectors all share common Biobrick prefixes and suffixes, all iGEM vectors would also have this issue of being inefficient in Gibson assembly. However, since our primers bind to the Biobrick and RFP area of the plasmid, they can be used to remove homology in any iGEM vector and make it better for Gibson Assembly.

Today we choose four relatively longer parts to do the digestion ,electrophoresis and ligation. Unfortunately, the results of digestion and electrophoresis are both terrible. Some bands disappear, and some others are dim. It’s always difficult to come up to expectations. So we didn’t go on to ligate them. We think it’s because our operations are not so standard. We want to do it again and seek the reasons.
We get some name cards of enzyme company through our teachers. We should clear up the enzymes we need and definite enzyme cut’s steps. We ask our teachers for this question. It’s clear now.

We verify remaining parts cut yesterday by electrophoresis. And ligate them in the evening.
7-28
Extract the plasmids that were ligated yesterday. For a day, they’re so clean. Obviously, we didn’t ligate them successfully. We make a plan about our future days’ tasks. In the evening, we go on ligating them. And make some square plates and dry them.
7-29
At 4: oo a.m, we transform four new parts and coat the four and two ligated parts on square plate. In the morning, we make up some medium and disinfect them. In the evening, we find the mediums don’t grow so well.

In the morning, we go to see the plates. It’s really bad. There are blend bacteria growing on the plates. We still tranfer the strain into LB liquid to be shaking cultured. Later, we throw them away. Then use the rest plasmids to coat square plates again. And we make some solid LB medium.
Another student moved to the Laoshan dormitory.

We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that when it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes to 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry. It is the technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.
Data Description—Newspaper
Data Description—Magazine
Data description—iGEM wiki
Sufficiency—Points of view provided
We consider at least one point of view is provided if they made an argument in their article, and provide an evidence to support their argument. A statement is not considered as an argument if it is recognized as fact. A point of view is considered provided if it contains a viewpoint from a professor, an institute, a stakeholder …etc. A point of view is not made if the author doesn’t provide the source right in the sentence, we didn’t consider the reference as the source in this part.
iGEM wiki are less likely to make an argument, in comparison to Newspaper and Magazine. We mentioned several situations confronted in assessing iGEM wiki, we discover that iGEM wiki is more likely to state a truth or recite what is in a paper, and then share their ideas.
Sufficiency—Attribution of responsibility
We consider an attribution of responsibility is provided if there is an issue, a conflict or a phenomenon with multiple reasons or attributions. An explanation of a truth, or an argument back up with truth is considered as attribution of responsibility.
Generally speaking, Magazine demonstrate more attribution of responsibility, the Newspaper often present less than two attributions of responsivity. We discover that it is magazine that is able to investigate into a topic in detail and more carefully, making the article complete. We also discover that iGEM wiki shows little retribution of responsibility, we thought GEM wiki are less likely to make an argument, in comparison to Newspaper and Magazine. We mentioned several situations confronted in assessing iGEM wiki, we discover that iGEM wiki is more likely to state a truth or recite what is in a paper, and then share their ideas.
Sufficiency—Additional reading
We discover that Magazine provide much more additional reading, enabling the audience to search for more interesting information. Newspaper and iGEM wiki both provide little additional reading.
Understandability—Illustration or infographics

One of our destinations is the Sciphar Organic Products corporation located in Xi’an. We learnt that they used to produce chitosan and healthcare products that contain the chemical, and reached out for them in hope of visiting their factory, where we can have a better understanding of how chitosan is produced. Yet in the first response we received, the company showed their concern—They have already closed up their chitosan production line. This, however triggered our interest: Why did they closed it up? Sensing that the reasons behind the company’s decision could also give us inspiration on our project, we decided to visit anyway.
At the company, we asked why the company had shut down the chitosan production line in addition to the technical questions we have prepared. The manager sighed at this: “You would be disappointed…it was profitable, indeed, we used chitosan to produce all kinds of products from drugs to cosmetics. But there were too many risks.” He explained to us that the current industrial production method—using concentrated hydrogen chloride and sodium hydroxide—imposes a lot of danger on the factory workers operating the machine. Moreover, the industrial wastes that comes with the production was too much for them to treat.
Despite that it differs from what we have expected initially, we have benefited a lot from this trip. We have identified safety and sustainability as two issues we should address with our design. Treating crystalized chitin with enzymes produces little side product but some harmless organic acetic salts. By incorporating our system into a machine that monitors the fermentation process automatically, we have also minimized casualty potentials.

Influence of Primary School Experience on our Experiments
When we gave the lecture in the Beijing 2nd primary school, the kids there left us deep impression. They were so eager to learn more about what we introduced. For most of them, it may be the first time for them to learn synthetic biology. Even if some concepts for them may be hard to understand, their curiosity to the beautiful natural world, their passions to synthetic biology, and their dreams to their promising future impressed us a lot. As the presenters for the lecture, this experience made the reminiscence of our childhood, when we were curious to the biology. We were eager to utilize the microscopes, to observe the behaviors of different insects, and to combine different chemical reactants. We have found that, it is the long-term interest and pursue of biology that tied us together: we are a group with same biology dream. As a result, every time we discussed our research design together, an invisible tie connected us"

Hi there! I am a Biotechnologist about to start a PhD in systems biology and ""-omics""-based approaches to bioremediation.
I was trapped by iGEM (and SB in general) 3 years ago, when I was part of the iGEM 2009 Valencia  Team .      Now, I'm very happy to repeat such an amazing experience as advisor.
The thing I like the most (apart from working in the lab, of course...) is travelling and meeting people from other countries, so I hope to see you in Amsterdam and Boston!
I'm an Electronic Eng. and I'm doing my PhD in Control Systems oriented to Synthetic Biology.
I play Guitar as hobby (although I studied almost all my life) and I like      traveling, biking, swimming, rock climbing, yoga, taking pictures and many things more...!!!.
I was iGEMer in 2010, and now I'm back as Advisor, so it seems iGEM is      something good, what do you think?
but I don't have time to fight Entropy... Take a look to my iGEM2010 user page or      to my web page.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,") to combine our constructs. We used multiple methods because of the time constraint and the fact that we didn't know which one would work the best. Due to a construct design error our assembly pieces contained the BioBrick prefix in the very first part, but the last part did not include the suffix. The suffix was added by PCR after synthesis and the prefix & suffix areas functioned as the homologous overlap areas between our brick and the backbone.
In the assembly phase, we also had to take into account the plasmids we were to use. As our whole system would require three plasmids altogether if we were to add the cellulose hydrolysing enzymes to the same bacteria, we had to be careful about the plasmids’ compatibility groups. Our plasmids needed different antibiotic resistances and intercompatible origins of replication. After our constructs were successfully assembled they were sent for sequencing to check that everything worked as expected. We then transformed them into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔyjgB ΔyqhD strain with chemical transformation and screened the transformants with double-antibiotic plates. These cells should be able to produce propane. All we would need to do is induce the production with IPTG and identify the propane by gas chromatography.
Degrading Cellulose
To further develop the idea of using propane as a biofuel, feedstock alternatives were sought as glucose itself interferes with food production. At first, we planned to use cyanobacteria as a host organism to produce carbohydrates to the propane pathway but with the limited amount of time available the project would become too challenging to be accomplished. However, non-edible carbon sources like cellulose had already been investigated by previous iGEM teams and cellulose hydrolysis by bacteria wasn’t connected to the propane pathway yet. Therefore, we decided to design a system that would utilize cellulosic waste.This helped us avoid interfering with food production and was easily integrated to our original plan of propane production.
Because we wanted to incorporate cellulose degradation and propane production into the same strain, all genes expressing the cellulose degrading cellulases needed to be in the same backbone. Two plasmids already contained propane pathway genes and the approximated limit of the insert size in the plasmid is about 10 kb. The number of different degrading enzymes was limited to three cellulases in order to limit the plasmid size and the stress of the organism. To convert cellulose polymers into glucose units, the proper hydrolysis requires enzymes endoglucanase, exoglucanase and β-glucos"

Therefore, it can be shown that the expression of GFP protein, as significantly increased after the addition of the cyclic amplifier, which will have a greater effect on our detection.
Figure7: The OD600 of BBa_K2305005 and BBa_K2305016.
Figure8: The part with the cyclic amplifier has about 10 times larger GFP fluorescence than the part without the cyclic amplifier.
2.3 Dual Fluorescence System
  We inserted the lacl gene into the downstream of the plux gene. LacI can inhibit the expression of the plac promoter to inhibit the expression of the RFP gene, a reporter downstream the plac promoter. Because of the existence of the strong promoter and the cyclic amplifier, the expression and the fluorescence intensity of the GFP will increase along with the growth of the E.coli ΔLysA, which is promoted by lysine. On the contrary, the expression and the fluorescence intensity of the RFP are inhibited. Then we used the GFP/RFP fluorescence intensity ratio to represent the output signal to improve the sensitivity.
  To test the effect of the dual reporter fluorescence, the genetic circuits we designed are as shown. The pbad is a promoter induced by L-arabinose. We simulate the response of E.coli ΔLysA to the lysine concentration with the response of pbad promoter to the L-arabinose concentration. With the increase of the lysine concentration, the transcriptional efficiency of the pbad increases, therefore the expression of the lacl and GFP will also increase. On the contrary, the expression of RFP is low, because LacI can inhibit the plac promoter. Then we use the GFP/RFP fluorescence intensity ratio to represent the concentration of the L-arabinose. And we have worked out the relationship of the GFP expression of BBa_K584000 and the L-arabinose concentration, as well as the connection between the fluorescence ratio of the BBa_K2305002 and the L-arabinose concentration, in order to verify that the dual reporter fluorescence can improve the sensitivity of our detection.
3.The Test of Whole Route
 After we had proved that the strong promoter, cyclic amplifier and the dual fluorescence system can enhance the signal and improve the sensitivity, we transformed the whole genetic circuit BBa_K2305000 into the E.coli ΔLysA. It was cultured in LB medium till its OD600 had reached 0.4. Then aliquots of 100ul were transferred into M9 medium to deplete lysine. After "

When doing the initial research for our synthetic alternative to palm oil components, we quickly came across lots of information regarding the current palm oil industry. It soon became apparent that the economies of some countries, for example Indonesia and Malaysia, depend almost entirely upon the current methods of palm oil production. Therefore we compiled a detailed impact analysis report for synthetic palm oil, which can be found by clicking on the button to the right.
Is The Palm Oil Industry Irreplaceable?
There’s no doubt about it, the economies of Malaysia and Indonesia, amongst other countries, rely heavily on the cultivation of palm oil.
But could there be a viable alternative, another industry which could support the economy as effectively?
Industries such as livestock[1], agriculture[2], services[3], tourism[4] and so on are already well-established and support the countries’ economies alongside the palm oil industry
Focussed development on any of the industries is foreseen to maintain the economies but in the meantime, environmental problems arise. Livestock industry, first of all, results in land-clearance in order to plant feed crops for the livestock. 8% of global water is used in the industry for different purposes[5] and the waste water or manure created, often composed of nutrients and harmful components, would be discarded into rivers and seas which affect the natural water source. Water and soil are polluted by chemical pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture industry[6]. In Malaysia, tourism is considered as profitable as palm oil industry but disturbs the ecosystem[7] through the construction of tourism facilities and an increase in carbon footprints[8]. Perhaps most interesting, the biotech industry is strongly supported by the Malaysian government[9], suggesting that our project may well have a future on Malaysian and Indonesian soil (see Patenting )
The palm oil industry is well-known for having a short payback period and is highly productive. If replaced by another sector, the new industries"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"1. Structure of the 1.5 MDa MpIBP adhesin structure.
Adhesin
The first step to realizing Gelcatraz started with the identification of a suitable bacterial                       adhesin to anchor the E. coli bacteria to the hydrogel. Recently, a large 1.5 MDa adhesin was                       found in the Antarctic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis. This large adhesin, named M. primoryensis ice-binding protein (MpIBP), is 0.6 µm long and consists of more than 130                       domains. Its structure is shown in Figure 1. 120 of these domains encode for the same immunoglobin-like β-sandwich that rigidifies                       upon binding of Ca2+ and acts as extender projecting the binding                        domains positioned on top of the chain into the medium (4) .
In our design process, we envisioned that                       we could use the sugar binding domain of MpIBP, to bind to a sugar-based polymer.                        In this way, we can tether the E. coli bacteria to our hydrogel.                        On the other parts of the wiki, we will                       refer to the shortened version of MpIBP including the sugar binding domain as                       ‘adhesin’.
In its native host, the MpIBP adhesin is exported out of the cell using the single-step                       type I secretion machinery.  The type I secretion of the adhesin requires four protein                       domains. Hemolysin A (HlyA) is a protein domain C-terminal to the adhesin protein,                       signaling for type I secretion. Hemolysin B (HlyB), Hemolysin D (HlyD) and TolC are                       the other proteins which are responsible for forming a trans-periplasmic export channel                       upon interaction with the HlyA domain, as shown in Figure 1 (5) .                        In type I secretion, all                       proteins passing the β-barrel pore of TolC, a constitutively expressed outer membrane protein (6) , must remain unfolded (4) . The RIM                       and RIN domains of the adhesin (see Figure 1) are the only domains that fold                       independent of calcium. Calcium is naturally present in millimolar concentrations in                       sea water, the natural environment of M. primoryensis. The entire adhesin is translocated                       to the extracellular space where the domains fold, but the RIM and RIN domain are already                       folded in the cytosol and prevent translocation through the Tol"

Return the column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Return the column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Place the column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700ul of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
Place the column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.
Transfer the column into a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube (provided). Add 60-80ul of Eluent or deionized water to the center of the membrane to elute the DNA. Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.
Note: Pre-warm the Eluent or deionized water at 65℃ will generally improve elution efficiency.
7.Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Weigh agarose powder and TAE buffer according to a proper portion, and add them to a 100ml conical flask (we usually make 1.5% Agarose Gel).
Melt the mixture in a microwave until the solution becomes clear (don’t leave the microwave).
Let the solution cool down to about 40-50℃ and add DNA gel stain (usually we use EB), pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appropriate comb.
Let the gel cool until it becomes solid.
Pull out the comb carefully.
Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber.
Add enough TAE Buffer so that there is about 2-3mm of buffer over the gel.
Pipette DNA samples mixed with appropriate amount of DNA loading buffer (the dye/GeneFinder is in the loading buffer) into wells on the gel.
Run the gel at 135V for about twenty minutes.
8.Colony PCR
We carry out colony PCR in order to amplify a few copies of DNA across several orders of magnitude and check the length of DNA sequences between two designed primers.

1 NotI Concatemers
Used yesterday’s gel purified fragments. We performed ligation using a 5:1 ratio of insert to vector. Our vector size is 2046 bp. Our insert is 143 bp. For 1121 ng of vector, we need 391.75 ng of insert. We set up the ligation reaction as below:
Amount (uL)
Vector (112.12 ng/uL)
10
Insert (52.63 ng/uL)
10
10X T4 Ligase Buffer
2.5
T4 Ligase
3
Total
25.5
We used excess insert because the recorded concentration from the nanodrop was higher than the theoretical yield. In addition, we used more T4 Ligase than in typical reactions due to the reaction having three times as many sticky ends to ligate.
2 Results
We cast a 0.8% TAE agarose gel to separate the bands. We ran this particular gel at 90 V for 2 hours. We excised four bands indicated for gel purification (Qiagen). The bottom most band may be due to vector self-ligation. The second band at 2.2 kb is probably singly ligated product.
Figure 1: Ligation of 2CA NotI digested vector and insert. We excised the 4 indicated bands for purification.
In the future, we should CIP treat the vector so it doesn’t re-ligate."

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Ethics#SL Conference_-_-_TEXT.html," a varied audience (of academics, the general public, ethicists, etc.) would contribute many different viewpoints to such discussions.
In addition to our exploration of E3LS, we also watched a live online conference, called “Seeking Common Ground in the Ethical Debates about Techno-Sciences like Syn-Bio” (June 24th 2009), which was conducted by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Hastings Centre. This Conference provided our University of Calgary iGEM Team with another framework to work with called the Precautionary (critics of Synthetic Biology) and Proactionary (Advocates of Synthetic Biology) Framework. We used this framework to examine the different perspectives of the Critics and Advocates of Synthetic Biology. The Precautionary Framework suggests that even if there is a slight chance that some work has the potential to cause harm than either the research project should be aborted or there should be extensive research on the ethical implications and the potential harms of the research project prior to beginning it. On the other hand, the Proactionary principle suggests that synthetic biology has an inherently positive attitude and that the field has great potential to solve issues facing our society. This framework could also be discussed in the form of a conference, as supporters of either side could easily be reached to share their viewpoints in a public debate.
Based on our exploration in these two frameworks, we have developed a list of topics that can be explored through a future Second Life Ethics Conference. In general, some of the issues that would be up for discussion include:
Why is it important to discuss the ethical aspect of synthetic biology?
iGEM is a synthetic biology competition where undergraduate teams from all over the world come and compete for the best syn-bio project. Do you think that these undergraduate teams need to discuss the ethical aspect of their project prior to their project? What sort of ethics considerations may be most important from an undergraduate student's perspective?
What are some of the ethical issues that the field of synthetic biology has to face? Is there some kind of balance between costs and benefits of the potential applications, and how can this be reached?
Some people believe that publications in the field of synthetic biology should be self regulated while others believe that the publications should be regulated by the government. What is your opinion?
E3LS is a way to categorize the ethical issues surrounding the synthetic biology. Is either of the categories more important than the rest or all of the categories are equal in significance?
Some argue that the open-source system of synthetic biology and the Parts Registry is problematic, especially with the increasing number of patents of genetic sequences"

Introduction: What is InterLab
Reliable and repeatable measurement is key to synthetic biology. It is essential for a standard protocol to be established so that the same measurements can be repeated in different labs. This year's interlab study is aimed to reduce the variability of cell count measurements by replacing OD600 measurement which varies between labs with directly counting of colony forming units (CFU) to determine the number of cells in each sample. Then the mean GFP expression level by each cell can be determined by dividing the already standardized GFP expression level of the sample by the number of cells in that sample.
This is the 5th year of InterLab and we have the following question:
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?

During the first day, we resuspended DNA from distribution kit (Kit Open Day!) and transformed the plasmids into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells.
For the second day, firstly we picked single colonies from transformation plates and prepared overnight cultures; we also finished particle and fluorescence calibration.
The third day was fairly occupied.

SynCity The SynCity event was organized by the Laboratory of Systems & Synthetic Biology at Wageningen University & Research. The event was a film and art festival held on the 5th and 6th of October about synthetic biology to involve the general public in this field. Here, both citizens, scientists and students could discover the field of synthetic biology and how it can be used for many purposes. This is done from an artistic point of view. Via art, synthetic biology is depicted, for example with a series of short movies. Together with iGEM Wageningen 2014, we presented our view and projects.
Moreover, as follow-up of the SynCity days two dialogue evenings were organised in which synthetic biology issues were discussed. These evenings were set up as workshops and were open to the general public. This was a nice opportunity for us to discover the different interpretations of synthetic biology and the chances or pitfalls it offers for society according to the general public. This also included a discussion on the role of implication analysis and risk evaluation in science. Staff members mentioned that in their daily work, not much attention was paid to thinking about the societal implications of their studies, although it becomes a more and more important part of acquiring funding or approval of research proposals. A consensus was reached that discussions such as these are important for both scientists and the general public to exchange their visions and expectations of synthetic biology and its implications. This way, the field of synthetic biology will become both highly innovative while being publicly accepted. This shows again that public engagement is an important part of projects such as iGEM, and science in general."",,Engaged with the public to spread awareness of synthetic biology and share information about their project with the rest of the world.,,,

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed."

Professor Keith Pardee
Professor Keith Pardee is an assistant professor at the leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto. His research looks into the potential of moving synthetic biology outside of the cell, rather than using cells to host engineered genetic programs. Having read about Keith’s research, some of our team attended one of his talks on cell-free technologies. He informed us about how microorganisms are not compatible with a lot of applications of synthetic biology, and how cell-free systems could solve a lot of these issues. This was our first big introduction to cell free and we became very excited about the possibilities this would have for our project. His talk also highlighted the key future goals of biotechnology as being low cost, using simple technology, and ensuring the difficult science is completed before application - which can be achieved by cell free technologies. Furthermore, cell free systems do not require a cold chain to be maintained during transport and storage making them ideal for our diagnostic destined for use in the field. In addition, Keith suggested that 37 degrees is the optimum temperature therefore our device would still function in Chagas endemic regions which have a high average temperature.
After the talk we approached Dr. Pardee for project-specific advice, including practical advice on the sequence of addition of certain components of our system such as adding TetR before freeze-drying to obtain greater activity. He pointed us towards a protocol for making our own cell-free extract. He further suggested that YFP on a paper system may be problematic as the auto-fluorescence of the paper may match the YFP signal, however this is no longer an issue as we later chose not to use a paper based system for our diagnostic. Dr. Pardee’s suggestions for future experiments, we could do with blood were promising especially as he said he had tried to get a cell-free system to work in blood plasma, giving us the confidence to continue with the idea of being able to use a blood sample as our detection medium. Finally, he also gave us some advice on how long this cell-free system would take to get started, which we were able to  input into our models and gain a more representative values for our parametres.

Getting the young interested in sciences is a tough but fruitful effort. My main ambition                          in working with this team was just this. Working with high schoolers was dramatically                          different from what I accustomed to; working with college students. This brought some                          challenges, but it was worth it. Teaching high school students how to work in a lab was hard                          or both parties. Seeing them overcome all of those was refreshing; it’s unbelievable how they                          have grasped things my college students have a hard time doing so."

Tool Overview
The eLabNotebook is an electronic lab notebook that facilitates collaborative, effective, and safe assembly of biological systems. The eLabNotebook allows users to:
Capture multimodal data inside and outside the lab with minimal effort
Follow a protocol in the lab while modifying and annotating steps as needed
Access a wide variety of digital resources
Get an overview of current activity and progress
share physical and digital resources in real-time
The implementation of the eLabNotebook entails:
Developing light-weight interaction techniques for capturing information
Considering strategies for organizing and sharing heterogeneous information
Visualizing current lab activity and progress
Designing for multiple contexts and devices
The eLabNotebook will be initially prototyped on the iPad platform.
In this project, we were motivated by the disconnect that we observed between biologists' planning stages and their work in the lab, and by the large amount of time the biologists spent maintaining their notebooks during lab work.  Often, when biologists planned for the future, they would create a long-term plan with multiple involved steps, each building on the last.  However, there was much planning to be done before the biologists could begin their actual work: they had to figure out what protocols were necessary for each step of their work, check that there were enough supplies in the stock room for those protocols, and schedule lab time with other students to ensure that no two people needed to use a machine at the same time.  While iGEM teams had many creative solutions to these problems, including the use of Google Docs and spreadsheets to share information about samples, or Doodle polls for lab scheduling, there was no simple way for them to accomplish all of these tasks simultaneously.
Over the summer, we studied biologists in their lab and observed their work practices. We interviewed biologists and asked about the challenges they encountered in the lab. We brainstormed with them"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

These results clearly show that expression of PtNTT2 leads to a reduced final cell density and slower growth. Furthermore, the different variants of PtNTT2 differ highly, indicating that some variants of PtNTT2 negatively affect the growth rate and final cell density.
Microcultivations of the Different PtNTT2 Variants
Due to the high price of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates, performing experiments such as cultivations in a small volume is desirable. Therefore, we validated whether cultivations in micro well plates can achieved the same results as cultivations performed in shake flasks and optimized the method . The optimal conditions for cultivations in a small volume were determined as follows: 12 well plates with a cultivation volume of 1 mL, 37 °C and 600 rpm. To analyze the growth of the different PtNTT2 variants in a micro cultivation, the shake flask cultivation was repeated in a 12 well plate. All cultures were inoculated with an OD600 of 0.1. Three biological replicates of each strain were tested and three technical replicates were measured at each time point. The results are shown in Figure 5.

We were inspired by the pioneer work from the TecMonterrey team of 2013 iGEM competition, which demonstrated that the TAT-Apoptin could kill tumor cells. Furthermore, they used a hypoxia promoter from E. coli to regulate the expression of TAT-Apoptin so that this protein could be expressed in the anaerobic regions, such as regions inside the solid tumors.
Although TAT-Apoptin could induce the apoptosis of tumor cells effectively, it seemed that E. coli was not a suitable vehicle to deliver TAT-Apoptin into tumors. We thought that anaerobic microorganisms might be more effective than E. coli to target the tumor tissues. After extensive literature searching and consulting with experts from different research fields, we found that Bifidobacterium longum (B.longum) should be an ideal vehicle to deliver TAT-Apoptin. First, B. longum only grows in anaerobic regions, which means that the expression of TAT-Apoptin from B. longum can only happen in anaerobic regions, such as the anaerobic regions inside solid tumors. More importantly, B. longum is safe to human body since it produces no toxin to the host. Furthermore, it has anti-tumor biological effects. Considering all these information, we have chosen B. longum instead of E.coli to express the TAT-Apoptin.
Improvement
To facilitate the expression of TAT-apoptin in B. longum, many biobricks have been replaced or added in the devices. First of all, Tmp1, originally cloned from the plasmid of Bifidobacterium that contains one ori and two orf sequences was added as the first biobrick to regulate the expression of the TAT-apoptin in B. longum. In addition, the promoter and RBS sequence from hup gene of B.longum that could function in the recombinant plasmid inside B. longum was also added to regulate the expression of this protein. To facilitate the secretion of TAT-apoptin, the signal peptides of Sec2 and Tmp1 were added to direct the secretion process of the fused"

The only living biological material that could escaped from the lab would be our E. coli host for DNA cloning and      parts characterization, and there is little risk associated with their leakage because we are using DH10B as the       major cloning host in which the strain is auxotrophic for leucine, and therefore rendering it unlikely to propagation       outside laboratory environment. The strains of E. coli we use in lab, DH10B and DH5alpha, are also routinely used lab       strains that are innocuous and non-virulent.
Researcher Safety
Tacking risk of organism, only non-virulent part was extracted from genomic DNA of non-virulent S. pneumoniae strain       obtained from Professor Patrick Chiu Yat Woo at Hong Kong University.      For chassis, only Biosafety Level 1 organisms (DH10B and DH5alpha) are dealt in the lab.       All members are trained to deliver safe lab practices. In dealing with toxic chemicals such as DMSO, we wear lab coats      and gloves and execute under fume hood.      All experiments are conducted in a lab premise under authorized supervision.      Risks with handling toxic chemicals, including DMSO, phenol and chloroform,       which include chemical burns and damage to the health of team members in the long run, have been addressed.      We wear lab coats and gloves whenever we handle these chemicals to minimize exposure to these chemicals,       and we carry out bulk management of these chemicals inside a well ventilated fume hood.      Risks associated with UV exposure during gel documentation and excision are also minimized by wearing face shields       and gloves until the UV light is off.
University Safety
Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO) is responsible for safety regulations at our institution,       The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST.      We, team members, have not directly discussed our project with the director of HSEO but, our supervisors have.      After discussing the risks, we decided to operate only on the genomic DNA of a non-virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and       we are not handling the live bacteria itself.

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview#current tools_-_-_TEXT.html," technique, it has several disadvantages such as high cost, requirement of laboratory settings of high standards and false positives due to detection of pathogenic DNA EVEN AFTER the resolution(clearance) of the disease. Finally, PCR amplifies the DNA in a sample and  only gives qualitative results. While Real-Time PCR can give information on the initial amount of the sample, it requires RNA samples which are degraded by RNases in the body and even if it isn't, it requires a well equipped laboratory to prevent further degradation.Therefore, this method cannot be used reliably in  many parts of the world (especially in the underdeveloped countries).
Another technique that can be used to detect pathogens through their DNA is DNA-hybridization, but the downside with this method is that it is labor intensive and involves the use of radio-labelled probes.
Detection by Microscopy
As mentioned before, microscopy has been the mainstay for detection of pathogenic fungi. This is primarily due to the fact that it's one of the oldest and most widely available means of detection. It only requires a microscope, a stain for contrast, the sample from a patient and a user with some experience. Furthermore, this technique requires neither the consideration of multiple parameters (such as in a PCR) nor much time (agar plate cultures need at least a day) to yield results.
Thus, we believe that improving detectability through microscopy by giving it the advantage of molecular biology (specificity and a better scope for visualization) while maintaining the advantages of conventional microscopy.

Biogurt: A Sustainable and Savory Drug Delivery System
Streptococcus mutans, the main cause of dental caries, binds to glycoproteins on the teeth. A clinical study (Kelly CG et al.; Nature Biotechnol. 1999) isolated the 20aa functional segment (p1025) that S.mutans uses to attach to the teeth. p1025 competitively inhibits the binding of S.mutans, causing unharmful bacteria to grow in its place, preventing the recolonization of S.mutans for 90 days.
We are engineering Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a bacteria commonly found in yogurt, to produce and secrete this peptide under a promoter activated by lactose.
The peptide p1025 could simply be added to any food. But production of this peptide by L. bulgaricus is an independent process, so inserting the gene into live bacteria in yogurt will enable continuous production. Since a new batch of yogurt can be made using the bacteria from a small  amount of the old batch, a continuous supply of teeth-cleaning yogurt will be available from the first successfully engineered batch. This could be the key to providing effective dental health care in underdeveloped rural communities, especially if yogurt is already an integral part of the diet.
Also, the p1025 gene could be replaced by any other gene, so this same expression system could be used to produce other useful peptides.  Yogurt with modified bacteria will provide a cheap, efficient, and delicious way to distribute vitamins, vaccines and more.

I have just finished my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.).  Currently, I am starting my graduate studies in the field of microbiology and quantitative Biology (M.Sc.) at the Technion's department of Biology. iGEM gave me the opportunity to undergo a full study process, from defining  a problem, to designing a solution  as well as modeling and working in the lab. During my participation in iGEM I have discovered the great potential of combining quantitative studies with traditional and innovative biological methods.

Hello, I'm a fourth year student at the Technion Institute of Technology, I am studying Biochemical Engineering and Chemistry Science. I am fascinated by engineering-science interplay. I decided to join the iGEM competition because I felt that this would be the only chance I would get in my B.Sc. career to prove that the combination between nano-chemistry and synthetic biology can lead to solving critical problems that would not be able to be solved by these fields separately. Apart from my educational interests, I would like to play an important role in a comeback of Breaking Bad  and to make some ""safe"" chemistry stuff.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," characterized by its enormous interdisciplinarity, bringing together scientists from different disciplines. […] I feel that it is necessary to implement this thinking in the curriculum of our universities.”
Luis Serrano (Design of Biological Systems, Barcelona, Spain)
Can you define synthetic biology?
“For me synthetic biology differs from biotechnology that it uses rational engineering and design.”
Victor De Lorenzo (Centro National de Biotechnología, Madrid, Spain)
Throughout the years how did your opinion on synthetic biology change? Did you accomplish something that you thought would never be possible?
“My view of synthetic biology has changed in the last few years from being just a mere extention of molecular genetics […] into something that allows us to understand and also to reprogram biological systems with a degree of predictability.”
It was very interesting to us to find out whether other renowned scientists working in other fields could be able to at least answer the simple question “what is synthetic biology?”. We, therefore, tried to involve other non-synthetic biologists in our video project. Some of them found the time to reply showing interest in the project, but eventually did not get to the point to really contribute a video due to their tight schedule. To bypass the problem of having to ask people per mail and not in person, we had the idea to interview speakers that visited a conference here in Heidelberg. We were surprised to see how well they could explain concepts related to synthetic biology!! Yet, to be honest, the conference was on systems biology, a field very close to synthetic biology, so it is perhaps not too surprising that they showed such high competence in this topic.
Eytran Ruppin (University of Maryland, USA)
How does synthetic biology impact medicine?
“Synthetic Biology is at a stage[…] where there is a lot of promise or a lot of hype and yet you need to deliver.”

Which is the best way in your opinion to educate the new generations in synthetic biology?
“Synthetic Biology is happening and therefore we need students who can do it and critically think about it.”

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#lab_-_-_TEXT.html," or economical as the physical and chemical bio-containment methods that Synthace currently employ. One of his concerns was that increasing the complexity of an industrial strain makes reproducibility and scalability more difficult. Any mis-control of the switch would incur cost as the run of that culture would die. For these reasons Dr Gershater thought that if increased containment is needed, investment in better physical containment is more effective and economical than biological methods. We decided to test how a kill switch might behave in an industrial setting by performing a continuous culture in a ministat (see here for details). In this way we could test how viable a containment strategy kill switches are when used in industry.
We then contacted Dr Tom Ellis  who leads research in synthetic biology and synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London. His view was that kill switches are not necessarily inherently flawed, but they are a lot more prone to breaking by mutation than other possible mechanisms (e.g. auxotrophs). He suggested that multiple mechanisms could be combined that each have less than 1 in a billion escape rates. This would could give an escape rate of 1 in 1020. As a result of this and our own ideas we designed a system that would incorporate both KillerRed, a kill switch already in the registry and KillerOrange, a new part. Both could work together to provide a more effective kill switch and provide the increased efficiency that Dr Ellis talked about. This influenced the design of the CRISPR based kill switch we had hoped to develop as we intended to test the effect of targeting multiple essential genes within the host genome instead of just one.
We spoke to Prof. Robert Beardmore EPSRC Leadership Fellow in the Mathematical Biosciences at Exeter University. Much of his research has been into antibiotic resistance. We discussed how high selection pressure is applied by prolonged use of antibiotics and how kill switches may be analogous to this. It is clear that cells which develop a mutation that inactivates the kill switch would be strongly selected for. It was estimated that functional loss of the kill switch would occur in a short amount of time as a result, and if this was the case, could have strong implications for kill switch longevity. Because of this discussion we decided to test the effectiveness of kill switches over time in the ministat. We measured the efficiency of KillerRed and KillerOrange over time in a continuous culture and found that within a week the efficiency of the kill switch was reduced to the level of the control. (see results ).
We then interviewed Professor Richard Titball, leader of the Microbes and Disease research group at Exeter University. We asked him about potential applications of"

Bristol,2017,Team:Bristol#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," West MP Darren Jones gave us feedback on our project and outlined some benefits and potential drawbacks of our proposed implementation - ideas which we were able to integrate into our Scenario Analysis .
Foresight Analyst Maree Conway - a PhD student at the University of Swinburne, Melbourne - and Dr Michael Reinsborough at BrisSynBio, gave us invaluable advice on how to structure and present our Scenario Analysis.
Dr Tim Chatterton , an expert in air pollution at the University of the West of England, highlighted potential problems with our project and some of the risks and challenges we could face communicating our project to the public. This forced us to think more carefully about the details of various aspects of the project, in particular pod design, which would require a large, but not overly intrusive, surface area, and would need to facilitate high efficiencies. He also highlighted the importance of considering the full life cycle implications of our project, raising concerns regarding release of NOx back into the environment if the ammonia our pods produced were used as fertiliser. This encouraged us to plan to integrate an MFC into our pod design which would utilise the ammonia at source.
Prof Eddie Wilson helped us with our Integrated Human Practices by directing us toward recent projects attempting to mitigate NOx pollution which we were able to learn from. He also stressed important pod design considerations, in particular the need for a large surface area.
Prof James Ladyman stressed the importance of effective communication with the public in order to generate the all-important trust which will enable us to implement our pods in the real world, without scandal. He also emphasized the importance of transparency, using language and analogies that the wider public will understand. This helped inspire us to create our media guide, to assist ourselves and others to communicate with the public. It also encouraged us to be active in creating the numerous graphics on our Wiki, along with our educational Plasmid Hoopla game, to make our work more digestible.
Dr Chris Adams kindly lent us a flask of NOx to use as a prop at the Big Bang Fair.

Daniel's Testimonial
Working with the Duke 2017 iGEM team has been a really great experience. As someone who doesn’t have much background in bioengineering, the team has provided a very friendly environment in which I felt welcome. The members always encouraged asking for clarifications in the case that I was lost or confused so I’ve never felt embarrassed to ask any questions. Their instructions have been very clear and their feedback has been very supportive. The way in which they explained all the background and concepts behind every step in their process really demonstrated their passion and dedication for their project. I have learned a great deal already in what has been a short period of time and look forward to applying the skills I learned to next year’s project! -Daniel Getman

""Years from now we will treat most infections with bacteria and not antibiotics.""
Professor James Malone-Lee
Barlow Professor of Geriatric Medicine
A solution is urgently needed for the increasing number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The engineering of bacterial cells to fight human pathogens is a promising alternative to administering traditional antibiotics. Our project involves the use of synthetic biology to engineer living therapeutics that have the potential to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a major public health concern in developed countries. This is largely due to growing antibiotic resistance.
The Problem
Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
Problem with Antibiotics
Antibiotic use is associated with numerous negative side effects, allergies and reactions. The most common side effects of antibiotics all impact the digestive system and occur in around one in ten people. Around one person in fifteen has an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and cephalosphorins [ 10 ]. Half of the patients we spoke to during our project wanted us to find an alternative to using antibiotics, owing to the severity of the negative side effects that they experience.
Despite their negative side effects, antibiotics have been used so widely and for so long that the targeted microbes have adapted to become resistant, reducing the effectiveness of the drugs. A vicious cycle ensues in which ineffective antibiotic treatments leads to overprescription and overexposure, which amplifies the problem of antibiotic resistance. Global antibiotic consumption grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010. [ 27 ] Described by the Chief Medical Officer of England as “a threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ketide chain[13].
There are three kinds of module: loading module, elongation and modification module, termination module. Each module condenses and modifies one unit. Basic function of a module is to elongate the polyketide. So a module contains at least the domain KS, AT, ACP. The exist of DH, ER, KR might change the structure of polyketide. Some natural modules may contain unnecessary domain DH, ER, KR without any function. Loading module is the first module of PKS that starts the synthesis. Termination module only contains the domain TE that terminates the elongation of polykeitde. Both modules are connected by short adhesion or docking domains. Docking domain is a kind of connection which can arrange the order of module. It can direct the intermodular transfer of polyketide intermediates [13].
The formation of PKS requires for the reaction groups that come from coenzyme A. So that host should afford to synthesis the substrate. Suitable host can be chosen or engineered to provide the substrate. The substrate should be firstly linked to CoA that refers to as CoA-linked PKS extender units, which is building blocks of polyketide. The natural PKS utilize 18 compounds including malonyl-CoA,(2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA, and chloroethymalonyl-CoA and so on[14].
After the synthesis, the product may enter the steps of post-modification.
6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, is a complex product synthesized through the action of a 6-deoxyerythonolide B synthase (DEBS) by the soil bacterium S.erythraea. DEBS from Saccharopolyspora erythraea has served as a model system for discovering ways to engineer PKSs .The DEBS subunits are encoded by three contiguous erythromycin A (eryA) genes. The gene is divided into three genes, which are organized into six modules that specify how each two-carbon unit of the final product is assembled [15].(Figure2)

Sporovector
Our Sporovector is specially designed to give you the opportunity to easily create Sporobeads with any fusion protein you can think of. The part between the EcoRI and PstI is available as BioBrick in pSB1C3 and can be cloned in any of our empty B. subtilis vectors. We also offer it “precloned” in pSBBs4S, which in this version lacks the NgoMIV restriction sites.
The Sporovector was created by ligation of three cut PCR-products with special overhangs (PcotYZ, mRFP and cgeA-B0014). It is designed to allow N-terminal fusions of genes in Freiburg standard ( RFC25 ). Towards that end, the gene to be inserted must be cut with XbaI and AgeI and the vector must be digested with XbaI and NgoMIV. This removes the RFP cassette and allows easy selection for the integration of the new insert. After ligation, there is a scar of six nucleotides between both genes but no restriction site left.
Expression of the gene fusion is controlled by the PcotYZ-promoter, which was the strongest in our promoter evaluations. The C-terminal part of the resulting fusion gene encodes CgeA, one of the two known spore crust proteins.
The vector is finished but has not yet been tested with an insert. We are working on three additional Sporovectors to also offer C and N-terminal fusions with both cotZ and cgeA.

To see how students who previously knew nothing about synthetc biology react to such a motion: where they will get the information, what type of arguments they will come up with, will they consider things from a different angle that we do?
They learned a lot in just a week. They got their information through the internet and friends (for e.g, the first thing Ivan Palenick did was to call his friend that does a PhD in biotechnologies).
To get the audience's feedback on the debate and views on the question.
The debate with the audience waw very rich, as it can be seen from the video.
To bring together scientists and non scientists to discuss releasing gentically modified bacteria in the wild.
The public was made up of scientists and none scientists. At th end, the debate was opend to the floor. They all discussed together and with debators.
That the debate be accessible to everyone
the speaking skills of the debators were excellent, and they used many images, which made the debate understandable to all (even people that came in knowing nothing about the subject).
We would like to add that everyone had a really great time.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," express the mutant protein, compare its binding energy with the original protein through ITC test and in turn model our work or optimise the algorithm we use (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Design of receptor optimisation experiments.
In conclusion of our project design, we test different binding domains of VEGF and D-Dimer by both BiFC and overall experiment. Also, we attempt to carry out in silico protein design to increase the binding affinity and prove its results in wet lab. Through all these experiments we are able to construct, test and optimise the STEP system, and make it ready for application in cancer cell therapy.
