We codon-optimized the sequence of this monomeric far-red fluorescence protein for the use in B. subtilis and synthesized it (by GeneArt ) with pre- and suffix of the Freiburg standard. We cloned this reporter in front of the terminator B0014. For the evaluation, this reporter was successfully combined with the promoters PliaI, PlepA and the Anderson promoter J23101 in the empty Bacillus vector pSBBs1C from our BacillusBioBrickBox. At the moment we already have the right construct integrated into the chromosome of B. subtilis. Unfortunately, we have not yet measured this reporter.

This evaluated lacZ gene is derived from the Bacillus reporter vector pAC6. It is constructed in the Freiburg Standard ( RFC 25 ) for in-frame fusion proteins. It also includes a ribosome binding site optimized for Bacillus subtilis translation. This lacZ BioBrick was tested in the expression vector pSBBs0K-Pspac. This construct gave output, so the reporter gene is functional qualitatively. See Data in the vector evaluation section of pSBBs0K-Pspac. A more qualitatively measurement will follow soon.

luc ( BioBrick:BBa_K823028 )
The luc gene encodes the monomeric firefly luciferase, which requires a special substrate to produce luminescence. We codon-optimized it for Bacillus subtilis, added a ribosome binding site and synthesized by GeneArt .
Firefly luciferase is by far the most commonly used bioluminescent reporter. This monomeric enzyme of 61kDa catalyzes a two-step oxidation reaction to yield light, usually in the green to yellow region, typically 550–570nm . The first step is activation of the luciferyl carboxylate by ATP to yield a reactive mixed anhydride. In the second step, this activated intermediate reacts with oxygen to create a transient dioxetane that breaks down to the oxidized products,"

Imm2 binds in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, so if the level of Imm2 in the cell should fall below the level of E2, then E2 is free to function. We hypothesised that by fine-tuning of the expression of these genes, we could cause the Imm2 concentration to drop below that of E2 at a defined time. This time point would be the point at which the instructor plasmid would start to be degraded. We therefore made some alteration to Darmstadt's design to make it applicable for the release of maxicells.
The first alteration was to the Immunity protein construct (Imm2). We have inserted I-Sce1 sites flanking the imm2 gene in the plasmid. This makes the system compatible with the                                       ‘Homing Endonuclease’ (I-SceI) method of maxicell production. When I-SceI expression is induced to digest the chromosome, the imm2 gene will also be cut out and therefore is no longer expressed. Imm2               protein levels will fall over time until Colicin-E2 protein is no longer bound by Imm2 and is free to digest the plasmid.
Following environmental release, conditions for the maxicell will be uncontrolled and variable. Therefore, the longer the maxicell is in the environment, the higher the probability               of a chance maxicell lysis event, and release of the plasmid into the surroundings. The plasmid may then be picked up by other prokaryotes in the environment. It is important that the instructor plasmid is               degraded before this occurs. However, we do not want to inhibit maxicell function (whatever that may be) by destroying the instructor plasmid too early. Ideally, plasmid degradation should occur immediately               prior the to the end of the active metabolic lifetime of the maxicell. Timing of plasmid destruction by Colicin should be finely tuned meaning selection of promoters and ribosome binding sites for E2 and Imm2               expression is crucial in order for degradation to occur at the desired point in time.
We have used rational design in order to select the promoters and ribosome binding sites necessary for triggering plasmid degradation at the point we estimate our maxicells will no longer be               metabolically active (see 'Quantifying Maxicell Timeframe' above). We have designed a model that predicts the degradation time point for every possible promoter-RBS combination for Colicin and Imm2               using the Anderson promoters and"

Viviane Chansavang (INSA Alumna)
iGEM 2011, 2012, 2013 and... 2014? I guess we can call it dedication...or is it addiction?
I graduated from INSA de Lyon in September 2013, worked hard in the organizing committee of the Europe Regional Jamboree in October 2013, and then traveled across the planet to sunny Southern California for my first job. Although I traded in the bench for a desk, I'm still showing support to my home team. Working at the Office for Science and Technology of the Embassy of France in the US, I am striving at fostering partnerships between French and American labs in the field of life sciences.
Valérie Forest (EMSE)
Graduated in Biologic and Medical Engineering, I am assistant Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne. I especially work in the field of nanotechnologies, but our engineering school is also highly interested in the development of synthetic biology and strongly believes in its outstanding applications. The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.

We need to almost embed an Athena swan ethos in everything we do
Professor Michelle Ryan had previously been heavily involved in the Athena Swan group and highlighted its importance in improving gender equality and diversity at the university and nationwide. Dr Dixon had commented that her department was trying to implement equality and diversity ethos directly into their work so they can drive forward changing attitudes in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences, however Professor Ryan suggested that Athena Swan activities and attitudes should implemented in not just the core sciences but also our own attitudes to work. She believed the reason why gender was being targeted so prominently at this university was because the
has become a lot more visible
and people have been more empowered to comment on the problem and act against it.
We know fifty percent of our student body are women so if you going to address one type of inequality that affects everyone, everyone is of a certain gender so it affects absolutely everyone
This provided us with a good answer for why the university was focusing so much attention on gender inequality and seemingly putting the changing of other forms of diversity on the back burner, that we hadn’t considered. But Professor Ryan did inform us that the University are in fact working hard to improve diversity as a whole at the university with the rise of groups like Stonewall, who fight for equality in terms of sexuality, but also programmes that look to improve racial and religious equality too. The conclusive point we were left with from Dr Wilson, was that we should make the whole University an inclusive and accepting place for all, recognising that science and scientific degrees are not gender specific subjects. Professor Ryan further emphasised this point, commenting that by embedding the ethos of Athena Swan into all our actions, we can make ensure the University is distinctly inclusive.
One of the main themes that has been recurring throughout this research highlighting equality and diversity at the university, has been the issue of the confidence of women. Professor Ryan had an alternative perspective to the majority of the academics we have met with. She highlighted that the issue with all the programme giving women
leadership training
and more confidence in their own abilities, is the fact that there is a fine line between improving and intervening.
I worry about them a little bit when they come across as trying to fix women as if there is something wrong
In the very first interview with Dr Griffiths, he suggested this same problem, that as a man he was uncomfortable with coming across in a patronising manner when"
KUAS_Korea,2017,Team:KUAS Korea#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the topic was good enough to draw attention from participants.
Last but not least, the leader suggested future outlook of synthetic biology and awakened everyone growing importance. At the end, everyone including both participants and organizers gathered together to discuss the ethical issue of synthetic microbes. On the industrial stance, regulations are to be relieved for its progress and production. However, it is different on civil side in that it is not proved whether he would have potential problems regarding health when one takes a transformed microbe. We had a heated debate on the topic which lasted for more than an hour.
Throughout the sessions, 35 students participated in average and among them, there were even students from other majors that are not related to biology. It seemed that various students were interested. Feedback was generally good in that the field was new for them, thus interesting and discussed subjects were somehow related to their lives.
These are the graph and comments of the participants from survey research.
We focused our survey on an understanding of synthetic biology since the seminar targeted on general undergraduates including non-biology major students. Most of the students who major in biotechnology showed deep and good understanding while the non-major students showed general and very low understanding. Overall, we were able to satisfy most of the participants.
Participant’s Comments
- I have heard of synthetic biology but did not have a chance to learn about it. It was a good opportunity to get to know about general synthetic biology. I’m actually looking forward to joining the KUAS team in 2018.
- Through the seminar, I got a general idea of synthetic biology and got interested in further studies. It was the usage of synthetic biology in the field of environmentology which caught my eyes. I have never thought of solving the environmental problems we are facing within the tools of genetic engineering. I hope the KUAS team to have more sessions in the future.font>
- Rather than simply engineering some genes of organisms, the concept of ‘designing the system’ attracted me into the synthetic biology. Although I’m short on my biological knowledges, the lecture was understandable since the KUAS team prepared a lot of materials for the lecture, and kindly explained the things that could be hard for us to understand.
Engagement with direct stakeholders
As we have described above, yet in Korea, there are noticeable deficiencies of interest in both public and academia in synthetic biology. Consequently, this directly leads to insufficient supports and discussions on the field.
For the public engagement, team KUAS_Korea concluded that the top priority is to communicate with the domestic academia especially with current and young-future science professionals. In order to promote a discourse"

Dr. Jeff Gralnick - Microbiology, University of Minnesota
Jeffrey Gralnick has extensively studied the physiology of Shewanella, a species of gram-negative bacteria found throughout the world in aquatic environments. By understanding the molecular mechanism that enables this species to respire a diversity of compounds - including insoluble minerals - he hopes to engineer strains that can generate power in microbial fuel cells or react against certain toxic metals in the environment.
Working in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Bond, Gralnick made a key discovery about how bacteria can convert organic compounds into electricity. It was observed that riboflavin (commonly known as vitamin B-2) was responsible for much of the energy produced by Shewanella bacteria growing on electrodes. Riboflavin produced by the bacteria was able to carry electrons from the living cells to the electrodes, and rates of electricity production increased by 370 percent as riboflavin accumulated. This finding has major implications for the development of scaled-up microbial fuel cells using similar bacteria.
Gralnick is developing strains, tools and techniques for increasing the robustness of using Shewanella for metabolic engineering and downstream applications in both Bioenergy (microbial fuel cells), Bioremediation and Biocatalysis.

In the meantime we also need to grow up cultures containing the plasmid backbone pMUTIN4, which will allow us in the near future to transfer our chosen BioBricks from the E.coli cells we are working with into Bacillus subtilis.
Another task which we have to complete is to prepare the BioBricks which are needed for our system and are found in the Spring Distributions.
Practical Outline
Three of our prepared BioBricks being kept on ice
Precipitate the ethanol from our DNA plasmids (containing the RFP and GFP genes) and analyse them through DNA gel electrophoresis.
Grow up some DH5alpha E.coli cells containing the pMUTIN4 plasmid vector
Hydrate and prepare BioBricks present in Spring Distributions.
Ethanol Precipitation
We used the ethanol precipitation protocol and carried out these steps:
Added 0.2ml of sodium acetate (a tenth of the volume of DNA) to 2mls of DNA from both GFP and RFP samples.
To these mixtures, 6.6ml of 100% ethanol was added.
The 8.8ml of GFP DNA + sodium acetate + ethanol solution was then divided into 8 Eppendorf tubes – each Eppendorf tube containing 1ml of solution.
In the same way, the 8.8ml of RFP DNA + sodium acetate + ethanol solution was then divided into 8 Eppendorf tubes – each Eppendorf tube containing 1ml of solution.
Both sets of Eppendorf tubes were then stored in the fridge for further work tomorrow.
Preparing cultures containing pMUTIN4
For this exercise 2 x 500ml flasks were used. Into each flask 100ml of LB solution was added (under aseptic conditions) and also to each flask 0.5ml of ampicillin was added (ampicillin resistance is conferred by the pMUTIN4 plasmid). A sample was then taken from an agar plate containing E.coli possessing pMUTIN4 and was added to each of the two flasks. The 500ml flasks were then left in the 37ºC shaking incubator overnight.

Results
2 uL ethanol is enough to kill the bees. Comparing to Bee. coli, who need at least 2.73 uL ethanol to inhibit growth, honey bees are more fragile than Bee. coli.
Future plan
Concerning possibility
According to the recent assay, it take 8 days from the invading of Nosema to the death of the bee. The time when suicide circuit activates should locate on around the 7th day, or the bee will be killed by Bee. coli. Based on modeling, our recent circuit design, which uses only two terminator with 0.98CC termination efficiency, it will activated the downstream positive feedback and kill the bee in 1 hour. We have concluded two ways to solve this problem.
Put more terminators behind the ROS promoter. By this way, we could postpone the death of the bee. We will clone different amount of terminators and measure the efficiency of each group to decide the number of terminators we should clone"

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Considering the big variety of cells across different tissues and species, NO-cGMP mechanisms are bound to vary and have designs that are specific to cell types. Thus,the model can serve as a general modeling framework for the study of NO-cGMP effects on the HEK293 as a complex cell signaling system. This framework can be tailored to address particular situations and can also be expanded to incorporate newly observed mechanisms.
In addition, based on scientific workers’ experimental and modeling research of HIV, we have established the model of simulating Lentivirus’ invading cells. Therefore, this model can be used as a reference for other iGEM teams to study Lentivirus.

We then added ATP to the mix and performed ligation at room temperature during the night.
Week 19th-25th September
We recieved all the GFP-FBD sequences and start the clonning by Golden Gate, the process is the same as for the before proteins we cloned, it is to say using common primers in 3' but specifics in 5' because the FBD different for each was there. Also in the design of primers we took in account the fact that the FBD is in 5' and there we need a codon start, since only 2 of the FBD started by a methionin codon. Therefore we added one extra aminoacids to these FBD which didn't start by Methionin's codon.
After do the cloning we transform the result of golden gate in DH5-alpha to amplify the plasmid and do Blue/White screening, in order to select positives (white colonies) and an additional PCR with the primers FNS17 and FNS18 which amplify the region of the plasmid flanking the inserted gene.
Here the photo of the colony PCR with the DH5-alpha cells, the negative control is the result of golden gate but with water instead of insert, therefore is the empty plasmid, with LacZ gene, from a blue colony.
We have them, since almost 1.5kb is the length we expected for the amplicons. YUJU!!
The next steps, are sequencing an ascertain that the plasmid has no mutations, and transform with this plasmid our strain BL21-DE3 to carry out the gene over expression. To do that we need previously to do a miniprep.
During this week we also design the primers to do the phusion proteins, XylE and CatE with the two different FBD, specifically: FBD1 and FBD10, We chose this ones because FBD is not specific and it could work a priori in any fabric and FBD10 becuase is a control which binds to cellulose.
This primers are quite long, more than 70 bp, since they include the hybridation region, the FBD (7aa  therefore 21bp) and the cutting region. It will be a challenge to do the PCR with such a long primers. The template will be the primers already constructed for the native"

4. Targeted Sequencing with dxCas9-Tn5
Once the in vitro functionality of the fusion protein was established, we used it as a tool to prepare samples for targeted sequencing using ONT MinION sequencing. We proved the targeted integration of DNA adapters compatible with Rapid Sequencing kit ( Oxford Nanopore Technologies ) and linked this activity to the pipeline of library preparation for sequencing. Data analysis proved the potential of the fusion protein to be used for targeted sequencing. To compliment our work, we also developed software tools to generate sgRNA arrays and adapters with barcodes needed for MinION sequencing and a software tool for sequencing data analysis to identify gene-doping DNA.
4.1 sgRNA Array Determination for Gene Doping Sequences
Design: We developed a tool that screens through a gene coding sequence, identifies possible Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequences for dxCas9 and analyzes the number of possible sgRNA molecules required for specific sites. One final specific site is chosen based on the lowest possible variation due to synonymous mutations, which was 12 for EPO cds, followed by generation of this array.
Results and interpretation: We generated a heat map that indicates the regions of human EPO gene with the lowest possible variation due to synonymous mutations (figure 20). The exon-exon junction (target sites that are gene-doping DNA-specific) is indicated with arrows in figure 20.
Figure 20. Heat map representing the total variation of EPO cds possible based on synonymous mutations. X axis represents EPO cds gene divided into subzones of 9 bp each. Subzones with darkest blue represent up to 18 possibilities of DNA (3 codons with 6 possible combinations each), whereas lightest subzones represent least number of possible DNA combinations. Junctions between exons are represented (in total 4 junctions) with their position in bp in EPO cds, number of identified PAM sequences and minimal number of sgRNAs required to cover all possibilities.
The model helped us to decide the best junction to be targeted by our fusion protein (junction with the least sgRNA posibilities). For EPO, it generated an array of 12 sgRNA at Junction three, with PAM sequence at position 232 bp of EPO CDS. For detailed information on the gRNA array model, please visit the model page .
4.2 Barcode DNA for Nanopore Sequencing
Design: We developed a tool useful for the generation of DNA barcodes within the sequencing adapters to identify samples’ subjects."

High School Outreach
The idea
To inform high school students about synthetic biology in general and our project in particular we conducted two workshops (on 2013-01-29 and 2013-04-28) in which we invited students to DTU. For the first workshop our guests were the "" Science Talents "", a selected group of 16 talented high schoolers from both Greenland and Denmark. The second workshop was given in front of 20 danish lifescience students and 11 international students from Norway, Hong Kong, China and the Netherlands.
The workshops consisted of three parts: Firstly a theoretical part in which we gave a lecture about the principles of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. Specifically we introduced the idea of biological parts and how they can be combined to create systems that help solve problems of our time. To illustrate this point we presented two iGEM projects from last year.
The lecture was followed by a practical part in which the students formed small groups and did a hands-on exercise. In this exercise we designed and printed paper parts that the students assembled into biological systems to solve a problem of their own choice.
The workshops concluded with the student groups explaining their systems to each other in short presentations.
Agenda
10:40 - Welcome and short Introduction.

For each one, plates 50 uL of 1:1 and 50 uL of 1:100 dilution.  The diultion was made by adding 0.5 uL of 1:1 to a puddle of 49.5 uL of sterile water on the plate.
made 1:10000 dilutions of Z0411 on ZaZar, GaGar, and LaLar by putting 0.5 uL of initial transformation mix into 49.5 uL sterile water.  Then, plated out 2 uL of this dilution into a puddle of 198 uL of water that had been applied to the plate.

Primer Designer Robot
This page describes the use of the Primer Designer Robot. If you would like to know how the algorithm works internally please click here .
The motivation to write the Primer Designer robot came directly from the Freiburg Bioware team. In one of the many casual meetings at the lab they told us, that a common mistake in Synthetic Biology is designing the wrong primers for PCR and thus wasting a lot of money and time. Since designing a primer is an easily automated process, we decided to develop this robot and include it into our project.
How to design a primer
This is the parameters menu of the Primer Designer Robot.
If you want to design a set of primers please select the sequence from the workspace that you want to amplify using PCR. If you have more than one or no sequence at all selected the Primer Designer will not work.
Now click the ""Design Primer"" Button in the Primer Designer's menu. You will see the menu as shown in the image above. In this menu you can select the desired melting temperature for the primers. If you want to you can also specify a start and endpoint in the target sequence. By default the robot will design a primer for the whole sequence.
Once you're done with the settings click ""send"".
The robot will now design the primers and display them like this:
If you are satisfied with the result, you can store both primers in the workspace, so you can export them. To do so just click the ""Store in Workspace"" Button. To make it easy to identify them there you can specify custom names for them first.
Brief Overview of Algorithm
Once activated the Primer Design first evaluates the input form and loads the sequence from the workspace.
The first primer is then assembled following these steps:
The robot adds one base after until the following restrictions are matched:
Primer length must be at least 18 Bases
Primer melting temperature must be close to the specified goal temperature
Primer must end with G or C
The temperatures are calculated using the formulas given on Oligocalc .
After the first primer is found the second primer is calculated the same, but with the first primers melting temperature as"

Overview
Our project aims to create a new kind of life form, mixed-reality cells, which are half-real and half-virtual. What should be mentioned is that mixed reality states occur only when a virtual and a real system are sufficiently similar.(Alfred Hübler, 2013). As two genetic oscillators built-in E.coli are alternative, we also simulate two e-oscillators in computer as virtual part corresponding to the genetic oscillators.
To reach the mixed-reality state, the approach is separated into three stages,the former two of which will be mentioned in modeling part. The first stage is virtual-virtual coupling. We use two e-oscillators of identical characteristics to simulate the mixed-reality process. They would transfer parameters and interact with each other to a coupled or synchronized state. Secondly, LED lamp is adopted to replace the fluorescence of real cell as the physical real part. It will connect with e-oscillator to compose a mixed-reality state of physical. On the other hand, it will show that our interface hardware could work as expected. At last, we wish to  achieve our goal, mixed-reality state. The genetic oscillator in E.coli will interact with e-oscillator in a computer through our interface hardware and gradually they would be strongly coupled.
E-oscillators
Two genetic oscillators, dual-feedback oscillator and quorum-sensing oscillator, are built in our wetlab, so we first analyze the important biological processes and construct ODE sets to simulate these two oscillators separately. However, due to the time interval between the expression of regulating protein and their binding to promoters, we improve our models more precise by DDEs. Once the better genetic oscillator is selected through experiments, we will adopt the corresponding one as the virtual part.

BioBrick Improvement
We decided to improve a BioBrick with the help of a recently developed mutagenesis technique called SAMURAI. The method was developed by Hu et al. [1] at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (under the name SPUX, later renamed SAMURAI [2]) and is a novel method for easily and quickly introducing the site-specific mutations. SAMURAI allows the user to introduce multiple mutations in the same gene in only one experiment. We wanted to explore the potential of this technique in relation to our project, but also to investigate how this method can be used within the frames of iGEM. Can it be a valuable resource for future iGEM teams? To answer this question, we first of all need to explain the SAMURAI procedure. After that follows a section about how we applied this technique to improve a BioBrick.
What is SAMURAI?
SAMURAI (Solid-phase Assisted Mutagenesis by Uracil Restricted Ablation In vitro) is an alternative site-directed mutagenesis method which utilizes uracil amplification, biotinylated primers and magnetic beads. SAMURAI allows the user to introduce multiple single-site mutations at once in the gene of interest, with high purity of the final product due to the total absence of wild-type DNA. [2]
How Does SAMURAI Work?
Amplify the wild-type DNA with a biotinylated forward primer and dAGCU (including uracil) instead of dAGCT (including thymine).
Bind the biotinylated top strand to streptavidin coated magnetic beads.
Separate the uracil-containing top strand from the bottom strand and discard the bottom strand. This is done by separating the strands with NaOH, collecting the beads with a magnet and washing away the rest.
Introduce the mutations via PCR. The mutations are introduced using 5’ phosphorylated DNA oligos (containing the mutations) annealing to the top strand, regular dNTPs and Phusion U polymerase, a polymerase which is able to work in both directions. Ligase is also added in this PCR step, to ligate the nicks arising in the bottom strand at the end of each oligo in the PCR reaction.
Release everything from the beads by heat incubation.
Dissolve the uracil-containing top strand (wild-type DNA not containing the mutations). For this, a restriction enzyme called USER enzyme is added, which cuts"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," backbone divided in two sets to loop over several levels of assembly. Level 0 modules are assembled into odd receiver plasmids (pOdd) with a kanamycin resistance by restriction with BsaI. Four odd level transcription units are assembled into one even level receiver plasmid (pEven) with a spectinomycin resistance by restriction with SapI. The system can be elevated to higher levels by looping over odd and even receiver plasmids exponentially by the factor of 4. For the case that less than 4 modules are needed spacer plasmids are offered of 200bp random DNA free of BsaI or SapI recognition sites to close the gaps. The level 0 parts’ fusion sites are designed using the PhytoBrick standard previously reviewed and are therefore compatible with GB 2.0 and MoClo. A further improvement of this system is the use of unique nucleotide sequences (UNS) set between single transcription units. This UNS allow highly efficient PCR amplification of single functional units and allow the assembly into the plasmids by overlap assembly methods like Gibson assembly as well.
Although this is an improved and very simple but useful system the usage of SapI delivers a 3 bp fusion site restricting the number of possible fusion sites to a lower number and simultaneously downgrading compatibility with previous systems.

Zhang figured out the algorithm to calculate the binding free energy between RBS mRNA and 16s rRNA and Han Tao started to write code for it at once. Now we have a simple program for calculating the binding free energy. So far we have worked out two algorithms to evaluate RBS strength.
2013.7.21
Zhang put forward 2 methods to evaluate RBS strength. The basic method is to use the PWM (position weight matrix) of the SD sequences and the spacer length between the SD sequences and start codon to calculate the relative strength. The second is to calculate the binding free energy between the RBS mRNA and the 16s rRNA in the ribosome.
Han Tao, Huang Xin and Rao are working together on the program code.
Qiu had finished the record module that we can add text, photo, table and so on. Because the record interface isn’t too concise, we should improve in the next week. At the same time, import and export function had accomplished. In the process of programming, we met with numerous difficulties. For completing the task better in the subsequences stage, Chen studied the jQuery. Next week, we will continue to work hard.
2013.7.28
HanTao began to deal with the GUI of the promoter evaluation part of our project.
Rao decides to inlay the BioBrick sequences data in our software as a text file.
ZhangYijuan had put forward the problem of how to determine the weight of motif similarity and spacer length score in the strength evaluation algorithm .After consulting with QiuRuosang, Zhang and QiuRuosang began to design experiments for the data needed to modify as well as validate our algorithm to evaluate both the promoter and RBS strength.
After the end of the third semester in this week, we invest a lot of time for the software production. Qiu had finished and modified the function of adding a photograph, table, step and the text. Difficulties in the database exceed we imagine. With increasing a lot of novel effect, login interface had been modified by Chen. Next week, we will tidy up the code for easier to read and improve the existing functionality.s

I finished my undergraduate degree in physics this year and moved straight into doing a PhD at the University of Aberdeen. My research is interdisciplinary between physics, maths and hydrology. I am looking at applying mathematical models to river networks in order to study their fractal properties. I hope to find a link between the geometric and physical properties in order to predict and control river behaviour. I also take extra classes in maths and evening classes in German. I really enjoyed working on the iGEM project over the summer months and I am looking forward to presenting our results at the iGEM jamboree in Boston this November!

Welcome!
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere graduate, undergraduate, and high school Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM started as a month-long course at MIT in 2003 in which students worked on simple genetic circuits. The class was soon turned into a summer competition which has continually evolved into it’s current form with over 250 teams from around the world competing each year. At the beginning of each summer teams are given a kit of biological parts which contains pieces of DNA submitted by other teams during previous years. At their respective schools, teams assembly their parts into devices and place them into living cells. This format provides an excellent learning opportunity and is especially motivating as students have much control over their team's project.
2006 marks the year that Purdue participated, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue continued to compete until 2010 when a lack of interest and funding prevented a team from competing. Fortunately interested increase and in 2012 Purdue began competing again. Our first year back we received a gold medal and advanced to the international competition at MIT, the following year we ranked third in the undergraduate division of North America at the 2013 regional competition.
Now we are back; bigger and better than ever! Our team continues to grow and although this year was difficult with an untrained board and some growing pains, you can expect us to continue striving at this year's iGEM competition"

For each transformation reaction, we recommend plating 100 μL of undiluted cells and 1:10 and 1:100 cell dilutions on antibiotic plates. Incubate the plates at 37 °C over night.
Standard BioBrick Assembly
modified from Silver lab :
This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

ThinkSTEAM
ThinkSTEAM is a non-profit organization with a mission to inspire and motivate girls by merging STEM and arts, thus           enhancing critical, problem solving and communication skills. More info about ThinkSteam can be found on their website . We gave a presentation on the principles of synthetic biology, as well as our project and cloning           techniques that were integral for our project. We also taught them about the concepts of transformation and selection,           making plates, making and running a gel. Furthermore, we gave the girls a tour around the lab, emphasizing safety,           and showing them how the Nanodrop machine, cold room, autoclave, and ultracentrifuge work.

HYPOTHEKids
HYPOTHEkids is an educational organization that offers summer program hosted in New York City to promote STEAM education among elementary school, middle school, and high school students. We worked with a branch in Harlem, consisting of elementary school and middle school students ages 4 through 11. We gave three different lectures on synthetic biology in this program, one to students ages 4 to 6, one to students ages 7 to 9, and one to students ages 10 to 11. For the students ages 4 to 6, we showed them an animation of cellular processes and specifically explained the portion regarding DNA synthesis, transcription, and translation in simple terms and a brief overview of synthetic biology. We then explained biological circuits to the students using real-life analogies of cause and effect. The students engaged in building circuits with Lego pieces, and they explained what each Lego piece represented in their circuit. We ended with a coloring activity made by the 2013 BGU Israel iGEM team. For the students ages 7 to 9, we showed them a BrainPop video about the central dogma. We explained synthetic biology, biological circuits, and we demonstrated gene knockdown with Jenga blocks, in that when critical genes are knocked"
Kingsborough_NY,2017,Team:Kingsborough NY#Seawater_-_-_TEXT.html," + Cm by spotting 10uL of bacteria and allowing the drop to dry into the plate. This gave the following result (picture on the right):
This indicated that the starting suspension had about 1.6 x 10^8 CFU/mL of bacteria. 50uL of this mixture was then added to 5mL of LB, seawater (SW), or sterilized seawater (SSW), with or without an additional 500uL of LB being added (preliminary experiments added this volume of bacterial culture directly, without centrifugation). The amount of bacteria added, given their new volume, means that each culture should start out with 1.6 X 10^6 CFU/mL
The Results: E. coli can survive, but not thrive
After allowing the bacteria to incubate overnight, we then spot-plated dilutions using the same protocol as before to determine bacterial density. Instead of just plating the cells on LB + Cm, we also plated them on LB without the selective antibiotic, but containing 3% NaCl to support the growth of organisms that might be found in the seawater. This way, we can determine if potential competitors are present and inhibiting E. coli growth. The resulting CFU/mL values are shown below – the dotted purple line indicates the starting amount of bacteria in each culture tube.
The results we obtained suggest a number of things:
E. coli will maintain plasmid J04450 without the presence of the selective antibiotic. When grown in LB without Cm overnight, the number of Cm resistant bacteria grows from the initial 1.6x10^6 CFU/mL to over a million times that amount.
The abiotic stress of higher salt content in seawater does not phase E. coli. The bacteria grew almost as well in sterile seawater supplemented with additional nutrients as it did in LB.
There are not that many nutrients usable by E. coli present in the seawater sample. Without the addition of 500uL of LB to the sterile seawater, E. coli was able to tolerate the conditions but not proliferate.
Competition from other organisms or attack by bacteriophages limit E. coli numbers in seawater. Growth in unsterilized seawater was reduced compared to the number of bacteria initially seeded in the culture.
Another interesting result that came out of this experiment was that E. coli harboring part BBa_J04450, when grown on plates with 3% NaCl, did not produce as much Red Fluorescent Protein as bacteria grown on normal LB Miller (with"

The regulative capabilities of the NahR promoter system was tested under different salicylate concentrations. dTomato was attached after the NahR biobrick ( BBa_J61051 ) as a reporter gene, and the fluorescence was measured using our fluorometer prototype .

Conclusions:
Restriction Free Cloning
The result of the first test PCR on dioxygenase, CotA and CueO, displayed in figure 1, showed that a 5% concentration of DMSO gave the best results for this PCR. This could be seen on the bands on the gel, which were thicker when 5% DMSO had been used. The results displayed in figure 2 showed that the part to be inserted had the correct length. This indicated that the insert contained the right gene with the overhangs, which is important for the next PCR to be successful. When the RFC products were transformed into the cells the fact that there were colonies on the plates confirmed that the RFC was successful. The cells would not have survived if they did not have a plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance because they were grown on agar plates with chloramphenicol. Because the original plasmids are methylated from being amplified in E.coli cells they can be degraded with Dpn1 and theoretically the only plasmids that are left should be our wanted plasmids. This means that the PCR product from the first PCR containing the HlyA-tag worked successfully as primers in the second PCR and hence since the HlyA"

Figure 1: Process Flow Diagram (PFD)
We as a team has decided to enter the manufacturing track. This was due to our excitement of the applicability of our project. We feel strongly, that the need of a replacement for mAbs and not least the opportunity to reduce usage of laboratory animals, should be explored on an industrial level.
The aim of PAST is to cater to customers with very specific needs. Therefore it has been decided to design several small-scale operations, which will allow the company to efficiently fill changing orders without accumulating large stocks.  It has not been possible to determine any values for the process design experimentally, therefore estimates has been made using data obtained on proteins considered to be as close in properties as possible to the peptide aptamers. Protocols and research papers have been extrapolated linearly, which is most often not possible. Therefore experiments should be conducted on both laboratory and pilot scale, and this proposal should only be taken as an indicator of the feasibility and competitiveness of the operation, and thereby the validity of carrying out the necessary experiments.  Below is our process design. Click the boxes to"

8. Use the Elution Buffer to elute the bound GST protein.
MagneGST Protein Purification
Preparation of Cells:
Bacterial cultures can be grown in tubes or flasks. Grow the culture containing the appropriate GST-fusion protein (GST-spycatcher) to an O.D.600 between 0.4 and 0.6, then induce protein expression. For IPTG induction, add IPTG till final concentration of 0.4mM-1mM and incubate at 37℃ for 3 h or at 16℃ overnight. Depending upon the expression system, other methods of induction and growth conditions can be used. Induction conditions often require optimization. For 1ml bacterial cultures, pellet cells by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 3 min and carefully remove the supernatant. For culture volumes larger than 1 ml, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant. The cell pellet can be frozen at –20℃ or–70℃ for long-term storage, or the cells can be lysed immediately.
Cell Lysis:
1. Prepare cell pellets from bacterial culture. Remove all growth medium. Recommended: Freeze the cell pellets at –20℃ (15–20 min is usually sufficient) or on dry ice for 5–10 min. Freezing cell pellets will increase efficiency of cell lysis of certain strains, such as the BL21 series of strains, or when cultures are grown to a high density. For cultures of O.D.600 >2, more lysis buffer will be required.
2.Resuspend the pellet in MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent at room temperature (20–25℃) by pipetting or gentle mixing. (for 500 ml of bacteria culture, use 10 ml of MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent)
3.Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 20–30 min on a rotating platform or shaker and then sonicate for 1 min.
Particle Equilibration:
1. Thoroughly resuspend the MagneGST particles by inverting the bottle to obtain a uniform suspension.
2. Pipet 100 μl of MagneGST particles into a 1.5 ml tube.
3. Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.
4. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
5. Remove the tube from the magnetic stand. Add 250"

But when we assayed our plates we found that some colonies had the desired phenotype. The plate on the right shows two distinct colour types.
Tuesday 5th October
We spent much of today moving out of the lab, we also analysed the results of the plate reader experiment.  Luciferin can be visualised by its fluorescence under UV light as shown on the right.
Wednesday 6th October
Our term proper began today so we were mostly busy but Paul came into the lab.
Thursday 7th October
Ben miniprepped G28 and some of the colour-changed luciferases for sequencing and placed the order.
Emily and Peter transformed two hns-mutant strains (black and red) with G28 and of Top10 with CD and EG from Mr Gene. In case that didn't work, we should have plenty of DNA left in the tube they sent us. I'll check in on those tomorrow. The Top10 cells are plated on kanamycin plates. If the transformation works, we can roll out the Gibson assembly. Assemblies to do are:
CD into Psb1C3 EG into Psb1C3 CD+EG into Psb1C3 pBad+CD+EG into Psb1C3
Since the hns-mutants are temperature sensitive, and the Lux operon is as well, we left the plates out on the bench. I used big plates with 300µl of transformed cells to increase the chances of getting some working colonies.
Saturday 9th October
Peter went in to check on the transformation plates today, the CD and EG transformants grew up massively, i.e. hundreds of cultures. There are still a couple of singles, so we should be fine (unless our Soc is contaminated again).
The hns mutants (termed R28 and K28, if only to abuse Will's naming system) don't show any colonies yet, but that was to be expected. 20°C and all that.
Sunday 10th October
Peter set on liquid colonies of Top10 G28, R28, K28 (the hns mutants) pBad+PP+YFP and pBad+YFP. All of these grew up, but they were rather thin (because shaking incubator < rotation incubator and all the cells sedimented). He left them to grow a bit more and will go and take them out of the incubator tonight.
There were lots and lots of colonies on the hns-mutant plates, so"

Fun with Kids
On 21 September 2014, ITB_Indonesia team opened a stall in a drawing competition for children of elementary school in Bandung. The event was attended by the children, parents and teachers from different rural areas of Bandung. Our participation in this event had aims to introduce the general structure of DNA to the elementary school children. We guided the children who attended that event to match colorful jelly candies as nitrogen bases in analogy of DNA. We thought it was an effective way to introduce DNA to the community through the children.
After being introduced to the game, the children learned to arrange those Jelly resembling the structure of DNA. They twisted chain nitrogen bases to become the double helix structure of DNA. Children were guided to play the game using simple explanation in as attractive way as possible so that the children were interested to assemble in ITB_Indonesia’s stall.
We hoped this ITB_Indonesia's human practice program would be an effective way to introduce the importance of DNA in young generation. The children could share together with their peers to introduce DNA double helix structure in a simple way.

By presenting our project and displaying our poster with other about 50 teams of China, we got many inspirations and also realized a lot of problems in our project. We closely communicated with FAFU-iGEM about transformation in B. megaterium and talked a lot about wastewater treatment with JLU-iGEM. Not only have we established great relationship with many teams such as FAFU-iGEM, JLU-iGEM and LZU-iGEM, we received many precious suggestions from HQs as well.

Our second cell line, which had been reinvigorated, were found to be entirely incompetent – so we will not use these further. We also found that both protocols were usable, but the first protocol that we used was more successful.
Meeting – LMU Munich. Today we had meeting (via skype) with LMU team member Simon about characterisation and construction collaboration. We also discussed modelling collaboration possibilities. We decided on modelling workshop that we are going to prepare. The meeting with LMU Munich team is going to be next Thursday (last day of CAS conference). Plan is to prepare power point presentation which could concisely summarise the use of modelling in synthetic biology.
Meeting – Wet Lab. This meeting was organized by Darren Nesbeth our supervisor to discuss our progress. James, Leonard, Bouran and Aurelija updated the current situation regarding biobricks as well as new ways of characterising shear force of curli expression. With regards to competent cells, our supervisor encouraged us to use our competent cells from the first run, as they were shown to be highly competent’.
Sponsorship. Martina and Bethan had a meeting with our supervisor to discuss new sponsorship opportunities.
Poster. Aurelija has worked on the second text draft for Munich CAS conference poster. Carina worked on improving design for the poster, she created slightly different design for circuits from those in registry.
Meeting - Modelling. Today Erin and Aurelija had a meeting with Chris Barnes to discuss ABC sysbio software. We wanted to find out if this particular software would be useful for us. We decided to use this and the first model that we are going to be using it for is going to be degradation. It will be a great addition to our modelling arsenal (and also we might get to use the supercomputer!)
Meeting – Human Practice. The Human Practice team met with Darren to assess the progress of our Human Practice events. He suggested we contact more marine interest groups (Fishing for litter, CleanUp UK, Marine Society) and other societies, such as the Society of Biology to organise presentations and events with them. Darren has also contact the internation marine organisation (IMO) – an important marine oganisation – with the hope of organising a presentation with their committee. Finally, we are hoping to organise a beach clean-up at southbank.

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," student-led innovation and research, and would you like to meet like-minded peers in an informal setting? On October 18th in the Charbonnel Lounge at St. Michael's College, iGEM Toronto hosted a free Panel Discussion about Synthetic Biology and its many applications. We also aimed to get feedback from public on employment of cell free synthetic gene networks.
In our event we engaged participants from all walks of life (professors, students, and accredited professionals in the field) in order to generate a casual yet critical discussion about Synthetic Biology and how to design research initiatives to maximize success. Topics such as feasability, effective implementation, and ethical concerns will be discussed. We encourage anyone with a critical mind to attend!
The panel was moderated by iGEM members and will consist of two parts: 1) A guided conversation with panelists followed by 2) A question-answer period where audience members can add their own input.
AGENDA: 6:00-7:15pm: Introduction to our iGEM project and Panel discussion 7:15-7:30pm: Break 7:30-8:00pm: Facilitated Q & A session between the audience and the panelists.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theoryold_-_-_TEXT.html," and Yellow for pigments. This is because light and pigment mix differently; light is additive and pigment is subtractive:
Light and pigment produce colour in different ways. While coloured light has a peak wavelength corresponding to its colour, coloured pigment absorbs all wavelengths that do not correspond to its colour and so reflect the corresponding coloured light:
In this system, red light is the opposite of cyan pigment, green light is the opposite of magenta pigment, and blue light is the opposite of yellow pigment. Hence our choice of sensors and pigments.
It must be noted that while RGB light give a full spectrum of colour and tone, CMY is a simplified version of the CYMK colour system used in printing. This was done because to engineer the pathways for CYMK colour system outputs is too complex (see logic gates below). However, as CMY is subtractive there will be tone as Cyan + Magenta + Yellow will approximate black.
This shows the logic gates required if we included a black pigment (K). Not very simple, and near impossible to input into an E. coli! However, when the black pigment is removed, the logic gates simplify down very neatly...
This system shows red light suppressing the production of our cyan pigment, green light suppressing the magenta pigment and blue light supressing the yellow pigment.
The Biology
The focus of our wet work is the creation of three independent 'light to output' pathways in E. coli. Each pathway will control the transcription of selected genes using Red, Green or Blue light. Incident light will prevent the transcription of the selected gene.
In our bio-camera the controlled genes will be those that code for the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments:
Red light prevents the production of Cyan pigment
Green light prevents the production of Magenta pigment
Blue light prevents the production of Yellow pigment
Each sensor prevents the production of its opposing pigment, producing the pigment which is the same colour of light that the light sensor detects. The mix of pigments will reproduce the colour of light incident on the bacteria.
If you'd like to have a go at mixing pigments and lights for yourself, why not play the colour mixing game at the bottom of our Notebook page? More difficult than you'd think!
Red light pathway
This pathway uses the well characterised Cph8 red light sensor (composing of Cph1 and Envz). When there is no red light present, this protein causes the phosphorylation of OmpR, to OmpR-P. This then diffuses away from the red light sensor, and can bind to a specialised OmpF promoter sequence which is upstream of the"

Thus, we decided to organize a roundtable discussion at HIBIT’11 conference and inform researchers whose domain is mainly bioinformatics about the synthetic biology, iGEM competition, and the Parts Registry as a new field for translational research.
HIBIT is an annual international symposium on Health Informatics and Bioinformatics  which aims to bring together academicians, researchers and practitioners from the general area of health or medical informatics and bioinformatics or computational biology. All poster, workshop and roundtable applications are peer reviewed before acceptance and we were invited to hold our roundtable during HIBIT 11 on 3rd of April 2011, you can find more details on our human practice page .
During the month of April our effort to find sponsorships continued and we have visited few companies in Ankara, Turkey.
May 2011
Our first potential sponsor was the METU-Technopolis, who have promised to cover the team registration fees for the competition.
METU-BIN registered iGEM 2011 as a software team.
We have been placed 5th place at nation-wide project competition organized by Hacettepe University with our project titled ""GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MRSA BIOSENSOR BASED ON SYNTHETIC DNA TECHNOLOGY"" and got our first financial support for 2011 İGEM competition. We have been placed 5th place and got our first financial support for 2011 iGEM competition. See more .
We have been accepted to organize a roundtable at HIBIT’11 about synthetic biology, iGEM and Parts Registry. Our topic was “Applications of Bioinformatics for Synthetic Biology”. In the roundtable we firstly explained what is synthetic biology, its importance to humankind and in which fields it can be used. Then we informed audience about iGEM and Parts Registry and discussed such topics as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
To work more effectively on our Project and to improve our knowledge we started to read articles and discuss them at our weekly meetings.

Starting a New Team
Early on this season, we got to bring our iGEM love and experience to Consort Alberta. Through workshops both in Calgary and Consort, as well as frequent Skype meetings, we (in collaboration with the Calgary Entrepreneurial iGEM team) helped Consort launch their first ever high school iGEM team. In addition to teaching lab techniques and how to use the registry, we helped the team to brainstorm and troubleshoot their project. The team had a great year, even bringing home the award for 'Best Human Practices Advance' at the High School Jamboree.
Figures 1 and 2. Lisa Oberding giving a lecture to the Consort High School team on how to brainstorm project ideas (left). Showing some of the high school students and their teacher Jerry, how to set up wetlab equipment.
We had a lot of fun working with the Consort team, especially helping them brainstorm ways to overcome many of the hurdles that they faced. As a brand new iGEM team in a rural high school, they had no access to any of the equipment or materials necessary for even basic molecular biology experiments. They were keen and motivated though, and we were able to help them come up with some creative DIY solutions for their labwork. We also spent some time helping them brainstorm how to incorporate human practices into their project. All in all it was a very rewarding experience and we definitely learned a lot form it.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-bc_-_-_TEXT.html,"ated CheY activates Clockwise rotation in the flagellar motors which without phosphylated CheY turns Counter Clockwise.
The CheY er constantly dephosphorylated by CheZ, which in this case is modelled as the constant k.
This corresponded well with the known theory for the real system.
Figure 7: graph showing the concentration of CheY rising when the concentration of phosphorylated CheA rises.
This is a simplified model and only describes a small part of the real system, this makes the data produced by the model incorrect prediction for actual bacterial behaviour.
Also the too large time scale is making it impossible too describe what happens when the photosensor in the cell is activated by light.
When trying too introduce the photosensor and the effect of light in the model, the increase in light doesn’t change the system behaviour to a degree that affects the output of the program.
This might be because the concentration of the enzymes, the rate constants in the model and the other model parameters have been set to high or to low.
Although several problems exist in the model it is still good enough to model the system behaviour and enzyme interaction but on a larger timescale than seen in nature.

XJTLU-CHINA,2016,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," of our team project, we set up an interaction activity with the surrounding guests in order to discuss the ethic issues about genetically modified food. It attracted a lot of people putting forward the idea on the given topic: Your attitude and potential consequences if genetically modified animal leave the lab and into practical use. During the interaction, we help the public to develop a more holistic and deeper insight towards the ethic issues in genetically modified food.
During the festival, we delivered a specific lecture on the practical application of mutagenesis and how biological sciences can provide help for achieving sustainability of the whole society. The Q&A session had effectively cleared public perception.
Our demonstration of the team project for 2016 attracted much attention from business leaders, young adults and even the senior citizens. The picture below showed the curiosity to our project. They told us that they care more about how our mutagenesis can help cure severe diseases and wonder how the project could be applied into practical use. This type of information inspired us to work hard and consider more about how our project can help the society to achieve sustainability.
On the last day, head of the Elementary Education Division at the Jiangsu provincial Department of Education as well as leaders from Ministry of Education, P.R. China accompanied by president of our university spoke highly of XJTLU-CHINA team members on independently conducting undergraduate student research project. We had shared ideas with them on public policy issues for current scientific subjects as well as the promotion of STEM subjects in China from undergraduate perspective.
Also, we are also involved in the discussion of cultivating students’ scientific and rational thinking, especially focusing on equipping young people with the knowledge and skills to solve tough problems with practical experiences.
Activity 6: Project demonstration at XJTLU Fablab
In September, student research groups at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University get together to share the experiences and detailed program to other research groups throughout the whole process of conducting research program. Other student groups come from electronic and engineering as well as computer programs.
We introduced synthetic biology to them by highlighting the multi-disciplinary requirements and the relative relationship with the association with knowledge in electronic or engineering.
Jo Johnson MP, The United Kingdom Minister for Universities and Science, showed great interest and commented our project on fascinating innovation and inspiration.
Reflections from the activities
 
1. From senior citizens: I am curious about your project since it is closely related to the medicine production. I wonder whether your project can help with the treatment of disease?
 
2. Residents in Shanghai: I wonder whether genetically modified organisms can pose negative impact on human life. Although it can facilitate the food production in"

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Patents are now conceived as an incentive for production and knowledge spreading. When a patent is awarded, the description of the invention goes public, in exchange for a maximum twenty-years commercial monopoly to the owner.
Patents are actually supposed to promote innovation and the disclosure of technological knowledge, which means allowing the latest inventions to be known by anyone, though their commercial use is forbidden without a license from the patent owner until the patent ends. On the one hand, the benefits that patents are expected to offer to society are very clear as their design is specifically supposed to improve the global technological level. Indeed, huge technological steps have been made since the patents’ creation (although it is not the only factor). On the other hand, stimulating the competition FOR the market (i.e. for “new” markets) by granting some kind of monopoly rents generates economic costs for society, which derive from a weakening in the competition IN the market (i.e. in the “same” market).
As a result, the patent system rests on a socio-economic balance, in which society is supposed to be beneficiary. Nevertheless, as we will further see, this balance is fragile and depends on the answers to the following questions :
What is the patentability scope ? What can be patented ? ;
How patents are granted ? (i.e. the toughness of the conditions required) ;
What are the rights of the patent owner ? ;
How long do these rights last ?
Economic limits of the patent model
Several factors (change in laws and in the practices of patent offices, technological and industrial evolution, etc.) may lead this balance between social costs and advantages to be broken. In some cases, the patent system may lead to hamper the innovation dynamics.
For instance, narrow patents are sometimes granted to different companies on very specific elements, the gathering of which may be necessary to develop an innovation (a new product for example). Nowadays, major worldwide companies use patents as defensive or offensive tools to block competition by preventing (potential) rivals to use specific useful components. When powerful enough, these rivals strike back by doing the exact same thing on other components so that they are mutually blocked. This case is known as the ""patent thicket"" problem. As an example Google has recently bought Motorola Mobile and its 17,000 patents for 12 billion dollars, which means they spent a lot of money to get these patents probably as offensive / defensive ends instead of spending it into pure R&D. Consequently patents sometimes paradoxically discourage innovation.
Contrary to the previous case, some patents may protect wide discoveries (also known as foundational patents). For instance, the patent granted to Myriad"

This may be due to using Taq instead of Q5, so the PCR was run again with Q5. Retried cloning pAK13AP and PAK13AC, digesting pAK13D with SpeI and PstI, and pC13X and pC13K with XbaI and PstI. Overnight ligations were created, after column purification and dephosphorylation. We will redo a digestion of pC13AK tomorrow because we digested with SpeI and PstI instead of XbaI and PstI.  We began cloning of pC13AQ, pC13BC and pC13AF, digesting backbone and insert with EcoRI and PstI. We made more DH5alpha electrocompetent cells to try to make heat shock.

THE UK iGEM MEET UP
As a team, we wanted to help other iGEM competitors get the most out of their experience. Entering a Synthetic Biology competition with relatively little prior lab experience can be a daunting task. Most of the students who enter the competition will never have followed a science project for such an extended period, and will almost certainly never have designed the project. However, we also firmly believe that there is a lot to be gained from participating in the competition.
To that end, we decided we could most benefit the other teams by hosting this years annual UK team meet up. We felt that we had a lot to offer students of other teams, both in terms of location and the expertise of staff present. Our team was a collaboration of efforts between the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the John Innes Centre (JIC). The UEA has been regularly ranked in the top five places for student satisfaction in the UK. It was our hope that any students who were looking to completing a PhD in the future might consider UEA as one of their options. The JIC, where our team was primarily based, is one of the world leading research centres, both in terms of Europe and globally, for plant and microbial research. It also boasts a large number of post graduate students, and each year takes on more. Some well known and prestigious names operate at both the UEA and JIC, and we were keen to give other teams the chance to explore both sites and arrange meetings with our staff.
Arguably the greatest benefit of the conference was the chance to meet other teams. We felt that interactions between teams would be of vital benefit. We ourselves had been wondering where we stood in comparison"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#EngineeringJournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"Week 7: June 10 - June 14
In this week 4 models of enzyme kinetics have been built in Mathmeatica for the study of beta-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase. By using the built-in function Manipulate, we can inspect the impact of substrate/enzyme concentration on the time course of the product of interest. In special cases, such as one model for horseradish peroxidase, even temperature can be varied as well.
It was noticed that some models predicts negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the governing equations were correct. We believe this was due to the stiffness of the system, for some reactions occurs 7 magnitudes faster than others. When using a different technique, say stiffness switching, the simulation takes very long time while progresses little, reaching maximum iteration step sets as 10^6. Fortunately the negative concentrations predicted were only of magnitude of 10^(-30) micro molar, such that it doesn't the result much. To fix the issue completely, however, may take more time by simplifying the governing equations.
Currently luciferase was modelled in luminescence output while beta-galactosidase and horseradish peroxidase was modelled in color metric output. To make a proper comparison we wish to model the luminescence of horseradish peroxidase too. Even though the unit of measurement of luminescence and color metric output were in arbitrary units, we wish to obtain good insights in the shape of their response curve to select the one best suited for our needs.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
While working on a model of chemiluminescence of horseradish peroxidase, mass balance applied to the reaction scheme resulted in a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). That is, in addition to differential equations governing the rate of change, because of the chemical equilibrium between species, algebraic equations constraining the relation between them are also included. Mathematica complained about the system being over determined even if no initial condition was given. In fact the form this DAEs has is not solvable by Mathematica.
The workaround for this problem I have found was to reduce everything to the fundamentals. So instead of equilibrium expressed as system of algebraic relations, I broke them into two reactions with rate constants large enough to be fast while at the same time obeys the proportionality required by the equilibrium constant.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.

The problem: Healthy ageing
How do you envision yourself as an elderly member of society? Frail, with a stooped posture and with greater risk of some cancers? Or healthy, active and living a high-quality life? This year the UCL iGEM team are working to build new systems that increase the healthy human lifespan and solve some of the issues of the ageing population. We are achieving this by focusing on the root cause, as opposed to traditional medicine which focuses on treating the symptoms of disease.
Ageing is a process that is caused by the cellular degeneration that leads to reduced maximum functional capacity of many organs, reduced capacity of cells to divide and increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer. Simply put, as cells age they become increasingly poor at functioning and repairing damage. Even though we are living longer than ever before, this does not equate to a higher quality of life in our older years. About 2/3 of the global population (100,000 per day) die as a result of age-related causes. In industrialised nations, the proportion is much greater, reaching 90%. We believe that by targeting the causes of ageing, we are able in turn to cure the symptoms of ageing, such as age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and lung disease (COPD).
We are living longer, and maintaining a high quality of life depends on healthy ageing. We all aspire to a long and healthy live in old age, but we know that older people are at increased risk of disease and disability that can seriously affect their and their family's quality of life.
Ageing is not necessarily a burden, and it doesn’t decrease a person’s ability to contribute to society. By showcasing some practical synthetic biology solutions to healthy ageing, interacting with the society, talking to politicians, religious leaders and policy makers we hope to show that UCL iGEM can make healthy ageing a reality.
An ageing-themed project has never been explored before in iGEM and we are really excited to build new systems that solve the issues of the ageing population. We are contributing the iGEM Registry and are among the first to propose synthetic biology solutions to healthy ageing!

2.4 DNA recombination
Ringrose and his colleagues have developed mathematic models to describe the kinetics of Cre and Flp recombination. The site-specific recombination process can be mainly divided into four steps as the following figure depicts: DNA binding, synapsis, recombination and dissociation.
The detailed mathematical representation can be found in previous research (Ringrose et al., 1998), so we didn't list them here. We want to explain Cre-mediated inversion using the mutated Cre/loxP system we used prefers the forward reaction. The difference between the mutated loxP site and wild type loxP site only influences the DNA binding and dissociation processes. So we focus on these two steps. A Cre monomer binds to one half of a loxP site and then an asymmetrical homodimer is formed when a second Cre molecule binds to the other half of loxP.
Because the concentration of intermediate products $Cre\cdot lox$ is very low, and $k_9>>k_{-8}>k_{-9}$, we can apply steady-state treatment to it, \begin{equation} \frac{d[Cre\cdot lox]}{dt}=k_8\cdot [lox]\cdot [Cre]-k_{-8}[Cre\cdot lox]-k_9\cdot [Cre\cdot lox]\cdot [Cre]+k_{-9}\cdot[2Cre\cdot lox]=0, \end{equation}
The second dissociation process is the slowest reaction within these four reactions. Hence, we ignore the last term $k_{-9}\cdot[2Cre\cdot lox]$. Then we get the steady-state of intermediate products $Cre\cdot lox$ \begin{equation} [Cre\cdot lox]_{st}=\frac{k_8\cdot [lox"

Background and Problem
Untill now, numerous iGEM teams have proposed effective projects against harming and fatal medical conditions. We believe that synthetic biology poses a promising option to invent robust medications and treatments, this year we targeted the most lethal disease worldwide and shaped the SynBio to be used as a safe and efficient weapon against it. This condition is called ischemia.
Briefly, what is ischemia?
Ischemia is, “iskhaimos” in Greek, the fusion of words “iskho”, keep back, restrain, and “haima”, blood gaining the mean of “staunching blood”. Theoretically, ischemia is the restriction in blood supply to tissues, generally caused by the blockage of blood movement which ends up with a shortage of oxygen and nutrition vital for cell metabolism and survival. Since oxygen is carried to tissues only via the blood, insufficient blood supply causes tissue to become starved of oxygen. In the highly aerobic tissues of the heart and brain, irreversible damage to tissues can occur in as little as 3–4 minutes at body temperature. The kidneys are also damaged at a fast rate due to the loss of blood flow. Tissues with slower metabolic rates may undergo irreversible damage after 20 minutes.
The process known as ischemic cascade is how ischemia causes tissue damage. The build-up of metabolic waste products is the main cause of the damage which inevitably results in the inability to maintain cell membranes, mitochondrial damage, and eventual leakage of auto-lysing proteolytic enzymes into the cell and surrounding tissues.
The blockage of bloodstream usually occurs due to a clot; therefore all risk factors that are related to the formation of clot may also contribute this phenomenon. Here, we can mention that the tendency of clot formation, which is also called thrombophilia, can be enhanced mainly by excessive body weight.
Excessive fat and sugar uptake results in the accumulation of fatty acids and cholesterol on cell membranes and vessel walls. These fatty components of vessel wall are called atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of cholesterol and fibrous tissue as plaques in the walls of arteries (in this case, the coronary arteries), typically over decades plaques can be further invaded by white blood cells because of inducing inflammatory reactions that lure macrophages and neutrophils. Due to the involvement of white blood cells, plaques can become thicker making it further solid and rigid"

Description: pSB1C3/PcArsR_PArsR-amilCP is an arsenic detection circuit. It is a two-part circuit that combines two series of promoter-gene sequences on one plasmid. The first part of the circuit, PcArsR, contains an E. coli-derived constitutive promoter (Pc), a Ribosome Binding Site, Arsenic Regulator (ArsR), and a Double Terminator. This sequence allows for unregulated expression of ArsR. The second part of the circuit contains an E. coli-derived Arsenic Regulator promoter (PArsR), a Ribosome Binding Site, the amilCP chromoprotein, and a Double Terminator. The PArsR sequence has a binding site for ArsR which blocks expression of the reporter in the absence of Arsenic ions. When Arsenic ions are present  amilCP chromoproteins are produced.

Abstract
Our project goal is to maximize the photosynthetic productivity for a culture of Rhodobacter sphaeroides under both high and low light intensities in a bioreactor by synthetically regulating the size of the light-harvesting antenna.   We chose to undertake such a project in R. sphaeroides due to its well-characterized photosynthetic and genetic system.
The antenna system functions to expand the spectrum of light available for photosynthesis by absorbing different wavelengths than that of the reaction center.  Essentially, it is like the dish around the main receiver of any antenna.  Marine bacteria, such as R. sphaeroides, evolved very large antenna complexes to absorb light in a natural environment where there is great competition for photons.  As a result, the photosynthetic machinery is saturated at a rather low light intensity in a synthetic non-competitive environment, such as a bioreactor.  This causes up to 95% of incidental photons to be dissipated as heat or fluorescence by the bacteria at the exterior of a bioreactor through a process called Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) (Mussgnug et al., 2007). In essence, these photons are being wasted as NPQ reduces light penetration into a bioreactor and starves cells on the interior for photons.  One method that has been shown to improve photosynthetic efficiency is the reduction of light-harvesting antenna sizes (Polle et al., 2002, Mussgnug et al., 2007).  Though, current approaches to this end rely on genetic knockouts and as such are difficult to precisely control from the"
