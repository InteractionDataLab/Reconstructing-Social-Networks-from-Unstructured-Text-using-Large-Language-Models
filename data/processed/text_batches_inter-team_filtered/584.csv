Some authors have demonstrated that DNA can adhere to the CNTs by simple electrostatic interactions between positively charged groups on the surface of the CNTs and the negative charges of the phosphate groups of nucleic acids. Studies have also shown that the CNTs do not interfere with the mobility of DNA adhered to its surface and have a protective effect against cellular nucleases even after a 60 min digestion, as well as poor enzymatic degradation thereof. So this team used this principle to improve the DNA transformation protocol, increasing the efficiency of it by using DNA attached to CNTs. Our lab work collaboration will be to perform our transfection protocol using DNA-CNTs complexes (Team Tec-Chihuahua will attach our DNA samples with their CNTs and functionalize them) to transform our Sf9 cells. We will evaluate the efficiency of transfection using CNTs by electroporation of insect cells and liposomal reagents methods."

TERRA allows scientists to easily incorporate microfluidics to their experiments and easily access and utilize the outputs of microfluidic devices. By using TERRA, scientists can automate synthetic biology protocols, such as those for molecular cloning, that can be applied in creating BioBricks or similar experimental products.
TERRA Works!
Our system TERRA has demonstrated the ability to automate and selectively dispense the output of an experiment on a microfluidic chip. Automation is implemented by the actuation syringe pumps and controlled from the UI. TERRA is also able to selectively dispense to specific wells on microtiter plates by choosing locations on the interface. By implementing these features in our design of TERRA we looked to achieve of making microfluidics more approachable and easier to use for biologists

Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT)
The Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) reached out to our supervisory group because of their real interest in the application of our gene detection method, with a specific focus on our targeted or selective sequencing based on the fusion protein we have developed. They see many applications for this technology, and have invited us to discuss with us and our supervisory group after the jamboree.
Improvement
One recommendation from the doping authority is to expand our research to urine. While blood samples are also taken for doping tests, these are not implemented in all human sports and are also more invasive than urine samples. Urine sampling is prefered by athletes as well. A sample preparation method including urine would be a promising extension to ADOPE. However, with the current method our test is already applicable to be used in many athletic disciplines.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," B. subtilis should be done but with using xylose during different times during the sporulation process to test if and when spores are be able to retain competence after activation. The initial culture and addition of xylose (to end up with 1% xylose in culture) to B. subtilis was done by Israt and I added xylose when the culture was added to the SGx2 media before being shaken for 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, I miss interpreted Israt's instructions and put xylose in both cultures, and not just in the one that did not already have xylose in it.  Because of this, is was determined that we would re-do the experiment after making a new batch of xylose (Israt) and SGx2 media (Shelby).
Week 23: September 29 - October 5
Xylose sporulation and SGx2 media
SGx2 media was made for the sporulation process. The recipe was originally obtained from Anna Fei, and was modified  for a smaller volume, as the media tends to get cloudy quickly and then can no longer be used.  The original recipe was for 500 mL total volume and was reduced to 250 mL for our purposes.
Original recipe:
500 mL of distilled water
8 g Difo nutrient broth
1 g KCl
0.5 g MgSO4 • 7H2O
Autoclave above mixture before adding the remaining ingredients
0.5 mL 1 M Ca(NO3)2
0.5 mL 0.1 M MnCl2 • 4H2O
0.5 mL 1 mM FeSO4
1 mL 50% Glucose (filtered)
This recipe was cut in half and was finished being made on September 30, 2014, the same day that culture and xylose was added for the 2-3 day shaking process.
A new batch of B. subtilis was cultured and a new batch of 10% xylose were made by Israt in preparation for the  xylose sporulation of B. subtilis.  She also added xylose (final concentration of 1%) to one of the cultures before shaking for 6-8 hours, resulting in a 1% xylose concentration in the culture, and left the other with out xylose so that it could be added when SGx2 media was added.  After being shaken, 0.125mL of culture was added to a volume of 25 mL of SGx2 media, and"

It works with either the up-stream or down-stream PCR amplification of the vector and gene.
Afterwards the PCR fragments can be fused into a pre-engineered vector containing an antibiotic resistance gene, by creation of single-stranded regions made by the In-fusion enzyme. [5] .

Tool Overview
SynFlo is an interactive installation that utilizes tangible interaction to help illustrate core concepts of synthetic biology in outreach programs. This playful installation allows users to create useful virtual life forms from standardized genetic components, exploring common synthetic biology concepts and techniques.
The installation references the E. chromi experiment conducted by the University of Cambridge iGEM team, which involves the creation of E. coli that serve as color-changing biosensors. The E. chromi protocol involves three basic tasks: drawing color-changing DNA from a parts library, encoding the DNA in bacterial plasmids, and then inserting the plasmids into E. coli.
Implementation
To simulate the E. chromi experiment protocol, the installation employs a tabletop computer, tangible objects that represent environmental toxins, and triplets of Sifteo Cubes. Sifteo Cubes are a commercially available, clickable 1.5 inch block micro computers that can interact with each other and communicate with a computer via proprietary 2.4GHz radio protocol. The current prototype of SynFlo supports up to six Sifteo Cubes. The interaction and animation is programmed using the Sifteo SDK written in C#.
Concept
Each triplet of Sifteo cubes consists of a BioBrick cube, a plasmid cube, and an E. coli cube. To represent the real-world application of E. chromi as biosensors, users can deploy the E. coli onto a tabletop computer. Once there, users can add three different types of contaminants to the Surface. The E. coli will move around, and a toxin that they are encoded to sense was added to the surface, they would change color.
Modify E. coli
Pressing on the BioBrick cube scrolls through a library of three color BioBricks. Users add a BioBrick to a plasmid and mix by vortexing: the BioBrick cube is placed on top of the plasmid, then the two are shaken together while the color drips"

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.

We found that farnesol has a preservative effect on various foods. So, we think about commercialization of ""Flavorator"" in the future.

We lowered height of Flavorator. As a result, Farnesol became easy to reach to food．
Refrigerator consumes the power of 300 kWh per year. Carbon dioxide emissions of a refrigerator’s in one year is 134.1kg. It is possible to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and consumption of electricity by changing to Flavorator from the refrigerator.
For this reason, it will prevent global warming.
From here, we will assume that Flavorator was completed. We think that the next problem is how to commercialize Flavorator. We can make Escherichia coli synthesize farnesol. However, in order to commercialize the Flavorator we need cooperation of people from other fields. For example, system to circulate the fragrance requires cooperation from Food preservation fields. We continue to overcome these problem, we would like to commercialize Flavorator."

HUMAN PRACTICES: GOLD
OVERVIEW
Our project has evolved from a single idea to a multidimensional project that extends the healthy lifespan through many routes. The influence of human practices has formed an integral part of our project and has greatly changed not only the design of our therapies, but the team’s perception and understanding of the problem. We truly believe that every person we have interacted with has resulted in either changing the way the team thinks about our project, inspired the formation of a new BioBrick or improve the design of our ideas. See our integrated practices page for a detailed overview of how human practices has shaped our whole project.

The two values are of the same magnitude but we take the smaller one, since we can not find the references of the first measurement and to play on safe.
The strength of the pLuxPR promoter has been measured relatively to pLacIQ by iGEM Tokyo_Tech 2010. They found a value for pLuxPR of 550 and for pLacIQ of 390. pLacIQ has also been measured by iGEM Upssala university 2012 and was found to have a RPU of 0.04 giving it a PoPS of 0.0012. From these values we calculate the PoPS of pLuxPR to be 550/390 * 0.0012 =0.00169 PoPS.
Next we sought values for pCI. iGEM NYMU-Taipei 2009 measured the pLux promoter relative to pCI, which allows us to calculate the PoPS for pCI: $\frac{1}{0.43} {\cdot} 0.00169=0.0394$ PoPS. Their resulst of pPen were not consistent and the team mentioned they lacked experience in the beginning. Results of the earlier used pCI and pLux were consistent though. This is why we only used their last results and  took the mean of pPen compared to pTet: $(0.801 {\cdot} 0.537 + 0,191) {\cdot} {\frac{1}{2}}=0.3106$. Using this mean value we were able to calculate the PoPS: $0.3106 {\cdot} 0.0394=0.01224$.
These values all depend on measuring activities and since the strains, media and antibiotic markers won’t be completely the same, the real values will diverge from the values found with these simple calculations. These values can give us an idea about the relative strength of the different promoters. We could gather the real values of mRNA concentration in our cells by executing a qPCR but for now we will use the found values for our model. The last important parameter for transcription is the copy number in which the genes are present in the cell. The plasmid that incorporates the used genes, has an ORI with a copy number between 100 and 300. In our model we will use a copy number of 200.

All purification steps should be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at >12.000 x g (10.000-14.000 rpm)
Use 1-5 mL of E. coli culture in LB media for purification of high-copy plasmids.
Use up to 10 mL culture for low-copy plasmids
Protocol
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of the Resuspension Solution. Transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cells clumps remain.Note: Ensure RNase A has been added to the Resuspension Solution.
Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix throughly by inverting the tube 4-6 tines until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Note: Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 4 min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled DNA.
Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Note:It is important to mix throughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.
Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA
Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting or pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white precipitate.
Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Add 500 µL of the Wash Solution (diluted with ethanol prior to use) to the GeneJET spin column. Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through. Place the column back into the same collection tube.
Repeat the wash procedure using 500 µL of the Wash Solution
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge an additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
Transfer the GeneJET spin column into a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. incubate"

Expert Interviews
Part 1  Design
As the project design is the core of our work, we interviewed Professor Nie (from College of Chemical Engineering, Hunan University) about some details in the experiment.
The origin function of Trim21
Trim21 binds to the fc domain of the antibody, and the proteasome degrades the antigen, but the trim is endogenously expressed (intracellular), while the antibody is in the circular (extracellular). They are in two different places so that the meaning of existence of Trim21 protein should not be the degradation of antigen, so what is the main function of Trim21? Is it that the escaped virus carries antibodies outside the cell and is recognized and degraded after entering the cell?
TRIM21 is an intracellular antibody effector in the intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis pathway. It recognizes Fc domain and binds to immunoglobulin G as well as immunoglobulin M on antibody marked non-enveloped virions which have infected the cell. Either by autoubiquitination or by ubiquitination of a cofactor, it is then responsible for directing the virions to the proteasome. TRIM21 itself is not degraded in the proteasome unlike both the viral capsid and the bound antibody.
TRIM21 is also part of the RoSSA ribonucleoprotein, which includes a single polypeptide and one of four small RNA molecules. The RoSSA particle localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Duke iGEM 2017 Improvement: Making pSB1C3 Better For Gibson Assembly
In pSB1C3 (and all iGEM vectors) the Biobrick prefix and suffix have homology (Figure 1) to each other and because of this, attempts at Gibson assembly usually end with self-ligation of the vector and rejection of the insert (See Duke iGEM 2017’s Contribution page for more info on this). BBa_K2464000 is pSB1C3 with the typical RFP insert, except we removed “gcggccg” from the suffix, which was homologous to the prefix. The SpeI and PstI cut sites are preserved and this iteration of pSB1C3 that we’ve dubbed pSB1C3_Gibson is highly effective in Gibson assembly (Figure 2). BBa_K2464001 and BBa_K2464002 are the forward and reverse primers, respectively, that we designed to perform Q5 mutagenesis on pSB1C3 to make pSB1C3_Gibson.
Figure 1: The Biobrick prefix and suffix have 9bp of homology.
Figure 2: pSB1C3_Gibson is highly efficient in Gibson Assembly.
Colony PCR was run on random colonies after transformations of Gibson assemblies to confirm whether the gene insert was present (pSB1C3 Homology n = 65, pSB1C3_Gibson Homology n = 30). The Gibson assemblies of pSB1C3_Gibson were done using pSB1C3_Gibson as the homology arms and vector the gene insert was placed in. We have not yet collected data for Gibson assembly into pSMART with upstream homology of pSB1C3_Gibson, which is"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modelling#Population_-_-_TEXT.html,"Visualisation
Alongside the actual simulation we are developing an application to visualise the output of our simulation in a three dimensional environment.
Below is a basic visualisation of one of the early versions of our simulation, where the different states of the bacterial cells are represented by differing colours. This early graphic was produced by feeding the output of our population simulations into another program which we have developed in Java, using the Java3D technology.
In this animation, a population of cells is seen to proliferate in three dimensions from a single cell. Vegetative cells are represented by white spheres. There is cadmium in the environment (not shown), and also sufficient food to allow proliferation. Cells can make choices either to grow and proliferate, or to sporulate due to the cadmium. If cells choose to sporulate, they make a further choice whether or not to sequester cadmium. Since there is sufficient food in the environment, ordinary spores (represented in black) germinate immediately after sporulation. Spores that cannot germinate because they have sequestered cadmium are shown as red spheres. Germinating spores (that have previously been non-sequestering spores) are shown in green.
Also below is an image of the more sophisticated graphical output which we have been producing. The Graphics package Autodesk 3ds Max has been used in the production of these graphics.
Further work
The current version of the model provides the basis of a bacterial population simulator, which can be improved and adapted for use by other people and projects in the future. Currently parts of the model are highly focused on our project, but it can easily be generalised. We have developed a framework for integrating agent based and biochemical models on a distributed grid system. The way in which the bacterial threads run in the program makes it very easy to customise and improve the behaviour of the bacteria throughout their simulated life cycles.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

1.Fudan-CHINA
We have established a good relationship with Fudan-CHINA this year.
This year the project of Fudan-CHINA is the STEP receptor engineered according to the predecessors. The receptor consists of two chains, one chain is TC chain with a transcription factor and another chain is PC chain with a protease. To test whether transformation and construction of these two chains was successful, they replaced the transcription factor and protease downstream of the two chains with a pair of complementary semi-fluorescent proteins that they self-designed disassembled ECFP.
In order to test whether their ECFP splitting successfully and whether it can apply to other laboratories, our team helped Fudan-CHINA characterize these parts and verified that their design and transformation of ECFP on bimolecular fluorescence complementation is successful in E.coli. By doing so, they can know whether their disassembled ECFP works as expected, and whether the transformation and construction of PC chain and TC chain is successful. The result is very important for their project.
We inoculated 100ul bacteria solution containing pGEX-4T-1-ECFP, pGEX-4T-1-LZ-cECFP, pGEX-4T-1-nECFP plasmids and 50ul bacteria solution containing pGEX-4T-1- LZ-cECFP, pGEX-4T-1-nECFP plasmids to mix. After incubating for 3-4 hours, we made the initial OD = 0.1. When OD was close to 0.6, we added IPTG at 1:1000 to induce protein expression at 16"

1. Theoretical model of predicting efficiency of terminators
The goal of theoretical model to predict the efficiency of a terminator from its nucleotide sequence. We use free energy methods to predict the secondary structure of terminator. A d score is defined as
D=-96.6DΔG/L+18.6T-116.9    (1)
Here, ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change of stemloop formation. L is the length of stemloop. T is the score of T tail.
To get a relationship between d score and efficiency, we use the biofab data as training dataset. Biofab is the International Open Facility Advancing Biotechnology, which was founded in 2009. It's led by bioengineers from UC Berkeley and Stanford. In biofab data, there are 40 terminators with efficiency data available. We calculated the d score of terminators in Biofab and plot it with efficiency (Figure 1).
(Figure 1 diagram showing the correlation between d score and efficiency)
We found that d score and efficiency is positively correlated. Linear fitting by parts is performed. We calculate the average error as follows:
(2)
Here Δe is the average error, n is the number of data , E（prediction） is the efficiency predicted by our model and  E（measurement） is the efficiency measured in experiment.
For Figure 1, the average error is 16%.
We proposed that terminators can be classified into three classes based on efficiency.
(Table.1 Table of  efficiency and d score correspond to different class of terminators).
2, Validating theoretical model by our own experimental data
We did experiment to measure the efficiency of terminators.Using the experimental data, we plot the predicted efficiency based on our model with efficiency data (Figure 2). We found that our theoretical predication fit experiemental data quite well.

Tuesday, 10/18
●
We first looked at pelleted cultures that have been maintained by EDTA for over a month. They maintained their color which means the chromoproteins were not degrading and the heat testing and heat loss is not a speeding up a degradation process and instead they are sensitive to heat. The EDTA is a protease inhibitor so the chromoproteins have not been producing more chormoproteins over this time period but maintained their color.
IMG_0126 2.jpg
Pellets still colored over 1 month later using EDTA as a protease inhibitor.
●
We wanted to test to see if the CBD worked on our PP and LO chromoproteins that had been placed in wax wells on Saturday. We put the cellulose sheet under running water from the faucet for a minute and took pictures before and after (show below). There was no color change seen which means our chromoprotein stayed on the cellulose sheet adn the cellulose binding domain successfully worked and binded to the cellulose
IMG_1648.JPG
Here are the chromoproteins with CBDs before we tested their CBDs with water. On the top row is PP and the bottom row is LO
IMG_1649.JPG
This was taken right after the chromoproteins were put under water for a minute. They still are on the cellulose sheet and appear to be bound well to it.
IMG_1650.JPG
Here is after the chromoproteins were given time to dry. They still have their color the same as before which helps to show the cellulose binding domain inserted is working properly to bind the chromoproteins to the cellulose paper.
●
We also looked again at our 12 chromoproteins we heat tested on yesterday to see the affect of sitting overnight on the bench top. We saw that they lost some of their color due to evaporation of water but maintained the color seen before heat testing.

The absence of oxygen and nutrients from the blood during the ischemic period creates a state in which the rejuvenation of circulation to its original state results in inflammation and oxidative damage due to the induction of oxidative stress instead of the restoration of normal function.
These oxygen consuming reactions may cause some leakages that produce toxic chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are intermediate products of oxygenation which have an absence of one electron in their covalent bonds. This makes them ultimately unstable. By means of this, ROS can disrupt almost all cation and anion structures present in cell media.
ROS are like a bomb for cells
Removing the clot allows fresh blood with high concentration of oxygen to reach the hypoxic tissues. Restoration of blood supply to ischemic tissues can cause additional damage known as reperfusion injury. This can be more damaging than the initial ischemia. (5) Reintroducing blood flow brings oxygen back to tissues, causing a greater production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, thus damaging cells.Hypoxic cells may use excessive oxygen due to their boosted oxygen consuming systems, which would result in greater production of ROS particles. Further inflammation would attract white blood cells to the perfused site, inducing them to secrete more ROS to the medium as they recognize the inflammation as a threat to the body. The ROS can damage all of cell components including DNA, cell membrane and organelles.
In prolonged ischemia (60 minutes or more), hypoxanthine is formed as a product of ATP metabolism. The enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase acts in reverse, functioning like xanthine oxidase due to the abundance of oxygen. This oxidation converts the dissolved oxygen gas to highly reactive superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Xanthine oxidase also produces uric acid, which may act as both a pro-oxidant and as a scavenger of reactive species such as peroxynitrite. Such radicals and reactive oxygen species attack cell membrane lipids, proteins and cell components, resulting in further damage.
Because of these, an effective and safe treatment of ischemia must both remove hypoxia and also prevent reperfusion injury caused by ROS production and its related pathways such as xanthine degradation.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) with designed RBS
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) protein coding sequence. A designed RBS with spacer DNA was added preceding the IL-2 for protein expression. This biobrick can be inserted after promoter of choice. IL-2 will be ultimately incorporated into the Las and Lux quorum sensing systems. With sufficient stimulation of the quorum sensing mechanism by an aggregation of bacteria, IL-2 production will occur and be released by the bacteria into the extracellular environment. Il-2 is a signalling cytokine and stimulates the production and differentiation of T cells (adaptive immunity). There is a silent point mutation at base pair insert 272 (A>T) to make the gene BioBrick compatible (XbaI site was removed).

mNARK-Lycopene cells had a higher OD compared to the wild type cells. Cells exposed to hypoxia were also compared with the cells that were grown with oxygen. Most cells still survived despite the presence of hypoxia.
Furthermore, with regards to W/T cells, a depletion in the oxygen concentration caused a drop in cell growth and division, as reflected in decreased OD measurements. However, growth and division of mNARK-Lyco-containing cells was maintained in oxygen-deficient environment during the 16-hour time test period.
This shows that our BioBrick construct (mNARK-Lyco) was able to ensure cell growth and division in oxygen-deficient environment.
The mNARK-Lycopene device is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to 'mop up' the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.
Under various stresses, the mNARK-Lycopene device promotes E. coli growth. Characterisation was achieved by comparing the performance of the BioBrick against wild type E. coli.
Initially, the growth of mNARK-Lycopene was compared with the growth of wild type E. coli. The mNARK-Lycopene cells substantially outperformed the wild type cells, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.45 and, potentially, still rising, while the growth of the wild type cells had clearly levelled off over the equivalent time period and had began to die, reaching a final OD600 of around 0.12.
After carrying out the positive control, the mNARK-Lycopene cells were tested under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, with the LB media containing 2 mM copper (II) chloride. The results indicate that the mNARK-Lycopene device boots E. coli growth. Wild type E. coli grew to a final optical density of 0.35 after three hours, from an initial OD of 0.15. The mNARK-Lycopene progressed from an initial OD of 0.25 to a final OD of 0.60.
The BioBrick was then tested against simulated oxidative stress conditions of 50 and 100 µM sodium nitroprusside. Both of these experiments, again, indicate that, in the presence of simulate oxidative stress conditions, the mNARK-Lycopene promotes E. coli growth substantially better then the control. At 50 µM, the optical density of the wild type cells decreases to an OD of 0.05"

From all the countries affected, Afghanistan is the country with the most landmine casualties:766 killed and injured in 2012. Other countries with an alarming number of large casualties numbers include Cambodia, Colombia and Yemen. Figure 2 shows the amount of casualties in the ten most affected countries for 2011 and 2012[8].

What is done against landmines?
The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty (also known as the Ottawa Convention, and officially titled The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction)[2] provides the main legal framework for governments to take action against land mines [8]. Governments who join the treaty declare upon signing that they never, under any circumstance, use, produce, stockpile and transfer anti-personnel mines. In addition, they must destroy all stockpiled antipersonnel mines in four years and clear all antipersonnel mines in all mined areas under their jurisdiction or control in ten years.
Next to that, States Parties are obliged to provide assistance for the care and treatment of land mine victims and support for educational programs to help prevent mine incidents [2]. The Mine Ban Treaty is currently signed by 161 countries. Major non-signatories include China, Russia and the United States. Since March 1, 1999, the Mine Ban Treaty is implemented as a binding international law [7].
The Ottawa Convention is mainly the result of the work of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and its spokesman person, Jody Williams. In 1997, they received the Nobel Peace Price ""for their work for the banning and clearing of antipersonnel mines"" [12]. The ICBL is a global network in around 100 countries, working to eradicate land mines. The ICBL-CMC (a merger between ICBL and the Cluster Munition Coalition) releases the Landmine Monitor, a yearly publication providing a global overview of developments in mine ban policy, use, production, trade, and stockpiling. It also includes information on contamination, clearance, casualties, victim assistance, and support for mine action [9].

At this temperature the pCP20 helper cannot be replicated and the Flp recombinase is expressed by the remaining copies of the helper. The bacteria should loose the R6K origin and the Cm resistance upon FRT sites recombination, mediated by Flp.
Streak the culture on a LB plate and incubate it at 43°C overnight to ensure the loss of the helper plasmid. The bacteria that form colonies should be without the pCP20 helper plasmid.
Validate the loss of the helper plasmid by inoculating colonies in Amp (at 100 ug/ml) media and validate the loss of the Cm resistance from the genome by inoculating colonies in Cm (at 12.5 ug/ml) media. Validate the correct length of the integrated part without Cm resistance and R6K origin by performing colony PCR with primers P1/P4 (which amplify the entire Phi80 locus) and VF2/VR (which amplify the integrated part). Validate the phenotype (when possible).
Colony PCR: a single colony or 1 ul of culture was added to the Invitrogen Platinum Taq reaction mix and was heated at 94°C for 10 min. Then it was assayed with this cycle (X 35): 94°C 30 sec, 60°C (for VF2/VR) or 63°C (for the other primers) 30 sec, 72°C according to the amplicon expected length (1Kb/min). Then the reaction was kept at 72°C for 10 min and it was run on a 1% agarose gel with the GeneRuler 1Kb Plus DNA ladder (Fermentas).
Fluorescence assays: integrants were inoculated in 1 ml of M9 + Cm (12.5 ug/ml) and grown at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight. The cultures were diluted 1:100 in 2 ml of selective M9 and let grow for about 4-6 hours under the same conditions as before. Three 200 ul aliquots for each culture were transferred to a 96-well microplate and assayed in the Infinite F200 microplate reader (Tecan) for about 20 hours with the following kinetic cycle: 37°C, 5 min sampling time, linear shaking 15 sec (amplitude=3), wait 5 sec, measure absorbance at 600nm, measure fluorescence with the proper filter (EX:nm/EM:540nm for GFP or EX:535nm/EM:"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"In the assay for repressor system, the data in Fig. 4 gave the similar results as team Glasgow did in 2015, in which the strong activity of the repressible promoter was significantly repressed in the presence of PhlF repressor.
Furthermore, we modified the expression of PhlF under the glucose responsive promoter (Pcar-PhlF-T-Pr-GFP/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230012]). And the E. coli carrying this plasmid cultured in LB broth overnight was transferred to  M9 minimal media with decreasing concentrations of glucose. The result in Fig 5 clearly indicated that the GFP activity driven by the repressible promoter was gradually increased in response to the loss of glucose to 1.88 folds compared to the initial GFP activity at the beginning culture in M9 media, suggesting that the level of expression of PhlF was positively corresponding to the concentration of glucose.
3    Glucose responsive suppressor suicide circuit
To achieve our goal, we added the suicide genes of lysis and NucA in the back of GFP (Pcar-PhlF-T-Pr-GFP-Lysis-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230017]) which are controlled under the same repressible promoter and hope to see the activity of suicide genes could respond against the presence of glucose.
As you can see in Fig 6., the OD value in response to the decreasing concentration of glucose was gradually reduced to 1.89 much less than average 2.71 in control group without suicide gene expression, implying that the suicide proteins killed the cells in the loss of glucose in the environment. Moreover, when the bacteria were grown in M9 media with 0.5mM glucose for 4 hours, the survival rate was decreased to 34% compared to 56% of bacteria without suicide genes (Fig. 7). And the cell numbers were reduced to 671 compared to 1120 of bacteria without suicide genes. Both data confirmed that this suicide device works well and indicated that killing process began when glucose in the media was running out.
Discussion
Glucose responsive promoters can drive RFP but respond slightly in the increasing concentration of glucose in M9 minimal media.  However, the device of repressor system works well in response to increasing concentration of glucose which controls the level of expression of PhlF repressors through glucose responsive promoter. The difference responses between the devices may result from the sensitivity of RFP and GFP or the experimental conditions.
The suicide circuit connected the combination of repressor system and glucose"

The iGEM-Team from Norwich developed a biosensor which enables the identification of antimycin-producing strains of Streptomyctes. Therefore they asked us to send them soil samples from Bielefeld, which of course we did. The interesting soil samples of Bielefeld are shown below. We hope that our soil samples helped Norwich.

iGEM-Team UC Davis
The iGEM-Team UC-Davis 2013 wants to develop and implement an experimental data depot for BioBrick characterization data and kindly asked us to collaborate with them. They want to establish an easily accessible and comparative platform to share experimental data about BioBricks and are searching for other teams that are willing to help them establish standardized characterization methods. We tested their promoter characterization protocols on the Anderson promoter collection J230100-J230119. The plasmid backbone of these BioBricks J61002 is very suitable for promoter insertion between the XbaI and SpeI sites, which places the promoter upstream of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene. Depending on the used promoter, the rfp-expression is in- or decreased, while the promoter strength can easily be characterized via fluorescence measurements.
Our team focused mainly on the second half of the collection, which comprises promoters with the below listed strengths.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ng/ul on two separate occasions, so the whole process was repeated for gRNA 4. 50ng of each brick was used for the brick ligations whereas 100ng of the backbones were used. 13.3ng of T1 was used and 7.2ng of PdCas9. Ligations were carried out for 2.5 hours.
Today we checked whether the ligations had worked. We tried to amplify using our brick forward and reverse primers for all bricks, however the results showed amplification of products much smaller than expected. We suspected a few problems so took a while to look through the primers using SnapGene and identified a few tweaks that could be made to the gRNA brick primers, so we ordered new primers for that. We were very confused by the promoter-GFP-terminator bricks as the products should be over 1kb whereas they were showing up at under 500bp. We decided to troubleshoot the PCR by using the brick forward primer and the sGFP reverse primer on P1, P2, P3, PE on the corresponding ligations. Today we also decided to ligate the sgRNAs with their promoter, terminator and the backbone in a 4 fragment ligation using T4 ligase overnight at room temperature.
Another late finish as we checked whether the PCRs worked with the brick forward primers and the sGFP reverse primer for P2, P3, P4 and PE ""bricks"" using our ligations as templates. They did! So that gave us hope that the promoter and sGFP are attached properly. We realised there was a problem with T2 amplification so we decided to switch to using T3 instead. So we created primer dimers of T3 and amplified it before PCR purification, ready for digestion on Monday. We noticed another problem with P1 which meant that it would not amplify using the primers we currently had, we made larger quantities of PCR of P2-5 + PE bricks using the brick forward primer and either strong and weakGFP reverse primers. Unfortunately the gel showed that the wGFP bricks did not amplify but the sGFP bricks did so we are a bit confused. We cut out the bands which had worked ready for gel extraction on Monday. Today we also dialysed our ligations which had been running overnight, and transformed these into TOP10 by electroporation and plated them on chloramphenicol plates to select for transformants. We also checked the transformation plates from yesterday which hopefully had the low copy backbone plus dCas9,"
Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#OurSoftware_-_-_TEXT.html," there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up"

Blog #18 - Noneffective Antibiotics (Part II): Hospitals as Receptacles for Multi-Resistant Pathogens
By NBailly 17:21, July 14 2014 (CDT)
SEM of a human immune cell ingesting MRSA
MRSA can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and sepsis. Picture by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
In their article Noneffective Antibiotics published in June, the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche explains it as follows: Antibiotics are the natural weapon of molds or soil microbes against competing bacterial growth. These bacteria under siege in turn counterattack with resistances: attack and defense – the natural course of evolution. Thus it was only natural, too, that since the first human use of penicillin and co., pathogens have developed strategies in order to escape the antibiotics’ effect albeit these drugs are quite insidious weapons: Some rip holes in the cell walls of growing bacteria, while others block reading of the DNA strand, interfere with protein synthesis, or keep the pathogens from secreting so that they croak on their own toxins.
As long as a pathogen carries a resistance against just one of the above mentioned strategies, it can still be killed by an antibiotic using a different mode of action. However, the situation is more dangerous, when a bacterium acquired several antibiotic resistances. In the past decades, microorganisms have arisen that are unsusceptible to each and every of the several hundred antibiotics we have developed. Especially places like hospitals, where antibiotics are used day in and day out, are recept"

Classifier Architectures
The first proposed architecture is straightforward: it accommodates upregulated miR on the top layer, downregulated miR directly on the output layer and couples the upregulated ones with 2 parallel mechanisms in the middle layer: transcriptional repression of the output layer by LacI and post-transcriptional inhibition by FF4.
The second architecture removes the parallel inhibition mechanism by FF4 and loosens the coupling of low levels of upregulated miR to the output. At the same time, by adding upregulated miR targets at the middle layer, it increases the coupling of high levels of upregulated miR to the output.
By removing upregulated miR targets on the upper layer, the third architecture allows greater LacI leakage when the upregulated miR are high.
The fourth architecture is very similar to the third, only simpler to implement.
The fifth architecture again combines the complementary couplings provided by LacI and FF4.
By reestablishing the upper layer, we get architecture six.
And by removing LacI we get architecture seven.
Transcriptional vs Post-transcriptional Repression
The basic variable element among these architectures is the method of double inversion. The two middle layer coupling mechanisms we explore, LacI and FF4, are used individually or combined. To assess the significance of this decision, we explore the input-output relationship for the corresponding architectures by scanning a pair of input upregulated miRNAs connected together in the same OR gate along the biologically plausible range they can cover.
There is stark difference in their behaviour. LacI maps low counts of both the miRNAs to relatively low output levels (OUTmax = 10000) and high counts of either on to high output levels, thus implementing the OR gate. Its transition occurs very rapidly at relatively low miRNA counts, while its on/off ratio is 20. FF4 on the other hand is even more effective at mapping low levels of both miRNA to low output levels and high levels of both to high output, but maps high levels of only one of them to middle output, therefore implementing an arithmetic AND gate more than a logical OR gate. Its transition is much more gradual than LacI’s, leaving a large zone of uncertain output, while its overall on/off ratio is 15. It also appears that the FF4’s presence masks the effect of LacI.
AND gates are implemented more successfully, at least for upregulated miRNAs. Although the overall on/off ratio remains the same, the output is more consistent with a logical expression when one miRNA is high and the other is low.

Reporter Module
The construction of reporter module is consist of inducible promoter PibpAB (BBa_K339010) , RBS (BBa_B0034) , amilCP (BBa_K592025) , and double terminator (Bba_B0015) . BBa_K1387000 consist of RBS (Bba_B0034), amilCP (BBa_K592025) and double terminator  (BBa_B0015), while the complete module was contained in (Bba_K1387001) . The reporter module will have a blue chromoprotein when the inclusion body is formed in the cell. This mechanism then acts as an indicator of cytoplasmic stress, in this situation is caused by inclussion body.
Degradation Module
The casette of degradation module (BBa_K1387006) is comprised of constitutive promoter, tet operator, RBS, outer membrane protein A (ompA) fused with LC Cutinase, and double terminator. By using constitutive promoter, we expect the recombinant protein, in this case ompA-LC Cutinase, will be synthesized indefinitely. OmpA is outer membrane protein, it comprises of β–strand B3-B7. Rather than using full sequence of ompA, we use ompA (46-159) fused with lipoprotein signal sequence, thus exposing it on the cell surface of bacteria1. We fuse lpp-ompA with LC Cutinase, an enzyme that exhibit esterase activity. LC-Cutinase esterase activity will cleave the ester bond on PET and releasing terephthalic acid and eth"

C1.1: Equilibration
Figure 10: Equilibration of C1
This is the first step of the product recovery. Before applying the fermentation broth to the column it needs  to be fluidized. The fluidization process is described in greater detail during the next step. An important   parameter for the creation of a stable bed is viscosity, should viscosities of the different buffers used vary   in a degree that destabilizes the bed an inert viscous liquid will be added..

The expansion is achieved be applying 10 bed volumes (BV) of column buffer (20 mM (4-(2-  Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt) (Na-HEPES) and 500 mM Sodium chloride   (NaCl)) at a flowrate of 300 [cm/h], which is recommended, though flows between 200 and 400 [cm/h] has been shown   sufficient. The composition can be viewed in   table 8. Determination of the BV relies on the production (see  equation 1), it has been decided to produce 2 [g/batch] of the peptide aptamer. This decision will be   elaborated in the decription of the elution step (C1.4). Reference: NEB-impact

Meeting of iGEM teams from Germany
Robert and Gabriele beside our poster
On 28th of June 2012 the third yearly congress of the strategy process “ Biotechnologie 2020+ ” took place in Berlin. The strategy process was initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to gather ideas and information about new production processes and methods as well as new applications by supporting the cooperation of science and engineering. During the congress the recently realized achieved arrangements were presented and still existing problems and questions were discussed in workshops. Central aspects were inhibiting and supporting factors for the development and production of future biotechnology products.
This year all eleven iGEM teams from Germany participated with representatives at the congress of the strategy process. Each iGEM team was present with a poster about its project and the teams discussed their ideas with the participants of the
All iGEM teams from Germany
congress. For the iGEM teams the heterogeneous professions of the participants had the special advantage that their projects were observed from different points of view. To move closer together a get together with all iGEM teams took place with a lot of discussions, help offers and talk about collaborations. Especially for new teams this was a possibility to discuss not only problems concerning their project but also central questions of the competition and organizational concerns. One of the central topics of the meeting was Human Practices. In this connection the iGEM teams were considering about how it is possible to give the society a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. Therefore the final idea was to organize a common day of action in all ten cities of the iGEM teams to inform and to discuss with the public.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," us were woefully unaware of anything beyond the most basic safety considerations for working with antibiotics and antibiotic resistant organism in labs.
To abrogate this, we created CARD - a card up our sleeves against antibiotic resistance, based on four simple concepts: Contain, Avoid, Replace, Dispose
CARD serves as a short and easy primer for how to safely design and conduct projects involving antibiotics in biotechnology, developed for our team well as for any student and researcher in biotechnology. We have high hopes for CARD that go well beyond our iGEM project and serve to lead to safer research in our home universities and elsewhere. However, we do not aim to give a comprehensive overview of legislation or national / institutional regulations which may differ widely from each other and from best practice.
Contain your bacteria, plasmids and antibiotics
This simple step often happens to be overlooked or neglected even by experienced researchers but actually constitutes the solid base for limiting the contribution of our research to the spread of antibiotic resistance.
When considering the issue of containment in more detail, however, the question of decontamination becomes more complicated. Ideally, we want to remove three main contaminants, each one of them capable of driving antibiotic resistance development in the environment:
Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria
Plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance
Antibiotics
Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria
Compared with other contaminants, bacteria can be removed relatively easily. Whereas this process is obviously never 100% efficient, the majority of the popular strains used for cloning are effectively killed off by common sterilisation solutions such as 70 % ethanol [4] . Whereas there is evidence for certain organisms exhibiting a decreased sensitivity to antiseptics, the concentrations used are generally still multitudes higher than what those organisms can withstand. It is worth to note, however, that most antiseptics are not sporicidal [5] [6] . Generally, you should [7] :
Wash your hands when entering and leaving the lab
Wear lab coats and gloves when handling any kind of organism, in particular if this organisms is known to carry antimicrobial resistance genes
Decontaminate the surface you have worked on, as well as any equipment you have used
Additionally to classic containment strategies, new mechanisms to avoid the spread of recombinant bacteria are being developed, such as kill switches [8] .
Plasmids
Free plasmids can, in comparably rare cases, be taken up by bacteria in a process called ‘natural transformation’ [9] .
To avoid the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, any plasmids containing them should be degraded as completely as possible.The"

Questionnaire
We made 2 similar kinds of questionnaire. One is ""Attitude survey of genetic engineering"" and the other is  ""Attitude survey of biotechnology."" They are almost the same, but ""Attitude survey of biotechnology"" has a little different question from ""Attitude survey of genetic engineering"". We only changed the word ""genetic engineering"" of the survey for ""biotechnology"" in order to make ""Attitude survey of biotechnology.""

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"olecules - enzymes, catalytic RNAs or catalytic DNAs. For example, such library may consist of billions of randomly mutated enzyme sequences, a few computationally derived enzymes or a metagenomic enzyme library.
The next step, after building the library, is adding the essential genetic regulatory parts - RNA polymerase promoter and a ribosome binding site (2). These parts are necessary and sufficient to synthesize the biomolecules in both cells and in-vitro. For example, this can be done by ligating the regulatory parts onto DNA fragments or by using overhang PCR, which adds additional sequences to the end of your amplified product.
After the regulatory parts are added the fragments must then be circularized (3). DNA fragments are circularized for two main reasons:
1. First of all, in order to amplify the DNA inside microfluidic droplets an isothermal amplification reaction must be used. That is because droplets become highly unstable and can break easily when the temperature is quickly altered - just like during the popular polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If droplets would break during the initial stages of amplification, all of the information from different droplets would get mixed in the tube and the knowledge about which activity belongs to which sequence would be lost, as it was not yet recorded by the means of amplification (before the amplification, the activity measurement information is in form of modified substrate nucleotides).
That is why CAT-Seq uses a multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which is a non-thermocycling (isothermal) based DNA amplification technique. MDA was chosen because of its ability to rapidly amplify single templates of DNA into long double-stranded molecules which contain multiple repeats of the starting template. That said, one of the core requirements of MDA reaction is that starting DNA template must be circular.
2. Secondly, as seen in the later steps of CAT-Seq, in order to efficiently express a catalytic biomolecule in droplets, Rolling Cycle Transcription (described in catalytic biomolecule production section) is used, which immensely increases mRNA synthesis yield from a single DNA template. Such technique also requires the DNA to be circular, as an RNA polymerase travels around it in circles producing mRNA.
Proof of concept
Choosing the first catalytic biomolecule for creating and optimizing CAT-Seq system was a classical “chicken or the egg” paradox. At the very beginning, when system design was purely theoretical and we have been preparing to build it, the main question we had was - what is the combination of substrate nucleotide and catalytic biomolecules we should use,"

Dundee,2013,Team:Dundee#Project#MopTesting_-_-_TEXT.html,"obacterial toxins from freshwater systems such as Clatto reservoir for example. Our main concern was in ensuring that our genetically engineered bacteria could not escape from our device into the surrounding environment. Therefore we wanted to prevent our ‘Mop’ cells from escaping but it was crucial that contaminated water could still interact with the cells. We decided to contain our cells within dialysis tubing. Dialysis tubing is a semi-permeable membrane composed of cellulose. The tubing is studded with pores and we chose a pore size of 8000 Da, this pore size is too small to allow the passage of whole bacterial cells. Microcystin has a molecular weight of around 1000 Da and so should freely move through the pores. This decision was an attempt to address some of the safety concerns that were expressed to us through our consultation process as the engineered bacteria would not be released into a complex ecosystem. A ‘blueprint’ of our device is shown in Fig 2.
Figure 2: The ‘blueprint’ of our ‘Mop’ Device. Left: The ‘Mop’ cells (shown as purple circles) are contained within dialysis tubing with a pore size of 8000 Da. Each end of the tubing is sealed with a dialysis clip (Green rectangle). Right: The dialysis bag is submerged into a beaker containing microcystin (shown as skull and crossbones). The microcystin should be able to move through the pores as it is much smaller than the pore size. When microcystin interacts with periplasmic PP1 a covalent bond will be formed and the toxin will be pulled out of solution.
Testing the ‘Mop’ device
Cells for trialling our ‘Mop’ device were again grown and prepared as above. A picture of our first ‘Mop’ device is shown in Fig 3. To trial our ‘Mop’ device we put 1 mL of the 1 g per mL ‘Mop’ cell suspension into the dialysis tubing, we also set up devices containing the control cells as described above. The dialysis tubes were placed into individual beakers, each containing 200 mL of 5 nM microcystin in TBS solution. The devices were incubated with stirring at room temperature for 1 h before 1 mL of the microcystin solution was removed, snap frozen and stored at-80OC. The samples were analysed the next day using the ELISA kit as before. Sadly, our Mop device did not successfully reduce the microcystin concentration. We have since repeated the experiment"

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," team worked to compile a list of functional requirements (FRs) that our system would have to meet:
Given our research, it was evident that the main goal of our scaffold was to increase the product titre from a given synthetic enzyme pathway (FR1: Increase product titre). With previous studies showing that a considerable increase in titre could be achieved through the utilisation of synthetically scaffolded proteins4,5, this seemed like an achievable goal. However, this main requirement of increasing yield was relatively broad, so breaking down this overall function into sub-requirements (FR1.1, FR1.2 and FR1.3) was necessary6:
Current Challenge
Criteria to Satisfy this problem
Naming Convention (relating to the flowchart)
Engineered metabolic pathways often suffer from flux imbalances5.
Metabolic flux rates of the system could be increased by increasing the concentration of intermediates8.
FR1.2.1
Decreasing the enzyme concentration required to produce the same product titre would have significant cost saving outcomes in an industrial context.
FR1.2.2
Unintended interactions between synthetic pathways and the cellular environment of the host can have significant implications for the productivity of novel pathways9.
Considering the benefits observed by the natural channelling of intermediates in vivo10, further lower level requirements can be identified such as:
Limiting the diffusion of intermediates into the surroundings
Facilitating the fast turnover of labile or toxic intermediates
FR1.1.1 and FR1.1.2
The critical determinant of scaffold effectiveness has been suggested to be the ability to provide control over reaction stoichiometry9.
As such the system must provide the capability of optimising enzyme stoichiometry.
FR1.3
On top of these key requirements, the system was also required to have commercial value and, as such, would have to be able to be used in a variety of applications (FR2: Adapt to different applications):
Current Challenge
Criteria to Satisfy this problem
Naming Convention (relating to the flowchart)
Previous enzyme agglomerates have been observed to only form under certain conditions, such as purinosomes discovered in HeLa cells that were found to cluster only in response to higher purine levels11. Yet, for the envisioned use of our system, the team determined that the scaffold would have to assemble independent of environmental conditions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the system to be able to function both in vivo and ex vivo environments.
FR2.2
Furthermore, the system would have to adapt to utilising a range of different enzymes. This would require"

MFC Efficiency
Figure 16 MFC efficiency comparing estimated current and measured current. The average efficiency of our MFC design is around 0.2-0.3
Assuming the decrease of cell population in the growth curve was because of using up the 20mM lactate after 24 hours in the M9 anaerobic medium, we estimated the average lactate uptake flux from the wet mass of cell, then we search for the theoretical electron generating flux through the FBA model described in figure 4 of modelling pages.
The wet mass was converted to dry mass by a factor of 0.3, assuming 70% water content in the mass. As described in modelling, the corresponding maximum DET flux was evaluated based on the assumption of 5% of biomass growth flux. The efficiency was evaluated by comparing the measured current with the maximum theoretical current.
Transformation
We first made the chemically competent cells and attempted to transform the Shewanella by chemical method. After several unsuccessful attempts by increasing both cell and DNA concentration, we turned to use electroporation for higher transformation efficiency. Instead of RFP in the competency kit plate, GFP is chosen as reporter for competency check to avoid confusion with pink Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. However, we cannot get any transformed colony yet. Literature also showed low transformation efficiency of pSB1C3-GFP in Shewanella, 4 colonies were observed on the transformed plate after electroporation[3]. We hypothesized that the competent cell concentration is not high enough to achieve observable transformed colonies on plate.

So it will be great if at first the cellulose is produced to block the existing channels, then with the injection of water, some small channels begin to form, so that the water can enter into the gaps of soil. And then the inducer is added to induce rhamnolipid to help the oil be washed out.
To make it controllable, we introduce fimS. In E. coli, the expression of the fimbriae component, FimA, is controlled in a binary fashion through the inversion of a 314 bp segment of DNA (fimS) that contains the FimA promoter. The inversion of fimS is performed by the DNA recombinase FimE, which binds to two inverted repeat sequences (Inverted Repeat Left and Right, IRL and IRR, respectively) that flank the fimS element. FimE has different binding affinities for IRL and IRR depending on the orientation of fimS, as a result, FimE is able to efficiently cause recombination only when the promoter faces IRR. Therefore, switch inversion is permanent and heritable.
In our design, rhl-BcsA switch will expresses nothing in nature condition. ●When nothing is added, there is no product because of the presence of the lactose operon.
●After we use IPTG to induce, it will constitutively express BcsA when fimS is oriented toward IRR, corresponding to the OFF state, and FY-07 will start to produce cellulose.
●Following when arabinose is added, fimE is produced due to arabinose operon. Unidirectional inversion (activation) of the switch by FimE, fimS is reoriented toward IRL and causes the constitutive expression of rhlABC, which corresponds to the ON state, and FY-07 will start to produce rhamnolipid.
In this condition FY-07 can controllably produce rhamnolipid and cellulose if we control the time and amount of the IPTG and arabinose.

1Gibson Assembly for small parts

1.2Efficiency of reaction
1.3Conclusion
Gibson Assembly for small parts
During the construction of our first plasmid, we had many problems dealing with getting correct assemblies of the constructs which involved small parts (< 200bp). We found that for those kind of assemblies, people would recommend using as much as 5 times more DNA from the smaller insert in relation to the amount of plasmid backbone, arguing that such a small insert would be completely chewed up by the T5 exonuclease when in small amount.
Our analysis of the reaction gave us notion that theoretically, the number of resulting colonies would be in direct relation to the amount of available backbone. However, the total number of true positives would only be influenced by the ratio at which the inserts could compete with the assembly of aberrant constructs, such as the one described by the Washington University 2011 iGEM Team about selfcomplementarity of the NotI sequences embedded in the prefix and suffix.
Having in mind that the small part would be chewed up by the T5 exonuclease and that with no insert available the remaining backbone would end up assembling with its selfcomplementary ends, we decided to see if we could test if by changing the amount of T5 exonuclease in the reaction we could improve our rate of true positives.
To challenge this, we designed a Gibson Assembly which involved a small part of mRFP1 and a large backbone for it to assemble. Our design included a strategy to quickly identify those colonies which where true positives from false positive.
We used pSB4K5-J04450 and selected a portion of mRFP1 which would measure"

Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast,, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed into biological fertilizers. This type of biological fertilizer not only enhances crop production, but also can help the soil maintain a high fertility.  Last but not least, burning of kitchen waste can be replaced by our decomposition method, which will effectively relieve the current unpleasant situation of air pollution.
Economic impact
Our project is aimed to increase the tolerance of yeast in hypertonic environments during food waste decomposition. With our modified yeast, survivability of yeast and their decomposing efficiency can be greatly increased. Currently, most of the companies have to add new yeast periodically to keep the decomposition rate. With the help of our yeast, the companies can save more costs by reducing the needs of large amount of yeast and increasing the decomposition efficiency.
Humanity
Because of the effectiveness of our modified yeast in food waste decomposition, people will be able of enjoy a safer and more comfortable life in a fresh and clean environment without the negative effects caused by the food waste.

We began cloning by digesting IDT stock solutions of T7/amilCP with EcoRI-HF and PstI, following iGEM standard protocols. We then ligated T7/amilCP with pSB1C3, using the iGEM ligation protocol. To screen the ligation we used our PCR protocol. After running PCR products on an agarose gel, we found that the ligation failed.
Week 14
We repeated the ligation at 4°C overnight. The reactions contained 5μL digested insert, 5μL digested linear pSB1C3, 1U T4 DNA Ligase, 1x T4 Ligase Buffer, and molecular water to a final volume of 15μL. The ligation was tested in the same way, and once again produced no bands.
The third attempt at ligation contained 10μL digested insert, 2.5μL of a plasmid with pSB1C3 that we digested using XbaI and SpeI, 1u T4 DNA Ligase, 1x T4 Ligase Buffer, and molecular water to a final volume of 20μL. It was left at room temperature for 1 hour, then moved to incubate at 16°C overnight. The ligation was tested in the same way as the previous 2 attempts. The gel had strong bands at 75bp, the size of the empty vector, and faint bands in the correct location for successful ligations.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html," grow on seeds to form flagellar filaments, but they cannot nucleate into seeds. Spontaneous nucleation can only happen in the presence of a high concentration of certain anions (often referred to as good ""salting-outers"", e.g. $SO_4^{2-}$, $F^-$, citrate ions) and neutral pH. The second and third step of our design correspond to the nucleation process and the elongation process respectively.
A key issue here is the competition between the process occurring on the yeast surface and that in the solution. Once nucleated, fragments of filaments will not be able to bind with one another to form new filaments (Lino, 1974). Therefore, only free flagellin monomers in the solution are useful for the polymerization on the yeast surface. Seeds formed in the solution are not only useless, but also reduce the concentration of flagellin monomers, which decelerates assembly on the yeast surface. Hence, our goal is to promote polymerization on the yeast surface and avoid it in the solution.
Our design prohibits assembly in the solution in the elongation step, namely step three. The condition in the buffer, i.e. physiological ionic strength and pH, only allows elongation, and nucleation cannot occur. Then, the flagellin monomers can only assemble on the existing seeds on the yeast surface, which is exactly what we want.
However, in step two, the nucleation step, the assembly in the solution cannot be completely avoided. We are therefore interested in how we can adjust the conditions to best promote polymerization on the yeast surface, and how many seeds will form in the end. Our model tries to answer these questions.
Model Formulation
Tables are provided for all the variables and parameters in the model at the end of this section for your reference.
For reasons stated in the section above, our model focuses on the nucleation process under conditions specified in step two. Elongation takes place alongside nucleation, and our model has to describe these two processes both on the yeast surface and in the solution. It is worth noting that depolymerization plays a relatively minor role in the assembly of flagellar filaments compared to microtubules, so our model will not put too much stress on this process like we did in the microtubule model.
There are some very sophisticated models describing protein polymerization. For instance, Kashchiev (2015) gave a comprehensive analysis of the polymerization process using nucleation theory, which, with all the correct parameters given, can predict the concentration of"

In Figure 6 , (#4) marks a ClothoData object. ClothoData objects are the means by which ClothoConnections communicate with one another. ClothoData objects are classes encapsulating the following information:
Sender - The connection which generated this object. This is the connection which is typically initiating a transaction.
Recipient - The intended destination for this object. This is the connection which is typically responding to a transaction.
Op Code and Use Code - These codes determine the type of operation which the data should be used for (e.g. calculate a DNA sequence's open reading frames) as well as how it should be used within the operation itself (e.g. the data is the sequence itself). There are an explicit enumeration of both Op Codes and Use Codes which enforce type safety in the system.
Payload - This is the bulk of the data. This is a generic data object which allows the system to pass back and forth whatever is required for the transaction.
Payload Information - An additional mechanism for detailing the payload should the Op and Use codes not be sufficiently granular.
Each individual connection is responsible for both being able to generate their own ClothoData objects and well as process incoming data objects. ClothoData objects are routed throughout the system by a connection addressing scheme. A key aspect of this addressing scheme is a ClothoHub.
For more detailed insight into the organization of a Clotho Data object and its operation you can check out the java doc here .
5. Clotho Algorithm
In addition to connections, Clotho also supports ClothoAlgorithms. These interact specifically with the Clotho Algorithm Manager . These are shown as (#5) in Figure 6 . This specific connection makes user created algorithms available to the rest of the system. The user can create an extension of the ClothoAlgorithm class and simply instantiate the algorithms in the Clotho software architecture netlist and register them with the ClothoCore. This then makes the algorithm available to use through a flexible GUI. The algorithm manager also allows the algorithms access to any of the database connections available to Clotho. This can be used to look up part information or save and create new parts.
For more detailed information on the algorithm manager and the creation of algorithms you can check out the java doc here .

The purpose of the Clotho Data Structure is to take potentially random, unorganized data and give it both syntactic and semantic meaning. Once this process has been done Clotho can now work on data in a unified framework by which developers and users can speak the same language about design"

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing 'controller cells' to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems.
Metabolic engineering exploits the genetic modification of cellular pathways to improve production of metabolites and proteins. Many noteworthy examples have been demonstrated wherein these cells serve as 'factories' for the environmentally sustainable production of energy, materials, and chemicals. Towards this aim, metabolic engineering has incorporated finely tuned synthetic controllers and cells in the creation of artificial networks. The general structure of these synthetic networks is based on control devices that respond to specific stimuli in a predictable fashion.
However, the task of coordinating among and between cell populations remains a critical challenge that can limit the production of desired end-products. One creative approach to address both of these challenges is through the leveraging of cell—Cell communication networks, and these have been the target of a variety of dynamic control systems.
AI-2 is synthesized and recognized by a wide variety of bacteria, which is known as a universal language in bacteria populations; correspondingly its use as a potential target for modulating Quorum Sensing (QS) activities among different cell types is of interest. In this project, we have developed bacteria AI-2 suppliers and AI-2-consumers, which can be deployed to control AI-2 concentration in a predictable fashion using the now well-characterized QS mechanisms of E. coli.
We have addressed this through the model-based design, construction, and characterization of these 'controller cells' to modulate the external AI-2 environment.
Design & Functional Prototype
We developed 'controller cells' that manipulate the molecular connection between cells by modulating the bacterial signal molecule, autoinducer-2, which is secreted as a QS signal by many bacteria species. Specifically, we have engineered E. coli to overexpress components responsible for AI-2 production (luxS, mtn), uptake (lsrACDB), phosphorylation (lsrK), and degradation (lsrFG), thereby attenuating cell—cell communication among populations.
Part 1 AI-2 Supplier
Abstract: To enrich the AI-2 concentration in the nature or artificial environment, we constructed two AI-2 Supplier Devices by overexpression the components responsible for AI-2 production (luxS, mtn).

Information expansion
Many biobricks are unclear in the iGEM Registry, and there is not enough information. When you browse BBa_K209410 in the iGEM registry and BioMaster, the results are as follows:
In iGEM Registry
In BioMaster
Through the above results, we can find that there is no description of the biobricks in the iGEM registry. However, in BioMaster you can not only find its function, species, Feature Key, but also the GO annotations and some references. With those information, you can better use the biobricks and even create new biobricks.
Search
When you want to search for a biobrick with a certain function such as: cellulose synthase, BioMaster will give the following results:
You can also search the wiki by keywords. For example, if you search for biosensor, BioMaster gives the following results:
Finally, you can also search directly using sequences: input sequence.
We have a different result:
In iGEM registry
In BioMaster
BioMaster can directly use sequence matching to find all biobricks that match the input sequence and sort by score. In addition, BioMaster gives more detailed information about matching sites, E-values and biobricks.
When the user cannot find a suitable biobrick, we also provide a reference to the user from the promoter predicted in the E. coli genome.
Wet-lab Validation
We worked with USETC-China to validate the effects of our predictor. They provided us with the FRE sequence of they used, we predicted this sequence, and performed promoter optimization to remove unnecessary part. They constructed plasmids with predicted promoter, and selecting red fluorescent protein as their reporter gene. After the vector was constructed and verified by sequencing, they transferred it to the host DH5.
By verification, the normal work of the red fluorescent protein can be seen, which proves that the predicted promoter is very likely correct.
Feedback
We invited 2018-NKU_CHINA, 2018-UESTC-China and 2018-USTC-Software to use our database. Meanwhile, we invited some previous iGEMers and professions to use it. They gave affirmation to our database and also gave us some advice to improve the database and better serve synthetic biology.
