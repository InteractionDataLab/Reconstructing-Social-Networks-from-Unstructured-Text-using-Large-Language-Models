Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water. Living near the wine places, like winemakers, are the most exposed.
Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates (plaques) characteristics of the disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal amounts. It can protect neurons against oxidation. However, several studies have shown that copper plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. It is also increasingly referred to as an ""environmental illness"". Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates in the case of disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
2. Curdlan
Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms. This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast’s wall. No bad impact on the environment has been identified. Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.
In 2013, the “Savoy ADAbio” tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests. For example, they tested the effect of fructose against mildew. After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of  100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper. According to this testimony, we now know that sugar helps fight against mildew.
Also used in many different applications, Curdlan doesn’t seems to have bad effects (see Other Effects Curdlan). However, we also collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature. This experience is useful to know"

Laccase LttH from Thermus thermophilus HB27 (ATCC7061)
Summary
Initially some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with different parameters to identify the best conditions for the production of the His-tagged laccase LttH from Thermus thermophilus HB27 named TTHL. Due to the absence of enzyme activity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-His tag resin). Using E. coli KRX containing BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K863010</partinfo>, TTHL could not be detected by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 53 kDa) or by activity test. Therefore a new BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_K863012</partinfo> was constructed and expressed in E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2. With this expression system the TTHL could be detected by SDS-PAGE and purified by using a small scale Ni-NTA column. The fractionated samples were tested regarding their activity. TTHL was shown to oxidize ABTS. After measuring activity of TTHL a scale up of the fermentation was successfully implemented up to 6 L. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) and a labscale Ni-NTA-Purification were implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize TTHL. A total specific enzyme activity of 15 U mg-1 was determined for TTHL at pH 4 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," “Resistance transfer is a major challenge beyond the borders as antibiotic remainders can be found in food from cuttle.” In the Netherlands, this seems less of a problem, according to Paul. “We need to be sure that no antibiotics remain in the milk before we can sell the milk”.
“Since two years we are breeding cows that are healthier and have more resistance against diseases. We treat mastitis with the antibiotic Ubrolexin in a late stage. In this stage the udder looks red and infected”. Paul is able to check himself whether or not the cow has mastitis in early stage. “If the cow has mastitis, the milk texture is different. In this early stage, Ice Mint, a treatment salve, can do the trick and cure the infection”. Paul told us about new techniques in the market, like the milk robots that detect the potential of mastitis. “Measurement on the milk conduction can predict whether or not a cow is infected with mastitis”.

Insights
Current methods to detect resistance take too long when immediate treatment is needed
Antibiograms and sensitivity tests
Lab results are still needed to validate diagnosis and to monitor
The use of milk robots
Need for argumentation to start with second choice antibiotics
Need for pathogen detection causing the disease
Changes
Look into pathogen detection
Look into developing a method for future milk robots (producer: Lely )
Summary
During this interview, we gained knowledge on current methods to identify pathogens and determine the sensitivity of these pathogens. These detailed methods will be necessary to follow trends and to validate current treatment and diagnosis. Furthermore, mastitis can be caused by different pathogens and it hard to identify which pathogen cause the disease and subsequently, identify which resistance genes this pathogen has. The milk robots are the new technologies in the field to detect and count cells in the cow's milk. The amount of cells (>25.000) is an indication for mastitis.

Synthetic Biology Seminar
The human practice team of ITB_Indonesia held a seminar with the topic about Synthetic Biology at the library of Institut Teknologi Bandung at May, 2nd 2015. The seminar was attended by many students within the ITB enthusiastically. At this seminar, we provided general knowledge regarding synthetic biology and presented the project of iGEM ITB 2015 this year about Rhamcolipid.
Questionnaire and Project Socialization
Bandung, the capital city of West Java, has various interesting and attractive events. One of those is the Car Free Day at the famous district of Bandung, Dago. At this every Sunday event, the iGEM team of ITB had a talk with the people of Bandung and tourists from other cities. We also asked for the participation and support from the society for our team by answering our questionnaires regarding to synthetic biology and its applications. There were already three times conducted projects, April, 19th 2015; May, 31st 2015; June, 14th 2015.
Seminar and Meetup of iGEM Teams from Indonesia
The ITB_Indonesia is proud to be able to host the first meetup of all of iGEM Teams of Indonesia this year at June, 27th 2015. By this great opportunity, we also collaborated with UB_Indonesia and UI_Indonesia to held a seminar. During this seminar, we also had the chance to share each of team’s project this year. In addition, we also asked the participants to flll the Oxford Team’s questionnaires as the form of our human practice collaboration. Not only that, we were also very happy to welcome the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes, through the live chat via skype video call. At the end of the seminar, while having the dinner"

The cultures were then left in the 37°C shaker overnight and examined the next morning. We were pleased to note that the culture exposed to nitrate was visibly green whilst the one without was not, suggesting our new biobrick worked at least at the most basic ‘on/ off’ level.
More detailed characterisation: 0 - 10mM assay
Experiment
Our next step was to set up and assay examining the biobrick's behaviour between 0 – 10 mM of Potassium Nitrate at 2mM intervals. The same colony of MG1655 containing BBa_K381001 was used to inoculate six 5mL tubes of LB at varying nitrate levels as listed below. This was repeated twice to allow the results to be averaged.

This data allowed us to construct graphs illustrating the trend in increased GFP production with increase in nitrate. The first images below show the raw data from the photo-spectrometer, and the graphs constructed from it.
We then used this data to generate a graph showing the average increase in GFP production, as illustrated below:
Unfortunately, because we only ran two repeats, we cannot be certain whether the downward curve of the graph is true behaviour or the result of one the 10mM readings being extremely low

Pure uncertainty
There is no possible scenario wherein catastrophe occurs when the precaution is taken
Taking the precaution achieves results that are close to the best case that could have been achieved
If the precaution is not taken, then catastrophe will occur
These conditions are quite strict, which limits the use of the maximin rule, e.g. it is rare that we have complete uncertainty (1) when discussing the Precautionary Principle. The problem is more often incomplete knowledge.
The minimax regret is originally an economic principle but has been proposed as an explication of the Precautionary Principle by Chrisholm and Clarke CHISHOLM, A. & CLARKE, H. 1993. Fair principles for sustainable development. Natural Resource Management and the Precautionary Principle (ed. Edward Dommen), Edward Elgar Publishing, 109-122. . The minimax regret helps finding what action (i.e. precaution or no precaution) in a given case that has the least difference between its result and the best possible result that could be obtained in the case. If there is no difference between the first action and its result and the best possible result, then there is no regret and it is therefore the action to choose. It can be clarified by showing in the two tables.

Summary
We analyzed the questionaires the students filled after the lectures, and obtained crucial information about their opinions and intention. Guided by the questionaire, we wrote a report to apply for a specific funding for iGEM-HS in Beijing and began to guide three students from the SHSBNU towards their future participation in iGEM competition.
Questionaire Analysis
In order to more about what high school students thought of Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and our lectures, as well as what supports do they want to get from us, we made a questionaire. After the lectures, 53 students (24 male and 29 female) out of all the audience filled our questionaire.
Questionaire. (Chinese Version)
Questionaire. (English Version)
Figure 13. Questionaires.
The datas are of great help. According to Question 1 and Question 4 in the questionaire, we recognized that over three-fifths of students have not heard of Synthetic Biology and over nine-tenths of students have not heard of iGEM competition before our lectures. Therefore it is extremely necessary for us to popularize the concept of SB as well as iGEM before any other actions. What makes us impressed is nealy 60% of students attended desire to take part in the iGEM competition, according to Question 6, which means our lectures of SB and iGEM did attract most of students' interests and enables us to fulfill our goal to guide them towards future participation in iGEM.

Question 6

Furthermore, based on the analyses we made it clear what we should do next. As we could see from the datas, there are 40% of students who are not willing to participate iGEM in the future; actually, only a few of them are not interested in SB or the iGEM, so we decided to analysize the reasons behind. According to Quesion 7, out of all the possible reasons ""Having little academic support"" and ""No funding"" are the most important. In addition, when we managed to find out what supports do students who desire to participate iGEM need, corresponding"

UCSF,2008,Team:UCSF#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"In several group discussions at the beginning of the summer, we identified a range of synthetic biology goals that might benefit from the use of heterochromatin/silencing. The concept of a “yeast immune system” arose in these discussions—essentially, yeast engineered to differentiate at the epigenetic level in response to detection of a pathogen. We then spent the rest of the summer working up and characterizing the parts that would be necessary to build it (3 months goes fast)! Thus, yeast will have to remain immune-compromised a little while longer…
Who did it?
As part of his postdoctoral work studying feedback at the level of the histone tail, Andrew Horwitz established the original LexA-Sir2/LexA operators system.
All other work was completed by the students, with mentorship and technical advice from their buddies:
During their pre-project in May/June, the Lincoln High School Students, under the supervision of George Cachianes, cloned a panel of chromatin-related genes into yeast over-expression vectors and identified Sir3 and Ssn8 as factors that were limiting for silencing. This was later used to “push” weakly silenced bits, expanding the range of promoters that could be silenced.
Willis Wong (Inputs group) explored alternative inputs for the induction of silencing, including GPCR-mediated signaling and light inducible dimerization.
Alex Ng and Ryan Quan (Silencing Group) investigated the relationship between promoter strength and silencing by generating a “matrix” of yeast strains with variations on the basic silencing bit. This work defined the range of promoters that can be used for synthetic silencing of a given target promoter. They also demonstrated that silencing is dominant over moderate transcriptional activators.
Jimmy Huang cloned and tested the regional silencing constructs, and also worked on feedback mechanisms to “lock in” silencing.
Leeza Sergeeva and Tiffany Saw, of the Antisilencing Group, worked on developing ways to un-silence a gene. Leeza also helped with the modeling effort and tested the Shuttle vector system by converting a few candidate AarI parts into BioBricks.
As part of the Outputs group, Jacinto Chen and Cathy Liu worked on silencing alternative genes (e.g. filamentation mediators, antimicrobial peptide genes).
Jacinto Chen also characterized the distance dependence of silencing and is working on identifying sequence elements that enhance (protosilencers) or limit (boundary elements) the spread of heterochromatin.

Kill-switch
The first safety concern we had was, understandably, creating a kill-switch. Kill-switches are are common practice for synthetic biology and for a good reason, and are made even more important when it comes to a project like ours, where you want your final GMO product to spread as much as possible, safely. Our entire project was designed and executed side-by-side with our Integrated Human Practices , trying to gain as much feedback as we could from specialists about the safety and biocontainment of our P. agglomerans.
We designed a pH-based kill-switch , but as we didn’t get to the testing stage of releasing it into the wild, it didn’t get to be put to work for real. Additionally, we gathered all the information we have on designing a paratransgenesis kill-switch on our Conceptual Framework .
Elimination
The elimination module of a paratransgenesis should, ideally, eliminate the target. And the stronger the effect the better, right? Well, not really. As we discussed in our Elimination page , when picking paratransgenesis effectors you must keep in mind how broad-working they are. Ideally, it should harm pathogens as much as possible while harming humans (and other non-pathogenic organism) as least as possible.
Our only effector with a Risk Group classification was DN59 , against the dengue virus, characterized as Risk Group 2. However, it’s classified as so because it is derived from one of the virus’ protein - but modified to block that protein, which made"

Introduction and Outline
So far we have transformed DH5-alpha E. coli cells with two synthesized BioBricks, which are the cotC-GFP-smtA and the kinA BioBricks. The cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick is involved within the metal sensing sub-project whereas the kinA BioBrick is involved with the Sporulation Team's sub-project. The Metal Sensing team have since taken these transformant colonies and used them to set up LB+kanamycin cultures for mini-preps and midi-preps; these were then left overnight in the orbital shaking incubator and are awaiting processing today. However there are a range of tasks which need to be accomplished today; these are listed below:
Prepare Mini-preps of the kinA and cotC-GFP-smtA transformants
Carry out the mini-prep processes
Analyse the mini-prep DNA  by treating with restriction enzymes.
PCR the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick with pMK15 and pMK16
Set up the PCR
Run the PCR for the correct duration
Analyse PCR products through DNA gel electrophoresis
Clean up PCR products if PCR reaction proves to be successful
Midi-prep cotC-GFP-smtA, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4 and pSB1AT3
Carry out the five midi-preps.
Quantify the midi-prep samples
Run the midi-prep samples on agarose gel through DNA gel electroph"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The ability to use a Design of Experiments approach towards the optimisation of CFPS systems has also been demonstrated. While this study has provided evidence towards these claims, further work should be performed to validate the findings. A DoE screening design for the supplements of CFPS systems should be used on the same cell extract batch repeatedly. This will help confirm that the screening models derived from the experimental design data are accurate. The screening design should also be performed on many different batches of at least moderately active cell extracts to confirm that important supplements do differ between batches. Following the above, a surface response design could be used for all commonly important supplements of the CFPS system to determine its effectiveness at optimising CFPS activity. The information could also be used to determine commonly unimportant supplements so they can be eliminated from the supplement solution, hence decreasing the cost per reaction. Furthermore, the full Sensynova system can be expressed in cell-free.

Birkbeck,2015,Team:Birkbeck#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Our aim was to use fun props and games to illustrate key concepts in genetics to an eager     audience of four separate classes of 9-year olds and 11-year olds.
The planning necessary before the big day was instrumental in our success. We devised scripts to involve all our team in the presentations and games while     leaving room for inevitable improvisation, designed engaging and practically feasible games with a tight time limit, crafted attractive props and finally     rehearsed numerous times to ensure our busk was going to be memorable.
We came up with four different games. The first one involved a talk about germs and a game where clapping children would react to glitter on their hands     when a team member in our clapping row introduced it at a random time. The glitter symbolised germs, and the game showed the children unequivocally just     how easily they spread through brief hand to hand contact. Our second game elegantly illustrated the notions in Mendelian genetics by using red and white     beans as alleles for flower colour. The kids were given varying combinations of these beans and had to work out what colour they produced.
Cautiously, we introduced DNA as a concept to the children in our third and fourth games. We assigned volunteers a nucleotide base and through     complementary binding and strand annealing we created a human DNA. Finally, paper DNA with action codes on was given to groups of pupils. After decoding     their piece of DNA, the whole class acted out what it specified all at once as the DNA was “activated”.
The reactions from the most enthusiastic children were unforgettable and hilarious in equal measure, and we can safely say that even the most sceptical of     kids became fascinated by the end of our busk.

What have we been doing, you ask? Well, for starters, we've been forwarding our articles for the Amoy China 2015 iGEM team whose Newsletter reaches hundreds of people.
In the Amoy Newsletter Number 5, which is just below, to read more about our team, go to p.9-11, and on p.59-66, we describe the kinds of human practice events we've already taken part in. For example, we talk about the iGEM London BootCamp that we jointly organised with the UCL 2015 iGEM and the London Biohackspace 2015 iGEM teams! And now we're planning another London iGEM meet (at the end of July), and a more general UK iGEM meet"

Prof. Juliana Chan
Introduction
Professor Juliana Chan is a professor of medicine and therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). She is also director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity, CUHK, co-director of CUHK-Prince of Wales Hospital International Diabetes Federation Centre of Education (IDFCE), and chief executive officer of the Asia Diabetes Foundation. With extensive knowledge on diabetes, obesity and clinical practice, Prof. Chan brought to our attention practical aspects of developing treatments for medical purposes. Meeting Prof. Chan helped us to understand more about the biochemistry of diabetes. Also, by giving us information on current treatments for obesity and diabetes, she allowed us to consider our work in context. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the regulations for the development of new treatments in medical fields.
Main Discussion
Professor Chan thought that our project was interesting because she has been keen to solve problems related to obesity and diabetes. She mentioned that obesity is a disease that many people disregard, but that has great potential to cause complications such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As more studies related to obesity are done, it seems like the cause of obesity is more than unbalanced lifestyle and diet. Professor Chan said that the underlying reason of obesity could be genetics and/or epigenetics.
In the case of diabetes, dysfunctional proteins from the deficient genes and high levels of free fatty acid could provide a stressful environment for the beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin. Prof. Chan explained that this kind of stress on beta cells can cause insulin resistance and ultimately lead to type II diabetes. We have investigated if our project could alleviate diabetes. Prof. Chan mentioned that our project could definitely help to reduce the stress on the beta cells by decreasing the amount of free fatty acid and ultimately alleviating diabetes. She, however, acknowledged that in the long run, our project itself"

Interviews
Overview
We decided to do an analysis of biosecurity, specifically the dual use issue of our project. While we were scanning the literature for information about our biosensor for detection of date rape drugs, we encountered many sensitive information about the accessibility and (chemical) synthesis of date rape drugs. Those information are publicly available. Especially the publication of a freely available ingredient raised our concern. This knowledge can create a threat to the health of people, if it is misused.
Because iGEM is an open source competition, we might ourselves provide knowledge that could be of dual use. Since iGEM asks us to be striving to be conscientious members of the synthetic biology community, we informed ourselves about existing biosafety, biosecurity and dual use regulations.
We found the legal situation in Germany, the European Union and the USA to be inconsistent. In addition to these laws, many proposals from various advisory boards and non governmental organizations exist. We provide an overview about the proposals of these organizations and summarize various aspects of the ongoing ethical discussion about the opposing needs freedom of science and regulation of research with possible biosecurity issues. Therefore we contacted several experts from ethics committees, members of the German ethics council, a constitutional lawyer and a law student from the USA, as well as the iGEM safety committee itself. In fruitful discussions we obtained"

He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal to become a philosopher.
Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Yuqing is a sophomore majoring in biology at UCAS.
The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.

Societal effect assessment
Once we had ideas of S-Din, we interviewed professionals or scholars in different fields and searched related policies. We had a better awareness of our project in the context of scientific inspiration, societal attention, safety and security, and legal considerations.( Silver page)
When S-Din was finished, we introduced it to the professionals. With their advice and help, we wrote a product statement combined with four parts: Terms of use, Bio-safety Alerts, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.
See statements page for more details.
Public promotion
When S-Din started to take shape, we promoted it to several iGEM teams and biology laboratories. They were interested in our software and tried out, then we were glad to receive their encouraging user feedback:

It is one of the most important antioxidant that works in order to reduce ROSs that are produced during metabolic activities such as furfural reduction and fermentation (Pizzorno, 2014; Forman, 2009). It prevents oxidative stress from building up in the cell metabolism which causes cell damage and eventually, death (Pizzorno, 2014; Forman, 2009). The pathway of glutathione synthetase and glutathione are demonstrated below along with the effects of glutathione on cell mass:
Glutathione Synthesis by Glutathione Synthetase
Figure 6:                     Glutathione Synthetase converts glycine and y-glutamyl cysteine to glutathione.
Glycine + y-glutamyl cysteine + Glutathione Synthetases →  Glutathione Synthetase Glutathione
Glutathione Oxidation and Reduction Pathways
Figure 7:                     Glutathione reduces ROS while producing Water and turning into Oxidized Glutathione which is later become glutathione by glutathione peroxidases and during                      the process NADPH metabolism is utilized.
Glutathione + ROS →  Water + Oxidized Glutathione
Oxidized Glutathione + Glutathione Peroxidases + NADPH → NADP+ + Glutathione
Improving Effects of Glutathione(GSH)
Then, we looked through the effects of glutathione on cell mass in order to observe the improving features of glutathione with the data obtained from Kim & Hahn (2013).                  In brief even 2mM difference make 30% increase in cell mass which is demonstrated below(Kim & Hahn, 2013).
Reaction Kinetics
Jez, J.M. & Cahoon, R.E (2004) stated that the km values of Glutathione Synthetase(GS) were 39 ± 5 μm for y-glutamyl cysteine and 1510 ± 88 μm for glycine meaning that GS has low affinity to glycine resulting in problematic production of glutathione and low reaction rate. In order to increase the reaction rate and glutathione formation we decided to enhance the gene expression rate by using a strong promoter and"

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitches: translational and transcriptional riboswitches. The fluoride riboswitch is a transcriptional riboswitch (Figure 2), which means that a terminator is formed when the riboswitch is transcribed that limits the processivity of the RNA polymerase transcribing downstream genes. When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
In our project, we will use the fluoride riboswitch from B. Cereus because it was characterized. In Figure 3 you can see a crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch. How can a negatively charged piece of RNA bind to a negatively charged fluoride ion? The fluoride riboswitch encapsulated three Mg2+ ions that can bind to the fluoride ion (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Crystal structure of a fluoride riboswitch
Aiming Ren, Kanagalaghatta R. Rajashankar, Dinshaw J. Patel “Fluoride ion encapsulation by Mg2+ ions and phosphates in a fluoride riboswitch” 2012 Nature 486, 85–89
In nature, the riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that help the organism deal with high levels of fluoride. These genes are often pumps that allow fluoride to be exported out of the cell (Figure 4). In E. coli the gene crcB encodes a fluoride efflux channel that removes excess fluoride from the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In E. coli when the crcB gene is genetically deleted (ΔcrcB), the phenotype is increased sensitivity to fluoride and concentrations above 500μM are lethal. In our experiments we needed to utilize the ΔcrcB E. coli strain so that fluoride could accumulate intracellularly.

In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are pulled together and the two residuals of β-lactamase will meet each other again to become an integrity part with enzymatic activity (in this case, ampicillin resistance).
(The upper figure illustrates the construction of the second set of membrane scaffold. We cloned the BLF1- and BLF2-scaffold genes into pCDFDuet-1 vector to obtain optimal expression.)
This activity can be detected by commercial β-lactamase testing strips, which are widely used strips in China initially designed to detect the residence of β-lactamase in drinking milk. One mechanism of these strips are based on immune colloidal gold and we chose it because of its high sensitivity, robustness and relatively low cost.
(The upper figure shows a β-lactamase testing strip based on the mechanism of immune colloidal gold. The testing strip has two lines which are control line (C-line) and testing line (T-line). When β-lactamase is detected in the solution, both C-line and T-line would appear as a red mark, indicating the existence of target protein.)
Results
Detect thrombin using membrane scaffold FA and FB
We expressed the first set of membrane scaffolds with split EGFP fragments FA and FB fused to the periplasmic end. Then we tested the function of our membrane scaffolds by adding two sets of aptamers with different linker length. The concentration of thrombin in the solution was adjusted to 0.2nM. 29-mer aptamer and 15-mer aptamer efficiently induced dimerization of membrane scaffolds (Figure C, D versus A) and led to green fluorescence emission under confocal microscopy.
(Fluorescence with or without aptamers. BL21 competent cells were co-transformed with FA, FB and protein E. When the OD-600 value reached 0.4, 0.4% was added to induce the expression of protein E. 2h later cells were harvested and washed two times with PBS. 5µL of bacteria were resuspended in 200 µL PBS, and a final concentration of 0.2nM thrombin was added to the solution. Different aptamers were also included in this point. The reaction system was incubated with shaking in room temperature for 30 min and then green fluorescence was viewed under confocal microscopy. Only very weak green fluorescence was visible when no aptamers were added to the reaction system (A). Biotinylated"
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," not enough DNA to be able to decode it after extracting it from a     bacterium. The next section explains more about the meta-data that     goes with the cipher text/DNA.
Translation to DNA is implemented in eightbit.js and dna.js .
Message format
Translating just the cipher text to DNA is not enough, we need    some more information in the sequence to be able to decode it after    extraction. We'll put this information in a header: a block of    DNA that precedes the cipher text DNA. The decoding machine will    first read the information in the header and use that to decode the    rest of the message.
Start & end
The first problem is that our sequence is inserted into other     DNA. When it is sequenced again there is also some DNA in front and    after the end of the message. We need a way to find out exactly    where our message starts.
To solve this, every message block always starts with the same    sequence: GACCAAGCCTGC. The decoding machine looks for    this sequence and then decodes the DNA that follows it. Of course,    it is possible that this sequence appears as part of non-message    related DNA, or it may be part of the message. The next pieces of    message information help with solving this. What the decoder does is    look for the start sequence and try to decode the rest, if that    fails it will look for the next occurrence of the start sequence and    decode that. If it reaches the end of the complete sequence without    successfully decoding a message it will come to the conclusion that    there is no intact message in the sequence.
Length
The next issue is that the decoder needs to know the length of     the message sequence. At the end of our sequence, after the     message, is a footer: GCACCCACCGAC. This helps verify     the sequence, but it suffers from the same problem as the start of     the header: it is possible that it occurs as part of the message     sequence. So it is possible that the end is detected too soon.     Therefore we also put the length of the message sequence in the     header. After the start sequence we reserve 8 base-pairs that     encode the length of the message: 8 bases encode 16 bits, which     means that the maximum length is \(2^{16} - 1 = 65535\)    base-pairs.
The decoder will look for the start sequence, then decode the     length and look foor the footer sequence after length number of base-pairs. In our example"

We used RFP, GFP, and CFP (which show up in red, green, and blue imaging channels, respectively) and our four organelles that could be easily distinguished: the nucleus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, and actin. The size of our MiCode set can by calculated using the function (2^x)^y where x represents the number of imaging channels while y represents the number of organelles to which the fluorophores are targeted. With three imaging channels and four organelles, we can create 4,096 unique MiCode combinations!
Our test MiCode set can accommodate up to 4,096 members!
Although a MiCode set of up to 4,096 unique combinations is plenty for our proof of concept experiments, many experimental libraries would require a set size close to the magnitude of 10^6. With a few augmentations we can easily expand the available MiCode set to and even past 10^6 unique combinations.
Micode set size can be expanded by increasing the 3 criteria.
States: A general binary system consists of genes expressing fluorescent proteins can either be on or off. Additionally, photosensitive fluorescent proteins that are activatable by UV light can be used as an extension into a ternary system in which the  states are: on, off , or photoactivatable (or PA for short).
Channels: We currently utilize  three channels: red, green and blue. It is possible to use other fluorescent proteins that are viewable under other imaging channels without overlap.
Organelles: We optimized the use of four organelles (actin, plasma membrane, nucleus and vacuolar membrane) for our project but additional organelles can be utilized.
The more generalized equation for calculating the possible set of MiCodes.
By simply adding one more organelle and one more fluorescent protein that can be visualized under an additional channel,
the available MiCode set size increases by 3 orders of magnitude!
When choosing promoters for our cassettes, we had to find promoters that would make each element of the MiCode visible under the microscope. Furthermore, the promoters would have to adjust for differences in protein abundances and consequently the relative brightness for each localization tag. A portion of our project was to decide on this optimum set of promoters.
Out of the 7000+ promoters in the yeast genome, we decided to experiment with 5 promoters: pTEF1, pTDH3, pRPL18B, pRNR2, and pREV1 - listed from strongest"
WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ins in plants recognize the effectors secreted by Pgt and trigger an hypersensitive immune response in the plant, causing localized cell death and preventing the spread infection. Different resistance proteins are naturally occurring in plants affected by Pgt and are encoded for by resistance genes. The immune response protects the plant by preventing the infection from spreading further. Often, this recognition occurs at a very low level of infection, so levels of cell death are low and do not significantly affect the plant. However, effectors can mutate, in some cases causing them to no longer be recognized by the plant. If the effector is not recognized, no immune response occurs and the pathogen can continue to infect the plant. In this case, the strain is considered virulent to the resistance gene the mutated effector corresponds to.
Pgt spores are able to be distinguished from other fungal spores by the presence of ribitol. When the spores germinate, they form infectious structures that contain hyphae, or branching filaments. Ribitol is a metabolic product in the hyphae and its production is unique to the hyphae of Pgt (i.e. there are no records of Pgt being produced in any other types of airborne fungus). Therefore, the presence of ribitol from airborne spore samples will in turn indicate the presence of Pgt.
Why is it a problem?
Pgt, while most notable for its impact on wheat, is a destructive force for many other cereal grains, including barley, rye, and triticale. These grains are a major staple in many diets worldwide, and shortages of these could cause a disruption in food availability and in many major industries. For most of the 20th century, Pgt was controlled around the world by the Sr31 resistance gene.
In 1999, the emergence of Ug99 or TTKSK caused the threat of Pgt to arise again. The new race of the fungus stopped producing AvrSr31, prohibiting an immune response to halt the progression of the disease. Since then, Ug99 has spread to areas East Africa and the Middle East, and new virulent strains have also developed. Two of the most damaging races include TKTTF in East Africa, Middle East, and Northwest Europe in addition to TTTTF in Italy. Pgt has also spread to the United States, but the races present are not as virulent and are better controlled by fungicides and chemicals. Climate change and global warming have exacerbated the effect of Pgt by increasing pathogen survival. The fungus is unable to survive winter climates characteristic of the locations it infects; however, milder"
UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the product of the perchlorate reductase. By measuring oxygen, we would be able to have some idea of the efficiency of our engineered biocatalyst. Although the introduction of the perchlorate reductase would dramatically affect the overall catalytic efficiency, this would provide us with a rough estimate of the production capacity of our microbes. In order to assess the viability of our process, we looked at the total amount of oxygen required by a single human to survive.
The average adult inhales/exhales around 7 to 8 L of air/min.1 If we take the higher value:
8L/(min)*1440  min/day = 11,520L
Given that the air is composed of ~20% oxygen and the air that is exhaled is roughly 15% oxygen, only about 5% of oxygen is consumed with each breath.6 Thus, the volume of oxygen consumed by the average adult is:
V = 11,520L * 20% = 576L
If we assume SATP, the relationship between the volume and molar amount is given by:
V = 24.8  L/mol
Then the amount of oxygen needed per day (nO2) is given by:
nO2=v/V = (576L)/(24.8L/mol) = 23.2mol of O2
Martian soil was found to have a perchlorate (ClO4-) content of 0.5 to 1%w/w.7 Perchlorate can be oxidized to produce oxygen using perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase,8 as shown by the equation below:
ClO4
-
yields 2O2 + Cl
-
Therefore, the mass of ClO4- required per day is given by:
mClO4 = nO2 * (1 mol ClO4)/(2 mol of O2)*MClO4
mClO4 = 23.2 mol of O2*(1 mol ClO4)/(2 mol of O2 )*99.45  g/mol = 1.15 kg of ClO4
Thus, the mass of Martian soil (msoil) required to supply one average adult with a day’s supply of oxygen, using the lowest possible concentration, is:
msoil = mClO4/CClO4 = (1.15 kg of ClO4)/(0.5%) = 230 kg of soil
This calculation is assuming 100% catalytic efficiency of conversion from perchlorate to oxygen"

Newcastle,2010,Team:Newcastle#E-Science_-_-_TEXT.html," choice had to be made between offering a SOAP or a RESTful web service. Time constraints and simplicity of implementation favoured a RESTful service. Resources are exposed as URLs and results are returned as plain text rather than in XML, as would be the case if it was a SOAP service (Pautasso and Leymann, 2008).
The web service accesses the relational database discussed in section 2.4 using Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC).
The web service can retrieve a simulatable model of a motif by firstly retrieving its rules.
Simulation
Simulation of models were provided by connecting the web service to an instance of JSim. JSim ( http://www.physiome.org/jsim/ ) is a software application, written in Java, for simulating quantitative numeric models. It is possible to run JSim as a service, a stand alone application or an applet.
The JSim server was installed on the same server as the Apache Tomcat web server.
Simulation is requested from the BioBrickIt service by passing the parameter simulation=true with the URL when a model of a motif is requested.
Taverna workflows
To create the workflows that utilised the web service, the decision was made to use Taverna Workbench . Taverna is an open source application for managing workflows. It can be used to integrate molecular biology tools and databases available on the Web. It is especially useful for web services (Hull et al., 2006). Taverna was chosen because of familiarity with the product, but also because time restrictions did not allow for the evaluation and comparison of other tools.

Motifs
We identified two motifs, a constitutive promoter motif and a coding sequence motif (see Figures 1 and 2)
Figure 1: The constitutive promoter motif.
Figure 2: The coding sequence motif.
The coding sequence motif illustrates how a modular approach can be beneficial to the design process. The constitutive promoter motif that is embedded in the coding sequence motif is shown with the red dotted line.
The motifs were identified using the Subtilin receiver model created by the Newcastle University iGEM team of 2008.

Consequently, aquatic organisms including fishes are subject to these pollutants. (Nahed S. Gad and Amal S. Saad 2008).
Excessive exposure to elements of this diverse group of chemicals may induce a variety of health effects depending on the particular chemical. It may cause severe damages to many organs and also genetic impairment.
Beyond being harmful to humans, phenols also appear to be toxic to aquatic animals. Chlorinated phenols are the most noxious to aquatic life ( more informations here ).

PCBs
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic organic compounds forming a family of 209 elements which derive from biphenyl and of chemical formula C12H(10-n)Cln. Every core can have up to 5 chlorin groups.   They are known to be the most persisting environmental contaminants in the biosphere. Due to their thermal resistance and chemical stability, they are commonly considered as indestructible. Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) are derivatives of PCBs and have also been identified as environmental contaminants.
Due to years of intensive use by industries, PCBs are found in large quantities in natural environment (air, water and soils).    Since the 80’s, their production has been banned because of their toxicologic properties causing cancers, reproductive impairment, neurodevelopmental anomalies, and immunologic deficiency.

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html," chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal. Compared with chemotaxis towards malate, both of 8F and McfR show stronger chemotaxis towards succinate.
Analysis
The tendency of the chemotaxis towards chemical gradient may be influenced by two factors: pH and phosphorylation state of McpS. The motor of flagella is energized by a H＋ (or Na＋ in some species) gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (Schmitt, 2003) , but the mechanism is not clear. Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flagellar and chemotaxis genes and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons to maintain internal pH homeostasis and to prepare the cell to survive future exposure to more extreme pH conditions (below pH 5 or above pH 9 which is higher or lower than the cytoplasmic pH 7.6) (Maurer, Yohannes, Bondurant, Radmacher, & Slonczewski, 2005) . The pH of attractants showed below (Fig.5) is at the range of pH 1.0 – 6.4. The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2.0 of succinate, which leads to weakest chemotaxis, for oxidative stress induces its protective responses more than chemotaixs genes expression; while the curves reach maximum at concentration of 0.01M because of the opposite reason.
Fig.5 The pH of the concentration gradients of malate and succinate. The pH of  malate is lower than succinate at high concentration (10-1 and 10-2 M), and is equal with succinate at lower concentration. Both of them remain pH 6.4 at low concentration(10-5, 10-7 and 0 M).
On the other hand, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is influenced by reversible McpS methylation and related proteins phosphorylation (Fig. 6). McpS, in response to chemoeffector stimuli, transfer the signals and make CheA autophosphorylated via the adapter protein CheW. Then phospho-CheA molecules serve as donors that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB. Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho"

The optimal temperature for plant growth is 25°C, with lower temperatures being allowable; higher temperatures can be very detrimental, particularly in the first two weeks of growth.
Growth conditions
With the purpose to obtain several perfects  A. thaliana, the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABCR) has led methods to cultivate and grow these plants inside and outside the laboratory, in medium and soil. These methods and required conditions can be checked in the protocol “Handling Arabidopsis plants and seeds”. The growth and develop of A. thaliana depends of several environmental conditions, besides to the genetic background; with the correct conditions,light, temperature and watering, plants produce flowers within 4-5 weeks and seeds can be harvested 8 to 10 weeks after planting.
Figure 4 Germination of A. thaliana.
With respect to the light, the optimum intensity is 120-150 umol/m2sec; higher intensities may produce death of the seedlings, while low light intensities may produce weak plants without enough chlorophyta. Besides, under photoperiods greater than 12 hours plants flower rapidly.
According to the temperature, 22-23°C ir the optimum condition, lower temperatures can be accepted but higher are impossible. The consequences with higher temperatures may result with the reduce number of the leaves, flowers and seeds while in lower temperatures growth is slow.
Other condition is the water required, the optimal humidity is the mild (50% to 60%). Lower humidity cause drying soil and higher humidity cause plant sterility.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

Measurement
It wouldn’t matter if our hardware was cheap, portable and easy to build if it didn’t actually work. We characterized it with LUDOX and fluorescein to ensure it wasn’t just making up the readings.
We used the interpreter to record the data from device. These readings were then exported and analysed to plot the graphs.
Optical density
Optical density measurements were taken using different concentrations of LUDOX. We made up a dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time. We used 6 dilutions. We used the same cuvette (washed with distilled water between readings) to avoid random error introduced by the differences between our cuvettes. We characterized our densitometer using Lee Filters’ - Fire (019) and Medium yellow (010) - and without a filter.
The readings for optical density are consistent with little variation between readings, except for LUDOX concentrations above 12.5µM. Above 12.5µM the readings began to decrease. We are unsure as to why this would happen, but this is clearly not caused by random error as it happened with all the filters.
Fluorescence
For the fluorometer function of our device, we used fluorescein to take measurements. We made up the same dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time but with fluorescein instead of LUDOX. We characterized our fluorometer using LEE Filters’ Twickenham Green (736) and without a filter.
The results are consistent and demonstrate the linearity of our fluorometer. The pipetting error in the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and"

Prior to the 2017 Synthetic Biology Conference, we had a short meet up with the SECA_NZ and Melbourne teams to talk about the progress of our projects, presentations and wiki. We then met up properly with the Melbourne, SECA_NZ & Macquarie teams during the 2017 Synthetic Biology Australasia conference in Kirribilli, and presented our projects together during the iGEM session of the conference. The two days of the conference were capped off with social drinks and an impromptu trip to Luna Park!
Auckland University
Very early on in our project, we talked with the SECA_NZ team from Auckland University over Skype about our team organisation and the scheduling of our final exams around the Giant Jamboree. We were able to help each other out by discussing our teams' situations and proposing ideas that would work for each of our teams. We also reached out to the SECA NZ team for help with editing the fonts on our wiki. This lovely font that you see on our page is all thanks to them!

This year the Cologne-Dusseldorf team expanded their postcard exchange internationally, and we were excited to take part! The aim of this campaign was to educate the wider community about synthetic biology by designing a postcard with an image relevant to synthetic biology on the front, and information about synthetic biology on the back.
We designed a postcard featuring Kylie the Koala to inform the public about our project and how synthetic biology can be used help make therapeutics like insulin more accessible and affordable. We exchanged our postcards with the Cologne-Dusseldorf team and the 27 other teams who were involved, then distributed them throughout the university. Through this collaboration, we hope to get people from all over the world interested in synthetic biology and iGEM!

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Super Curriculum
From our crowd appeal at the Exploratium, we were encouraged to expand our message. We have developed and are now freely distributing a synthetic biology curriculum.
With this curriculum, we wish to teach middle school (and high school) aged students about genetics, synthetic biology, and genetic engineering through the frame of superheroes. This twist to such a broad and intricate field will hopefully introduce students to synthetic biology as well as excite a new generation of researchers.

We helped the Nevada iGEM team set up their yeast-based project by sending them yeast strains (W303 and S288C backgrounds) and shuttle vectors for cloning in both E. coli and yeast. We also helped them troubleshoot expression issues they had in their yeast strains, and as a solution, we provided them a construct we generated with the promoter pTEF1 (BBa_K319003, our characterized and sequence-verified version) driving GFP expression.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Landmine_-_-_TEXT.html,". We used a steady state assumption to simplify this relationship, which means that we assumed that the concentration of active promoters does not change in time, i.e \(\frac{d}{dt} [P_{A}] = \ 0\). This assumption can be justified by examining the experimental data in figure 4, from which it can be clearly seen that after a certain amount of time, the reporter protein level reaches a constant value.
Figure 4: Induction of yqjF and ybiJ by 2,4-DNT; Time course of luminescence signal development following exposure to 156 mg/L 2,4-DNT. Figure adapted from [1].
This yields the following:  $$  [P_{A}] = \ \frac{k_{on}}{k_{off}}[P_{R}][DNT] = \ \frac{1}{K_{d}}[P_{R}][DNT] \tag{8} $$  Here we introduced the dissociation constant \(K_{d} = \ \frac{k_{on}}{k_{off}}\). The next assumption we make is that the total amount of promoter (\([P_{T}\)) is constant. This makes sense, since an active promoter can become a repressed promoter and vice versa, but it is not possible to make new promoters or let promoters vanish. We ignore and therefore neglect the fact that during cell replication, the promoter level will rise due to DNA replication. However, we assume that this is a minor contribution. This assumption yields the following:   $$  [P_{T}] = \ [P_{A}] + \ [P_{R}] \ \rightarrow \ [P_{R}] = \ [P_{T}] - \ [P_{A}]  \tag{9} $$  Combining equations (8) and (9), we obtain:  $$  [P_{A}] = \ \frac{1}{K_{d}}([P_{T}] - \ [P_{A}])[DNT]  \tag{10} $$  This can be rewritten to the following form:   $$  \frac{[P_{A}]}{[P_{T}]} = \ \frac{[DNT]}{K_{D} + \ [DNT]} \tag{11} $$  Equation (11) thus gives us the number of active promoters as a fraction of the total amount of promoters.
The change of concentration of reporter protein ([R]) is given by the following ODE:   $$  \"

For emitting light successfully in this pathway, all of the materials are necessary to be worked well. Contrast to other accomplishment, however, our team focus on the different attribute in this pathway. What we pay attention is the fatty acid reductase pathway to get alkane, not the luciferase. According to the left side of the [figure1], we can find a fatty acid reductase pathway, which contains luxCDE. It can change fatty acid(RCOOH) to aldehyde(RCHO).

Retrieve MG1655-biofilm growth plate (for eventual degradation) from benchtop, take OD600 reading to make sure every well has had cells in them, then decant and wash planktonic cells away. The plate is then ready to be incubated with supernatants.
Retrieve P. putida-biofilm growth plate (for eventual degradation) from 30 degC, take OD600 reading to make sure every well has had cells in them, then decant and wash planktonic cells away. The plate is then ready to be incubated with supernatants (make sure antibiotic free supernatants - the ones in cold room made up on Friday are antibiotic free).
Set up again biofilm viability plates using cultures of our constructed E. coli. Can potentially set up two plates, both of which left on bench (~25degC incubation). (Raffy, is biofilm growth viable?)
Set up biofilm inhibitory plates by culturing P. putida in supernatants of our constructed E. coli, as well as non-constructed E. coli as controls.

However, it should be noted that the orange curves has the same growth conditions as the red, but shows a lot less growth of B. subtilis (Fig. 15). The reason for this can be that the S. elongatus showed less grow after induction compared to the cells from the red curve, this also means that there is less cells to secrete sucrose.

Question: Is it possible to fuse Lactate Polymerizing Enzyme (LPE) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)?
Experiment: The experimental set-up can be seen at our protocol section . Firstly, both LPE and GFP were amplified using PCR. The DNA template from IDT was mixed with the prepared MasterMix, and the PCR was started at the following conditions for LPE: 95°C for 3', 95°C for 30’’, 60°C for 30’’, 70°C for 1’ and 70°C for 10’, with the three middle step repeated 35 cycles. For GFP the PCR program used was 95°C for 3’, 95°C for 30’’, 55°C for 30’’, 70°C for 30’’ and 70°C for 10’, with the three middle step repeated 35 cycles. Both electrophoresis lasted for 1 hour at 115 volt. After amplification the integrity of the amplified DNA was checked on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA was purified using PCR Purification kit from QIAGEN according to the manufacturer's protocol. After purification the DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop. To fuse the two genes a fusion PCR was carried out. The purified gene products was used in a PCR along side with a prepared MasterMix containing GC buffer, see protocol section for the exact composition of the MasterMix. The PCR program for fusing and amplifying the gene construct was a follows 95°C for 3’, 95°C for 45’, 65°C for 45’, 70°C for 2’ and 70°C for 10’. After amplification the PCR product was loaded on a gel for electrophoresis. The conditions for the electrophoresis was 1 hour at 115 volt.
Result: At first, the two genes LPE and GFP should be amplified to get the right overhangs. This is so, because the genes was ordered"

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Darmstadt_-_-_TEXT.html," We then came to a joint conclusion.
Concluding discussion with iGEM Team Darmstadt
While they focussed on legal aspects, especially the detailed German laws concerning the creation of a lab at home, we layed our focus on infrastructural, educational and social aspects. The iGEM Team Darmstadt found out that the very strict laws in Germany make the establishment of a biohackerspace rather difficult. This matches the disparity in governmental support for the different Community Labs we have met. While the German Technik Garage is subjected to a lot of rules and restrictions, the Dutch Waag Society is even promoted by the government to teach about and enable DIY Biology at home.
Having a realistic risk assessment, most of the public concerns can be resolved easily. Especially the putative threat of bioterrorism is an emotional fear rather than a rational one. On the contrary, a spreading of Community Labs promotes “open science” and possesses an inherent beneficial potential. One of the great benefits would be to give the people the chance to make chemical and biological tests of water quality, food, medicine etc. This would largely increase the consumer protection. In addition, Community Labs are often very ambitious in their efforts to educate the public. They also contribute to society on other levels e.g. driving forward exeptional aspects as BioArt.
To conclude, we are convinced, that a further growing European Community Lab scene will have benefits for society and science. However, to promote the establishments of more Community Labs in Europe, we need to review the strict restrictions and increase connectivity through cross-linking networks like Medlife.

The LPS-binding site is 32 to 50 amino acids in length and forms an amphipathic  loop which binds to the lipid A portion of LPS (11, 15, 18). We therefore  studied whether a molecule such as ENP, which binds to lipid A and has been  shown to confer protection against the deleterious effect of LPS in vivo, could  block one or more of the sequential LPS-induced events leading to increased EC  monolayer permeability. In this work, we have studied whether ENP protects  against LPS-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, actin reorganization, and  loss of endothelial barrier function. the importance of the  amphipathic loop structure can be investigated by introducingappropriate  disulfide bonds to create a cyclic conformation. However, previous  investigations with cysteine- and non-cysteine- containing peptides derived from  TALF, a protein highly           homologous  with LALF, showed little difference in LPS binding activity (23).

Considering that Limulus  anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (LALF) reduces the growth of gram negative  bacteria and terminates them; we determine that it can be used as a surface  protector. In our Project, we plan to design LALF protein producing system in a  specific bacteria that will not be harmed by this bactericide itself. To do  this, we needed a bacteria type that has no lip-A structure which is bound by  LALF. Thus, we decided to use Bacillus subtilis colonies which are the most  prefered gram positive bacteria in iGEM. In conclusion, our  “"

USP-EEL Brazil iGEM Team
In the frames of collaboration with USP-EEL-Brazil iGEM Team , we created a homology model for their expressed protein laccase, which functions to degrade water contaminating estrogens. We found that the homologous protein from the organism Myceliophthora thermophila has a higher affinity binding to 17A-ethinylestradiol than to estrone. Using the protein-ligand docking software, we hypothesized the explanations for the phenomenon in the hydrogen bond in the structure of laccase enzyme, which facilitates the redox reaction in the active site for 17A-ethinylestradiol better than for estrone. Thus, the model showed the affinity of the homologous to laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus protein to two similar ligands and it explained the reasons of difference between the interactions.
Duesseldorf iGEM Team
The collaboration with Duesseldorf iGEM Team has also given us interesting perspectives on our project and the transformation protocols of Synechococcus elongatus. Both of our teams worked with the cyanobacterial organisms, so through the Skype meeting we presented the ideas of our projects and could exchange valuable troubleshooting ideas. The team of Duesseldorf agreed to look at our protocol of transformation and suggested antibiotic gradient plates, which we consequently tried to use. They have also given us a piece of advice on the sponsorship attraction.
Stony Brook iGEM team
Stony Brook iGEM Team was one of the teams, who worked with the same strain of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Collaboration with this team was very helpful for our team since the team shared their protocol of transforming cyanobacteria. At that moment, we troubleshooted the transformation protocol, media plate preparation protocols and antibiotic resistance for obtaining separate single colonies of transformed Synechococcus elongatus. The protocol of Stony Brook Team appeared to be successful and gave us first separate colonies which we could further use for the hydrogen sulfide assay. We, in turn, suggested some solutions for"

(6) The Regulation of the RFP
The ultimate purpose is to reveal the red color only under the condition that the time is up or the bacteria invasion is higher than standard value.
First, the promoter in this circuit is a double-regulated promoter, and it can only be activated when the following requirements are fulfilled: (1) The lack of the CIIP22 protein and (2) The linkage to the AHL-LuxR complex.  Hence, we can regulate the device at the appropriate timing. After the function of the memory system is shut down and the AHL-LuxR complex accumulation caused by the cease of tetR translation, the promoter (BBa_K145015) starts to work and produce the RFP.
(7) Counter
The counter is designed to work in the lactose-accession stage only. We insert a part of sequence which encodes the LuxR protein downstream the constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23106 ). Therefore the system is full of LuxR on the go. Besides, the promoter in the Lux operon ( BBa_K145150 ) can only work in the lactose-accession stage under the regulation of the LacI-repressive promoter. We can use both characteristics to prompt the work of the signal output and the cell’s death.

The two proteins are mutually exclusive; if one is being expressed, then the other cannot be expressed, because they share a promoter region. Expression of CRO triggers the events that lead to replication and lysis. Expression of CI induces and maintains lysogeny. Our plan is clone the CI protein into E.Coli following the Qrr4 protein and the CRO protein following HapR.
Kp April 1st  We started today with each group presenting their research and game plan for the coming weeks/months. It seems like we all know, or at least have a direction, to our next plan of action. Our E. coli turned out well and we were able to single out a colony in order to prepare overnight. After further research, it is clear that we will not be able to use T phages in our E. coli as a means to destroy cholera biofilm. We have all done more research on lambda, and it appears to be our best lysogenic phage choice. It is well studied and the mechanism for turning on the lytic cycle is very well understood.

Not this Friday, but next Friday, we will have our Final Presentations. They will be done by sub-group; my sub-group is the cholera-phage approach. As part of the project, I need to attend a science seminar. Tomorrow I’ll attend the seminar by John Roth on something to do with molecular biology, then write a one-paragraph summary of HOW the presentation was done, the showsmanship of the presentation. On the day of our presentation we need to explain the background of what we have done, then go into our methods and results, then give our conclusions.  Today we followed the mini-prep/Alkaline lysis procedure to purify plasmids from our overnight samples. We followed the step-by step protocol given in the kit we used. We chose to use 1 mL of our E.Coli overnight solution in our samples ... and at the end, our plasmid concentrations were low (24 ng/microL and 16ng/microL, respectively). We used the spectrophotometer in Dr. Grose’s lab to determine the concentrations of our plasmids. So, in the future, we ought to a) include Dr. Grose as we follow the protocol to ensure we are doing things correctly, and b) probably"

5.9 T7 Phage Selection Method Test #2
I) Purpose
Test the size of plaques formed from x6 and x8 top agar
To practice working with thick top agar
II) Expected outcome
As top agar increase in concentration, the number of plaques/plate should decrease and individual plaques should become smaller.
III) Reagent record
T7 + phage: -7 dilution from 5.8, specifically, -7 dilution from stock 5.6; E coli BL21; Agar: ×2 prepared by Jordan in 500mL glass bottle; LB: prepared by us on 4.3; overnight bacteria culture: set up on Wednesday at 4:00pm using 4.6 streak; ×8 top agar stock: prepared by us on 4.3
IV) Actual procedures / observations
i)  Warmed up the plates and pipettes by placing them in the 37 C incubator for 3 hours
ii) Ten test tubes were labeled control, ×6, ×6, x6, x6, x8, x8 ×8, ×8, x8, and ×8. To each of the test tubes, 0.5mL of E coli overnight liquid culture was added.
iii) To each test tube 20 μL of -7 phage solution was added. This mixture of E coli and phage was left sitting for 20 minutes before proceeding.
iv)   In a separate set of test tubes, top agar was diluted to give ×6, and ×8 concentration.

08/21 : DIY in synthetic biology
What about DIY in synthetic biology?
We started the debate by watching the diybio video headlined “DIYbio in 4 minutes”, a presentation by Andy Mac Cowell, an active diyist from the DIY bio Boston group.
The DIYbio Community - Presented at Ignite Boston 5 (2009) from mac cowell on Vimeo .
First, I have to make a notification about this post. That talk leads us to something a bit discussed, like a controversy. My own opinion about DIY and amateurs in science is not the point here, even if my graduated work is mostly about that question. Here, I just try to transcribe what I presume understandable in the team's position. I don't share the team's mind but that is not the point.
I wanted to know more about the reception of DIY practices in biology for the team because of several question. The iGEM concourse seems to be a way to experiment, to test some new way to make science : young students spend their summer time on a own-build project, the teams are undergraduated, the project are often innovative or stimulant. The DIY in biology claim that kind of alternative way to make science as one of their goals. So, for the team, regarding the iGEM science making experimentation, what about a daily experimentation? We also can notice that, even if they aren't totally “admit” in the iGEM competition (named “non-competition teams"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," making the sandwich on the transfer apparatus.  From bottom to top (red to black electrode), the loading order was as follows:
2 sheets of blotting paper
Nitrocellulose membrane
Gel
2 sheets of blotting paper
Transfer was run at 20 V for 1 hour.
Note!  The side containing the protein is face up when the notch in the membrane is situated on the top right hand corner.  However, due to troubles with the gel, the lanes are now in the opposite order of loading.  So, with the protein right side up, the lanes go: marker, 100 uM, 10 uM, 0 uM, neg con, etc.  Also, we forgot to roll bubbles out from the sandwich with the pipette fragment before transferring (my bad!)  Hopefully this doesn't impact anything.  One last note on the transfer: the current cap was 400 mA, and when we started the transfer, it initially began at 17 V and 400 mA.  Over a few minutes, the voltage increased to 20 V and the current began to decrease, hitting 110 mA after a half hour of gradual decay, which is where we expected the current to be.
The transfer seemed to have worked, transferring the marker bands from the gel onto the membrane.
Blocking:
Membrane was blocked at 4 degrees overnight.
Tomorrow we will proceed with primary and secondary antibody staining and band visualization.
Library ligation optimization
Dan suggests that we optimize the vector:insert ratio for our library assembly.  We will try using the following insert ratios (assuming a vector unit of 1): 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 16.  Unfortunately, today we did not have enough cut CB bottom plasmid to immediately begin the ligation and transformation, so we attempted to cut more CB bottom.  After performing a cut with Bsa-HF using the previous protocol, we performed a PCR purification on the product, only to find that there were only 3.4 ng/ul of cut plasmid present.  This is not enough to perform the ligation, and so we will have to try the CB bottom plasmid cut again tomorrow morning when the cultures have grown enough.  We can then do a ligation and transformation tomorrow and count colonies on Friday.
As stated in the earlier section, we should probably plate 100 ul of transformed bacteria to standardize everything and to keep colony counting fairly manageable.

Type of venom Venom refers to varieties of toxins produced by certain types of animals. One of the most common venoms are produced by snakes where 15% of 3,000 species of snakes are found poisonous. Snake venom consists of proteins, enzymes, substances with a cytotoxins, neurotoxins and coagulants
Most snake envenomings and fatalities are found in South Asia, South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with the high fatality rate of 125,000 deaths per annual. Among these India is reported the most cuased by big 4 including Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. Indian cobra is found the most famous and make the highest fatality rate (43%) in India and Southeast asia.
Indian cobra venom contains a potent post-synaptic neurotoxin which acts on the synaptic gaps of the nerves, thereby paralyzing muscles, and in severe bites leading to acute respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. The components of venom include lysis enzymes such as hyaluronidase which increase the spread of the venom. Its toxicity is found one of the highest based on LD50 value in mice. Symptoms of cobra envenomation can begin from 15 minutes to two hours after the bite, and can be fatal in less than an hour.
Despite the advance in emergency therapy, antivenom is often only the effective treatment. In treatment antivenom is"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA). Similar to Kelly Roberge's comment, mature fine tailings can be dried and solidified, but in turn it liberates water from the clay and sand. This water cannot be used for any industrial purposes until it is detoxified. Ideally, this water can be detoxified sufficiently to be returned as tailings pond surface water and become reusable in the bitumen extraction process.
In order to deploy our biosensor and bioreactor system, it was suggested that we look into various regulatory boards within Alberta such as Alberta Environment and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) to attempt to obtain permits to begin attempting pilot programs. Scale up of the bioreactor is also a major consideration in order for us to push it off the bench and into the field.
The full interview can be found below.
Zvonko Burkus from Alberta Environment Discusses the Project in Detail
Zvonko is a process water and policy specialist for Alberta Environment. Zvonko was happy to discuss with us at length about this project. Notably, there were concerns about the use of both FRED and OSCAR in active tailings ponds, since naphthenic acids are known surfactants which help with bitumen detachment from the sand particles. FRED was seen as something which could be more useful in a live-monitoring system, since currently there are no such systems for organic compounds, which is a possible direction for us.
We were warned that the oil industry is rather traditional, but as we have seen from our OSLI dialogue , it appears that more companies are beginning to see the potential benefit of biology in solving various issues with the oil sands.
Some interesting points for us to explore further included examining whether or not the intermediates of our metabolic pathways were more or less toxic than the starting compounds, and expanding our scope to target other compounds such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, chlorides, composite tailings, polyphenols, and hydrogen sulfide.

Finally iGEM kick off week arrived! I finished the BioBasics lectures with the entire team (both BU and Wellesley members were present). Following Orit's suggestion, I had the students break into teams and explain figures from a paper to the entire team to ensure students really did understand the concepts and results discussed in the paper.
Training for the wet team continued on Tuesday and Wednesday. During lab meeting on Wednesday, tasks were assigned to groups for building the first constructs the team will need to make (promoter-rbs-xFP-terminator).
These tasks included the following:
1. Choosing promoters, ribosomal binding sites and fluorescent proteins to build 4-part transcriptional units to generate fluorescence

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Wetlab#Part Design#Components#Promoters_-_-_TEXT.html," Filenko et al. [3] reported 20 repressed genes and 24 activated genes.
The promoter that was used in conjunction with NsrR is from the yeaR-yoaG operon, PyeaR. This was identiﬁed by Filenko as a gene that is repressed by NsrR, though they also predicted that it was co-regulated by an oxygen responsive transcription factor Fnr. It was shown by Lin et al. [5] that its transcription is actually independent of the Fnr factor. This is important because the Fnr transcription factor is associated with E. coli’s anaerobic metabolism, meaning that the metabolic state of the E. coli would have to be controlled if it were to act as a sensor. Using the PyeaR promoter avoids this restriction.

Conduct plating under the filter hood. Add antibiotic to molten agar whilst in bottle, such that the antibiotic (Chl or Amp) is diluted by 1000 times. Then gently mix. Pour just enough agar to cover the surface of the petri dishes. Plates should take ~30mins to set.
Then add volume of E. coli according to protocol, using beads to spread across petri dish.
Day 9
Growth and Culture of Bacteria
Refer to section 1.6 of the protocol guide.
Only one overnight culture each set up for iGEM distros (20K, 22A, 22K, 21J) as it can be rightly assumed that plasmids supplied by iGEM HQ are high purity.
Day 10
Plasmid for PCR Products
Digest aliquots of each of the samples, and run on gel. (Refer to protocol in section 1.2 )
From gel, determine the degree of success of these samples.

Finally, we helped them attach a string to the microcentrifuge tubes and allowed them to take their extracted strawberry DNA home as a necklace or bracelet. They were ecstatic with the activity and asked us many questions regarding DNA and our project. With the second group of students, we gave the same presentation, but the students took part in the E. coli buddies activity, allowing them to interactively learn what synthetic biologists do. We feel that it is important for an interest in science and sense of curiosity in children to be fostered at a young, and by reaching out to such a young group of students, we were able to introduce the basics of biology to them in a fun and engaging way. By performing strawberry DNA extraction with the kids and allowing them to store and keep the extracted DNA in a creative way, the basic knowledge about the origin or appearance of extracted DNA will be firmly grasped. Furthermore, we learned that young students love asking insightful questions during presentations, and we made sure to accommodate with a longer Q&A session in future presentations.
LaValle Movie Night
Previous Next
To increase awareness of synthetic biology, we held a booth at the LaValle Movie Night, where parents and children from Suffolk County came to our University's football field to watch the animated movie Sing. To engage the children before the movie, we gave out pompoms and explained the basic principles of biology and what molecular biology means. For older audiences, we handed out flyers explaining our project and spoke with parents and members of the community about what synthetic biology entails. Parents shared their personal concerns with GMO’s and synthetic biology in many aspects of day to day life. We were able to ease their worries by explaining the benefits and applications of synthetic biology. Young children were also able to grasp the advantage of our project in helping the environment. We approached reaching the general community by attending this event and speaking with parents and children. Our pom-pom activity and flyers were both informational as well as engaging. We learned that the best way to educate young children is with hands-on activities and props. Nonetheless, many were very interested to see what we were doing and teaching! This was a fun event for the community and for the iGEM team as well.
