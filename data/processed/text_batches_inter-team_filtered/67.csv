Зная об этой проблеме, мы как команда iGEM UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB задумались о возможности усовершенствования стратегии снижения уровня углекислого газа и одновременного синтеза ряда биологических веществ, представляющих экономический или научный интерес. Для реализации нашего проекта мы определили два этапа. Первый этап предполагает две трансформации зеленой микроводоросли Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: сначала введение фермента цианобактерий Fructose-1,6 / Sedoheptulose-1,7- biphosphatase с целью усовершенствования цикла Кальвина (одного из наиболее важных этапов процесса фотосинтеза), а затем изучение и параметризация индуцируемого промотора (METE), который предполагается использовать, с помощью гена RFP. Второй этап включает в себя введение необходимых генов с целью построения метаболического пути для производства биологических веществ, но уже с пониманием того, как работает промотор METE.
С другой стороны, мы попытались понять потребности людей, проживающих в загрязненной местности, и хотим вместе с ними разработать стратегию внедрения биореактора и определить, какие биоматериалы будут наиболее пригодными и полезными для населения. В частности, комму"

WITS-South_Africa,2010,Team:WITS-South Africa#machine2 design_-_-_TEXT.html," experimental procedure a combination will be chosen so as to introduce an effective delay in repression. This delay is crucial so as to allow sufficient transcription of both the PlcR-PapR fusion peptide as well as the E. chromi pigment as this ensures adequate propagation of the signal throughout the colony as well as sufficient E. chromi being produced to ensure a distinctly visible report. The phage activator will be sourced from the Registry of Standard Parts.
mCherry
Akin to the function of Venus in cassette 1, mCherry - a monomeric fluorescent protein - will be used in assaying the degree of transcription induced in colony 2 by incident PlcR-PapR quorum molecules.  In addition to the visual report that will be produced as the response signal that propagates throughout the colony, mCherry will aid in the quantification of the mean fluorescent response of the colony. mCherry will be sourced from the Registry of Standard Parts.
Terminator
As described above, the terminator ends transcription. By placing a terminator in the middle of cassette 2, it introduces a time delay between the activation of the initial region of cassette 2 and the feedback component, SpoOA. The terminator DNA will be sourced from the Registry of Standard Parts.
PO Phage Promoter
Forming the receptor of the cognate activator-promoter pair of phage sensitivity tuners, the PO promoter will initiate transcription when the phage activator binds the promoter. Since the genes downstream of the promoter will only be transcribed after the phage activator is transcribed, translated and folded, a time delay is inserted due to this unavoidable metabolic process. The PO promoter will be sourced from the Registry of Standard Parts.
E. chromi
So as to produce a chromogenic indication of the presence of HPV (or a proxy thereof), the E. chromi pigment will be used. The E. chromi biobrick is a composite biobrick comprised of sequential enzymes that process a substrate until a visible dye is produced. The combination of four sequential enzymes converts the substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate (which is colourless) to the pigment beta-carotine via several intermediates.  The E. chromi biobrick will be sourced from the Registry of Standard Parts.
SpoOA
So as to provide a suitable negative-feedback loop to the ‘machine’, SpoOA is a protein that binds to the regions adjacent to the PlcR box in the PlcR-PapR promoter. Once produced, the repression of SpoOA will negate the production of both mCherry as well"

Nonetheless,  we believe the method should still be tested in the future.
As time went by, we met some problems in the cloning and they helped us to inspect parts in detail and try to solve the problems. As a result, we changed the way of collaboration. Based on their advice, we transformed the plasmids of ER-INP and monobody into E. coli successfully(Figure.1.5-1) and we very much appreciated their help.

The sigma 70-pdc/adh generator (k558001) was assembled using classic cloning techniques. It was then transformed into two E. coli competent cell lines, NEB 10-Beta (New England BioLabs) and T7 Express Iq (New England BioLabs). Colonies were screened through restriction digest analysis, DNA sequencing and tested for enzymatic activity.
Pyruvate Decarboxylase Activity
Pyruvate decarboxylase activity was assayed using aldehyde indicator plates (Ingram et. al. 1987) to test for a Schiff Base reaction to detect the presence of acetaldehyde, a substrate for ethanol production. The figure below shows pink colonies after an overnight incubation on Schiff base plates. The streaked colony on the top of the plate is a negative control cell line (white-light pink). The streaked colony on the right are a typical example (pink color) of sigma 70-pdc/adh generator in the NEB 10-Beta cells. The cells on the left (dark pink) and represent what is typically seen for the sigma 70-pdc/adh generator expressed in T7 Express Iq cell lines. From the results shown here and other experiments, we  concluded that the NEB T7 Express Iq cells produced higher levels of the acetaldehyde intermediate.
Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity
Ethanol production was tested using EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems). The figure below shows percent ethanol production in T7 Express Iq cells (NEB) in 2% versus 10% glucose medium over 24 and 48 hours. The sample grown in 2% Glucose over 24 hours yielded 0.02% ethanol, and the sample grown in 10% Glucose over 48 hours yielded 0.018% ethanol. From the results shown here, and other experiments, we have concluded that our modified E. coli is in fact producing ethanol.  Furthermore, we have also concluded that increasing amounts of glucose does not lead to higher ethanol production. It is possible that these lines are only producing low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase and we are seeing a buildup of acetaldehyde in these same lines. It may be necessary to re-evaluate the original operon and re-engineer it to improve the adh gene thereby increasing production of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Stability Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"osome binding sites (RBS), would cause the system to be unstable. Therefore, we performed stability analysis to assess the conditions and constraints that the system gives three stable states.
Here we focus on examining the equilibrium points, at which all species-of-interest i.e. repressor proteins reach equilibrium and that their concentrations do not change with time (i.e. $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dz}{dt}=0$). Then, we can determine whether the equilibrium points are stable or unstable. A stable point is defined as: given a slight perturbation to an equilibrium point, the system automatically returns to the original point subsequently; while an unstable point is an equilibrium point where the system changes dramatically upon any perturbation. Moreover, parameters, such as relative efficiency of the promoter and binding affinity of the repressors to DNA, are known to have great influence on the stability of the equilibrium points. Therefore, in order to achieve a stable system, it is crucial to investigate the suitable numerical range of the parameters and accordingly, this will provide insights on the selection of proper combinations of parts in the circuits.
(I) Poincare-Perron Theorem
Poincare-Perron Theorem was employed for the stability analysis.
For the ODE system
Suppose $\overrightarrow{p_e}$ denotes an equilibrium concentration of the repressor proteins. Then $\overrightarrow{p_e}$ is stable or unstable as follows:
If the eigenvalues of $\overrightarrow{f'}$($\overrightarrow{p_e}$) all have negative real part, then $\overrightarrow{y_e}$ is asymptoticallystable;
If any of the eigenvalues of $\overrightarrow{f'}$($\overrightarrow{p_e}$) has positive real part, then $\overrightarrow{y_e}$ is unstable.
In order to obtain the equilibrium concentrations of the three repressor proteins, we have to solve $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dz}{dt}=0$, such that:
Where $x_s$, $y_s$ and $z_s$ denote the equilibrium concentration of the repressor proteins. However, solving a nonlinear ODE system analytically is hard and the solution is expected to be too lengthy and complex. We therefore employed piecewise-linear functions (Jutta,Gebert & Nicole,Radde & Gerhard-Wilhelm,Weber, 2007; Polynikis, Hogan, & Di Bernardo, 2009) to approximate the Hill’s term in the equation as follow:

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP production via Hok-Sok is capable of decreasing the evolutionary pressure against the removal on non-essential genes. This effect will be further studied in later experiments, where the distance between the hok-sok cassette and a gene of interest is lengthened. Overall, we suggest use of the Hok-Sok system as an effective method for internal plasmid maintenance without the use of antibiotics.
Considerations
PCR of Hok-Sok Construct
Amplification of the Hok-Sok cassette is difficult due to the high inherent secondary structure in the construct. Hok ssDNA is capable of naturally folding into a stable secondary structure, resulting in early terminations and other side products. We recommend that a reaction buffer suitable for difficult templates be used, such as Phusion GC buffer + added DMSO.
Measuring OD of RFP Cultures
Due to the close proximity of the emission wavelength of RFP (584 nm) and the classical absorbance wavelength for measuring cell density (600 nm), it is difficult to accurately determine the cell density of cultures that are expressing RFP. Given more time to calibrate our testing measurements, we would either have used an alternative wavelength for measuring OD (>600 nm), used a hemocytometer as an alternate counting method, or switched to GFP as an alternative fluorescent marker whose emission wavelength differs from 600 nm by a greater amount.
Moving Forward
In the future there is great potential to use the Hok-Sok system both in vitro and in vivo. In the laboratory, using plasmids which contain the Hok-Sok cassette along with some sort of positive selection marker, such as a fluorescent protein, instead of an antibiotic resistance gene would permit for positive selection of desired colonies without the use of antibiotics.
Furthermore, the Hok-Sok system could have a transformative role outside the lab. Synthetic biology projects often rely upon genetically modified bacteria which are designed for release into the soil, water sources, and ingestion by animals. Our 2014 project, for example, involved E. coli that could one day detect an oyster pathogen, and the University of Toulouse 2014 iGEM team was interested in designing bacteria capable of defending trees against fungal attack. If these bacteria carried antibiotic resistance genes, there would be ample concern about other bacteria acquiring this resistance through horizontal gene transfer. However, if the Hok-Sok system was used to maintain plasmids, it would reduce concern over increasing the number of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains.
In addition, there is potential to take advantage of the Hok-Sok cassette as a method of post-transcriptional control over a variety of genes. As hok is indirectly"

This measurement device for alkane output sounded almost as feasible as the method to measure sucrose. Ultimately, Dr. Balazsi’s advice would come to greatly influence our decision between our choice for alkanes or sucrose.   
April 16: Correspondence with Neil Warner (Director of Transportation and Parking, Stony Brook University)
In addition to reaching out to experts in synthetic biology, we wanted to understand how administrators in transportation would view our project. We reached out to Neil Warner, the director of transportation and parking at Stony Brook University, in order to get his input. He responded quickly to us and admired our research in producing alternative fuels. He explained the effect these alternative fuels have on the regenerative exhaust systems, and the fuel pumps that impact whether people would actually adopt such a system. He also explained that NY State Agencies are exempt from the state sales tax on highway fuel. Therefore, the cost of fuel for such agencies is equal to the price of diesel at the pumps. For ethanol-based biofuel to be adopted, it must be able to compete with that price and have a decent fuel economy. Fuel economy is directly related to the energy that fuels produce from combustion, and so our ethanol-based biofuel needs to have a fair cetane rating. Furthermore, Mr. Warner suggested that we reach out to Caterpillar and other diesel engine companies to learn more about the impacts of ethanol on exhaust systems and fuel pumps. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response from them.  
May 3: Meeting with Dr. Brian Baynes (Former CEO, Joule Unlimited)
Dr. Brian Baynes discussed with our team the experimental strategies as well as the challenges of using cyanobacteria to produce alkanes. He recalled that Joule’s production of alkanes was successful but only at a small scale; large scale production required extraction and distillation to get a desired purity. In addition, the photosynthetic efficiencies of their cyanobacteria reached a maximum of only 10%, and the methods they utilized to enhance efficiency were very expensive. In essence, Dr. Baynes believed that such a venture would not be economically feasible. Our conversation with Dr. Baynes encouraged us to pursue the sucrose-based project. Considering the amount of time and resources we had, the team felt it would be more feasible to do a project centered around carbon sequestration.

Introduction
The 2016 UCLA iGEM Team is proud to participate in the Third International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology. As members of the synthetic biology community, we are committed to providing robust data for the development of novel characterization methods in the rapidly growing biological design fields of synthetic biology. The purpose of the 2016 InterLab study is to examine the precision and accuracy of fluorescence data and information processing from active iGEM teams participating around the world. By collecting fluorescence data from multiple teams in absolute units, variability in measurement and consistency of data collected from instrumentation following a uniform procedure can be determined within a high degree of accuracy. This notebook will record all protocols, daily experiments, relevant images, as well as the raw data and graphs used in the Interlab Submission Form.

Results
The following results are the fluorescence calibration curve (FITC) and the cell sampling OD600 and fluorescence results. The graphs were generated from the Excel spreadsheet provided by iGEM.
FITC Fluorescence Calibration Curve
Cultures were sampled at the t=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hour marks in 100uL aliquots from 5mL cultures and stored on ice to arrest growth until ready for measurement. These results are almost as expected, there was highly stagnated growth for both replicates of Device 1; we attribute this discrepancy to human/experimental error.
OD600 Graph for the Positive & Negative Control and Devices 1, 2, and 3
Following the last sampling at t=6hr, all samples were added to a 96-well plate in preparation for fluorescent measurement. The plate layout can be found in the lab notebook below. Fluorescent values were normalized following measurement,

Survey Analysis
When we had chosen to create a worm buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practises group. The modeling group worked with creating a analysis program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to gra"

This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. An initial leak occurs almost immediately after a liquid passes the area of the leak. Regardless of scale, these leaks are considered a failure mode.
Leak (Over Time)
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. A leak that occurs over time is not characterized by an initial leak growing over time but as a leak that appears a significant amount of time after liquid has passed the location of a leak. These leaks can be seen in situations where a seal degrades during incubation period, leading to a new leak forming minutes after liquid initially passed through a section. Regardless of scale, these leaks are considered a failure mode.
An initial leak. The red liquid has leaked out of the channel into the area between the PDMS and the flow layer.
Air Bubble
This qualitative failure is characterized by an air bubble being present within a channel or primitive. Air bubbles can affect proper liquid flow and can reduce the accuracy of design features such as time-dependent mixers and metering. Regardless of scale, air bubbles are considered a failure mode.
Multiple air bubbles are present in this chip. The red and blue liquids should extend down and up respectively to the circle valve between them, however air bubbles are present that are preventing these liquids from completely filling their respective channels.
Liquid does not cross an OPEN Valve
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid not crossing over a valve that has been opened by actuating the corresponding syringe on the control layer. This failure can exist in many forms, such as liquid pausing after filling the first portion of the valve and never crossing into the second section or leakage around the first portion of a valve. This failure is often accompanied by leakage due to pressure buildup.
Liquid is not properly crossing over a valve in this chip. After filling the first portion of the valve the red liquid should be crossing into the other section and filling the following channels. However, it is not crossing, which can cause leaks and improper liquid flow.
Liquid crosses a CLOSED Valve
This qualitative failure is characterized by a liquid crossing over a valve that is closed, meaning that it’s corresponding control syringe has not been actuated. This failure can exist in many forms, such as liquid leaking over a valve that has never been opened before or leaking over a valve that was previously opened by is not closed. This failure can lead to contamination of liquids as well as inaccuracies with features such as metering.

Details of Consult and Our Statement
Conversation with lawyer
Question1: Does BioMaster cause any infringement when using data and providing links to related documents from other databases?
Answer: If related resources are open to everyone and there’s no statement, using related data will be fully reasonable and legal. What’s more, BioMaster only provides references and the original links which is open on the related websites. So there will be no infringement.
Question 2: If users cause some influences on the project or others via using data in BioMaster, is BioMaster responsible for it?
Answer: Since the software is free and there is no interest dispute between the two parties. Users should use the voluntary principle when using it. Therefore, even if there are adverse consequences, the software provider is not responsible.
Statement
0 Version Start!
With the investigation and analysis, we merged it with our idea and we started our 0 version so that what we constructed would better fit user’s needs.
Professional Advice
When the 0 version was done, what we need was more professional and authoritative suggestions. To make sure the comprehension of the suggestions, not only universities but institutes and bio-technology company were visited. They gave us very specific suggestions and what we should improve. At the same time, we gained experience on establishing the database.
Communication with Dr. Dai
On 31st Jul, we attended the scholars' forum on synthetic biology, led by Dr. Dai Junbiao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After the forum, we communicated with Dr. Dai. We simply introduced what BioMaster is and what we want to achieve. He gave us his opinions and what he think about our projects. Also, he provided something that we should improve such as experimented data.
Full conversation
Question 1: When the experimenter conducts synthetic biology research and gene circuit construction, what aspects of the biological bricks should our database focus on and provide information to facilitate its work?
Answer: First, the sequence information of the components is very important. Second, the description of the function of biological components is also critical. At the same time, if you can provide data of some experiments carried out on some fragments or sites, it would be better. The experimenter will make good use of this information.

Genetics Model
Click the ""Genetics Model"" title to toggle our visual
The DNA coding for the 6 enzymes required for breakdown and assimilation of PET was too long to fit on one plasmid. To rectify this and to be able to test smaller subsystems, the PETase and MHETase genes were placed on Backbone 1, Plasmid 1. The Glycolaldehyde Reductase, Glycolaldehyde Dehydrogenase, Glycolate Oxidase, and Malate Synthase were placed in sequence on Backbone 2, Plasmid 2.
Plasmid 1
Repressed System
Activated System
Plasmid 1 uses an AraC and pBAD promoter to regulate the expression of PETase and MHETase. The transcription factor made from AraC usually binds and represses the pBAD promoter, halting transcription of the plasmid. The inducer, arabinose, can be added to the media, and this molecule binds to the AraC transcription factor on the DNA strand and changes its conformation so that transcription can occur [1]. The reaction scheme on the left explains a more complete mechanism of the transcription/translation of these proteins. The creation of AraC protein is related to a constitutive promoter which we assume enters the system as a constant rate, K. This method was also used by the UC Davis iGEM team in 2012. We assumed a fast-equilibrium hypothesis on the formation of the dimer and an essentially constant pool of arabinose in the environment. We can also streamline the binding of the two arabinose inducers to the AraC dimer into one reaction determined by the rate parameters k3+ and k3-. Since the amount of RNA polymerase does not change relative to these molecules, and since the frequent assumption used in literature is to group the transcription and translation rate into one overall rate of protein production, we simplify the system further. From these assumptions, we can simplify the system down into the system shown on the right.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

Aachen,2018,Team:Aachen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," using Plasmons for thermal purposes, we learned how all the different parameters influence Plasmon Resonance.
Secondly, during intense discussion we further evolved our setup. Up until that point,             we wanted to analyze the reflected light with the spectrometer.             This light is scattered by Plasmon Resonance in a 90° angle from the wafer.             It is a clear signal, but it is very weak. Furthermore, this means that the incident light beam,             that excites the Plasmons, and the reflected light beam are running inverse parallel. Because of this,             a beam splitter is needed. As our spectrometer is not extremely sensitive, Dr. Mourran advised that we should consider a transmission setup.             We followed his advice as this also simplified the setup. The beam splitter is not needed in this case, and this results in one component less that needs to be perfectly adjusted.

Searching for Fano Resonance through Simulation
Dr. Mouran recommended us to talk to another expert in this field,             who could give us some quantifiable data at which wavelength the Plasmon Resonance occurs.             He put us in contact with Dr. Chigrin, group leader for Theory of complex materials at the DWI Leibniz Institute for             Interactive Materials.
After a few minutes into the presentation of our proposed nanogold structure layout,             Dr. Chigrin immediately started talking about how we could develop such a sensor without running simulations first.             We were a bit confused as plasmon resonance occurs in nanoparticles always, the resonance wavelength changes depending on size and shape.             Then we realized that we were talking about two different phenomena.
Dr. Chigrin thought that we wanted to use the phenomena of Fano resonance in our sensor,             because we had a periodic hexagon grid of discs with 160 nm diameter and 400 nm distance from each other.             We had never heard about this and were curious. Fano resonance is an interference phenomenon.             It occurs if the plasmon resonance wavelength meets the Bragg condition. This could greatly enhance the peak of our signal (figure 1).
Figure 1: Fano resonance
The zone in which the Bragg condition is met, is quite small and dependent on a lot of factors. A college of Dr. Chigrin, Sebastian Meyer, did a simulation search for the distances where the bragg condition is met. You can read more about Fano resonance and the simulation results, that Sebastian Meyer did, in our wiki .

After this, 90% of our work should be on the novel features we're trying to implement, the new views and algorithms that will make our tool uniquely useful.  And that will mean more updating here as I have more interesting things to talk about.

Milestone
These are the major milestone objectives for the Construction phase:
TODO Our wonderful buoyant, metal filtering bacteria should be alive and kicking!
TODO (?) The lab/plan cloning strategy should be fully worked out at the end of the phase to reflect our final decisions on which parts/protocols/procedures/? to use. (I think this roughly corresponds to the Implementation Model in UPEDU. -- Jaspervdg 11:09, 23 June 2009 (UTC))

Growth curve of ER2566 during 5 L fermentation
Cell harvest after 3.2 h of cultivation at a final OD600 of about 4.6. The culture passed through a self-built cooling system made of a Liebig condenser. Cooling is enabled by julabo thermostat. Half of the culture was directly poured into prechilled 50 mL tubes and centrifugated, while the other half was first kept in a separate 5 L glass bottle at 4 °C due to missing space in the centrifuge.

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," delivery of nucleic acids to mammalian cells, ensuring our risk was fully minimized. Additionally, no killer proteins or any protein known to trigger a serious immune response in researchers or other organisms were used. We encourage other teams to follow our lead -- utilizing transient lipid transfection methods instead of viral infections and look forward to interacting with all mammalian-oriented research teams.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
At MIT the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) office serves as our biosafety committee for all of the labs on campus. An EHS representative for the Weiss Lab approves each student’s biosafety and lab-specific training. All students receive BL2 lab training and students working with mammalian cells received additional blood-borne pathogen training. EHS training includes General Biosafety for Researchers, Managing Hazardous Waste, General Chemical Hygiene and lab-specific training. We also gave a presentation on our project to staff at the EHS office in mid-July, who evaluated our practices and issued full compliance for our project with no additional safety concerns. We are also planning on giving a talk in mid-October to MIT’s Synthetic Biology Working Group, where we will receive additional feedback and lead discussion for safety concerns.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
We mainly used the mammoblock standard to create our parts, which allowed for safe storage of these parts. Since the mammoblocks use bacterial entry vectors, the mammalian parts can be stored in a BL1 setting, facilitating safer shipping and submission of parts. We hope that when future iGEM teams work with mammalian cells, they use the mammoblock standard to allow for coordinated and safer contribution of parts. Additionally, we rely on safe methods of nucleic acid delivery -- ensuring other teams will easily be able to transition to mammalian work in a safe manner. Finally, we have been characterizing a mammalian promoter (U6-TetO) that can transcribe short strands of RNA as RNAi could be a very robust method for implementing a mammalian kill switch on essential genes rather than employing a far more dangerous toxic protein or substrate.

In the meanwhile, the same procedure was done in a parallel way for our correct red clone and also sent to sequencing together with the blue ones. Unfortunately, the red clone did all of a sudden not show the correct sequence anymore. Therefore, new ONC, miniprep, gel electrophoresis and diluting plating were performed.
Moreover, protein expression control was started for the correct blue bacteria and the supposedly correct red bacteria. ONCs were made, followed by a main culture, which was growing to an OD600 of approximately 0,4. It was inoculated at OD600 of 0,05 and was altogether growing for 7 hours to reach the right OD600. Afterwards the red and blue probes were each separated into two probes and one of each was induced by IPTG at 15°C for 18 hours. The following day, the cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm and 10 °C, resuspended in 1 ml of Lysis-buffer (Potassiumphosphatebuffer pH 7,5) and sonicated with ultrasound (4x 20 sec, amplitude 5). After that, the probes were centrifuged for 20 min at 16000 g and 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf vessel and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of Lysis buffer.

1 Questionnaire
The literature shows that IBD is frequent in young, so we want to investigate young people's understanding of gut health and IBD. We produced relevant questionnaires and posted them on a social website, and ended up with 291 responses.
After the survey data came out, we immediately analyzed and discussed with our instructor, professor Ding Chen. Here are some important conclusions:
i. Young people know less about bowel disease and IBD
Only a few people pay attention to information related to intestinal diseases, and most people only pay attention to information related to problems or other special situations. Awareness of intestinal diseases and IBD is low in some developed regions.
ii. Young people have a concentrated source of information about disease
When we surveyed participants for information on bowel disease or health, we found that the vast majority of their information came from the Internet.
iii. Young people lack intestinal health awareness
When asked if they would take care of their gut health in their daily lives, nearly 80 percent of the participants said they would not take care of their gut health. This contrasts sharply with the rapidly rising incidence of the disease.
iv. Intestinal diseases affect people's normal lives
For participants who have been identified with bowel diseases, we asked questions about the impact of bowel disease on their lives, most of whom believed that it affected their lives.  Some even thought that some bowel diseases significantly reduced their quality of life.
v. In the treatment plan, people care most about efficacy
In this questionnaire, we asked participants what factors they were most concerned about in the treatment regimen. Participants were asked to rank the effects, costs, side effects, risks, and access approaches, and most of them rated efficacy as most important, followed by cost, side effects, risks, and ease of access. This inspires us, when designing treatment, in order to satisfy people's expectation to cure, work hard on curative effect more.
vi. Most people do not know about bacterial therapy
Finally, we asked the participants to talk about their acceptance of our proposed treatment. Those who fully accept and reject are in the minority, and most people hold a neutral attitude.
Conclusion
This questionnaire has timely solved some problems of our team and pointed out the direction of our future work.
Ⅰ. Public understanding for the intestinal disease and IBD is insufficient, we need to do some of the other more popular science activities to publicize the relevant information, improve the awareness of the public.
Ⅱ. The selection of drugs and treatment design needs to consider a number of factors, we should collect more social opinions, trying to make an effective, safe"

Varroa destructor
According to beekeepers we have spoken to , and as has been suggested in scientific studies 3, 4, 5 , the most important cause for increased bee mortality is the fittingly named parasitic mite Varroa destructor (herafter also named Varroa mite or just Varroa). Varroa mites feed on haemolymph (‘bee-blood’) which weakens the bees, while spreading serious diseases like the deformed wing virus. Beekeepers and bee researchers stress that the first and most important step to save the bees should be to control Varroa more effectively. Therefore, iGEM Wageningen UR 2016 aimed to save the bees from Varroa.
Figure 1. 10x magnification of a V. destructor, taken with a stereo microscope.
Currently in the Netherlands and other European countries, beehives are treated against Varroa with a combination of organic products consisting of thymol, formic acid and oxalic acid. These compounds can contaminate beeswax and honey 6 . More importantly, beekeepers are wary that such compounds can be harmful to bees and humans when the concentration used is too high 7, 8 . On the other hand, too low concentrations fail to kill Varroa and facilitate resistance 9 . The hobbyist character of beekeepers further adds to the concerns that accompany Varroa treatment. Beekeepers often care for their bees in their spare time and might not have time, resources, or the experience to use existing treatments in the intended manner.
Bee T
We propose a Varroa specific treatment through the use of engineered bacteria that releases toxin in a specified and regulated manner. The released toxin is not harmful to bees or humans. To do so, the bacteria will employ a network of regulation mechanisms to produce the toxin only when mites are present and when enough bacteria are present to effectively kill the mite. Other mechanisms are intended to strictly confine the bacteria to the treated hive, preventing them from spreading and mixing with natural ecosystems.
Specificity
When we started, there were results 10 suggesting that a crystal protein produced by a Bacillus-like strain is able to specifically kill Varroa mites. To facilitate testing of such toxins, we developed a new in vitro method for testing Varroa toxicity. This method involves the use of vesicles created from Varroa mites and release of fluorophores from these vesicles. The new test for Varroa toxicity"

HFIP Silk from last week gelled up
Looks like it doesn't hold for more than 1 day
Tried wetspin with godet v3.1
godet v3.1 is too short: the fiber keeps slipping off of the bottom, even with the overhang
Also, the screw holes on the godet need to be larger.
Started another concentration dialysis: 1:40 pm
Should remove at around 9:00 am tomorrow
Started a lyophilization: 2:30 pm
should remove on Wednesday at 2:30 pm
I tried to see how much volume could fit into one of the 3.5kDa cassettes
tried forcing 20mL into the cassette
It fits, but definitely leaks
When I extracted the liquid from the cassette, it was evident that some PEG had gotten in there
TOMORROW: Start the first dialysis for 2 silk samples asap in the morning."
Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of the cost for running industrial biosynthesis, utilizing carbon dioxide could be a major advantage not only from environmental perspective but also from an economical point of view. In order to achieve a stable co-culture, a dependent relationship between the two organisms is desired. This can be achieved in several ways, for example through quorum sensing [6] or metabolite exchange [7]. An exchange of metabolites was chosen due to the advantages of such a system, for example by providing additional fitness benefits due to the division of metabolic labor [8]. It has also been shown to be capable of purging cheaters from the system, i.e. cheaters do not seem to be able to outcompete the cooperating population [7]. Furthermore, in 2015 the Amsterdam iGEM team achieved a proof of concept in which they created a symbiotic culture between the cyanobacterium Synechocystis and Escherichia coli based on auxotrophy. This provided us with great inspiration on how to achieve our production system.
The resulting system will allow for the direct conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into commercially used chemicals that are currently derived from fossil sources of carbon, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1. General concept of the project with the cyanobacteria using light and carbon dioxide to produce acetate for a production organism
The chosen production organisms were Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They were chosen since they have all proven to be capable of industrial level production. Furthermore, all of them have been the subject of extensive research, providing a good foundation for continued development.
How will this work?
The modifications planned for each organism in the project are summarized in Figure 2. The project is divided into two systems: either with a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic production organism. For the prokaryotic organisms, arginine is overproduced and secreted. The cyanobacterium, which has its own gene coding for arginine biosynthesis knocked out, is therefore allowed to grow. The same strategy is used for the eukaryotic system, except glutamine is used instead of arginine. In both systems cyanobacteria will secrete acetate, acetate will be the only carbon source available for the production organisms thus leading to a co-dependency. This is achieved by overexpression and knock-out of several genes. For more details about the modifications, see the constructs page.

UNAM-CU,2015,Team:UNAM-CU#project_-_-_TEXT.html," 2 mains parts:
One capable of measuring blood glucose levels
The other capable of synthesize and excrete right folded insulin
For this circuit to work, the parts must be able to communicate with each other
Our main goals
Glucose levels detection:
Characterize a Trg-EnvZ chimera that interacts with the GGBP (Glucose-galactose binding protein)
Adjust the GGBP’s sensibility to human physiological levels
Insulin production:
Test the correct insulin production and secretion in bacterial strains with oxidative citoplasm
Use the insulin Lispro cDNA under a controlled promoter
Couple the insulin’s promoter to glucose levels information given by its detection
Theoretical basis
GGBP
GGBP is a monomeric protein that binds glucose with a dissociation constant (KD) in the  µM range.
Punctual mutations have been made by research groups in order to diminish its KD to the mM range (Hsieh, 2004); these mutations make it possible to detect glucose levels in physiological concentrations from other organisms, giving the evidence that it could be possible to adjust the detection to human physiological glucose levels as well as abnormal glucose levels due to hyperglycemia in diabetics.
The EnvZ-OmpR Two Component System
Two component systems (TCS) are the major signal transduction mechanisms in bacteria; several receptors can sense some compounds in the media and respond with chemotaxis and metabolic changes.
The EnvZ-OmpR TCS has a chief role in osmoregulation in bacteria. By this mechanism, the bacteria can sense osmotic changes in the environment through the EnvZ receptor, which is bound in the inner membrane of the cell. When the environment osmolarity changes, the EnvZ receptor has a conformational change that leads to its phosphorylation, this phosphorylation lets EnvZ to phosphorylate OmpR , a transcription factor, which can then activate the expression of two porins under the OmpC promoter sequence.
Trg receptor
Trg is a receptor and is part of a TCS able to interact with many periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs); interestingly it interacts with GGBP when bound to glucose and it induces chemotaxis of the bacteria towards the glucose source
The TrgZ chimera
Since Trg and EnvZ share some structural characteristics, in 1994 Baumgartner, et al designed and stably expressed a chimera that puts together the Trg periplasmic domain with the EnvZ citoplasmic domain.
As a consequence, this chimera is able to"

Preliminary Project Description
Aflatoxins, specifically, aflatoxin B1 have been troubling food and agriculture industry all over the world. As secondary metabolites produced by certain species of Aspergillus, aﬂatoxins have been one of the most toxic and problematic . Though many past traditional biological methods have been put in this fight against these toxins, the purposes were mostly realized by mixing whole strains and degrading toxins passively.
Our goal this year is to create a more sensitive cellular device to simultaneously detect and degrade AFTB1 in the environment. We have two subsystems, the Detection Subsystem and the Degradation Subsystem. We will take and modify some past parts designed by Tsinghua 2017 as our biosensor to detect AFTB1. And we will utilize this part to induce downstream genes to produce enzymes that will degrade aflatoxin outside cells. We have some candidates now that show the ability to degrade AFTB1 and they will be tested by us then.
Detection Subsystem
Inspired by Tsinghua 2017, we will reconstruct the sensor based on the yeast two-hybrid technique. There are two domains in this part, the transcription-activation domain (AD)  and the DNA-binding domain (BD). They correspondingly use two different single-chain antibodies of AFT ScFv1 and ScFv2 to link together when AFTB1 exists and activate Gal4 promoter then. When the promoter is activated, it can open downstream genes, the Degradation Subsystem.
Degradation Subsystem
The degradation subsystem is designed to degrade aflatoxin which will be induced by the Detection Subsystem.
bacC
bacC is a bacilysin biosynthesis oxidoreductase gene from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. As a new report says, bacC may contribute aflatoxin degradation in some degree. The BLAST results show that bacC has some similarities and identities to reductase with nine reductase enzymes of Mycobacteria smegmatis,"

Danish Ethics and Wiki Workshop at SDU
In the spirit of the iGEM community, we hosted a meetup in August for our fellow Danish iGEM teams: InCell from the University of Copenhagen (KU), and the Snakebite Detectives from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).  A total of seven members from these two teams joined us for breakfast and attended our meetup. This was the first ever iGEM meetup hosted by our university, so we decided to make it memorable. We took advantage of our interdisciplinary team roster, and thus designed a wiki and ethics workshop to aid our fellow Danish teams.
We utilised the broad interdisciplinary profile of our team, to have Emil S. and Lene present the perception of science throughout the history and the meta-bioethical aspects of GMO, respectively. Emil S. has a Bachelor of Arts in History, and Lene has a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. The ethical presentation was purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time"

Rhamnolipids have many applications because of their natural biosurfactant, emulsifying, fungicidal, antibiotic and pharmaceutical properties. Rhamnolipids can also operate in extreme conditions such as high temperature, pH and salinity. Rhamnolipids have low toxicity and are biodegradable compared to their synthetic chemical counterparts. A rhamnolipid is composed of a rhamnose sugar molecule and a b-hydroxyalkanoic acid. The rhamnolipids are almost exclusively produced by pathogenic microorganisms. For this reason we propose the non-pathogenic nature of E.coli as an attractive candidate for commercial rhamnolipid production by assembling our rhlAB gene into a BioBrick using synthetic biology to engineer this new rhlAB producing bacteria for human benefit.

The students from the 11 different countries all over Europe really appreciated all of the tips and advices that gave the speakers during this roundtable. A lot of exchange between the both parties were focused on the patenting process which was a really good topic to deal with because of the lot interrogations of the students.
The first thing to know about this symposium is that we wanted to organize an event as much entertaining and sharing as possible. That’s why we planned a main scientific symposium through two roundtables to maximize the exchange between the speakers and the audience.
Then, we decided to focus our both roundtables about synthetic biology of course. However, we didn’t want to only deal with sciences in a global way.
That’s why we planned to divide our scientific symposium into two related but different roundtables.

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Proteinase K activity
The Western Blot results show that proteinase K was expressed, however, no activity was detected in a cell lysate assay and no proteinase K could be purified from the cells. The proteinase K cultures were induced overnight with 6 mM (final concentration) of arabinose. According to the literature, proteinase K self-digests (8) . Perhaps the induction strength and time was too long. Next time we will reduce the time and concentration of induction for proteinase K.

Connect the power lead and run the gel with 180 V until the distance of the lowest molecular weight standard lane to the gel end is down to 0.5 cm.
Staining the polyacrylamide gel (Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining):
After finishing the SDS-PAGE remove gel from gel casting form and transfer it into a box.
Add 100 mL of the Colloidal Coomaassie Brilliant Blue staining solution to your polyacrylamid gel.
Incubate the gel in the solution at room temperature until the protein bands got an intensive blue color. Shake the gel continuously during incubation.
Remove the staining solution.
Wash the gel with destaining buffer .
Incubate the gel in H2O (2-6 h) for bleaching the background. Shake the gel continuously during incubation.  If necessary replace the colored water with new one.
MALDI-TOF/TOF sample preparation
Tryptic digest of gel lanes for analysis with MALDI-TOF:
Be careful that skin scales or hair do not contaminate your sample. So wear hand gloves and tie up your hair.
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60 % (v/v) CH3CN and 0.1 % (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively, microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing. If you work with reaction tubes from Eppendorf, you do not need the wash step either.
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes. If necessary, cut the parts to smaller slices
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µL 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 20 minutes till the gel slices are destained. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µL trypsin solution followed by short centrifugation.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Today Phil and I tried dynamic light scattering (DLS) with our version of Yeates' original cage and Mutant #10. Phil's older samples (purified 4 days prior and thawed twice) were very aggregated and the initial attempt to pipette a sample clogged the tip. My M10 sample (purified 1 day prior and thawed once) were somewhat aggregated, albeit not as extensively.
We pooled all three elutions of the original cage and filtered it and elution 2 of M10 with a .1 micron filter using a centrifuge. M10 elution 3 was kept unfiltered since it was the least aggregated sample.
DLS was performed with the filtered original, filtered M10, and unfiltered M10. Results below:

Cervical cancer is the one of most killing cause of woman. Approximately, 300.000 people deaths by cervical cancer in every year (Frazer, Cox et al., 2006; Lowy and Schiller, 2006).Cervical cancer caused by Human papillomaviruses (HPV) (Martinez et al., 2008).More than 100 types of HPVs have been identified to date (Dell et al., 2001), but the two most common types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18. HPV type 16 and 18 are high risk type that causecervical cancer (Das, 2003). Both of those type responsible for approximately 70 % of all cases (Smith et al., 2007).

So it has a bright future about controlling nematodes.
Embarking from the actual problems and focusing on nematodes attack, our human practices aim to direct our project by the way of researching, investigation, interviewing and collaboration. Additionally, it makes synthetic biology as well as our project well reach out to the public so as to lay a formation for the application and popularization of our projects. And in this way, we hope to take synthetic biology to practical application from laboratory genuinely, and to realize the value of scientific research.
Laws & Regulations
It is universally acknowledged that the biosafety problem is a social problem which not only needs scientific researchers to make achievements in labs, but also needs the government to lay down some policies and laws for specification at the same time. In recent years, as scientists have made great progress in the field of life science, Chinese government is attaching growing importance to bio-safety problems and legislating to consummate the bio-safety and environmental safety of China. In order to get a clearer understanding of those laws and regulations, we interviewed Lecturer Yan Houfu in the School of Law, Beijing Normal University. Yan is a doctor of environmental law who graduated from Peking University. He is enthusiastic in environmental protection. He pays a close and long-term attention to the environmental laws and regulations in China and has obtained great achievements in the relevant research.
We headed for the School of Law to visit Dr. Yan on July 9th, 2015 and conducted an in-depth communication of bills on bio-safety and protection of peasants’ rights and interests, etc. From this interview we learned that the government of China adopts a fair attitude to the legislation of bio-safety. As to the guarantee of peasants’ rights and interests, the government furnishes cover to the peasants from the insurance companies who are supposed to offer compensation to peasants if large scale insect pests or diseases occur.
In addition, we discussed with Dr. Yan about the social issue of transgenic plants. Dr. Yan expressed that he didn’t know much about the biological principle of transgenosis product as a researcher of law, and he realized some of his previous opinions were unscientific after"

FJNU-China,2018,Team:FJNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", there is specific salt concentration and temperature on the skin. We choose this feature as a starting point, designed and construced an engineered E.coli strain with a logical gate to produce bacteriostatic PLA. Every basic component serves respective functions. dsrA, a temperature-controlled promoter from E.coli, is more active at 37 degree than 25 degree.[3] The osmotically control promoter proU shows sensitivity to the salt concentration from 0M to 0.3M.[4] We used the global-regulate protein H-NS that could specifically bind to osmotically control promoter proU as a specific repressor to inhibit the promoter downstream.[5]
    When the circuits are spray on the skin, temperature reaches 37 ℃, the repressor protein LacI will be expressed to inhibit PlacI and the H-NS won’t be revealed. Thus, when people sweat, the Na+ and Cl- will induce proU resulting in the logical gate switching to “on” state.
    The circuit doesn’t need to be “on” state when it is at room temperature. When temperature stays below 37 ℃, dsrA will not work. The function of PlacI BBa_R0011 has become a constitutive promoter. The global-regulate protein H-NS will be expressed to inhibit proU. Then the logical gate will be on “off” state.     We developed the 2-PE part as a switch that realizes the transformation from producing mode to suicide mode. TetO and TetR are common logic elements used in synthetic biology, linking with 2-PE and mazf.[6][7]
    Without the induction of arabinose, TetR and mazf won’t be expressed, and production of 2-PE maintained at a normal level.
    If users would like to stop 2-PE production, they only need to add a little arabinose. TetR will be expressed to inhibit TetO and mazf, causing the cell death.     We currently use GFP and RFP to characterize the expression of our circuits. And we’re also trying to obtain more results. (Details can be found on our Results page.)

Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
Chains in our Chain-Node Model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those with definite structure.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: Compare first the partReference and partType defined in database of the first part of two chains in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or the end of either chain. Meanwhile, a part in bound and unbound state(这里多了半句？)
If unicode_c of each chain is different with others, then we could sort the chain list by comparing their unicode_c (just the same with comparison of two strings). However, it is not always so: chains with same unicode_c may be equivalent or not. It is due to the mark asterisk *. Unicode_c knows where are the binding sites, but it does not know the binding details of that part. In other words, unicode_c could not solely determines the order of the chains since it lacks of information of the trees defined in our Chain-Node model. The forest (set of trees) in Chain-Node Model describes the binding details of parts in chains. We need to find something like unicode_c to represent the essence of the associated trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bond state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i"

2. In 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU/FAFU, we discussed about how we want to use this alliance and came up with 2 conclusion: 1. Build a worldwide database containing contents of heavy metals in soil 2. Mutual improve our social impact
2017.08.23
In 23th of August, we sent a Collaboration Request to iGEM official website, the next day Ana Sifuentes replied our message and posted our request in the iGEM official website, and we received the response of many teams like team EXETER and team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN, with their information, we construct a database which contains the worldwide data of contents of Cu2+/Cd2+ in soil or water. And we build it based on map of the world.

First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.
This one goes deeper
A good rule for rocket experimenters to follow is this: always assume that it will explode. The vehicle explodes, literally explodes, off the pad. The simulator shakes you a little bit, but the actual liftoff shakes your entire body and soul.
Even deeper
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And a level-3 title again
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#FutureScenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," originally were in JPEG format.    This shows that nowadays, it is not only possible to store text and    information as we did in CryptoGErM; but DNA can be taken to another level    of storage.
If now it is possible to store images in DNA, in the near future we    might be able to store complete movies on DNA
DNA sequence drops to $0.0002 per Megabase
Fourth fictional scenario
CryptoGErM is designed primordially for information that requires to    be stored for a longer period of time and whose accessibility is not required immediately. However, we are pretty sure that    this would change in the upcoming years due to the fact that DNA    sequencing is becoming faster and cheaper every year. The inclusion of    new and modern techniques, like massively parallel DNA sequencing, [8] have resulted in the    decrease of the price and time needed for the DNA sequencing    parallely to the increasing of the number of megabases that can be    read.
Since 2008, [9] it has    been predicted that DNA sequencing techniques would evolve till the    point that we will be able to obtain the DNA sequence in just a few    hours or minutes, even though many technical challenges have to be    overcome first.
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a division of    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), established to take part on    behalf of the NIH within the International Human Genome Project (HGP),    has been tracked the costs associated with the DNA sequencing (These    tack is done within the Centers founded by the National Institute). This    data can be consulted freely on the webpage of the NHGRI, in the    section “DNA Sequencing Costs: Data. [10] The following graph contains the data of    the costs of DNA Sequencing up to October 2015.
Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence
The graph above shows how the cost for the sequencing of DNA has    plummeted since the beginning of the 21st century; this is mainly given by    the introduction of high-throughput techniques.    By October 2015, according to the data provided by    the National Human Genome Research Institute, the cost for    Megabase base of DNA sequencing was $0.0145. By this year    2016, the cost of the DNA sequencing is expecting to be further    reduced. However, until now, not official data has been released.
According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles approximately"

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#Project#Overview#UVA_-_-_TEXT.html," our assembly of the uirS two component system did not function. At this point there was not sufficient time remaining prior to the jamboree to do further testing to discern the reason for the failure of the system, however the two reasons we believe to be the most likely cause of failure are:
PlsiR promoter from Synechocystis does not function as a promoter in E. coli. It may not be able to recruit the sigma-70 factor required for binding of E. coli RNA-polymerase to initiate transcription
The Phycocyanobillin synthesis biobrick used K322122 may be supplied with a mutated promoter, leading to lack of expression of PCB. We have documented this error in sequencing of its promoter on the experience page on the part K322122
Testing PlsiR
A crucial part of testing the uirS system in E. coli was ensuring that the PlsiR promoter did not act as a constitutive promoter, thus negating the use of the system as a conditional transcriptional activator. We have confirmed through the use of a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner that PlsiR is not active when uirS and uirR are absent.
PlsiR was ligated to GFP with two ribosome binding sites of different strengths and no fluorescence was observed (the parts  used for this experiment were K1725401 and K1725402) (Figure 6). Placing uirR upstream of the strong constitutive promoter J23101 did not have an adverse effect on cell health or its ability to reproduce.
Figure 6: Average Fluorescence/A600 in DH5α Strains. Fluorescence and absorbance were measured at one-hour intervals and the ratio of the two was averaged. Fluorescence was measured in arbitrary units. Little to no additional fluorescence was observed in strains containing PlsiR.I13500 or PlsiR.E5501, when compared to DH5α cells containing no GFP or GFP without a promoter (E5501).
PlsiR was submitted as a separate BioBrick (K1725400) after the removal of the SpeI restriction site starting at the 53rd nucleotide. Assuming UirS and UirR are present, this BioBrick allows future teams to create a system that elicits a response to UV-A. Through BioBrick assembly two additional parts were created that allow for a system based on these three members to be tested by fluorescence measurements: K1725401 (which contains PlsiR upstream of the RBS B0034 and GFP"

Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Yesterday's lab session saw the Metal Sensing team innoculate 6 tubes of 5ml LB (plus ampicillin) with six cultures of DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_J33206 in plasmid pSB1A2 in the morning. By the time afternoon had arrived, the bacteria had grown to sufficient numbers; three of these cultures were then used to further inoculate 3 flasks of 50ml LB+amp. The three flasks of 50ml LB+amp + transformant E. coli cells were then placed in the orbital incubator and will take part in today's midi-prep. Meanwhile the six tubes were used in a mini-prep attempt but alas, the procedure went wrong and had to be abandoned.
Today's lab session will focus on creating midi-prepped plasmids from the inoculated 50ml LB+amp flasks as well as carry out restriction enzyme digest analysis on a sample. The samples will then be run on agarose gel by DNA gel electrophoresis.
Procedure
Midi-prep of transformant E. coli cells
To carry out the midi-prep we used Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute midi-prep kit and with it, the protocol . There were no changes to the protocol except for an additional step after step 10b - an additional 2 minute spin to ensure ethanol removal. The route we took was the Spin method.
The only thing to note is that we did not midi-prep all of the samples placed in the flask; cultures"

Abstract  The first software that designs  temperature-sensing regulatory RNA – RNAThermo is presented in this  article.  Parameters were set and several  temperature-sensing regulatory RNA sequences were given by the RNAThermo.  The designed RNAs have been verified both as  to on the structural and functional aspects.   RNAThermo’s potential application in the fermentation industry is  discussed.
Keywords: RNA Thermometer, Computer, Design
Introduction
In addition to exploration,  explanation and prediction, the ultimate goal of science is creation.  In the field of life science, enthusiasm  towards creation originates the synthetic biology.  During the last decade, numerous artificial  biological networks had been made by rearranging the exited biological macromolecules.  Recently, creation of the macromolecules  inside biological networks emerges as a hotspot.  Because of structural simplicity and manipulation  convenience, RNA becomes an ideal model for conducting such researches.  In this article, the first software that designs  temperature-sensing regulatory RNA - RNAThermo is reported.  Structural and functional verifications of  the designed RNATs were made.  RNAThermo’s  potential application in the fermentation industry is discussed:  the software provides a new method for  achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.

To validate the sucrose-exporting capabilities of transformed synechococcus and characterize a previously made biobrick inspired from Dr. Ducat’s research (BBa_K656011), the cscB-transformed PCC7942 was grown and induced to export sucrose by 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with and without chloramphenicol (CAM) as measured by High-Throughput-Liquid-Chromatography (HPLC).

Figure 3: Principle of the bioreactor. An inner compartment made from a repurposed dialysis bag (2 kDa, Spectra/Por ® 6 dialysis membrane, 132633) contains bacillus producing a product. The outer compartment contain synechococcus secreting producing a carbon source for bacillus to live on. The dialysis bag serves both as mechanical separation and easy extraction of the product without cross contamination. Edited and reprinted with permission of Gert Gram and Jyllands-Posten.
 
Enabling production from a common feedstock.
The choice of bacillus as “manufacturer” strain, was made taking into account its general resistance to extraterrestrial environments (ref - der var nogen der nævnte en artikel) and its ability to form hazard-resistant endospores (REF 5, ref 1). Endospores, at least theoretically, could be utilized to create a library of transformed  hibernating bacteria that upon addition of growth media can resurrect through germination, growing, and producing a wanted compound. We believe that such a system would make transportation less expensive, avoiding the need of cryogenic storage, and maybe more importantly, enabling the possibility of a closed system where astronauts could avoid contact with the bacterial cultures directly because all initial protocols are prepared on earth. Such closed system would be highly relevant to avoid contamination of the recycled atmosphere in extraterrestrial environments such as space stations, where opportunistic bacteria have been observed"

Groningen,2012,Team:Groningen#international cooperation_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.1% iodine, a clear zone was formed around B. subtilis wildtype and B. subtilis strain containing pSac-Cm. There was no clear zone observed around B. subtilis strain containing backbone K823023 (right picture).
The inability of the B. subtilis strain containing BBa_K823023 to degrade starch has demonstrated that the amyE locus in    the B. subtilis genome had been replaced. Apart from this characterization experiment, our team has been using BBa_K823023     as a plasmid backbone for our volatile detection device in B. subtilis sboA-lycopene .

TU Munich iGEM 2012
We participated in the survey of the iGEM TU Munich and are very proud that we got their original Bavarian Collaboration-Medal.
iGEM Uppsala
At the beginning of August we received the chromoproteins amilCP (blue), amilGFP (yellow) from iGEM Uppsala 2011 .     We were able to transform their BBa_K592009 and BBa_K592010 behind our identified promoters into E.coli and managed to turn B.subtilis into blue and yellow, which has never been done before!     For the latest results, check our Pigment page .
After the European Jamboree, the Uppsala team sent us the red chromoprotein eforRed (BBa_K592012). Although we could prove succesful cloning into our plasmid psac-cm connected to our promoter PsboaA, into E. coli and Bacillus subtilis by restriction analysis, there was no visible expression of the protein.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
