LovTap
LovTap is a protein fusion of the LOV2 domain from Avena sativa phototropin1 and trp repressor from E.coli.
Phototropin is a plant blue-light receptor, with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and  conserved cysteine residues responsible for the conformation change upon blue-light exposure. The LovTap fusion makes use of this conformational change.  In the dark state the LovTap is not able to bind to DNA. After light activation the deformation of the TrpR domain is reversed and TrpR is able to bind to the trp operon.  
We would like to use LovTap as a blue light sensor for our multiplexer. 
Fig: The figure shows in blue the Lov2 domain, in yellow the TrpR and in dark blue the linker helix.
Cph8
Cph8 is a chimeric light receptor engineered by Levskaya et al. in 2005. It contains the photoreceptor Cph1 and the EnvZ histidine kinase.  The light sensing unit is connected to transcription via the EnvZ-OmpR signaling pathway, phosphorylated OmpR acting as a transcription factor.
Cph1 is only active when it binds the chromophore phycocyanobiline (PCB). Since PCB is not naturally produced in E.coli we also need to express the PCB generators: ho1 and pcyA.
In this construct far red light activates the EnvZ kinase which results in the phosphorylation of OmpR and its activation as a transcription factor. Red light on the other hand deactivates the kinase"
Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Practices#Morality#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," to treat the biosensor’s effect on this group as neutral. Thus, we are left with weighing the positive effects the biosensor has for problematic drug users against the negative effects it has for individuals who would be swayed into drug use, in order to determine whether its implementation is morally wrong.
I think that, when considering these two groups, the positive effects outweigh the negative, for several reasons. First, the demographic of people ‘treading the line’ of drug use is surely small. For it is somewhat unbelievable that there exists a large population that has, up until this point, remained abstinent of drug use, only to be swayed by access to additional information regarding the quality of drugs. A more probable scenario is that this is not quite how risk assessment works, and that very few people actually belong to this demographic. Indeed, consider heroin use as an example. Most individuals probably do not engage in this activity because they are afraid of exceptionally pure heroin; rather, we expect them to harbour more pertinent reservations, such as fear of needles, social stigma, etc.
Second, the demographic of problematic drug users who could potentially be helped by this device is undoubtedly large. An overwhelming majority, if not all, of the countries in the world face problematic drug use. Furthermore, in countries that can afford it, there exists considerable infrastructure devoted to reducing the societal harm caused by drug use, including needle exchanges, drug consumption rooms and rehabilitation services. The fact of the matter is that, while certainly there could be individuals whose only barrier to drug use is a lack knowledge of purity, they most likely comprise a small portion of the population compared to problematic drug users. If the biosensor’s implementation is to have a positive effect on these individuals by reducing harm and illness, then its positive consequences outweigh the negative consequences for society. Thus, according to the Utility Principle, the implementation of the biosensor would be morally good.
>
Conclusion
In this essay I have argued that, when asking the question of whether the drug purity biosensor is morally wrong because it will cause more drug use, what we are actually asking is if the action of its implementation would cause more drug use. I then reasoned that assigning a moral status to an action requires a criteria of right and wrongness, and selected Utilitarianism as this criteria. Subsequently, I separated society’s population into four rough groups or demographics, arguing some would be affected by the implementation of the biosensor, while others would not. I further postulated that, in the final moral reckoning, it comes down to whether the amount of good the biosensor could do for problematic drug users outweighs"

No explanation of what to do with waste (tea bag)
Figure out how to deal with resistance problem and reaction (AMPs)
Drinking water with GMOs implies other risks than drinking water with cholera
Our team was also pleased to see how others managed to progress with their own projects. It was interesting to confront our ideas of human practices with theirs and particularly when parts of our projects were similar. (e.g. peptide production, treating water, dealing with worldwide health issues)
At this point of the competition, all teams were unsure about some aspects of their projects, and these meetups contributed to make progress on how to answer interrogations / solve ethical issues.
Skype meeting
Greece
It was our first skype meeting. We had the opportunity to talk about modeling because the Greece team already had modeled the comportment of a quorum sensing molecule in a cell population. This modeling could have been related to our project with the diacetyl acting like a quorum sensing molecule between V. harveyi and P. pastoris. Moreover they were interested in NMR facilities we use to detect quorum sensing molecule.
Singapour
We did a Skype to meet each other and to introduce our project. We talked about collaboration but didn’t find how to help each other.
Purdue
We had an interesting exchange about collaboration. Indeed, their project is about using lung microbiota to detoxify lungs and because one of our members already dealt with strains coming from the lung microbiota, it was the opportunity to do an experiment for them with these lung strains (experiments and obtained results are described above). More than that, in their lab they had the opportunity to use rats organs which could have been useful to test the cytotoxicity of our AMP once we’d produced them. But we couldn’t produce them soon enough.
Boston
Their project is about producing AMPs against a wide-range of bacteria causing world-wide disease like malaria or cholera. with an in vitro system. Because their system is based upon AMP without a methionine in N-ter they were interested in our project. As their production is based on an in vitro production and ours is based on the communication of several microorganisms, we had a lot of points to compare. We talked about our protocol, pros and cons of our projects and so on. We would have liked to collaborate with this team but while they were starting their experiments we were ending ours on the shareable part.

Selection of the project
In order to make a chance to reach the iGEM competition finals, we have to choose an impressing project! To be inventive, it is important to know what is renewing within the field of synthetic biology and within the iGEM competition. Therefore, we regarded all projects of previous years and discussed the most remarkable projects during several group meetings. Furthermore, all new and interesting articles of the 'Science' and 'Nature' journals have been read.
To stimulate the creativity within the group, we held a brainstorm session. We came up with a great variety of topics, from bacterial anti-aging cream to oil detecting bacteria and from bio batteries to anti-hangover medicines. Of all these subjects, the most interesting and most significant topics were chosen to be elaborated. After extensive research and decision making, we presented our four remaining topics to our supervisors:
Bacterial CSI
Facebook
Tumortargeting
TV Screen
Together we considered the possibilities and limitations of the knowledge and technical and biological requirements of the Eindhoven University of Technology. Because of many uncertainties, ethical problems and the lack of guarantees for results, we ended up with our final topic: building a television screen using genetically engineered yeast cells!
Let’s start!
So finally we decided on our project... Yet it’s time to start our biggest challenge in science! Before the first week of the summer, the project of the iGEM team of Valencia in 2009 was our basic guideline. We did not only read their wiki, but also considered their outlook, tips and bibliography.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#solution_-_-_TEXT.html," Hawaii (2008), Tsinghua (2008), Virginia (2008) teams worked on it and submitted a set of BioBrick parts for PHB synthesis. However, the complete phaCAB operon is not available in the Registry. Because a lot of work about PHB has already been done and because our short term goal was not to optimize the PHB granules productions, an existing engineered E. coli strain able to produce PHB was used as a proof-of-concept affinity matrix producer. This strain comes from the DSMZ public collection and is named DMSZ15372 .
Taking advantage of the natural affinity of Phasins to PHB, it is possible to engineer strains in which PHB and the Phasin-tagged protein of interest are co-produced and the binding can occur. The overall yield and specificity of the process depends on the structure of the Phasin-based tags, which can be easily constructed or modified by using BioBrick parts compatible with the common RFC10 and RFC23 standards to perform in-frame assemblies.
For this reason these tags are modular and can be freely expanded; a generic one is shown in Fig.23.
Figure 23: Generic tag composed by two Phasin coding sequences separated by a flexible peptide linker coding sequence.
Protein purification system
Phasins and PHB granules can replace the common affinity tags and matrix respectively. However, expensive proteases are still essential to remove the tag after the Phasins-PHB binding. A novel engineered inducible Intein can be used to complete the purification process by removing the affinity tag, thus replacing proteases.
Intein
Inteins (Intervening Proteins) are sequences capable of self-exciding from a precursor protein through a process known as self-splicing, forming a peptide bond between the flanking proteins (exteins). Many so-called mini-Inteins have been engineered, whose key feature is the capability to completely release a flanking extein (the target protein) in response to a simple stimulus, either chemical or physical, with no need of expensive proteases.
In literature, one mini-Intein was obtained through mutagenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mtu RecA Intein. The sequence of this Intein, referred to as ΔI-CM, allows for pH/heat-controlled C-terminal cleavage.
Thanks to this feature, the ΔI-CM Intein can be fused downstream of an affinity tag and upstream of the protein coding sequence of interest in order to enable a cheap cleavage process to remove the N-terminal tag.

To use this promoter, we would have to modify the MIG1 binding site for the promoter to function on glucose-enriched media. According to Dr. Hans Ronne of the Department of Forest Mycology and Plant Pathology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, maintaining galactose inducibility would entail a risky manipulation of the CYC8-TUP1 co-repressor complex.
We researched other methods of eliminating glucose-mediated repression, but deemed it more practical to use a constitutive promoter like TEF1. Constitutive promoters enable constant gene expression, while inducible promoters turn gene expression on or off depending on a certain factor. Controlling the amount of product produced is a critical element in creating a specific dose of medicine. To control dosage the consumer could heat-shock the yeast after a time calculated from the progesterone biosynthesis rate, as opposed to controlling the amount of galactose in the growth media.
Terminator
We originally chose the Tsynth27 terminator recommended by Dr. Hal Alper1 for its short length (66 bp) and high gene expressivity [17] . When we ordered the sequence from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), we received an error regarding the length of the efficiency region; the long, repetitive sequence of TATA base pairs, which was originally designed for higher efficiency, made synthesis of the gene block impossible.
We decided to use another short synthetic terminator, Tsynth8, also designed by Dr. Alper. Tsynth8 contains a shorter efficiency region yet still allows for high gene expression and low cryptic promoter activity in Y. lipolytica.
GENE CONSTRUCT ASSEMBLY
Initially, we determined that Gibson Assembly (GA) was the best option for plasmid cloning for two reasons: our mentors and team members have prior experience with the method, and GA can join many DNA fragments of any length. However, we wanted to explore other possible methods of cloning before making our final decision. We reached out to Dr. Jean Marc Nicaud and he suggested we consider Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) for plasmid construction. Dr. Nicaud informed us that GGA was an ideal method for Y. lipolytica plasmid assembly. Dr. Rohinton Kamakaka also advised us to use GGA as it offers a seamless, single-reaction assembly of DNA fragments, similar to GA [18] .
After further research, however, we discovered multiple issues with this assembly technique: our team members and mentors have no prior experience with GGA,"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," consider before any handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are several concerns that must be addressed properly. The safety of the public as well as of the environment is of the utmost importance, but the safety of the person in direct contact with the GMOs should not be compromised either. The risk associated with laboratorial work can be evaluated using the statement “Risk = Hazard ✕ Probability”. To responsibly address this inquiry, the entire team was given a mandatory lab safety course held by Lab Technician Simon Rose. In addition, we received a detailed handbook regarding lab safety. This ensured that all our team members were well equipped to work safely in the lab. Throughout the project we have continuously been evaluating the safety of our work. These assessments can be found in the safety form . Furthermore, our team participated in the 5th annual BioBrick workshop hosted by DTU BioBuilders. Here we participated in a lab safety course before entering their laboratories. Both of these lab safety courses gave us the necessary knowledge to work safely with GMO and handle waste appropriate, as well as the according procedures in case of an emergency.
In the lab, we worked with several potentially harmful chemical agents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethidium bromide, chloroform, phenol, Congo red, antibiotics, and autoclaved glycerol. These chemical agents were handled using gloves at all times, and whenever deemed necessary, handled in a fume hood. Gloves were worn when necessary, and clean lab coats were worn restrictedly in the laboratorial areas. To visualise bands in agarose gels, we used an UV board. UV rays are carcinogenic when exposure is frequent and prolonged. To reduce the amount of exposure, several precautions were made. Gloves, long sleeves and a facial screen were worn at all times, and the time spend at the UV board was kept at a minimum.
Public and Environmental Risk Assessment
The chassis organisms containing the system is meant to be contained in a device, which is incorporated into an urban environment. While this device would be a safely enclosed container, it still possess the risk of physical breakage from violent acts or environmental disturbances. For this reason, we consulted a plastics expert, who advised us to use the plastic known as Polycarbonate. This plastic is remarkably durable, with the ability to ward off most physical traumas. The plastics expert has estimated that such a container would last in an urban environment for at least 20 years, and most likely more than that. To illustrate the durability of the plastics, he notified us of several devices from the 1980s"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," findings can be misused – even when they were determined in good faith. VBIO therefore do not take dual-use problems or biorisks lightly. Everything has to be done to prevent individuals, society and environment from or accidental or malicious misuse of life sciences.
On the other side bad will, crime and terrorism always can elude even the best laws or legal prohibitions. Therefore awareness of the involved scientists is of crucial importance. Proliferous introduction of new regulations, structures, licensing procedures and administrative processes will prevent dual use risks only to a certain extent. Effort and benefits would be out of proportion with the associated disabilities and delays of life science research. Therefore VBIO stands against demands of the “Deutscher Ethikrat” (German Ethics Council) for stricter legal regulation.
In the sense of an appropriate risk strategy we support awareness-raising measures at all levels of the science community, within universities and research institutions, within scientific societies, within companies and last not least within study and teaching.
Supported by the “Konferenz Biologischer Fachbereiche” (KBF, German Conference of Biological Departments) VBIO had achieved that the topics of biosafety and biosecurity were implemented in study reference frame “Fachkanon_Biologie” and the study plan of “Fachspezifisch ergänzende Hinweise” (FEH 10) of the accreditation agency ASIIN. Thus all life science departments in Germany are asked to implement biorisk management aspects in all of their bachelor and master degree programs.
The goal must be to confront every bioscientist with the dual-use problem and biorisk management from the beginning of his career and to achieve that a bioscientist is not satisfied with the compliance with the legal regulations but recognize and accomplish this special ethical responsibility. In individual cases, this can also mean the temporary or final abandonment of a research project.
In line with the “Gemeinsamer Ausschuss zum Umgang mit Sicherheitsrelevanter Forschung” of the DFG and Leopoldina (joint committee on dealing with safety-relevant research), the VBIO requires universities and research institutions to create financial, organizational and time-related spaces that enable their employees to conduct risk-responsive, risk-averse analysis.
These include regular training, exchange and counseling services. A further step is the establishment of “Kommissionen für Ethik der Forschung” (KEF, Research Ethics Committees) which are the first contact points for all scientists. In addition, beyond the institutions, all opportunities must be exploited to raise awareness of the dual-use problem in research"

Figure 1 The H-NMR spectra of DMAP (top), GMA (middle) and the storage water                                         (bottom) do not show any overlap. This shows that the final dextran gel does not                                         contain any toxic DMAP or GMA.
Waste production
Hydrogel synthesis
Only aqueous waste is produced during the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and the polymerisation                             into a hydrogel. Aqueous waste is water with small amounts of organic molecules dissolved in it.                             In our case these are organic molecules are the solvent DMSO, DMAP, unreacted GMA and methacrylated                             dextran, NaOH, HCl, synthesis byproducts and byproducts formed during the radical polymerisation                             (including unreacted methacrylated dextran). None of the waste products can be recycled due to                             dilution or contamination with other compounds.
Especially during dialysis, a large amount of aqueous waste is generated. Approximately 50 liters                             of aqueous waste is produced for 80 mL of hydrogel. The amount of waste can be drastically reduced                             by changing using a smaller dialysis volume. We used a dialysis volume of 4 litres to accelerate                             the dialysis. If a smaller volume would be used and equilibrium between the dialysis bag and the                             medium is established each time, we expect that we can halve the amount of waste, at the cost of a                             longer purification duration.
After use
The dextran-GMA hydrogel is biodegradable and is therefore safe to use in ecological environments.                             The bacteria are equipped with a kill switch which will also kill the bacteria after the patch                             has served its function and is thrown away. In this fashion waste production is kept at a minimum.
Costs
We are using a dextran hydrogel for our system. Medical-grade dextran is expensive. However, the                             production of one hydrogel only requires small quantities (100 μg). Therefore, the estimated                             dextran costs for making one 400 μL hydrogel in patch form is around €0,65. Adding other reagents                             will bring the total costs to approximately €1,00 for one hydrogel in small scale conditions.                             These costs can be optimized by upscaling. Modifying the bacteria is a one-time expenditure.                             Afterwards they can be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be                             performed on a large scale. Costs of medium are very low."

I'm working as a post-doc with Prof. Blank at RWTH Aachen University. In my Ph.D. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Schmid (2008-2012) at TU Dortmund, and Prof. Matthias Reuss (2009-2011) at the University of Stuttgart, with a focus on elucidating the link between the central and aromatic metabolism of P. putida using a systems biology approach.
I'm fascinated about understanding the collective behavior of microorganisms and their metabolic potential in different niches. In my research, I use tools in metabolic engineering & systems biology such as metabolomics, fast sampling, kinetic/dynamic modeling and metabolic flux analysis.
In iGEM, I enjoy working with a group of young scientists from Aachen to achieve our common goal of detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa on hard surfaces. Besides science, I try to get myself involved in adventurous sports...but honestly... I just like to relax my day with a delicious meal and a good sci-fi movie!

I am working as a Subgroup Leader in Prof. Schwaneberg research group at the Institute of Biotechnology, RWTH Aachen.  The research area of the Schwaneberg group focuses on directed protein evolution by developing novel methods for generating diversity at the gene level, analyzing consequences of mutational biases on the protein level and developing novel high-throughput screening systems that will lead to improved biocatalysts for prominent applications in industry. In particular, my core expertise is development of high throughput screening systems for different enzyme classes in order to redefine the screening step no longer as bottleneck in directed evolution.
In iGEM, I enjoyed very much to work with highly motivated and ambitious young scientists from RWTH Aachen University. I truly believe that our collaboration has just started and that we will enjoy jointly solving the scientific challenges in the near future.

The fluorescence value of the second group is higher than that of the first group of arabinose-only control group and the fourth group of blank control group. It indicates that the fatty acid operon plays a role, and the third group only adds fatty acids to produce fluorescence values, which may cause fluorescence leakage.
We are very grateful to TUST_China for helping us complete the experiment of measuring fluorescence, and have obtained good experimental data, which has advanced the progress of our experiments. At the same time, in addition to the experiment, the two teams often exchanged ideas on WIKI and other aspects to promote common progress. It is a great pleasure to work with TUST_China and hope that the friendship between the two teams will last for a long time.
Detailed information about the team-TUST can be found in the here: TUST_China.

What help did we give them?
After introducing the gene plasmid containing GroES and GroEL into DH5α strain, UESTC-China verified that the growth of the recombinant strain was significantly better than that of the original strain at 1% butanol concentration. However, the single experiment was not convincing, so UESTC-China invited us to repeat the experiment to ensure the repeatability of the experiment.
We helped UESTC-China measure the effect of the expression of the GroESL gene on butanol tolerance in the DH5α strain. The effect of positive and negative samples of UESTC-China on butanol tolerance was measured. (The positive sample is E. coli DH5α with the GroESL gene introduced, and the negative sample is the DH5α wild type strain).
The measured data of the Abs600 within 24 hours are as follows:
What did they help us?
One of the keys to our experiment was the ability to construct a plasmid of interest. The operon and the vector plasmid we constructed are the key to this step. The ends of the operon are BglII and XhoI digested ends, respectively, which are complementary to the vector plasmid.
Thereafter, we performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a 16 degree reaction for 5 to 6 hours. Thereafter, we transformed the enzyme-ligated plasmid into E. coli top10 strain and observed its growth (the AMP resistance gene was carried on the vector plasmid to confer selectivity)."

Additionally, we asked for suggestions and things to consider when molding our project. Dr. Mendelson proposed that we carry out risk analysis to evaluate the chances of our therapeutic working and weighing the risks and benefits of this delivery system. He also advised us to be specific about what genes we are trying to target while remaining cautious. “Antibiotic Resistance isn’t just because of genes. Superbugs have multiple resistance mechanisms, disabling the genes doesn’t mean it’ll surefire die.”
Takeaway: Our conversation with Dr. Mendelson helped us be more considerate with the language we use when referring to antimicrobial resistance. When talking about antibiotics, this website only uses the terms ""antibiotic resistant"" or ""drug resistant infection""; according to Dr. Mendelson, most of the population can understand these terms, a first step to combating AR worldwide. Dr. Mendelson also convinced us to carry out risk analysis for our protein delivery approach.  .
Interview with Dr. London
Dr. London is a WGN radio correspondent and currently resides in rural Maine. Dr. London practices general medicine and is active in healthcare policy. Dr.London recently made news as she devised a reusable epinephrine autoinjector to combat Epipen’s controversial price increase.
Dr. London emphasized the importance of physician-patient relationships and public health policy to lowering the rate of antibiotic overuse. Hospitals are essentially hotbeds of bacteria, more so than individual physician practices. People without insurance (due to de funding) also have the tendency to wait until things are bad before rushing to the emergency room, where carers unfamiliar with the patient prescribe antibiotics “just in case” the problem is a bacterial infection, which it's often not.  Dr. London believes our project is a clever idea, as antibiotic resistance must be attacked on all fronts with as many new ideas possible. The onus, however, lies with us to educate the public about gene editing, which often sounds like a dangerous idea to the average citizen.
Takeaway: We tried to take Dr.Londons emphasis on educating the average citizen that genetically modified does not inherently correspond to something negative. For example, while presenting to CTD students, we made an “ethical consideration slide” that balanced the pros and cons of potential genetic engineering applications. Projects such as experimental mosquito (i.e to fight Zika) or GMO foods often get a bad rep in the media, but have many positives such as disease eradication and feeding hungry populations.

In the figures are the FACS test results of our parts., which are EBFP2 without and with intein respectively. The EBFP-A signals tell us that the split florescent proteins could fuse together and emit florescent light.
Without Dox, constructs containing CMV show no florescent signal, which means that one single N- or C- terminal cannot light up. However, once the other half is induced, they bind and emit light.
This serves as an excellent reporter system. We can co-express EBFP2N:IntN and EBFP2C:IntC with target proteins A and B respectively. Only when both A and B are expressed, EBFP2 signal can be conveniently detected by flow cytometry or microscopy. If either A or B is not present, EBFP2 stays in darkness. Therefore, we can easily put our hands on the information about A and B’s expression states.
Although our program is a fundamental one and have no specific practical application in our minds beforehands, our work unexpectedly produces useful tool for genetic research. This is a footnote of the unpredictable and fascinating character of science."

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," with the lab work of constructing the intron system, progress was made at our lab towards implementing a framework for measuring relative fluorescence of cell cultures, using the protocol described by Kelly et al. (8). Such measurements are necessary in order to quantify the notion of intron efficiency developed in our model.
Work on this project is ongoing. The steps taken this summer were:
  • identification and acquisition of appropriate materials and equipment access
  • training of four undergraduate students, separate from the main lab project, in essential lab techniques
  • test-running the protocol and troubleshooting errors.
Once a quantification system is successfully implemented, our team will be also be equipped to begin making measurements of many other registry parts, according to the RPU standard proposed by Kelly et al. (8). Our vision is for RPU quantification of existing registry parts to be a standard component of UW iGEM's yearly activities, beginning with constitutive promoters and expanding into measurements of more complex devices.

“Academic build their knowledge step by step, but a biohacker may not have that structure of knowledge - they have gaps here and there, so their knowledge isn't so well organized.”
Community-level Outcome
“It can bring a community together, people that wouldn't normally meet, by fostering a sense of common interest.”
How would you describe your overall experience?
“I really enjoyed it. I wish I had spent more time doing it because it was learning experience for me as well as for them.”
“We were mutual teachers; [he] asked lots of questions on biology, but I asked him lots about electronics.”
“It was eye opening!”
Biohackers
What new skills / knowledge did you gain?
“Specifically, equipment hygiene.”
“It’s not just about curiosity for scientists, they also need to be disciplined .”
“I found the experience of [the workshop experiments] not working very positive because that happens [in the Hackspace] a lot and it's nice to know that also happens with other people. If it goes right, you just followed procedure but didn't gain understanding but with troubleshooting you learn… so we got a lot out of that exercise.”
Which existing skills did you develop further?
“Interpreting… using controls, positive, negative controls on tests, so you know what you did wrong.”
What did you learn about working in an academic lab?
“One of the instructors said, when students do [similar experiments] it takes a month to get it done, but because we were biohackers and wanted to do this, learning stuff was faster, because we were all passionate and learned faster.”
“Some of the striking differences that I come across are"

Sporulation Tuning
The bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, used in our project is a gram-positive soil bacterium that, under certain conditions, would commit itself to a developmental pathway leading to the production of spores.(Predich, M., et al; 1992) Therefore, in this section of our project, we hope to control sporulation in our bacterial population, such that we can decide how much of the population becomes spores, and how much continue as vegetative cells. Should the cell sporulate, it would become a ‘metal container’, trapping the sequestered cadmium in its spore.
After the cell sequesters cadmium into its spore, it should not germinate or the sequestered cadmium will be released back into the environment as a result. Therefore, the role of chassis comes into play, where the sleB and cwlJ germination-defective mutants are put into use.
In order to control sporulation, our team is proposing the idea of inducing the synthesis of KinA, with IPTG as a sporulation initiation signal.
Chassis
Since the main aim of our project is to sequester cadmium in the environment into the spores of our engineered B. subtilis, but what happens after the cadmium has been sequestered?
Do we attempt to retrieve the sequestered cadmium? Or, do we simply leave the sequestered cadmium in the spores of our engineered B. subtilis?
For our project, we have chosen the latter. We will not be attempting to retrieve the sequestered cadmium. However, then comes the question of, would there not be chances of the cadmium entering the environment again?
Our solution to this question would be to disable germination of the spores, thus retrieval of the sequestered cadmium becomes unnecessary, as the spores can persist intact for thousands of years.
While we would like to disable germination for the spores that contain sequestered cadmium, not all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that we still have some cells germinating, so that our population of"

Positive Control
OxyR Promoter Results Our OxyR results were inconclusive. Despite documentation in the literature about the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducible promoters katG, hemH and soxS, we were unable to produce consistent results demonstrating their usefulness as ROS sensors. The results of our final assay can be seen in the graphs below:
5 hour readings
The graphs represent (from bottom to top) the OD, the raw fluorescence, and the normalized fluorescence (fluorescence/OD). The clustered lines on the bottom of the graphs are the negative controls (empty plasmid, promoter-less GFP) and a positive control for fluorescence. The top lines are the final versions of our katG promoters controlling GFP expression. The horizontal axis is ROS concentration, which increases from left to right.
As can be seen, there is no significant increase in fluorescence with increased hydrogen peroxide concentration.
SoxS Promoter Results Over the summer, we built an ROS sensor using the SoxR promoter which we never tested with paraquat. After Indiana, we came home and tested it using paraquat, with great results. Unlike team UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil , our device doesn't include the SoxR protein, expressed under a constitutive promoter, but works just fine with the natural levels of SoxR present in the wild-type E. coli strain we used (K12). As can be seen, there is some basal fluorescence in the SoxR knockout strain, but it is obvious that SoxR is the major activating factor in this super-oxide sensor. Also, unlike the UNICAMP_EMSE team, our sensor reached peak fluorescence at 20 uM paraquat concentrations, rather than 40 uM.
Each sample was run in triplicate, and the averaged ODs and fluorescence values are displayed in the graph. The raw OD and fluorescence are shown below, and the normalized fluorescence (Fluorescence / OD) is shown above. These data points were taken 3.5 hours after inducing with paraquat.
We are very pleased that the soxS promoter works as a super-oxide sensor without producing extra SoxR protein within the cell. It is also interesting to note that with this construct, the fluorescence peaks at 20 uM rather than 40 uM of paraquat.
Overall Results The AND gate function was very successful when using pBAD in place of the OxyR-inducible promoters. pBAD worked as an ""arabinose sensor"" which demonstrated proof of concept. We were very pleased with the range of thermosensors we produced. The variety offers flexibility to"

The results were promising with colonies growing on the plates. A digest, however, was still required check the results.

Sequencing results sent off in week 4 were received and were analysed using a sequence alignment tool.
ELJ both forward and reverse sequences were fine as expected as they were joined last year. The sequence of MZH+WK did not provide conclusive results, with most of the sequence not matching to the corresponding template. Analysis of TB-Cut created confusion with regards to which template we should actually be using to complete the sequence analysis. The analysis of TB-cut still needed to be confirmed.
While attempting to analyse the sequencing results, 3A assembly was used to ligate ELJ+TB (operon 2 and 3). This was transformed into E. coli (both commercial and competent cells) and plated onto LB agar plates with the corresponding antibiotic to the antibiotic resistance in the backbone.
OP+QR transformant colonies from were cultured, the plasmids extracted, digested and checked on a gel.

Ligation products of OP+QR (2727bp), C+A (2713bp) were tested using digest check to see if products were of expected size corresponding to the backbone and composite part. Results were as expected for the ligation of OP+QR. The results for C+A suggest that the ligation of these parts did not work.

Breaking the Ice
Once the team was created, we decided to set up an informal event where we would have the chance to get to know each other. We met up for pizza, beer, and wine at the university. Being at the beginning of the project, these hours were very important for us to bond.
BBQ at Ostenfeld Dormitory
After a long day brainstorming and working on our project strategy in the office, we met for a well-deserved BBQ at the courtyard of one of the dorms at the university campus.
Trip to Delft and Amsterdam
This year’s European iGEM Meetup was held in Delft, the Netherlands from the 7th to 8th of July. We took this opportunity not only to bond with other iGEM teams and discuss about our projects, but also to relax from the hard working days in the lab during the summer. Before going back to Denmark, we also spent one day in Amsterdam sightseeing.
The Great DTU BioBuilders Bakeoff
Designing a different kind of team building activity, we organized an event where the team was split in subgroups that competed to create the best cake. The team that made the most tasteful cake was announced as the winner of the great DTU Biobuilders bake-off.
Goodbye Lunch for Aleksander
One of our team members, Aleksander, had to leave earlier for the States, as he was going for a semester abroad. Thus, we decided to have a lunch to say goodbye to him and arranged to meet him again in Boston for the Giant Jamboree!
Visit to Terrariet Reptile Zoo
We were very excited when we discovered that one of the snakes, Bitis gabonica, with which we are working in the project could be found in a reptile zoo, here in Denmark. For this reason, part of our team planned a day trip to visit the Terrariet Reptile Zoo.

3) In our model, we ignored that E.Coli do not travel in straight line during run, but take curved paths due to unequal firing of flagella.
4) Our model did not consider the size changing and dividing of bacteria. And the tendency of bacteria congregate into small area due to qurum sensing is also ignored.
Model Designing
In chemotaxis, receptors sensing an increase in the concentration of chemoattractant send a signal that suppresses tumbling, and, simultaneously, the receptor becomes more highly methylated. Conversely, a decrease in the chemoattractant concentration increases the tumble frequency and causes receptor demethylation. The tumbling frequency is approximately 1 Hertz, and decreased to almost zero as he bacteria move up a chemtoatic gradient [5].
In the model, the bacteria should be able compare the chemoattractant concentration at current point to the concentration at previous second. If the concentration decreases (i.e. C_t1-C_t2  ≤0), the bacteria will tumble with frequency 1 Hertz. If the concentration increases (C_t1-C_t2  >0), the tumble frequency decreases, and hence the probability of tumbling decreases. From equation 10 in ref [6], we known that even if C_t1-C_t2  >0, the probability of tumbling could decreases to 39%. Therefore, we can conclude the above description into the following statement [8]:
Chemotaxis of bacteria population under laboratory conditions
Under laboratory condition, the chemoattractant diffuses from the source, hence the distribution pattern of chemoattratctant changes with time. In this case, error function (Equation 2) was used to describe the non-steady chemoattractant distribution. The simulation of chemotaxis of 100 bacteria placed 6cm away from the 5mM malate is shown in the movie below.
Chemotaxis of bacteria population in Soil
Malate is used as the chemoattractant in our project, the malate is constantly secreted in the root tip, and the concentration is 0.3mM[9]. In this case, the malate source is always replenished due to continuous secretion from the root tip, the distribution pattern can be considered as steady (i.e. independent of time), and steady state Keler-Segel model was used to demonstrate this distribution (Equation 3 and Equation 5). The distribution was displayed in Figure 7.  And Figure 8 shows the position"

Library of functional acids
In our project, the regulation sub-system is constructed to adjust the microenvironment pH by synthesis of acid and alkali. These chemicals can be secreted outside the bacteria and thus change the microenvironment pH. A library for acid synthesis is established and the following kinds of acid are included: lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, succinate, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, we can apply different genes in the regulation sub-system according to various situations or wide-ranging needs.
○ Lactic acid[Expand]
L-Lactic acid, one of the most important chiral molecules and organic acids, is produced via pyruvate from carbohydrates in diverse microorganisms catalyzed by an NAD+-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase [1]. The ldhA gene is used in the synthesis of lactic acid. This gene encodes an L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) which converts pyruvate to L-lactate [2]. The simple pathway of lactic acid synthesis is shown in the figure below:
○ Formic acid[Expand]
Formic acid is a signature fermentation product of many obligate and facultative anaerobes [3-5]. One core enzyme, pyruvate formate-lyase 1[6], is applied to the synthesis of Formic acid. This enzyme work only under anaerobic condition. The figure below shows a simple pathway of formic acid synthesis:
○ Acetic acid[Expand]
In synthesis of acetic acid, two enzymes, phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) [7] and acetate kinase A (ackA) [8] are used. Phosphate acetyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:
Substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and phosphate, whereas its two products are CoA and acetyl phosphate [9-11]. ackA can facilitate the production of acetyl-CoA"

Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and other bacteria. It has been showed that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing, interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA. Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.
When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9. During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.

If the protein inserted is unstable it will be degraded by the cell and the Gal4-VP16 transcriptional activator will no longer function. If a quantifiable marker protein such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is under Gal1 then the level of GFP output of the cell is related to the stability of the inserted protein.
Our collection of three parts consists of a degron, the test plasmid containing the GAL4-VP16 transactivator, and a construct used in evolving our protein for higher GFP.With those two parts alone, BBa_K1408001 and BBa_K1408002, users can use BioBrick cloning or PCR to generate ALL 5 test constructs: Deg0, Deg1, Deg2, Deg3, and Deg4. We chose to submit these parts separately to allow future users the utmost freedom in designing a specific test construct for their specific protein of interest.

Conclusion and Results
Expected results correlate with the genetic design found on the Experiments page. To recapitulate, the full construct contained the LacI repressor system, which initially impeded the promotion of sequence, ClpXP CI, located downstream of pLac; upon IPTG induction, LacI, when encountered by the chemical, exhibited repression as IPTG molecules bound to Lac repressor proteins. This inhibition allowed promotion of the latter portion of our construct: pLac ClpXP CI. Because of ClpXP’s activation, the transcribed protein was able to recognize the middle portion of our construct containing an SsrA tag attached to tsPurple and, thereby, degrade our reporter chromoprotein. In addition, the CI (competitive inhibitor), was able to bind and inhibit pλR, obstructing the promotion of tsPurple. Therefore, the working construct would supply us with a concentration of translated tsPurple dependant upon the strength of the attached degradation tag (LAA, DAS or no tag present); color expression would then persist inconstancy as the CI repressed the excess promotion of tsPurple. Following the workflow, we then would have transformed our constructs into varied Keio Knockout and Wild strains in order to validate the functional portions of ClpXP. Concluding the institution of our genetic parts into Keio strains, the inoculation of colonies - using the refined methodology demonstrated in our Model and Demonstrate pages- into triplicate trials of 0M, 10 uM, 100 uM, 500 uM, and 1mM concentrations of IPTG, with antibiotic Luria broth as our solvent, would provide us with enriched data to then utilize our Chrome-Q. From calculated HSV color values, it is predicted that as IPTG concentration increase then the hue values will decrease. Hue is measured from 0 to 360 degrees; lower magnitude hue values indicate darker spectrum colors and higher magnitude hue values indicate lighter spectrum colors. Although we are using the HSV color model we decided to omit saturation values. Because saturation measures opacity/ transparency and the data collected will range from a purple to yellow (non-expressive cells) coloration, then calculations of opacity are ineffectual. Finally, value, synonymous to the term “lumin"

In the cloning process, traditional digest-ligate workflow and homology recombination techniques are used. We are working on constructing the vector recently. Identifying the fusion dCas9 protein could be successfully expressed and verifying its biological function will be our next step.
The origin pdCas9 offer by Haiyan Liu's lab at University of Science and technology of China was called as p-GFP-dCas9-VVD in the following. Sequencing Independent Ligation Coloning (SILC) was used for adding 6×His tag and deleting GFP and VVD coding sequence.
Primer A is design to PCR a 4kb fragment which contains TcR and rop sequence. Primer B is supposed to generate a 6kb fragment which contains ori-ara/ pBAD promoter-dCas9 coding sequence (from 5’ terminal to 3’ terminal), meanwhile, 6x His-Tag is also added to the N-terminal of dCas9 coding sequence. (Primer A and Primer B are both represent one pair of primers, which contain homologous sequence for recombination for 15-20bp.)
The electrophoretogram of ligation result is shown as follows.
The Functional Test
The basic circuit T7-sgRNA (J23100)-J23100-GFP-pSB1C3 is a minimal circuit built to verify whether our dCas9/ sgRNA system can function well. sgRNA (J23100) is short for the small guide RNA which are designed to target the J23100 promoter specifically. he basic circuit and the vector of dCas9 are in two backbones. To confirm our dCas9/ sgRNA regulatory system is feasible, we choose to co-transform these two plasmids into the E. coli BL21 strain at the same time.
In this circuit, sgRNA (J23100) is controlled by a T7 promoter without lac operon (which is equal to a constitutive promoter) and GFP is controlled by J23100 promoter, therefore their expression is both sustainable. In the dCas9 circuit, the expression of dCas9 is under the control of ara/ pBAD promoter, so the arabinose is a trigger to the inhibition effect of GFP expression in whole system. If the expression of GFP is significantly suppressed after inducer added, it is fair enough to demonstrate that our dCas9 protein and sgRNA present their biological function successfully.
We tried to use electro-transformation to co-transform these two plasmids ("

Since the attendance fee is so expensive and we already paid a large fee for the team to participate we will not be able to take everyone to Boston. We have enough money to send 5 or 6 team members only. Finally, we created a “To Do” list to help everyone stay on track as the new semester begins.
August 26, 2014
We reviewed Johanna’s draft concept map, timeline, and list of “parking lot” ideas. We reviewed Elizabeth’s draft theoretical framework. Jennifer Kuzma conducted a systems mapping exercise with the group to build upon Johanna’s draft. We reviewed the tasks and deadlines from the To Do list. We finalized the list of Jamboree attendees. They will be Elizabeth, Emily, Jen Baltzegar, Barry, Rene, and Johanna. Scripts for the video are due August 29. We will have a video review meeting on September 25 to provide comments and ask for revisions from Brad. Brad will send final video by October 1. We ended the meeting with a long discussion about tweaking the tool to be more general than just for the Glowing Plant and incorporating an algorithm into it to make it more quantitative than qualitative. We divided up sections and will have a draft concept map due by the next meeting based on our previous group writings.
September 8, 2014
We discussed logistics about filming on September 9. We reviewed several software packages that could allow us to create the document that we have envisioned, however none have exactly the capability that we want. We may have to make do with a combination of one of the packages and an excel spreadsheet or database form. Our next step is to develop an explanation of how the tool will work for users. We need to include an explanation of what it is, how it works, the rationale behind it, and finally use the glowing plant as an example. We also need to compile the maps into a single document, Jayce will take the lead on this. Finally, we updated the To Do list and planned our next meeting.

Discovery of Aequorin
One day in the fall of 1960, shortly after my arrival at Princeton from Japan, Dr. Frank Johnson showed me a small jar containing a spoonful of white powder. He explained that the powder was a freeze dried “squeezate” made from the luminous jellyfish Aequorea, and that it would emit light when mixed with water. He asked me if I would be interested in studying the bioluminescence of this jellyfish. The powder did not emit any light when moistened. But I was quite impressed by Dr. Johnson’s description of the brilliant luminescence of live jellyfish and the great abundance of specimens around Friday Harbor, Washington. So my response was a definite “yes.” My experience in bioluminescence research at the time was meager and limited to only the luminescent system of the ostracod Cypridina. I imagined, vaguely, that the jellyfish would probably contain a kind of luciferin and a luciferase, possibly with one of the cofactors, such as ATP, FMN, or NADH, like the fireflies, luminous bacteria, and Cypridina that were known at that time.
In the early summer of 1961, we traveled from Princeton to Friday Harbor in Dr. Johnson’s station wagon, which he had newly purchased for the excursion. The car was fully loaded with necessary equipment and chemicals, including a MacNichol integrating photometer of gigantic size (a two-foot cube), and four travelers (my wife and Yo Saiga, an assistant, came along) with all of their baggage on"

SCAU-CHINA
It’s quite admiring for the outstanding performance of SCAU-CHINA last year in iGEM. This year, we are very pleasant to reach out to them and got several meet-ups during the whole year. We exchanged our ideas on plenty of aspects such as the importance and the tendency of Synthetic Biology, the experience on running a well-organized team and so on. We managed to collaborate on holding a synthetic biology meeting on their campus and introduced our software to the public. Additionally, we also visited their lab and guide them to tried our S-DIN project for search and design process. They shared the same concern with us on the information integration matter and gave us positive feedbacks on the user-friendliness aspect and our simulation functions. For their next year project, they said they will use our software for the pre-brainstorm inspiration and the design process in order to save plenty of time for detouring around aimlessly.

3. Orange Book/FDA
We also considered patents without single chain insulin to identify whether existing commercial / FDA products involved patented methods eg. storage etc., that may be broad enough to include insulin analogues like Winsulin.
Looking through the Orange Book, a drug database showing all products that have been approved -  including their therapeutic equivalences, our team searched through all 101 entries that involved insulin to determine whether or not we would fall under a patent here.
Search Method
All 101 patents were collated it in an excel data table (right: screenshot of excel data sheet) and formatted with Y/N based on their expiry date. We then picked out all the patents (green) in force and ordered them by their relevant associated patents and their associated claims.

Comic
The comic below is the result of a collaboration between the artist Johanne Holm and members of the SpaceMoss team. The comic attempts to describe the vision and methods of our project in Johanne's unique visual style.
SpaceMoss and the Space Man
SpaceMoss was present at the lecture given by recently returned Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen at the UCPH ball room, and our comics were a hit with the attending crowds. Everybody wanted one and we were trying desperately to keep up with demand.
One very cool moment, early on, was to hear the minister of science exclaim ’SpaceMoss! I’ve heard of you guys!’ upon receiving his copy!
The lecture was amazing, and we were all stoked to hear the first-hand account of Andreas’ trip to the ISS, a mere five days after he’d returned. There were lots of good questions from the audience, including questions from each attending member of SpaceMoss. Upon asking how long he thought it’d be before we saw a human on Mars, Andreas replied that it’s hard to tell, but if everybody got behind it, we could get there in maybe 15 years. ‘Technologically’, he said (and we’re paraphrasing from memory), ‘we’re closer to Mars now, than the Apollo was to the moon, when they first set out’.
After the lecture, there were refreshments and mingling, and one SpaceMoss’er stuck around long enough to be treated to a relaxed conversation with the man himself about which steps to take in order to be considered for astronaut training, given his current background. At that same conversation, Andreas took great interest in our project, wanting to know technical details and how far we’ve progressed.
All in all a very cool experience for all of us, and Andreas left with a smile - and a SpaceMoss comic tucked safe in his pocket.

""First of all would you pack the spoilage detector in the food packages before being purchased by   consumers? Or would you have a spoilage detector for individual consumer's detection for   example after opening of the food package? Would it be safe to use? How about disposal? Regarding the iGEM Groningen design in 2012: How would you make an applicable, useful and   simple detector for food e.g. in the fridge? If you put your detector into the fridge at time 0, how   fast would you know if the food is spoiled or not, regarding the design of your detector. E.g.   bacteria based detector needs bacteria to grow and produce certain compound resulting in the   detectable colour. Would the lower temperature have an effect on the time of compound   production and therefore the spoilage detection? For the best results at the competition, rethink   and discuss your application strategy with as many people as possible. Take the critique of the   design and try to make it better. Be prepared to answer all of those questions and to defend your   application design at the Jamboree (judges are very straightforward with the questions). Good   luck with the project!

Today, we made our second attempt at making the buffer solution for the recovery of the spores sent to us by Anne Moir from Sheffield University. We also decided to prepare the plates for plating out the sleB and cwlJ spores.
James about to pipette 10ul of anti-foam into the frothy LB solution
As Dr. Phil Aldrige's lab did not have stock of Em which is required, Em was borrowed from Prof. Colin Harwood's lab. On the 4th of August , the buffer solution was prepared , however it was prepared wrongly, and therefore remade again today. For the buffer solution, as seen in the protocol for Method A , MgCl is required and a stock solution has already been made for it. However, upon inspection, we realised that the MgCl stock solution has been contaminated, probably due to the fact that it was made several years ago, and thus we made a new 0.05M stock solution of MgCl. A stock solution of 1M KCl was already kindly made by someone else from Dr. Phil Aldrige's lab, and thus we made up the last required solution, 0.1M stock solution of Potassium Phosphate. The stock solutions we prepared were then sent for autoclaving.

We decided to pour 500ml of LB with Em and Kan. We were earlier taught how to pour 1 litre of media correctly, and were confident in doing so. However, we failed to realise that at half the amount during practice, we should not let the LB + agar media cool to too low a temperature. Therefore, when we mixed the cooled DI Water with the LB + agar media, the solution solidified. However,"

Tjerkje is studying higher professional education livestock farming. She helps her dad on his dairy farm.
Insights
Udder infection (mastitis) is a long-standing disease at dairy farms.
Farmers want a faster method to determine which antibiotics to use to treat mastitis if the default antibiotic does not work and if she can do the test herself she would like to, to save costs of the veterinarian.
Changes
Meet the values fast and cheap
Meet user-friendliness based on the farmer as potential user
Summary
Tjerkje said the most common diseases on the farm are utter infection and claw disorders. The farmers treat udder infection (mastitis) themselves. For this they have antibiotics that they are allowed to inject in the cows. Most of the times this works, but sometimes it does not, then they have to call the veterinarian. They try to do most things by themselves to prevent high bills from the vet. With mastitis they then have to hand in milk for an antibiotic resistance test, this test takes 2-3 days until results come in on which antibiotics to use. Tjerkje wants a faster method and if she can do the test herself she would like to to save costs of the veterinarian.

Summary
Gerbrich studies animal sciences. She told us that E. Coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus agalactiae are the most common pathogens in livestock farming. Giving preventive antibiotics is not allowed anymore, the rules to prescribe antibiotics are quite strict in the Netherlands for the dairy sector. Every year the veterinarian composes a plan together with the farmer, for which antibiotics are allowed to use for which illnesses. When a farmer wants to deviate from this plan the veterinarian needs to have a written declaration. Every antibiotics used needs to be registered. A farmer can thus inject the antibiotics himself, the challenge is that while farmers are trying to reduce antibiotic usage, on the other hand, if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in"

Faced with the setting sun, leaning against the glass, the little prince recalled the lively day he spent with the five guys. “If only she was as happy as the flowers I saw today.” The little prince said to himself. Beauty exists in the world all the time. With a smile on his face, the little prince got to sleep. That night he had a dream in which he danced with his rose.

As a long-time fan of Winnie the Pooh and my stuffed animal collection, I was drawn to the idea that CRISPR could be used to make new creatures! And maybe even living versions of some of my favourite stuffed animals like a teddy bear (as real bears are dangerous and not safely huggable).  After some deliberation I came to the realization that CRISPR designed teddy bears might not be the most logical of goals in life, but all the research I had done toward it spurred my interest in synthetic biology and eventual life-long dedicated commitment to iGEM. After several years of being a part of both the high school and collegiate teams, I am happily back for another year of enjoyable torture.

The alcohol dehydrogenase from Pichia pastoris subsequently converts nootkatol into nootkatone by oxidation. It uses NAD+ as a cofactor which is reduced in the reaction. The regeneration of this cofactor is facilitated by the BM3, which oxidizes NADH Schulz et al. (2015) .
Figure 7.6: ADH lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.7: structure Nootkatone
The first milestone to achieve our goal is the separate integration of each of our three enzymes ValS, BM3 and ADH into level 1 vectors (Dueber Toolbox) in yeast and to verify their expression by Western Blot analysis. Therefore, a 3xFlag/6xHis-tag was added to the N-terminus of each of the proteins.  It enables us to use an anti-His antibody followed by an anti-mouse-antibody to make protein abundances visible. Subsequently, the two enzymes ADH and ValS were combined in a  level 2 cassette plasmid.  BM3 is designed as a level 1 plasmid and will be co-expressed with the level 2 plasmid to achieve a nootkatone production. The expression of the enzymes in the cytoplasm is again verified by Western Blot analysis.   The further approach aims to provide the enzymes with C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals type one, which finally converts the nootkatone pathway into our artificial compartment.
Since the production of nootkatone does not lead to a change of colour we need to apply different methods for verifying substrates. Once we succeed with the qualitative validation via Western Blot analysis, we can verify the presence of nootkatone by using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively.
Model influence on Nootkatone expression
We modeled the nootkatone biosynthesis pathway using ordinary differential equations in order to optimize nootkatone production. We found two hard and an"

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is important to realize that the problem does not exist in a vacuum; it exists because the real world imposes some sort of constraint (technical, environmental, social, etc.) that prevents the solution from being implemented in an ideal manner. Although there are several different types of constraints, as mentioned above, we encouraged ourselves and future teams to first nail down the specific technical constraints that exist.
There are several different approaches to constraint determination. Focusing on the values that are important to you as an individual and to your entire time can help guide your decision-making process.   Stakeholder identification can also dictate who you should talk and about the topic of discussion; a stakeholder is defined as anyone who may be impacted by your activity or may be impacted by someone who is directly impacted by your activity. As a diagnostics team, our challenge was to bridge the gap in communication between engineers and medical professionals: to address this, we spoke with healthcare professionals, synthetic biologists, academia, industry professionals and executives over the course of our project. Our initial interactions focused on the technical challenges of designing our methodology, especially the need for a non-invasive cancer detection technology that did not rely on chemical treatment.
Develop
After defining the technical parameters of the project, it is important to consider to see how this actually impacts the solution development aspect of one’s project. Often times, teams already have a pre-conceived notion for the problem space they are trying to address. In order to clear the barriers for innovation, it is of utmost importance that the team begin to shape this unrefined idea after each of the initial stakeholder interactions rather than prior.
Development can also be split into two cyclic elements:
Modeling and Visualizations
Modeling is everyone’s best friend, especially an iGEM team’s because it allows for further characterization of a part, device, or a system before actually using resources to build it. For us, it was important to be able to visualize the development of our solution to make sure it fit into the technical parameters that we had determined beforehand. Diagnostics teams can use modeling to check for the validity of their project via a bottom-top approach: protein modeling and an understanding of Michaelis - Menten kinetics can help provide validity of genetic circuit design; further modeling can characterize an entire system (i.e. if a team is developing components for a microfluidic device), and also provide an ecosystem overview that demonstrates the impact of disease monitoring.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#PlasmidConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,". subtilis genome 168 trp+ and imaging under the microscope.
Integration into the genome of B. subtilis 168 trp+:
sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and pDR111+message was integrated into the B.    subtilis 168 trp+ genome. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be    integrated into the B. subtilis genome. By double cross-over it    replaces amyE gene, with desired insert, in this case insert is    Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER, which is located between amyE front    flanking region and amyE back flanking region.
Experiment set-up:
10 μl of sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and pDR111+message plasmids were    transformed into the B. subtilis 168 trp+ strain (see transformation protocol ). Selection was made on 150 μg/ml    spectinomycin LB agar plates.
Microscopy experiment set-up:
B. subtilis cells were grown overnight in 3 ml LB with 150 μg/ml    spectinomycin at 37°C and 220 rpm. On the next day microscopy slide was    prepared as explained in the following protocol . Cells    were imaged using phase contrast: filter POL 50% 1 s exposure, green    fuorescence: FITC, 0.8 s exposure, objective: Olympus 100X/1.40,    camera: CoolSNAP_HQ/HQ2-ICX285 and software: Resolve3D softWoRx-Acquire    version.
Figure 10. B. subtilis 168 trp+ cells with sfGFP     integrated into the amyE locus.
Conclusion:
Integration into the B. subtilis 168 trp+ strain of the plasmids    with the reporter sfGFP(Sp) was successful. Multiple colonies were    obtained on selection plates. B. subtilis cells were subsequently grown    and checked under the microscope to see if there is an expression of    GFP (see Figure 10). We could definitely see the GFP signal when    observing the cells under the microscope. This was big enough proof    that our plasmid construction followed by integration into the B.    subtilis genome was successful.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," with RFP. All the plasmid preps were found to be cloudy on the next day, signifying proper bacterial amplification. From the DNA nanodrop quantification, we found out that most of the preps have DNA concentration of 30 and above. Their 260/280 ratio also seemed to be within or at least close to the usual range (1.7-2.0) as well. Next, we ran these samples in gel electrophoresis.
Because there were 4 samples run for each type of composite part, it would be easy to see if any of them is a false positive. From the gel picture, all bands for each device seemed to have the expected band size. But an unexpected result came out for the pCat-GFP because only 2 samples of this type have similar band size while the other 2 are both very high and very low. Because the DNA for these samples are supercoiled, it is not possible to calculate their size just by comparing them with the DNA ladder. Nevertheless, it is still possible to measure their relative size difference from each other and that is what I did to determine which pCat-GFP samples can be kept. After doing this step, I performed restriction mapping. This step is done by obtaining one sample for each device type and prepare three small samples out of it: uncut, single cut, and double cut. The uncut serves as the control. The single cut aims to confirm the overall biobrick size because the DNA won't be supercoiled and thus its size can be measured based on its position using the DNA ladder. The double cut is meant to produce the fragment containing the complete GFP device. That way, it is possible to predict the behavior for these samples after gel extraction based on the size of backbone, insert and overall plasmid. Running these samples, I found out that all samples behaved according to our expectation except for, again, pCat-GFP; its double cut did not produce any fragment at all. Further attempt to do the same thing yielded an oversized fragment. With all these results, I decided to religate GFPc (Bba_E0240) and pCat (Bba_I14033) again.
All this time, I have been assuming that the pBad-GFP device worked well if it did not fluoresce as pBad is an arabinose-induced promoter. As long as it had a good band size in gel electrophoresis, I considered it to be a positive result. But it is important to see if pBad can indeed be induced with arabinose"

Modification of the previously described motifs within the Cry3Aa structure –Random mutagenesis of the binding sites, and
Finding specific binding motifs to the receptors within the mite gut – Phage Display
Binding Site Mutagenesis
Design
In 1996, Rajamohan et al. demonstrated that mutations in the binding sites of Cry toxins can both decrease and enhance the specificity of a toxin towards its target organism 2 . Knowing this, the 3D structure of the Cry3Aa toxin has been analysed. Three putative binding sites have been identified. These are shown in in the following table.

VWPSAVY
To mutate these binding sites, the plasmid pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS has been used as a template. This plasmid contains the gene encoding wildtype Cry3Aa toxin (B. thuringiensis var. tenebrionis, Taxonomy ID: 1444). Its expression is regulated by the arabinose inducible promotor pBAD/araC ( Bba_I0500 ). From this plasmid, three different plasmids were created with randomized sequences within the binding sites. By this we expect that each individual colony harbouring this plasmid containing an individual variants, in other words, a library of Cry3Aa proteins with randomly binding sites to be screened.
Screening
The mutants have been screened following the hightroughput procedure developed and described above . In short, random colonies were picked from each of the binding mutants (n=144) for toxin expression and from these (n=24) were selected for activity testing . As a negative control, cell free extract from empty expression strain, BL21(DE3) has been used. The in vitro toxicity assay results for these 24 tested mutants compared to the Cry3Aa expressing strain and the negative control are shown in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows a heatmap of the tested mutants' activities.

Bacto-Aid
Project
Our project face the growing problem of plastic pollution and the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bacto-Aid is a sustainable concept with bacteria aiding us. We focused on producing a bandage, consisting of recombinant spider silk integrated with antimicrobial peptides, making it preventive towards infections. The plastic, of which we wish to attach the spider silk to, is biodegradable and produced in the lab.
Bacteriocins
Spider silk
poly-β-hydroxybutyrate PHB
In order to realize our project we set out to; 1) test the antimicrobial effects of different bacteriocins on pathogenic strains of bacteria, 2) assemble a silk expressing gene-construct, and 3) optimize the PHB production. Additionally, we tried to create a hybrid silk gene-construct in which bacteriocins are incorporated in between the silk monomers.
The bacteriocins were found to be more efficient towards S. aureus than traditional antibiotics. Furthermore, we designed our own hybrid bacteriocins and proved a synergistic effect was achieved by doing so.
We worked hard in order to produce a silk construct we could purify. However, we discovered too late that our inconsistent results were probably due to expired streptavidin beads (which are crucial for the silk assembly method).
We managed to optimize the production of PHB. The incorporation of a secretion system into the plastic production, enabled us to synthesize vast amounts of PHB. Some of the produced plastic was used for 3D printing a piece of a jaw to prove the usefulness of our biodegradable plastic.
Scientific reproduction has been a cornerstone of our project from the start since we have been using other iGEM projects as basis for the development of our Bacto-Aid. We have likewise focussed on reproducibility of our own project in order to assure that the good ideas lives on.
So let’s get down to the details.

Anything beyond heavy metals?"
Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," polar amino acid? Or a non-polar, hydrophobic /-philic, charged, non-charged one?. We compared the consensus sequence with the 3D structure, using PYMOL, to extract as much information as possible, and then came up with this ideal consensus sequence:
ideal consensus sequence extracted from the consensus motif above
imposing desired functions
The next consideration we had to do was: how many Nickel do we need on the surface of our ideal Nickel binding protein, in what pattern, with what distances between, and at which angles toward each other to allow proper ion complexion? Nickel can be complexed by imidazole structures from 4 planar orthogonal directions, as well as to axial positions. It can, however, only take four ligands at once - preferably in a planar orientation. Cobalt has a bipyramidal setup for ligand-binding, too, but can take up to six ligands. The distances from an N-atom in the Imidazole ring to the ion had to be between 3 and 6 Angström. We found a crystal structure of a different protein which was resolved with three Histidines complexing a Nickel ion for a comparison, as well as some old publications that analyzed peptide ion bonds that taught us how the complex should look like. (Jordan 1974) We wanted our protein to be short. First in order to cause as little unspecific binding as possible and further to allow an easy expression as well as for keeping costs low for gene synthesis. For a proper purification of His-tagged proteins in Ni-NTA columns we knew that there are up to three Nickel involved in the interaction between the His tag (which consists of 6 or 7 Histidines) and the column. These have to be in close proximity to one another. There are always two Histidines of the tag binding to one ion.
This was what we had to implement into our LRR backbone.
To get a first impression how Histidines are positioned in a bacterial Ligase, we replaced all non conserved amino acids by Histidines and sent the sequence for a 3D sequence prediction to I-TASSER, an online structure prediction software tool.

Cell Movement in Microscopic and Macroscopic Aspect
Basically, we considered the movement of a cell  as a process of random walk, since an individual E.coli cell was always in the states between moving and tumbling  (Fig.1).Similar to Brownian particles, the random walk of E.coli followed the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory [ 1 ].
Fig . 1 Genetic circuit related to cell movementin(left) and cell random walk(right)
Firstly, for the one dimension of random  walk, let x (t) denote the position of an E.coli cell at time t, given that its position coincided with the point x=0 at time t=0. And we assumed an E.coli cell moves an average distance l—in  either the positive or negative direction of the x-axis—each step (during a time (τ) between two tumbling states). The probability that the cell was  found at the point x at time t was now equal to the probability that,  in a series of n (=t/τ)  successive moving steps, the cell made m more steps in the positive direction  of the axis than in the negative direction. The desired probability was given by  the binomial expression [ 1, 2 ]
(1.1)
To simplify equation (1.1), for m<<n, we obtain
(1.2)
Taking x to be a  continuous variable, we can obtain
(1.3)
where
,
v= l/τ was the average speed of the cell movement, and f=1/τ was the tumbling  frequency of E.coli.
In two dimensions, the square of the distance  from the origin to the point (x, y) was r2=x2+y2; therefore
For a macroscopic view, D was defined as the diffusion coefficient. For a simple diffusion process, it is easy to write an diffusion equation to describe the density ρ distribution.

Toronto,2012,Team:Toronto#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Made 1L of LB, as well as autoclaved some glassware. Only plate one from May 18 showed any bacterial growth after incubation at 4°C overnight, indicating good sterile technique during the training exercises yesterday.
SNC Lavalin, Monsanto, and New England BioLabs were contacted for funding enquiries. Approached Rob Reedijk about consolidation of financial accounts. Obtained A. thaliana seed from the McCourt lab at EEB, along with their recommended growth protocol.
  May 23
For demonstration purposes, we transformed cyan fluorescent protein from the BioBrick distribution plates with ampicillin resistance into DH5αC (competent DH5α).
  May 24
Checked the cyan fluorescent transformation, which failed. To check whether the BioBrick plasmids were compromised, or whether our technique was to blame, we will retry the transformation with another BioBrick. Ordered supplies from MedStore.
  May 25
Made kanamycin plates, and checked on the May 24 transformations, which proved to be successful. Aimed to finalise the phytase construct.
  May 28
Various sponsorship opportunities were pursued for the lab for much of the day.
2 test transformations were performed as another tutorial. Kanamycin's efficiency was tested with the following three treatments: LB; LB and DH5αC; LB, DH5αC, and K.
  May 29
Tested a 2µL/mL kanamycin overnight culture versus an LB blank on the spectrophotometer. Placed two different projects into the shaker: Project One (10mL LB; 10µL C; 20µL DH5α): LB control; LB, DH5α, and C; LB, DH5α, C, and BioBrick K414007. Project Two (10mL LB; 20µL DH5α): LB control; LB and DH5α; LB, DH5α, and 20µL K; LB, DH5α, and 25µL K; LB, DH5α, and 30µL K.
  May 30
The LB controls failed from yesterday, so the 500mL container of LB from which we took yesterday's samples was thrown out. The K414007 promoter was miniprepped using a Qiagen Plasmid Extraction Kit. Using the nanodrop, we found our extraction sample to have a density of 20ng/µL – good miniprep. Performed a transformation using K414007"

Results of Transformation efficiency, B. subtilis electroporation (2nd Trial), and RFP transformation
Results of RFP Control with Transformation Efficiency Kit testing PCR competent cells
Negative Control Plage
There weren't any colonies on the negative plate, and we got colonies on the positive plates.
We can conclude that the competent cells worked.
However, the number of colonies from plate to plate for the same concentrations weren't consistent. That may be due to inconsistent volume of competent cells in the PCR tubes.

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
