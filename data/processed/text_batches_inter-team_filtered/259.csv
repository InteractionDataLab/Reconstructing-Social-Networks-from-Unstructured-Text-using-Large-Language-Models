Arriving at the Idea
Week 9
After an in-depth literature analyzes we have gained the knowledge there currently there are two main state of the art technological solutions of biological part characterization – microwell plates and microfluidics - have both positive, but more importantly considerable negative aspects in terms of acquiring high-throughput activity and sequence linked data and seems to require completely new approaches in order to remove those negative aspects.
More
First of all, the microtiter plate technology approach offers a way to connect biomolecule sequence to activity by physically separating the biomolecule samples in physically separated plate wells. As the location of each biomolecule is known, a robot can quickly measure the activities of biomolecules in each well. Yet, the limiting factor in this case is extracting DNA template encoding the biomolecule from each well and sequencing it, while not losing the information about what activity was recorded for that particular encoded biomolecule. Therefore, as this method offers a precise way to connect sequence and function, its throughput is rather low.
On the other hand microfluidic technology approaches offers rapid biomolecule internalization into small droplets, where each droplet then works as a separate microreactor. In this way the throughput is a lot higher than in microtiter approach. For example, libraries of 109 different biomolecules can be screened in a single experiment. Yet, the problem with such approach is that even though it offers a lot higher throughput and droplets can even be specifically sorted into few different categories, once a scientist wants to sequence the DNA molecules which are contained in those, for example, 109 droplets, the droplets need to be broken. As the water droplets are broken, different biomolecule encoding DNA is mixed together, and the activity information about each particular biomolecule is lost.

Week 11
We have decided to arrange a meeting with Karolis Leonavičius from Droplet Genomics who specializes in Microfluidic Technologies and single molecule research.
More
We talked about advantages and disadvantages of microfluidic technologies as a whole and then we went on to discuss the case of our interest – biomolecule activity screening and characterization. According to Karolis, single biomolecule encapsulation in nano-sized droplets is already highly optimized and efficient. There also is a lot of research describing efficient expression of biomolecules in those droplets.

Although the researches of biofilm have focused on preventing their formation and promoting their disruption because of their significant roles in pathogenicity during a long period of time, several novel applications of biofilm have been proposed in the last decade, because their potential to be a synthetic biological platform for self-assembling functional materials has been realized and developed[3].
So, biofilms can be used to load therapeutic drugs or functional peptides, and then releasing them extracellularly, where functional peptide domains can fuse into an effectively therapeutic factor. Here, we take the EGF loaded Curli biofilm as an example to illustrate this approach.
Example: Peptide-loaded Curli biofilm
The Curli biofilms secreted dominantly by E.coli are highly robust functional amyloid nanoﬁbres with a diameter of approximately 4–7nm that exist as extended tangled networks encapsulating the cells [2].
The most important point is, Curli fibers are self-assembled by CsgA amyloid proteins, which can be engineered to fuse other functional peptide domains. Thus, we incorporate therapeutic enzymes or peptides (i.e. EGF peptide) into Curli biofilm.
Figure 1. The illustration of EGF-loaded Curli biofilm. Curli biofilms are formed from the extracellular self-assembly of CsgA amyloid proteins, which can be engineered to fuse other functional peptide domains. For instance, if the sequence of EGF peptide is cloned next to CsgA secretion sequence connected by a GSGGSG (G-Glycine, S-Serine) linker, the EGF peptides will be fused into CsgA proteins and be loaded on Curli biofilms by self-assembly of CsgA-EGF monomers, whereas EGF peptide domains are still functional, presumably.
As Figure 1 states, the linker between CsgA protein domain and EGF peptide domain can be designed as the targets of hydrolytic enzymes, which are up-regulated at sites of inflammation [3]. Thus releasing of EGF peptides would be precisely and locally concentrated, rather than entire-intestinal concentrated. Furthermore, Curli biofilm has a long-term stability, which enables sustained EGF peptide release in this way over hours or even days.
We confirmed the formation of EGF-loaded Curli biofilm through Congo Red dye (Figure 2) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 3).

√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.

When our team were design the experiment, we realize we lack of current situation of faeces testing as well as treatment of intestinal inflammation. In order to get a better understanding the current detection method and to improve our project, our team member Weihang Guo and Boxuan Li went to the clinical laboratory of navy general hospital and made an interview about testing method of intestinal inflammation in Sept 9th, 2017. Mr. Hao (the director of the laboratory) put forward some practical suggestions about our project. Moreover, her subjective view and feelings also influence us a lot. (picture of Guo Weihang and Li Boxuan)
Through the hospital interview, we consulted the current hospital's methods and procedures for stool detection. In the hospital, the examination was mainly divided into regular inspection and tissue culture. Regular inspection can only make an overall judgement which is about whether there are red or white blood on the stool and condition of stool. Tissue culture takes about 16 to 20 hours (overnight), besides, the equipment is relatively expensive and only can only detect shigella and salmonella. Additionally, if the subject has taken antibiotics those day, the result may be a false negative samples.
In the interview, we also acquire that there is a new gut detecting method which can present the situation of gut just like taking an X-ray image, but the technology is still in the stage of development and the cost is higher, therefore, our method noninvasive test of intestinal inflammatory disease is comparative and in a low price.(There is the picture when we did the interview for doctor )
In the interview, we asked the doctor's advice and found that the deficiency of our project—we are not sure when to detect the capsules since the capsules may excrete after several excretions. If all stools are collected, the efficiency will be reduced and will cause unnecessary health problems. For this point, our preliminary solution is to add some iron granule inside the capsule, and after defecation, we can insert the iron rod with strong magnetic paste into the stool for quick detection.
(The doctor was introducing the facilities to us)
Second, we cannot determine the specific position of inflammation in our gut. By asking the doctor's advice, we learn that different part of dug’s PH value is diverse. Accordingly, our initial idea is use different pigment protein to represent"

“ I’ve always been interested in ethics and whether we can say anything meaningful about it, or whether it’s all, strictly speaking, nonsense. In some ways I leaned towards the latter, but now that I find myself in a position to potentially make a difference in lives of people caught in real struggle, I feel as though I have a chance to do something good.
Patrick Philosopher
“Doing this project has allowed me to realise that biology is more than just squishy stuff; it can potentially offer solutions to many problems from space exploration to oil to world hunger. I’m really excited about starting my career and exploring the possibilities of synthetic biology, that’s how iGEM has been so transformative for a fledgling scientist like me. “

Collaboration with the Marburg team
IGEM Marburg asked us if we would like to participate in their collaboration project, which is an Interlab Study of their own design. They wanted us to measure the growth rate of the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens, by growing it in a liquid LB V2 medium and check the OD600 value every 10 minutes over a period of 5 hours. The measurements were done using spectrophotometry and we made a growth curve of V. natriegens for Marburg.
V. natriegens is a fast-growing bacterium, with a generation time around 8-10 minutes. As of today, E. coli is the commonly used laboratory bacterium, however this bacteria’s generation time is around 20 minutes. V. natriegens could potentially be a substituent as a laboratory model organism, due to their shorter generation time.
The goal of this collaboration is to investigate if the growth rate of V. natriegens is consistent between all the iGEM teams that are participating in Marburgs Interlab study. We did the growth experiment two times and obtained the growth curves illustrated in Figure 1 and 2.

Ethics
""Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and know the life science,                                  but like many developing technologies, it has provoked ethical concerns from the scientific community and the public and                                 confronts demands for new regulatory measures"". (Prof. Bracha Rager-Zisman, Department of Microbiology Immunology and Genetics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) .
Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine                                  but also poses some potential risks.
Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology. For example modifying an organism for medical purposes or                                  environmental care is still a debate in our culture. The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many                                  questions and concerns among the general public. Furthermore, similar concerns are expressed by scientists who specialized                                 in other fields of research. We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions,                                  we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology. We aimed to study the bioethical                                 issues that may arise from our project to  ensure no harm can be caused by our product.
Shimon Glick describes several ethical issues related to Synthetic Biology from a                                  Jewish aspect in a paper he published a few years ago:” Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View” (1):                                 Ethics raises many issues and controversy in science. According to Judaism philosophy, man is                                 considered as a collaborator with God; his motives to research are pure.                                 His goal is to improve mankind and its surroundings. However, there are many risks                                 when we deal with science, like deliberate abuse or dangerous miscalculations.
Meeting with bioethics experts
During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be                                 relevant for our project.
First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science. Prof.  Deichmann"

Many of our basic parts (promoters, terminators, and fluorescent proteins) are courtesy of the Dueber Lab at UC Berkeley, our host this year. Our iGEM team chose the targeting proteins and sequences from the the Yeast GFP Database created by the O'Shea and Weissman Labs at UCSF, and either PCRed them from genomic DNA or synthesized them via gene synthesis ourselves. We then combined these parts with the basic parts provided by the Dueber Lab to build all the devices we utilized.
All the higher-order (cassette, multigene, full MiCode) device cloning, which mainly involved Golden Gate Assembly, was done by our iGEM team. While some of the Golden Gate backbones were provided by the Dueber Lab, many of the parts specific to MiCode project, specifically the backbones for multigene and full MiCode assembly, were designed and cloned by us. Additionally, we produced all the yeast strains necessary throughout our entire iGEM project and did all the image acquisition and analysis.
The leucine zipper sequences were provided courtesy of the Keating Lab at MIT, in a collaborative effort to identify an orthogonal interaction set. With the sequences provided, we constructed the leucine zippers via gene synthesis, combined them into our MiCode construction scheme, and assayed them in yeast.
Computational
On the software side, we wrote the MATLAB code, constructed the Cell Profiler pipeline for automated image analysis, and tested it using images generated by our iGEM team. Matlab object identification functions from the community forum were used as templates for the basis of our own code. We developed CellProfiler pipelines with the aid of the CellProfiler manual and sample pipelines from the online forum .
Website, Presentation, and Poster
With their permission, we began with the website template of the Berkeley 2011 iGEM team , and tweaked it to our needs this year. All the content was created by us except for the blue banner and Berkeley logo (provided by the University ), and the Javascript necessary for our slideshow on the front page (provided by Dev7 Studios ).
For the presentation and poster, any images not of our creation are cited where relevant.

Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities).
As we defined three dimension for our Human practice, we quickly list the work for each dimension:  (1)technology/profession: to understand the technique that we design can be used and successfully applied by the public.  We need to collect professional comments from professors, food suppliers, bio-tech industry and the public.   (2)education/communication: to promote the synthetic biology in iGEM project, and also receive feedbacks and comments from the society.  We decided that our human practice part should serve the role of education and communication.  Thus, we need to visit schools of different levels and the public.   (3)social impact: to investigate relate issues in food safety in Taiwan. We should  comprehend it from a macro view, not only being upset consumers and complaining about the government.  Dr. Tsai believed we should target understanding the policy design because many issues (ethics, social justice, safety, security, culture, budget constraints) have to be considered in policy development.  Thus, we decided to investigate related policies, how the government implements the policies, and the effectiveness of the policies.  Also she believed that we should approach and examining these issues from different sectors, not only listening to the governmental officers.
To make sure the system will work out well, we visited (1)executive departments, (2)legislative departments and lawyers, (3)non-governmental organization, (4)industry, and (5)vendors, (6) school.  We are very proud of work in education.  We visited many schools across every age group, teacher's inter-district communities, senior high schools, junior high, elementary schools and kindergarten. We produced two game apps which are free on Google Play Store, named Gene Check and Gene Maker. ( See our Human Practice )

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," the GC content of these regions is within 40% ∼60%. Thus, it’s better to avoid regions with sequence repeats and select regions containing even GC content.
The cloning vectors can be linearized by restriction digesting with endonuclease or by reverse PCR amplification.
2. Design of PCR primers of the insertions
The principle for the design of ClonExpress MultiS primers is: introduce homologous sequences (15 bp∼20 bp) into 5' end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amplified insertions and linearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction. Taking sequential assembly of three insertions (assembly order from 5' to 3' is as follows: insertion 1, insertion 2, insertion 3) to pUC18 cloning vector as example, design the primers as below:
Firstly, design the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3 (two insertions next to cloning vector) according to Figure 1.
Fig. 3: Design of the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3
Notice: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the Tm of primers, the homologous sequence of vector ends should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.
Secondly, design the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2. Homologous sequence used for inter-recombination between insertions can be fully added to either the reverse primer of insertion 1or the forward primer of insertion 2, and also can be partially added to both of them. Taking the addition homologous sequence to the reverse primer of insertion 1 as an example, design the primer according to Figure 4.
Figure 4: Design of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2
Notice: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the Tm of primers, the homologous sequence of vector end should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.
Lastly, design the reverse primer of insertion 2 and the forward primer of insertion 3. Design principles are similar to that of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and forward primer of insertion 2 respectively (see Fig. 4).

I'm a fourth year biochemistry major, and I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team this summer. When not in the lab I downhill/freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, skydive, and anything else that induces high amounts of adrenaline. These risk seeking hobbies of mine seem to always result in me being hospitalized. But I guess you gotta' play to win. I also play lead guitar in a band. I can often be found listening to Zeppelin, Clapton, B.B. King, Dylan, Buddy Guy, Neil Young, etc, etc, etc...

The diffusion over the cell membrane is more complicated because some proteins play a role in it and the membrane is not equally permeable for every molecule. For AHL, we found a value given in molecules/second. This unit seems strange because diffusion is usually  used with units in concentration. It also leads to strange results since the amount of molecules is being leveled out so the inside amount equals the outside amount even though the concentrations are different. This is why we added a correction for the volume of the cell and the external volume to it.
We assume that the volume of the cell has a shape of a cilinder and is constant. For this simplified volume we found a value of $5.65 {\cdot} 10^{-16} $ l. We can take this volume as a constant, since cell growth is very small compared to the diffusion. The outside compartment will be modeled as a cilinder in the agar with a radius equal to $\sqrt{2*D*t}$. For the initial value of the outside compartment we take a volume slightly bigger than the cell volume.
4. System
4.1 Cell A
The designed circuit in Cell A is under control of a temperature sensitive cI repressor. Upon raising the temperature, cI will dissociate from the promoter and the circuit is activated. This leads to the initiation of the production of LuxR and LuxI. LuxI will consecutively produce AHL, which binds with LuxR. The newly formed complex will then activate the production of Leucine and Ag43. Leucine and AHL are also able to diffuse out of the cell into the medium. Ag43 is the adhesine which aids the aggregation of cells A, while Leucine and AHL are necessary to repel cells B.
We can extract the following ODE's from this circuit:

Collaboration: SCU China iGEM team 2016
In order to gain a better global understanding of intellectual property rights in emerging markets. Our team lead, Dawson, was in Chengdu, Sichuan, China in July to visit family relatives. While in China, he couldn’t help but seize the opportunity to meet with SCU-China iGEM team in person to exchange ideas. This eventually lead to a knowledge exchange where both teams researched on copyright, patent and trademark laws in the respective countries. In the end, we exchanged our information to compare and contrast the nuances in regards to IP rights within each country.
We realized that both respective countries had their differences in IP laws due to cultural differences, and we devised a mock business plan in order to accommodate for the differences in intellectual property laws to ensure our venture is successful in an emerging global marketplace.
Outreach: St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High with UrbanTundra_Edmonton iGEM Team
Team member Mirat Sojitra presenting the concept of synthetic biology to junior high students at St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High, Edmonton, Alberta.
As part of our efforts to reach out to the community, our team collaborated with the local high school iGEM team. To celebrate this, we organized an event at a local junior high school, St. Elizabeth Seton, and introduced the concept of synthetic biology.
The children were not fully aware of how the properties of everyday items can be used to create scientific reactions. A protocol using household belongings, designed by the high school iGEM team, showed how it is possible to extract DNA from strawberry. This was very successful, with the junior high school students receiving hands-on experience. We were thrilled to collaborate with the high school team and also inspire the next generation of students by introducing them to iGEM and synthetic biology."

Membrane Accelerator
As there is no compartment in prokaryotic cells, enzymes involved in a biochemical pathway diffuse all over the cytoplasm. Intermediates produced from one enzyme cannot be passed efficiently to the next due to spatial obstacles.
Rationally designed assemblies of enzymes could help substrates flow by decreasing distance that intermediates have to travel between enzymes, and thus increase yields of sequential biological reactions. If we attach those enzymes to engineered membrane proteins which constitutively assemble together, the reactions are going to proceed much faster.
Based on this theory, we tried to build a Membrane Accelerator which organizes enzymes involved in sequential reactions in order on E.coli's inner membrane.
Construction Details
As demonstrated before, we based our device on E.coli inner membrane protein Lgt. SRP-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA is fused to N-terminus to localize fusion proteins to membrane.
To rationally assemble and arrange enzymes onto inner membrane of E.coli, we incorporate three protein domains that can interact with their cognate ligands. Protein-protein interaction domains and ligands from metazoan cells (mouse SH3 and PDZ domains and rat GBD domain) were recruited to assemble enzymes on membrane. Each domain could assemble with its cognate ligand.

As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This practice ensures that the patentee has a much time as possible to work on their IP while being protected before fully committing economically to the patenting process. Since we will be disclosing the majority of out findings on the iGEM wiki in late October, the ability to file a patent in many international markets are limited as they immediately label any knowledge on the internet as public domain. For a patent in Canada/United States, there is a one-year grace period after the date of disclosure in order to file a patent before the IP becomes part of the public domain. During this time period, one can file for a provisional patent valid for Canada and the U.S, the function of the provisional patent is to serve as a place holder for a patent down the line and lasts for a year from the date of filing. After the 12 months, one can go straight into a U.S. patent which lasts 20 years or can file a Paris Convention Treaty Patent, which would extend protection by 18 months which allows for more time to get research funding, additional development and entrepreneurship.
As a team we were also curious to see how intellectual property rights in emerging markets affected patenting. The rationale behind this exploration was to explore intellectual property in other emerging markets and see whether or not dNANO could potentially commercialized. We then contacted and collaborated with the Sichuan University (SCU-China) iGEM team in order to compare and contrast intellectual property rights in Canada and in China.
We realized that some countries have compulsory licencing where the government is able to licence out one’s IP without prior consent of the inventor. Usually, these are granted under special circumstances such as a national emergency and ultimately undermines the inventor’s autonomy with the IP. P

Entrepreneurship
Most patents lead to business development in some capacity. As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Software#Measurarty_-_-_TEXT.html," k-neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}_k$ can be determined as: \begin{equation} s(p) = \sum\limits_{p' \in \mathcal{N}_k} \nabla(p') / \arg\max\limits_{p} s(p) \end{equation}
Using thresholding, $TS_l \leq s(p) \leq TS_u \wedge TI_l \leq I \leq TI_u$, different areas, such as background or pathogen, can be selected.
For the empirical choice of thresholds, it can be argued that these are tailored to the specific case. While this surely is true to a certain extent, the here presented method has been successfully tested on images from a completely different domain, and no changes to the thresholds have been made to make it work. A proper theoretical evaluation is emphasized, however, is probably not the aim of the iGEM competition.
Finally, selecting for the red region, this delivers the location of possible pathogens. Since the size of the agar chips is variable but fixed a quantitative analysis can be performed by counting pixels for instance.
Empirical Evaluation
Using our MATLAB code, we found the lower threshold for the smoothness index to be $TS_l = 0.85$ and the upper threshold $TS_u = \infty$. Similarly, for $TI_l = 235$ and $TI_u = \infty$.
Using these settings, we can find a response already in images taken after 42 minutes.
Ideally, one would rate the quality of the image segmentation using some ground truth, such as manual delineations. This still has to be implemented for our method. However, from visual observations, our method is showing promising results.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectModeling_-_-_TEXT.html," we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
What are special reactions and How to handle with them?
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions (RNA polymerase are ignored). The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
What are differences from single compartment to multi-compartment?
Consider an example first. AHL molecules outside diffuse into E.coli cells with rate k1, while AHL molecules inside E.coli cells diffuse outward and enter into the bio-reactor with rate k2. We assume diffusion reactions are all driven by concentration gradient.
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
Chains in our Chain-Node Model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those with definite structure.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: Compare first the partReference and partType defined in database of the first part of two chains in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or the end of either chain. Meanwhile, a part in bound and unbound state(这里多了半句？)

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Overview
We devote to dividing the polyketide synthases (PKSs) and catalyze according to specific mechanism. Therefore, as if we standardize the genes which encode independent domains of PKSs, we can synthesize new kinds of polyketides by means of permutation and combination of domains.
In the process of analyzing the DEBS1 which catalyze and synthesize 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB)，the precursor of erythromycin, we know that each domain has independent and specific chemical reaction and function.
Name of domain
Function
Acyltransfer-ase, AT
Activating the extended unit------- propionyl group
Acyl carrier protein, ACP

Ketocaylsynthase, KS
Combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond
Keto-reductase, KR
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond
Dehydratase, DH
Dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond
Enoylreductase, ER
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene
Thioesterase, TE
Removing the polyketide chain from PKS
By preliminary analysis of chemical reaction and function of each domain, we can conclude that it is available to analyze their own kinetic mechanism, and it's significant. If we simulate the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, we can finally establish kinetic model of PKSs related to all kinds of polyketides.
Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," now the most important plasmid we have!  More digestions and transformations were done to keep the flow of the project moving well.
Science U presentation goes extremely well. Instructors are happy, kids were very engaged and seemed to learn a lot. Cloning and sequencing continue, with the goal being the confirmation of all five variants so that progress can be made to inserting the RBS library and characterizing.
Week 12
Monday, August 4 - Sunday, August 10
- Notebook Entries
Sequencing confirms two of the GFPs correct, two more likely correct, and one (GFP4) still lagging behind in cloning. Progress made by inserting dRBS and transforming cells. Unfortunately, numerous tries are needed until this is done successfully. Oligos containing the dRBS are re-annealed more than six times, each time with minor improvements to the protocol. Sequencing continues, and G4 is re-cloned.

Construction of Plasmids 2 and 3 started by preparing and assembling some of the easier parts.  There was some trouble with our electrocompetent cells and some solutions being used in PCR clueing reactions.
Finally, lots of colonies found on plates with G2 and G3 that contain the dRBS. Colonies glow, which is encouraging, cryo stocks prepared, then TECAN measurements began for G3. Old plates cleaned out, cryo stocks prepared for anything that seems like it might be useful, and rest is throw out. Clay leaves for Spain.

Part I: E.Tree
Detail:
E.trunk bacteria detect nitrates in the medium and release either LasI or RhlI directed signals. It includes two circuits: the first pathway is controlled by a nitrate sensitive promoter (pYeaR), so that if the medium contains nitrates, the entire pathway will be on, RhlI (produces AHL C4-homoserine lactone), tetR and GFP will be produced. TetR then binds with pTet in the second pathway and blocks it.
If the medium contains no nitrates, the first pathway is repressed while the second one is unblocked, so LasI (produces 3OC12-homoserine lactone) and RFP will be synthesized.
E.leaf bacteria change color according to the signal molecules released by E.trunk. LasR and RhlR are constitutive synthesized in E.leaf; they bind to the LasI and RhlI directed signals, respectively.
Overall effect: If the medium contains nitrates, E.trunk releases C4-homoserine lactone (the product of RhlI); the signal molecules enter E.leaf bacteria and bind to RhlR. This RhlI/R complex then interact with pRhl promoter and green fluorescence is emitted. Meanwhile, RhlI molecules further synthesized in E.leaf bacteria, so that not only bacteria grow along the border but all E.leaf bacteria on the plate will turn green.
Similarly, if the medium lacks nitrates, E.trunk bacteria release 3OC12-homoserine lactone  (the products of LasI) and the “leaves” turn yellow.
Part II: Dinner Service
Detail:
The ""customer"" E.coli is consisted of two pathways.  The first pathway codes IsrR, a siganl that activates the second pathway, and aiiA, which degrades IsrR. The promoter for IsrR is stronger than that of aiiA. In that case, part of the IsrR will be degraded, but still some will be able to activate the second pathway. When the second pathway is activated, Lux"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," second issue with this original part is that it is only able to give a single output (GFP). When the promoter is flipped, nothing else is produced. This completely misses one of the most useful characteristics of a device which has a promoter that can be flipped: dual outputs. We have made use of this characteristic by encoding the rhlI gene on the antisense strand of the Fim switch upstream of the flippable promoter. This enables any additional output to be easily added by using the RhlIR two component system mechanism. As a proof-of-concept for this, we have included the Fim switch as a processing variant in our Sensynova Framework. The Fim switch is able to act as a 'standby switch' by expressing eforRed (red output) when no signal is detected (i.e. when no analyte is detected by the detector cell). When a signal is detected, expression of fimE can be activated, and the promoter is flipped, resulting in expression of RhlI. This leads to the synthesis of the C4-AHL quorum sensing molecule, which is sensed by the reporter cells present in the community and its reporter gene is produced. This is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: SBOL Visual of the switching mechanism of the Fim Switch, in the native [OFF] state the eforRED reporter is expressed (shown in red) allowing direct visualisation of the cells.  Following the inversion of the promoter region ( K1632004 ), eforRED expression is halted and the rhlI gene is expressed ( J64718 ), this is now the [ON] state.
Characterisation
To test the functionality of the Fim switch, ensuring that C4 AHL is produced, the strain was cultured with a reporter strain ( K2205015 ) which produces GFP in response to the quorum sensing molecule C4 AHL.  Due to a small sub-population of the Fim switch strain being white, a single white colony was picked and cultured separately.  This strain was used as a positive control as it should produce C4 AHL.  Both the majority (red) Fim switch strains and minority flipped (white) Fim switch strains were tested for C4 AHL production by co-culture with the reporter strain.  Initially the Fim switch strains were spotted onto a lawn of the reporter strain (Figure 2) followed by quantitative analysis of the strains by co-culture in a 96 well microplate (Figure 3).    This culture is then co-cultured with the reporter cell. This reporter cell detects C4"
FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," on the glass surface. In presence of curli, the particles tend to grow isotropically, with fibers coated around an assembly of individual particles. The ZnO nanoclusters provide average sizes of 0.9 µm with a standard deviation of 0.2 µm, considering 50 clusters. In absence of curli fibers, needle like structures form, which are highly uniform in shape with an average length of 1.1 µm and an average width of 0.55 µm. The size and shape is likely controlled by other factors such as sugars, less complex protein structures in the biofilm matrix or salts in the medium.
Figure 3: Figure 3: ZnO needles grown in the absence of curli fibers in an autoclave at 121°C for 20 min on a p-doped silica wafer.
This result is confirmed by the autoclave mediated synthesis (Figure 2), where similar needle like structures with equal size appear. Accordingly, the capping agents of these structures have to be included in the growth medium or biofilm.
Figure 4: REM images of mineralized biofilms grown on a FTO glass slide with 500 x magnification (left) and 2000 x magnification (right)
The biofilms grown on a FTO glass slide provide more homogeneous layers in contrast to the biofilms grown on a silica wafer (Figure 3). On the bacteria a network like structure can be found, which is most likely mineralized as the layers were sintered before measuring, to kill the bacteria. Beside the larger network like structures smaller clusters can be identified at higher magnifications. The amount of ZnO for this preparation is low compared to the high amount of organic material and hence we started to increase the ZnO ratio.
Future Prospect
For further enhancement of the solar cells the mineralization process can be improved to obtain higher surface area covered with ZnO. One part of this work must be a reliable prediction of the biofilm quality as every biofilm can differ slightly in its composition and the amount of ZnO binding domains. Also the structure and size of ZnO can be adjusted more accurately. Here a specific surface pattern on bacteria which is called S-layer. The potential surface roughness provides high loading capacities for dyes or other photosensitizers, which enhances the efficiency of the biofilm solar cell drastically.

Introduction
The Design of a project is the product of the first big planning phase. It changes often throughout the project due to first findings in experimental data and a never-ending engineering cycle.      Opposit to our project description, this page contains information on all the transporters and channels we got in contact with throughout our project. Further down this page we also give some      information about why we chose S.cerevisiae as our chassis and why we integrated genes from Arabiddopsis thaliana. In addition to that, we also hand information about why we choose homologous      recombination, the loxP system, Easy Clone integration sites and an inducible promoter.
S.cerervisiae
A.thaliana
Recombination
EasyClone
loxP System
GAL1
In the very beginning of the planning- process we collect all kind of ideas of how we could design our project. Which organism is the best? Which molecular tools should be used? Which      thermodynamically efficiencies do the several transporters have? We read a lot of literature, design a first plan and consult our advisors to concretize our scheme. Afterwards, we start with      the modelling and the work in the laboratory. We have failures and successes regarding the aims of our project at first, which made us shift the design from time to time. The modelling and      the first lab- results cause that some parts were adapted and the project itself is adjusted in the direction the modeling and the lab- results guide us. Finally, after repeating this cycle a      few times, we get our latest project design and performed several tests to proof the results.

A global problem
In attempt to solve the energy crisis witnessed by global citizens, the 2017 Macquarie Australia iGEM team H2ydroGEM, designed an elegant prototype that uses direct applications of synthetic biology to produce cheap, renewable and easy to use hydrogen energy. We call our creation H2GEM- the Hydrogen gas Genetically Engineered Machine-which will be freely available for consumers to use in their home.
Hydrogen energy is deemed to be Australia’s next biggest export. Already, different states in the country have announced that they will be utilizing hydrogen energy for their vehicles. The governments in South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have both agreed to take on hydrogen powered vehicles within the next two years. In anticipation of this renewable Australia, our team decided to take on the onerous task of addressing the two major set backs to renewable hydrogen energy:
1. Production and Cost - Hydrogen gas is not found readily available, and as such, we look to fracking and other such distasteful methods of hydrogen extraction. The wonderful environmentally friendly advantages of hydrogen energy become nullified by this costly process.
2. Storage - All gases expand to fill up space, and as such, storing them in high volumes becomes difficult and costly. Because hydrogen is flammable, safety also needs to be carefully taken into consideration.
Our synthetic biology solution
Our prototype, H2GEM, was designed to resolve these two hinderances, and allow hydrogen energy to more easily enter into the Australian and international market.
The H2GEM was designed so that it was compact enough to fit within a standard Australian household garage. The unit itself is shaped as a compact, sleek lightbulb-shaped design. Its dimensions are 1 metre tall, 60 centimetres wide and 30 centimetres deep. It will be constructed using two rectangular pieces of sheet metal welded together at the top of the unit, with two lightbulb-shaped metal pieces at either end. A small input tray is located near the base so that feed stock can be inserted by the user with ease.

This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Andreas fully tested the instrumentation today. A dilution series was made to test the sensitivity of the sensor in the right geometry. More details can be found in the lab-book.
Still no successful ligations for the biobricks, as a couple of colony PCRs show. Looks like the insert for the SpoVA biobrick may not have been digested. Oops...
The platereader also gets a thorough workout, as we try one last assay on our magnesium riboswitch construct. 24 hours later, we might get some nice data.

Q2
More than 70% people haven’t ever heard the word, “synthetic biology”. The word, “synthetic biology” hasn't spread yet. We need to extend the knowledge of synthetic biology and genetic transformation.
Q3
GM crops, clone, DNA, iPS cells are ranked higher than other thing.
It’s remarkable that the number of 10’s which answered “Bioethics” is the fewest among all generations.
Q4
All the generations are worrying about negative effects on the human body and the environment.
We think that public attention became stricter to technology because of the accident of Fukushima nuclear power plant.
There is also the person who wants to know about genetic transformation.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Human Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," London. The NRPUEA iGEM team greeted the UK teams, provided refreshments and a lovely buffet lunch, as well as chairing the speeches and making sure the day ran smoothly. There was a great atmosphere at the meet up, and the event was a huge success.
The day consisted of a number of guest speakers, including advice and tips for iGEM success from  Dr. Tom Ellis (advisor of the 2009 winning iGEM project E.chromi) and an interactive talk on synthetic biology and science communication from the BBC science presenter, Nature editor and Guardian writer, Dr. Adam Rutherford. The UK iGEM teams presented a poster and a 15 minute presentation about their project. This gave the members of each team the chance to practice their presentation skills before the European team meet up, as well as a chance for others to ask questions and see what other project routes the other teams have taken.
The event was also available LIVE on the internet via Google+ hangout, to allow the public and those that were unable to attend to still watch the presentations. Despite there being a few technical difficulties with the quality of the image, figures have shown that over 600 people watched the event.

Communicating with other iGEM teams
As part of our efforts to collaborate with the other iGEM teams this year we've made an effort to keep in contact with an array of iGEM teams. Here are some highlights:
- We communicated with all of the UK iGEM teams via Twitter, Email, Facebook and Google+ before, during and after the UK team meet up.
- We tweeted with many other iGEM teams from around the world and closely followed the iGEM community.
- We video called the St Andrews iGEM team via Google+ Hang-out to discuss our projects further as well as to seek advice about the arrangements for the UK team meet-up.
- Our advisor Richard Kelwick was interviewed by the Edinburgh iGEM team via Skype about our teams perspectives on public awareness and understanding of synthetic biology.
- We visited the Cambridge team near the beginning of our project and they were kind enough to give us a tour of their labs.
- Finally, the British Columbia team sent us a questionnaire about intellectual property that we happily filled out.

Once you finish the design, you can run simulation program to check if it works well and then export it as plasmid and we will generate the DNA sequence for synthesis.
Algorithm
The users of our software are all innovative researchers who are interested in utilizing Synthetic Biology to tackle many different real-world problems. The purpose of our system is to recommend the most related genetic parts to the users based on users' research interest detected by our system.
The information we use to make recommendations is based on a database powered by NLP and Random Walk, which contains scores between each keyword and each genetic part. Formally, it is a matrix consisting of the number of keywords and the number of Parts. The element at the row and column is the score between the keyword and genetic Part that can reflect the connection between them. (Higher score suggests stronger connection).
The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering, i.e. we first search similar keywords in our database of the unknown word offered by users, then recommend genetic parts which are highly related to those keywords that are suggested for users.
How to find the most similar keywords in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution: To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately, we use techniques in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vector can represent the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar keyword efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a speedy algorithm based on the binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.
Network Analysis
Search analysis
At scientific journals, keywords are often required for publishing articles. Keywords can be used for indexing or searching, and offer a faster way for readers to browse the content of a project and find their interests.
In fact, in 2015, iGEM try to collect some keywords by asking teams to submit.
This year, a new data format is created and its keywords enable our network analysis. First, We used Microsoft Text Analytics Service to extract keywords from wiki texts of previous projects. Only the most frequently used keywords will be focused. By using machine learning, those keywords were converted to word vectors base on a semantic database. A network profiling relationship among keywords, projects and parts data is built and stored in the S-Din database. When searching, related information will be provided based on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea unexpectedly.

We found that the fimE KO we hypothesized would overproduce type 1 pili indeed agglutinated the yeast, as indicated by a white clump at the bottom of the tube. The fim B KO samples showed no sign of clumping and were completely opaque:
To confirm these results, we examined equal volumes of OD standardized agglutinated samples from either strain under light microscopy. Slides were prepared according to the slide preparation protocol and to visualize the bacteria and yeast, we stained the slides according to the Gram Stain protocol.
These photos are representative of the morphology of each sample. The large purple circular cells are S. cerevisiae and the small pink cocci are E. coli:
At this point we were confident in the agglutination assay’s ability to detect the presence of pili via mannose-mediated adhesion. However, we hypothesized that our future modifications of the fimH adhesin might lead to weakened mannose binding strength even while the pili were still properly assembling.  We required a diagnostic assay that would detect whether type 1 Pili were present on the cell surface even when fimH no longer bound to mannose. So we conducted extensive literature review and developed the with the aim of a rapid test to provide a “yes” or “no” answer to this question.
We first tested our assay on our control strains, growing both the overproducer and null strain overnight in LB liquid culture, then OD standardizing to ensure our results were not dependent on variable cell growth. Then a volume of each sample was spun down at low speed (so as not to lyse the cells), washed once in DPBS to remove secreted proteins, and resuspended in a smaller volume of DPBS to concentrate the signal in later steps. These samples were then heat treated for 20 minutes at 60°C to shear-off the pili from the cell surface and spun down again at low-speed so the cells would pellet but the sheared pili would remain in solution. This pili-containing supernatant was then denatured using formic acid, boiled in 1x Lamelli’s buffer and run according to the SDS-PAGE protocol. The resulting gels were stained according to the R-250 Coomassie protocol  and compared at the molecular weight of Type 1 Pili’s structural subunit protein, fimA, which"

Production Plasmid
Part of our project concerned an assembly that produced L-DOPA (levodopa or L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) from L-tyrosine in E. coli.
L-tyrosine can be converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. An equivalent of tyrosine hydroxylase in bacteria is 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase which is expressed by the genes hpaB and hpaC in E. coli. To simplify our assembly, we designed our construct to position hpaB and hpaC coding sequences in succession under the control of CP25 promoter which constitutively expresses downstream coding genes.
We constructed our production assembly by cloning a CP25-hpaBC-rpoc transcriptional unit into a vector containing a pMMB67EH ori and spectinomycin resistance marker. Our construct was assembled using golden gate cloning techniques. To do so, we first used golden gate to assemble all individual parts (CP25 promoter, hpaBC, rpoc terminator, and backbone) into entry vectors with the Type II restriction enzyme BsmBI. From there, the entry vectors were used to assemble a cassette plasmid with the Type II restriction enzyme BsaI. Cut sites for BsmBI and BsaI had been added previously to all parts by the Ellington Lab through the use of primers and PCR amplification.
We made a similar assembly using the same methods; in this assembly, however, we used PA3 promoter, another constitutively expressed promoter, in place of CP25 because we were afraid CP25 was too strong of a promoter.
Here is a brief overview of each main constituent of the hpaBC transcriptional unit:
CP25 promoter strong promoter; initiates transcription of hpaBC; interchanged with PA3 promoter.5 promoter. PA3 promoter (BBa_K2458000): moderately-strong promoter; initiates transcription of hpaBC; interchanged with CP25 promoter.
hpaBC (BBa_K2458001): gene expressing the enzyme hpaBC (4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase).

Washington University in St. Louis 2011
The 2011 WashU iGEM team is researching the capability of baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to produce the compounds β-carotene and β-ionone. By manipulating the enzymatic pathways associated with the compounds and incorporating them into yeast, we hope to find an efficient means of infusing vitamin A, a derivative of β-carotene, into food items. Our research may ultimately stimulate the advancement and production of healthy food supplements similar to ""golden rice"".
β-ionone, derived from β-carotene, is an aromatic compound characterized by a rose scent and is a contributing ingredient for many perfumes. Production of β-ionone in a widely-available organism has the potential to improve the efficiency of obtaining this fragrance for the perfume industry.
Our team has been vigorously working throughout the months of June, July and August and we hope that our research will be put to good use!
The Project's 5 major components
1) Using PCR to attach a restriction site and yeast plasmid homology to our four unique cassettes (selective markers).
2) Using PCR to attach a restriction site and yeast plasmid homology to the genes involved in our enzymatic pathway.
3) Performing a restriction digest and ligation process to connect the genes and cassettes together such that we get Homology---Gene---Restriction + Restriction---cassette---Homology.
4) Transforming our final gene/cassette product into yeast. Then through yeast mating and sporulation, we hope to successfully create transgenic yeast that can produce β-carotene and β-ionone.
5) Using assays, we ultimately test for the production of β-carotene and β-ionone and the efficiency of this pathway.

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Introduction
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) helps direct proteins to the mitochondria when this peptide sequence is in front of the N-terminus of the protein of interest. MLS will be removed upon the peptide’s translocation into the mitochondria, but four additional amino acid residues (Ile-His-Ser-Leu) will be left at the N-terminus of the protein. The CDS of MLS was cloned out from pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA) using PCR.
MLS is submitted in RFC25 standard ( BBa_K1119001 ) to facilitate fusing with other CDS. MLS in RFC10 standard ( BBa_K1119001 )is submitted as alternative, but it cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to the limitations of RFC10. Users who obtained the part in RFC10 standard can obtain the part by PCR and fuse to other domains using overlapping PCR.
In our characterization, the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format ( BBa_K648013 ). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter ( BBa_K1119006 ), and terminated by hGH polyA signal ( BBa_K404108 ). The aforementioned construct ( BBa_K1119009 ) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos dye after transfection and co-localization between the GFP signal and that of the dye was determined as the area of signal overlap. To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was"

""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
This week has been a succession of PCR, digestion, PCR, PCR, digestion, vector growth, more PCR.
We can confidently say that we now know how to set up and run agarose gels! Looking on the bright side of things, we made a lot of mistakes these last few days that we hope to evade in the future: buffers need to be diluted, instructions followed, labels clearly written, and don’t lick the metal poles in the -80° freezer. Just don’t.
In order to learn all these valuable lessons, we had to sacrifice one thing: results. Many of our PCRs were unsatisfactory, plasmids did not digest properly, E. coli wouldn’t take up the vectors, and it turns out we have a knack for mysteriously making PCRs disappear on agarose gels.
Not until Friday after lunchtime did we finally have some successes:  we found a PCR and the conditions that worked for the gene we are currently working on, the D6 elongase from L. major. Plus, we managed to grow a decent amount of vector and restrict it with enzymes. We hope that we’ve set a good foundation to build on next week – nowhere to go but up!
Week 4
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
The clean cut pGEX was used to try and optimise our PCR conditions. However, all our preparations came back blank. After reviewing our protocol, and making sure we had done everything correctly, we turned to our primers. We had been using a primer that did not bind where we thought it did. We fixed this and started using our GST Forward primer in combination with the reverse primers that we had used to make our primer dimers. Taking a break from the lab, the team travelled through to Edinburgh to meet iGEM Dundee and iGEM Edinburgh to swap ideas and hear a few synthetic biology speakers.  On our return, and using the correct primers a colony PCR was run and bands were seen in lanes for platinum, palladium and nickel. We seem to be getting somewhere! Alongside this we made our first protein gels and prepared some uncut pGEX to run on them after inducing it with IPTG to see if our GST tag (with our primer dimer peptides ) would be over expressed. The gel will be run on Monday.

To simulate the worst case scenario, we did replica plating of some exemplary sensor chips. In three experiments, we got an arithmetic mean of five colonies which were picked up. From that we concluded that the risk of infection is really low even if the measurement device and chips are not handled properly.

Very few alternative splicing is reported in yeast, yet it can normally carry out the pre-RNA processing function. Another is that changing the gene sequence to control the expression pattern is too difficult to apply.
Finally, we suspended this idea and tried to find other doable and potential projects.
E-waste
  E-waste now is becoming a worldwide environmental problem. Current treatment is like this: most countries transport the E-waste to the developing areas; then the workers there recycle the useful or worthy parts by hand; the useless parts are shredded and the powder undergoes further selection by different physical and chemical properties; eventually the remains are deeply buried. The whole process costs tremendously and still results in environmental pollution. So we tried to solve this problem in a synthetic biology approach. We checked the components of the E waste: plastic and metal. We continued to read related papers about bacteria degrading plastic, mobilizing metal elements, or absorbing metal elements. Unfortunately, the plastic substances in the E-waste like epoxy resins, and PCBs, PVC are very hard for bacteria to degrade. Secondly, though there’s some paper indicating the power of some bacteria of recycling the metal, the detailed mechanism is still a mystery. In order to first mobilize the metal elements from the solid E-waste, we had proposed some ideas like producing acid such as acetic acid, citric acid even cyanic acid, thus the bacteria we used must be tolerant to the high pH environment. Here the dilemma is: on one hand, if we use some special bacteria, it is difficult to engineer it; on the other hand, if we use E.coli, it is difficult for us to engineer it to adapt to the acid environments. Due to these problems, we stopped further discussion on this topic.4
Signal Modular by Protein Scaffold
  This idea comes from the paper by Keasling in which he used protein scaffold to boost the metabolic flow in biosynthesis. We think we can adopt similar methosd in signal transduction. At first, we were all excited about the idea. However, the tragedy is that we found out UCSF had done a similar project in 2007 iGEM. : (
Change the color by shaking
  This is just an interesting idea that there’s no specific practical application. The key of this idea is to discover a sensing system based on the physical attachment between cells. So we looked up some paper, and found one paper's novel discovery of sensing the touching. But the fatal drawback is that it lacks detailed mechanism that we can harness.

Paul Tan– Officer SINOPEC Guangzhou, China
Sinopec Guangzhou Petrochemical Company (“Guangzhou Company” for short) is one of the leading petrochemical enterprises in South China. The core business of Guangzhou Company covers refining products including solid plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene.
Jianfeng and Paul endorsed our project explaining that they welcome the technology development of bioplastic, even as a competitor to them. The mass convenience of plastic in food, clothes, car industry, etc. are too important and so far there is no other material that can replace plastic. And, currently the degradation of plastic is still too expensive for its price and its environmental impact. As a result, bioplastics constitute a possible solution to the growing demand of plastics.

Understanding the recycling market of plastics
Jianfeng and Paul have experience in the petroleum-based industry and knowledge of how the plastic market has change. We were aiming to understand the importance of different disposable scenarios and they gave us an insight of the recycling industry. They explained that after the reduction of oil prices in 2014, the recycling industry had retreated as making new plastic became much cheaper than recycling it. In addition, they mentioned that recycled plastics are slightly different and the manufacturers need to add other materials to improve the physical properties. These additives tend not be in the labels of the plastics making the recycling process more difficult in a further stage.
Implementations
The recycling scenario would not be the best end-of-life for our plastics, in conjugation with the comments of Dr. Higson from NNFCC we believe that a combination of recycling and composting could be helpful in terms of the sustainability of our bioplastics. The results of the research in PHBV degradation and composability should be incorporated to the design of PHBV products.

Summary

Best basic part: BBa_K2886002
What is VEGF-scFv？
We present BBa_K2886002 as our best basic part which encodes VEGF-scFv that can recognize VEGF.
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), originally known as VPF (vascular permeability factor), is a ligand commonly used in research. As a kind of endogenous growth factor produced by both human and mouse cells, VEGF has various biological effects such as stimulating the formation of blood vessel and enhancing the permeability of it. VEGF is a big family, consisting of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and PGF, of which VEGF-121 and VEGF-165 are two main types in body as well as used in research.
VEGF-scFv, standing for VEGF single-chain variable fragment, is adapted from the outermost Ig-like domain of the antibody of VEGF. VEGF-scFv encoded by BBa_K2886002 is a fusion protein containing light chain and heavy chain linked by a GS linker. As for its function, VEGF-scFv can bind many kinds of VEGF including VEGF-121 and VEGF-165, the most commonly used subtypes of VEGF referred above. Thus, iGEMers could use this part to achieve the detection of most kinds of VEGF efficiently and conveniently with our part.
Test results
Moreover, to realize higher affinity and efficiency of ligand-receptor binding, we alter a few amino acids on the binding surface with the assist of Rosetta.

As Dr. Alonso-Vega explained, the need for such a test stems from lack of medical follow-up and recommended we align the second test suggested in our optimal diagnostic strategy with the pentavalent vaccine to increase turnout of infants tested to further minimize issues caused by the lack of adequate follow up. The optimal location to obtain the newborn’s blood required for our diagnostic kit was also confirmed with advice from Dr Alonso-Vega. She suggested we consider placental and heel prick blood as two potential options as the blood source. Further research indicated that despite the high volume placental blood (10-20ml at delivery) it may not be as suitable in the context of our blood clotting reporter, because the blood from the placenta is likely to have already clotted. Thus we chose to opt for a heel prick based test, corroborating our survey results that 97% of those surveyed would be comfortable with a pinprick or small syringe test for diagnosis.
Eileen Murphy
We approached Eileen Murphy and colleagues, who  led the PATH diagnostics gap analysis for Chagas, to help us contextualise our device in the existing diagnostic landscape and ensure our device was focused on meeting the required needs. Our communication with those at PATH reaffirmed our diagnostic focus on congenital Chagas disease, because outside of infants born to Chagas-confirmed mothers, the acute phase is typically mild, relatively short in duration meaning that many patients do not routinely seek medical care. In addition we were warned of the technical barrier of true negatives facing commercial assays detecting parasite infection directly, which occur due to intermittent shedding during chronic phase infection that means parasites may not always be present in collected blood samples. However, it was noted that this may not be as significant an issue if our diagnostic was used in the acute phase context. In light of these discussions we decided to tailor our device towards diagnosing congenital infection in newborns.
Professor Jaila Dias Borges Lalwani
Professor Dias Borges Lalwani is professor of epidemiology at the Faculty of pharmaceutical sciences at UFAM, whose contact details were forwarded to us by the AQA Amazonas team. We were fortunate enough to be able to arrange a Skype meeting with Jaila, which helped us contextualise the problem of Chagas highlighting the difficulty of seeking diagnosis given non-specific early disease symptoms. Furthermore, our conversation highlighted the regional specificity of transmission, directing us towards Bolivia as our focus country since it has the highest rates of congenital Chagas."

Enhance promoter strength prediction accuracy. Because our experimental data is so limited, the weight of the spacer length and the motif similarity is roughly determined, which lead to a weak correlation between the promoter strength. In the future we hope to obtain more experimental data with regard to the effect of spacer length and motif similarity having on promoter strength so we can revise the weight coefficients  of the two factors and get more reliable results.
The next version of this part of our program will be able to analyze not only the promoters of E. coli, but other species such as Bacillus subtilis, we'll integrate the transcription factor binding site data of more species into our database and use PWM algorithm to predict the TFBS in the promoters.

He informed us that we could facilitate the secretion of sputum giving the patient an expectorant. Finally, as discussed below, we concluded to the oropharyngeal sampling, as it is also suitable for infants and the sample is easier to handle.
Hellenic Society of Point-of-Care Testing
We also had the unique opportunity to meet with Dr Dionisis Vourtsis, Dr Giorgos Antonakos and Dr Katerina Stini from the Hellenic Society of Point-of-Care Testing. They gave us general guidance as to the established criteria in order for a kit to be considered suitable for PoC testing and helped us define our primary goals for the kit design. They specifically noted the need for rapidness, precisely the diagnosis should be completed in 30-60mins, and automation. Taking this advice into account, we opted for RPA as a quicker RNA amplification method, instead of our original choice of NASBA. In parallel, we tried to combine several steps together, reducing the moves and the time needed for the test operation. This meeting also finalized our choice on the sample type, as we knew that the viral load is greater in the sputum than in the pharyngeal smear, but we did not know which sampling method would be less inconvenient for the patient. We were informed that patients are in general more familiar with the swab as a sample collecting method rather than the spit. Evaluating the difference in the viral load versus the ease in the collecting and handling of the two samples, we concluded to the collection of pharyngeal smear with a swab.
The Kit
Dr. Maria-Nefeli Tsaloglou, Diagnostics For All (DfA)
Our kit design was extensively based on a diagnostic device developed by researchers at DfA. Dr. Tsaloglou, board member of the not-for-profit company, was eager to show us the device and answer our questions. Having worked with various amplification methods, she helped us pick a suitable one for our system. We had in mind that in order to avoid the need for cooling mechanisms and ensure a uniform temperature throughout the detection process, we should use an isothermal amplification method functioning at around 37 oC, that is the working temperature of our cell-free transcription-translation system. Dr. Tsaloglou indicated the disadvantages of NASBA and RCA, that we originally had in mind, such as being thermally initiated at 37-40 oC and also"

Approach
Our experimental approach can be summarized as follows:
1. Organisms and surface proteins selection
2. Surface protein amplification and cloning
3. Yeast two-hybrid assay with an existing peptide library
4. Peptide functionalization
Results summary
We chose the five fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, A. nidulans, Candida glabrata, C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the parasite Toxoplasma gondii for our project. In the first step, we amplified all in all 35 different genes encoding surface proteins of the mentioned organisms in a standard PCR reaction (compare table 1). We were able to transform 20 of our 35 genes into a so called bait vector (contains a DNA-binding domain) and performed the Yeast-Two-Hybrid (Y2H) screening with them. Thereby, we accomplished to find more than 3000 probable interaction partners for our surface proteins.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

I Introduction
Even though we have orthometric gene circuit, the killing ability of two warriors may have great difference. [Fig.1]
RFP is used to indicate the LacI level inside warrior, so it can indicate the killing ability of warrior. From this figure, we can see that the LacI level inside warrior I increase at a very fast speed. In real situation, this means that warrior I will be killed at the beginning.
Therefore, in our project, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level. Intuitively, many potential factors can influence the killing ability, like the catalysis rate of AHL synthase, cross-membrane rate between AHL molecules. Then what factors can we change to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggest that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins.
II Evaluation of warrior's killing ability
First, to simplify the evaluation, we will have some hypothesis at first:
1. The increasing rate of two warriors are the same.
2. The environmental capacity (it is mentioned in the famous Logistic model) of two warriors are the same if the environmental conditions and the initial amount of resources are the same. (By these hypothesis, we can ignore influence of growth rate on killing ability, which will make things more complicated.)
3. Also, we could only consider the condition that there is glucose inside the medium and there is only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI, so it can indicate the killing ability of"

Overview
To implement audiogenetics, we chose two (Piezo1 and TRPC5) from hundreds of mechanosensitive(MS) channels for their sensitivity to mechanical stress and selective permeability to calcium ion. We used genetically encoded calcium indicator (R-GECO) to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 and TRPC5 channels. We used hypoosmolarity as a positive control stimuli and validate the function of the MS channels and Calcium sensor.  We designed a microfluidic chip to quantitatively tune the shear force exerted on cell membrane, and both channel are responsive to such mechical stress. Surprisingly, we discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell response to shear force in an biphasic manner and a maximum responsive of ~0.3 pa. We haven't found similar report in the past.  We also examined the intracellular calcium response to various combination of frequency and intensity of sound.We discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell are very sensitive to 15khz sound and not to 10khz, which indicate the previous identified touching sensing Piezo1 channel could detect sound wave"

Please see the Registry Contribution below, and you can click on the name of parts to see more detailed information. (These parts do not come from our team's 2015 range of part numbers)
This experiment is designed to demonstrate the improvement of element's function. We use the fluorescence quantitative PCR method, add a pair of primers and a special fluorescent probe which is oligonucleotides with report fluorescent groups and fluorescence quenching groups at the ends. When the probe is complete, the fluorescence signal emitted by report fluorescent groups are absorbed by fluorescence quenching groups. When the PCR begin, the probe combine with a single chain of DNA. Then in the amplification, Taq enzyme, a the 5'-3'end excision enzyme degrade the probe, make the report fluorescence groups and the fluorescence quenching groups separate. Then the fluorescence monitoring system can detect the fluorescence signal. One DNA chain, one fluorescent molecular. We can identify the yield of PCR by detecting the fluorescence signal. We also draw a standard curve to quantify the experimental result.

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#project_-_-_TEXT.html," as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids learn more about synthetic biology in an enjoyable way. To our surprise, when they were playing these games, they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. ( Exhibition at National Museum ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
II Gene circuit
In our system, E.coli is divided into two groups, with each group having three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
Concretely, the gene circuit of each character is displayed below.
Principles of this circuit can be seen at Design of characters.
III Invertase assay
In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)
(Fig.2 The number of cells expressing mRFP)
More details can be seen at Invertase assay
IV Orthogonality test
Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
((Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test)
However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
(Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from results)
We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumoral action_-_-_TEXT.html," fragmentation observation, consequence to the CAD (Caspase Activated DNase) activity, a specific endonuclease of the apoptotic process.
A MTT test allowed to quantify the effect induced by the p53 wild type expression into infected cells.
Figure 3 : AdCMV.p53 effect on cell survive. Control and AdCMV.p53 infected cells were incubated in serum-free media after 1h of infection.
In serum absence, non-infected and ßgal infected cells continue to proliferate. In contrast, for p53 infected cells, proliferation is stopped and followed by an important fall of population. After 72h, nearly the totality of p53 infected cells were dead (figure 3).
According to this study, it appears clearly that to bring a p53 wild-type version into the p53 mutated cell population induces the apoptosis phenomenon and decreases significantly the tumor population.
Similar results were reported in the study leaded by Corrado Cirielli (in 1999) by using similar analyses on a U251 cancer strain from a glioma.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," daily handled in academic laboratories. After the heart attack and the death of his wife, Hope Kurtz, Steve called 911. Finding his “home made laboratory”, the police, present for Kurtz's wife’s death called the FBI and the Joint Terrorist Task Force who arrested the artist and opened an investigation about bioterrorism. Art works by Steve Kurtz often relyon biological material and already had been presented in art galleries and museums. One week after the arrest, the New York State commissioner of public health confirmed the inoffensive nature of the biological agent in Kurtz's house. After the failure of that bioterrorism accusation, the US Department of Justice charged Steve Kurtz and Dr. Ferrel from Pittsburgh University of mail and wire fraud. That investigation of mail, and listening of internet and telephone communications by police forces were permitted thanks to the US Patriot Act. Even if the name of the charges seemed less serious than bioterrorism, mail and wire frauds could lead both men to 20 years in jail. Dr. Ferrel is accused of illegal use of the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) between Pittsburgh University and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) to get the $256 strain of bacterias sent to Steve Kurtz. Indeed, academic laboratories get biological material from companies like ATCC through such agreements. The MTA specifies that it is forbidden to sell, share, post, or reproduce the material. Such specifications are not very respected in the academic and scientific field. Kurtz and Ferrel are accused of a rupture of contract, but neither institution (Pittsburgh University and ATTC) lodged a complaint about it. The Kurtz case is the first time that the US Department of Justice went so far in such a case. In its Criminal Resource Handbook, the Department asserts that such interventions are justified only in the case of prominent risks for the public and not for little cases. Mail and wire frauds are used in order to transform a civil offense in a federal pursuit. In June of 2008, Steve Kurtz won the case and was allowed to take his home made material lab back, after the failure of the FBI investigation.
That case is so dense that we will only mentioned the more interesting elements of analysis here, the main issue I want to point out is the blurring brought by the reality. We cross all the ethical issues, biosecurity and biosafety concerns by manipulating concepts, stakes and precautions without taking into account the complexity of the reality of human relationship, forms of exchange, discourses, etc. I think the Steve Kurtz case has to remind us that boundaries"
Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Autofocus_-_-_TEXT.html," above - attempting to account for global maxima of focus scores would require the autofocus procedure to be far longer than desirable. We also implemented a naive dynamic threshold to stop moving the z axis once the focus was ""good enough"", a value for which is empirically derived.
We settled for a hill-climbing approach. Imagining the theoretical focus score for all possible z values on a graph may look like a hill. This algorithm attempts to ""climb"" that hill of focus scores. This algorithm assesses the focus scores of individual frames, moving in the direction where the focus is increasing. If the focus decreases, the motors are reversed in smaller increments. This process is repeated several times until an exit condition is reached.
We tried a variety of other approaches to tackle these issues:
Implemented the Gaussian approximation to predict in-focus position from the interval. This assumes that the image is formed from paraxial rays only, which is a good approximation in the case of microscopic imaging.
Implemented the Fibonacci search algorithm. It turns out that this is the optimal search algorithm for the situation of unimodal functions [2].
Implemented the parabola approximation to find in focus position.
Gradient search, which is a simple technique to locate local extrema, was also attempted but did not give satisfactory results, as the learning rate required for convergence was slow. Also, noise from images drastically disrupted the calculations. This was a significant problem even when the gradient was calculated by taking multiple pictures around the point of interest.
Fig. 2: Autofocus algorithm in action: the plot shows the increase of the variance (i.e. the focus score) of the image with each iteration.
Fig. 3: Indicative proportion of time spent in each phase of one implementation of an autofocus search
The performance of the final autofocus algorithm varies, depending on the starting point of the search. A typical processing time is around 5s, which allows for autofocus during live-stream imaging through the Webshell .
The autofocus algorithm we have implemented is open for further improvements and performance enhancement. Ideas for future development include:
A better hill climbing algorithm for finer focus after reaching the ""almost focused stage""
Automatic  measurement of the actual height to the CCD
More reliable motors use to improve precision
The Autofocus algorithm we have developed can be found in the Downloads page. The whole Software team contributed to its development.

We used matlab code to run the model, and yet this work still needed to be optimized. we assumed that the formation of AHL complex and the transcription of INP gene happen in series. Compared to Simbiology, we divided simulation time into 10 intervals so that we can apply the changeable effect of AHL complex on the INP production. In the output, we can easily find the synthesis rate of INP is accelerated and reaches maximal value at around 5 hours.
Week 1
The first day we divided the work. We decided to divide ourselves in smaller teams, one of these smaller teams started working on ethics, safety and education. We started with brainstorming; we were looking for an original idea for presenting the safety problems. After finding a good concept we read several papers. From Wednesday until Friday we worked really hard on writing a text about all the dangers our organism could entail.  Tuesday, the 5th of July Eurogentec and Delphi Genetics gave us an interesting presentation about their companies and what they do. Afterwards we talked about our projects and they gave us interesting insides and offered to help us when needed. We are very thankful and I hope to visit their lab in the future. Eurogentec agreed to synthesize primers and the AFP gene for us, free of charge. Delphi Genetics also agreed to sponsor us, by giving us a 96 well-plate with DG1 competent cells. Thank you for that!
Week 2
When we finished writing the final safety text, it was passed on to the design team to be put on the website. Afterwards, we started working on the ethics and education part. We wanted to create something outstanding and interactive which hadn’t been done before. That’s why we came up with the idea to make a small movie about Chris and Stefan who aren’t familiar with synthetic biology and GMO’s."

iGEM Toolkits: Gibson Assembly Vectors
About Gibson Assembly
Gibson assembly is a new synthetic biology tool that allows scar-free assembly of multiple gene-inserts in one isothermal reaction by using an exonuclease, polymerase, and heat-stable ligase to chew back, anneal, and repair gaps from homologous DNA fragments. This method is gaining popularity as it tends to be more efficient than standard restriction/ligation assembly, which can save a great amount of time in the cloning process. Overall, Gibson assembly allows teams to built large gene constructs with ease.
What happened last year?
The Gibson Cloning method is definitely not a new method to be introduced to the iGEM community.  In 2010, the Cambridge iGEM team created the BBF RFC 57 document which outlines a protocol for Gibson Assembly using standard BioBricks ( BBF RFC 10 ) that would allow many fragment inserts during a single cloning step. However, while creating the Magnetosome Toolkit, we found that this BioBrick standard was incapable of producing high yields of desired Gibson products even for two-fragment assemblies.
The ""pSB"" standard BioBrick vectors available through iGEM are not designed for efficient multiple-insert cloning beyond three fragments and are limited by ligation scars. The primary problem with a standard pSB vector is the self-complementarity of the two NotI sequences embedded in both the BioBrick prefix and suffix. These sequences prevent gene inserts from being incorporated efficiently, and do not produce a high yield of the Gibson product even in two-fragment assemblies. Generally, the backbone self-anneals and the recircularized plasmid has a combined prefix and suffix region that reads EcoRI-NotI-PstI.
To overcome this problem, the 2010 UW iGEM team developed new prefix and suffix regions that"

Procedure
Except mentioned in the coming Problems and Troubleshoots, the cloning strategy was following the standard BioBrick assembly rule. The inserts may be isolated from BioBricks vector  by gel extraction or directly amplified products by PCR with high-proofreading DNA polymerase.

Problem 1.
– BioBricks are unvailable
The part of PI promoter was not in stock. Therefore, we are unable to request from iGEM HQ. We asked and got the plasmid DNA from team NCKU_Tainan. But unfortunately, we can’t re-transform E. coli with materials we got from them.
Trouble-shooting 1.
– Synthesis of promoter sequences on primers
It’s good news that the glucose responsive promoter region contains only 36 bp (PI and Pcar). Therefore, we designed the sequences on the forward primer. The cloning was going smoothly in the following process. And DNA sequences are all confirmed by sequencing.
Problem 2.
– The part of lysis gene was flanked by a wrong BioBrick Prefix
We’ve finished the gene cloning for lysis genes. Unfortunately, according to our sequencing data, we found a mistake that the previous team added the wrong Prefix in front of the part. The part starts with ATG, but unfortunately, the team took the wrong Prefix “for all the other parts”.
Trouble-shooting 2.
– PCR using a primer with correct Prefix
We designed new primers with the correct Prefix “for the coding region parts” along with a strong RBS / a weak RBS, and performed PCR to get the part. This approach successfully solved the previous problem we met.
Demonstration
Experiment
First of all, we’d like to know how glucose responsive promoters (i.e., PI and Pcar) are induced in response to different concentration of glucose (GROUP 1) as shown in in Fig."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.
Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)
