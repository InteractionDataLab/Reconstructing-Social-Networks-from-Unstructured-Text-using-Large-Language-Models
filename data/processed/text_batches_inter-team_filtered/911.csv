High Fidelity PCR
With the objective to generate EPO biobrick with a Kanamycin fragment as intron, high fidelity PCR was done to amplify EPO biobrick from junction 2 between introns. Primers 103 and 104 were used to PCR amplify the backbone. At the same time, primers 105 and 106 were used to PCR amplify a fragment from Kanamycin from the plasmid pSB1K3. Primer sequences can be found at: Primer sequences .
50 µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 1.5 minutes and an annealing temperature of 65 °C. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

Conclusion
Biosafety is not a side part of synthetic biology, and it needs to have a greater emphasis in iGEM in general. The new category Biosafety in the parts registry aims at improving this. We hope to see in future years more biosafety projects arising.

Toxin/antitoxin. Consits of the insertion of the Holin + Endolysine and Anti Holin genes.
Holin is a protein that forms pores in cell membranes
Anti-holin binds to holin, inhibiting it's action.
Once pores are formed by holin, lysozyme can access the periplasmic space and degrade the cell wall, causing cell lysis.

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," a 2 l expression experiment
Investigator: Katrin
Aim: picking of clones for a 2 l expression experiment 2 clones of S. cerevisiae containing citrus limonene synthase (mit consensus sequence) were picked from the plate Andrea 29 (22.08.) and resuspended in 100 ml SCU medium + glucose
Vectorfragmentation of structural genes of Xanthohumol
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: The detection of our desired proteins via western blot failed three times. To rule out that recombinations of vector elements did take place, the vector backbone of our gene constructs and of a pYes vector from the limonengroup containing a gene insert whose protein could be detected via western blot was fragmented and the fragmentation patterns were compared.

The volume of DNA was calculated to have 500 ng of DNA. A suitable volume water was added to result in a total volume of 20 µl.
Incubation at 37 °C for 2h.
Verification of control digest by agarose gel electrophoresis:
20 µl of each digest product was mixed with 4 µl 6x DNA loading buffer and loaded into the gel. The separation process lasted 1h at 90 V.
Gel picture of vectorfragmentation 1
Gel picture of vectorfragmentation 2
The fragmentation pattern does not show unexpeted bonds. Therefore the gene constructs might have some point mutations which are not visible via Agarose gel electrophoresis. As the transformation of yeast with our constructs resulted in a reasonable number of cfu, it is likely that the URA3 gene and the 2µOri are not affected by possible mutations. Thats why we will continue our work with sequencing our gene constructs including their respective promoters.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#FerritinJournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"ussian Blue ferritin. Using this method we could exploit the iron core of ferritin by running a native PAGE and staining the iron core. This would then confirm the presence of our protein, therefore we ran initial tests of this method by running dilutions of the ordered ferritin solution in addition to other things. This method worked extremely well for staining ferritin controls, although the E.coli samples lack the bands, which is problematic as this indicates  either there is no ferritin being produced, or this stain isn’t sensitive enough for the amount of ferritin produced. FIGRUERUEURE
On a happier note, our work with gibson assembly has finally produced one of our constructs, the fusion of the heavy and light ferritin chains to an E-coil. Because this method appears to be relatively successful, we intend to order more primers and use Gibson assembly for the construction of other parts as well.
Week 19: September 2 - September 6
We got more Gibson primers for the creation of the fusion proteins containing TALA and TALB connected to ferritin. The pieces were PCRed out and the Gibson reaction was attempted and subsequently transformed. All of the resulting colonies did not contain our desired part and this may be due to the presence of template vector originally used for the PCRs. Therefore we will attempt to DPN1 treat the DNA in order to chew up the original vector.
Week 20: September 9 - September 13
The western blots for beta-lactamase and the TAL constructs appear to look good, despite the very faint bands seen on SDS-PAGE. Therefore it is possible ferritin is being expressed as well, but is too difficult to see due to background. We may attempt to try to clean up the sample through some crude purification techniques such as treating the sample at 75C, exploiting the stability of ferritin. Alternatively, once we attach the his-tag to our main coil-ferritin construct, we can try to observe ferritin experssion through western blots as well.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," most present in the lab, assisted by Emily Reeves and Joel Burton-Lowe were also commonly present in the lab this summer. In large part, the genome integration, cloning and characterisation analysis were performed by Dan Barber, Eloise Lloyd and Jack Fleet, as well as specifically the ministat was championed by Dan Barber.
Multiple members of the team were initially involved in research and facts finding for the modelling - Daniel Barber, Jack Fleet, Pablo Sharrock. However, the actual modelling work itself was mostly carried out by Joel Burton-Lowe, Andy Wild and help from Leanne Stanfield and Alan Williams.
We have collaborated with many teams and would like to thank them all for helping us, and we hope we helped them too. Alan Williams and Daniel Barber performed the Newcastle collaboration; Andy Wild performed the Edinburgh collaboration; Leanne Stanfield and Emily Reeves were most involved with the Purdue Collaboration; Alice Redgate and Pablo Sharrock performed the Stanford-Brown collaboration and despite the fact that we were unable to test with the Z1 strain from Glasgow, we would like to thank them very much for helping test the leakiness of our T7 promoter.
The wiki was designed and created by Alan Williams and Andy Wild, with help from Joel Burton-Lowe. Content for the wiki and wiki editing has been done by all members of the team, specific examples are: Daniel Barber writing much of the lab work and Jack Fleet writing and editing much of the Human Practices section, including all the equality and diversity content, with help from Emily Reeves and Andy Wild with the education sections. Joel Burton-Lowe has been the chief designer of the team - creating the posters, logo and other outreach materials.
In terms of public engagement and outreach Alice Redgate has been the most valuable member of the team: filming every vlog, every science fair/school visit, interviewing Professor Dawkins and recording and preparing all of the Desert Island Sciences. Various team members were responsible for communications with the academics, researchers and public figures for Desert Island Science, specifically Hannah Osborne, who arranged a meeting with Jim Al-Khalili. All members of the team have been involved in the scientific outreach at one stage, with Andy Wild, Eloise Lloyd, Joel Burton-Lowe, Alice Redgate and Pablo Sharrock having important roles in designing the board game. Presentations at the different schools were done by Jack Fleet, plus Jack Fleet and Eloise Lloyd prepared and performed the presentation at the Westminster meet-up. Leanne Stanfield was influential in the early stages of the module work, but this role was later taken up by Emily Reeves, who also presented the final product to the head of"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", one of the nurses on the ward. Jan explained to us the current treatment of UTIs. The protocol for treatment is to first take a urine sample to test for the presence of bacterial colonies. If the dip test comes back as positive, the patient is treated with a wide spectrum antibiotic, after which an antibiotic treatment specific to the type of bacteria identified may be given. Whether or not a catheter is fitted with prophylactic antibiotic treatment is the doctor’s decision.
Up to this point, we weren’t fully aware of the potential seriousness of UTIs. Jan told us about a case of a person getting septicaemia as a result of a UTI. The patient had received antibiotics for seven days and had come back for a check up. Their urine sample was clear and but, despite this, the patient rapidly went into septic shock. This life threatening infection is caused by the uro pathogen ic bacteria rising up the ureter to the kidney. If a patient becomes septic the catheter has to be removed or CAUTI can be fatal. This shocking example made our project feel very relevant and we took a lot from this initial conversation. We went on to investigate the pros and cons of the current methods of CAUTI treatment, and compare these to what our solution could offer. Following this meeting, the design of the catheter became an integral part of our project.
Laura Evans, from the Adams Ward (geriatric) in the John Radcliffe Hospital, also talked to us about the current treatment of UTIs, informing us that the use of antibiotics is often ineffective and therefore infections are recurrent. We asked Laura the following questions.
What happens when a catheterised patient tests positive for a UTI?
“Whether or not the catheter is removed if a patient tests positive for a UTI depends largely on the reason that the catheter has been fitted. In most cases, the catheter remains fitted and the patient is treated with a large dose of antibiotics.”
Is antibiotic resistance a problem?
“Yes, particularly on this ward. As we treat elderly patients with recurring infections, the uropathogens they succumb to are often resistant to antibiotic treatment. As a result, we have to try different combinations of antibiotics, but in many cases this does not stop recurrences of the infection.”

SynoProteiner
Abstract
Our team mainly focuses on programming the software by genetic algorithm, evaluating both optimization of single codon and codon pair and hence determining the fittest optimized sequences for expression in heterologous host cell.
In addition, Synoproteiner protects enzyme cutting site. Users can choose corresponding cutting sites, not substituted during the optimization, so that the power of chosen enzyme cutting site won’t fail.
Apart from the optimization, we have two additional functions. One is the statistics analysis, which provides the numbers and the proportion of the codon in the original and optimized sequences, making the optimization easier to understand. The other is the prediction of the protein folding rate. The purpose of the prediction is to seek the law of the folding rate in general, computing a relatively accurate folding rate value of the optimized sequences for the users.
Background
Synonymous codons and the efficiency
Except methionine and tryptophan, all amino acids can be encoded by two to six synonymous codons, resulting from the degeneracy of the genetic code.1 However, unequal utilization of the synonymous condons leads to the phenomenon of codon usage bias, which is mainly due to natural selection, mutation and genetic drift.2 According to related studies, codon usage bias has certain connection with gene expression level.3 The larger the value of codon usage bias is, the higher gene expression will be. So the problem, how to substitute the synonymous codons aimed at raising the efficiency of gene expression and thus increasing the production of recombination protein in heterologous host cell, is expected to be addressed.

Tip: Store plates inverted at 4°C in a dark room or wrapped in aluminum foil to preserve light-sensitive antibiotics. Do not store for longer than 3 months as antibiotics may degrade.
Antibiotics
Bacterial strains carrying plasmids or genes with antibiotic selection markers should always be cultured in liquid or on solid medium containing the selective agent. Lack of antibiotic selection can lead to loss of the plasmid carrying the genetic marker and potentially to selection of faster-growing mutants!
Tip: Prepare stock solutions of antibiotics separately from batches of liquid or solid media, sterilize by filtration, aliquot, and store in the dark at –20°C. Recommended stock and working concentrations for commonly used antibiotics are shown in the table Concentrations of commonly used antibiotics.
Tip: Before adding antibiotics to freshly autoclaved medium, ensure that the medium has cooled to below 50°C. Ampicillin (sodium salt)  50 mg/ml in water  –20°C  100 µg/ml (1/500)
Chloramphenicol  30 mg/ml in ethanol  –20°C  170 µg/ml (1/200)
Upon going to Kosuri lab, it was found that ampicillin plates were already available.  Fasih mentioned that they may be a few months old.
Conclusions: If access is available, the Yeates strain will be streaked on Sunday evening to allow for protein expression throughout next week.  A meeting with Dr. Kosuri should be made in order to outline the experimental approach.
Intro: Today Nithin, Phil, and I got certified to work in Sri's lab. Amp plates and other materials are in the iGEM cabinet in the cold room. I designed primers to express the cage within the iGEM vector to minimize transformations. Researched protein expression stuff.
iGEM Expression Primers:
prefix
handle-iGEM prefix-T7 promoter-RBS-spacer-gene
suffix
gene-his tag-double stop codons-iGEM suffix-handle
The primers had -25 kJ/mol homodimer association and other pretty bad secondary structures. However, the sites of interest were the restriction sites from the iGEM suffixes etc, so there isn't any redesign we can do. Oh well...

Mr Holmes
Welcome to the Teamwiki of the iGEM Aachen in 2014!
Cellock Holmes - a case of identity
Pathogens on solid surfaces in places where good hygiene is crucial pose a serious threat, since – even after cleaning – these can still be present in dangerous amounts. This is demonstrated by the high number of 3.2 million patients each year that have to be treated due to in the health sector acquired infections. And 37000 of those infections end deadly. The EU estimates that at least 20-30% of those cases would be preventable with an intensive hygiene program. However, for a more effective control these respective pathogens have to be identified.
We are developing a system that makes this possible. We are constructing a device with which pathogens can be detected easily, efficiently, effectively and less expensively by utilising genetically modified cells. We focus on a fast response time coupled with an automated analysis.
Our project is not only applicable to the detection of pathogens but we are looking to develop it further into a platform for a general 2D detection of nearly any cell or substance.
Our biological approach
In order to detect the pathogens fast, specifically and inexpensively we are building sensor cells to detect these pathogens. These sensor cells can identify pathogens in very low concentration by responsing to specific extracellular molecules either secreted by or displayed on the pathogens. These molecules trigger a fast fluorescence response by our immobilized sensor cells  which will be measured by our device.
You can follow our molecular approach in more detail by checking out our Biological Part/Labbook
The device
Our device Cellock Holmes is designed to be an automated 2D fluorescence analyser. We aim to be able to quickly measure the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells and automatically analyze the emitted images"

Cell patterning on chip
MITOMI
S.Maerkl and S. Quake recently developed a high-throughput microfluidic platform capable of detecting low affinity transient binding events on the basis of the mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions, called MITOMI (ref. 1). In the context of our project, we decided to use this technique to precisely look at the molecular interactions between our two key trans-activator molecules involved in quorum-sensing, RhlR and LuxR. We wanted to quantify the interactions of those two molecules, bounded or unbounded to their specific AHLs, with the sequences of the p(rhl) and p(lux) promoters. MITOMI is a good way to precisely characterize promoters and define cross-talks levels.
For detailed protocols, have a look at the Notebook .

Chip functionality and Charecterization of TetR-inducible promoter
We conducted several experiments with cells containing a plasmid with RFP under TetR-inducible promoter in order to characterize it. An overnight culture of RFP-cells was diluted in 1.5 mL of LB and loaded on chip. On the following picture, one can observe the flow that fills in the chambers.
The first column of the chip was also continuously flowed with TetR [0.2 mM] for diffusion on chip. We expected to observe the onset of RFP fluorescence when the trigger concentration of TetR would be reached.
However, the results obtained revealed several dysfunctionalities of the chip. In most of the chambers, the cells had difficulties to grow and, overall, RFP expression in these chambers diminished with time. The number of cells also decreased until it reached a 'constant' population size (this is however hard to assess since the experiment time was ~2 hours). This is illustrated by the following set of pictures, where one can clearly see that between t0 and t1 the number of cells in the chamber drops dramatically but then stays constant. RFP fluorescence also decreases.
We believe that this might be due to several factors including the small amount of medium available to cells to survive and the high concentration of TetR used to initiate the experiment. This makes the readout of our results very complicated as the RFP signal decreases due to loss of cell activity in general. In these circumstances it is impossible to monitor the expression of RFP in response to TetR stimulation as the cells are in distress.
However, for some individual positions in the chip, we recorded a response consistent with our expectations: we can observe"

Week 1 (05/21 – 05/27)
We start to meet in the lab. We have been assigned a big lab in Malga, the      building that hosts all the teaching labs. It’s the biggest one.
We’re starting to design the constructs and primers and prepare LB      medium for culture. We also make a list of all we have at our disposal and      what we need to order.
And so it begins.      I've been designing constructs and primers for the last few days, but finally it's time to enter the lab and get things started! I'm going to work on cloning and characterization of araC-pBAD, the promoting system we are going to use with CysE, the gene that will allow us to clean statues. I will extract the araC-pBAD promoter from part BBa_I0500 from the registry and then put a GFP under his control to study it.
This is the first week of wet lab! We spent few days organizing spaces, equipment, supplies, making competent cells, buffers stocks, medium for coltures. We also started extracting the first parts from the distribution kit, but i had no luck with part BBa_I0500, containing araC-pBAD promoter. At first i thought i was terrible with the transformation protocol, but looking better in the registry i saw that the"

BBa_K1963000 (Hfq from E. coli K-12)
Hfq is an RNA binding protein. It can bind to a range of RNA sequences but is often used in conjunction with an RNA hairpin formed by the E. coli micC sequence.
BBa_K1963001 (Hfq from Serratia marcescens DB10/DB11)
An RNA binding protein from the Hfq family.
BBa_K1963002 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the E. coli micC hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host or with co-expression of E. coli Hfq in an alternative host. The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by the micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed between C-193 and T-194.
BBa_K1963003 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the Serratia chiA hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production with co-expression of S. marcescens Hfq BBa_K1963001 . The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by a chiA hairpin sequence from the 3'-end of the S. marcescens chiA gene encoding a chitinase, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The use of an S. marcescens chiA hairpin/Hfq pairing should provide very high specificity in chosen chassis organisms. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed betweeen C-193 and G-194.

Results
1. Public perception of bacteria
One of the first questions that was in the survey asked the general public to choose what image they associate with bacteria. One image showed an image of bacteria to be green and sick looking (associate with bad bacteria) (option 2) and the other image was of an electron microscope image of a bacteria (option 1). Due to copyright issues, we can’t post the images onto our wiki. 89.8% of the population associate that image with bacteria. However, 7.2% chose option 2 to be the image that they associate with bacteria. Which still indicates that the general public still think that bacteria is bad, which in reality is not the case, as bacteria can be good and bad for you. Most people who chose option 2 were from the UK.
The Wechat survey showed that 74.17% of people think option 1 describes bacteria better, 20% of people think option 2 is better. The Wechat survey showed a higher percentage of people still associate bacteria to be bad.
2. Knowledge of Synthetic Biology
In response to a question asking the public how much do they know about synthetic biology. 19.9% said they know nothing and 57.2% said they know a little. We also asked what the general public think synthetic biology is defined as, some of the responses can be seen below, where most of the respondents have a general, accurate idea of synthetic biology whilst others either skipped the question or answered “I don’t know”. The Wechat survey showed that 59.17% know nothing about synthetic biology at all.
Popular answers:
“Creating things” – Creativity and design seemed to be a key word in most responses
“Genetic engineering”
“Man made”
“Genetically modified organisms used to create products we use/need everyday”
“The ‘direction’ of biology be external forces, such as humans”
“The study of how to engineer life to obtain organisms with new features of benefit to humankind”
“interesting”
3. Genetically modified organisms
Even though 80.7% of the survey responders are accepting of synthetic biology, 8.4% of the population either said that they don’t agree with genetically modifying organisms or that synthetic biologists are playing with god. We also asked if they thought that the benefits of genetically modifying organisms outweigh the risks. 81.3% said yes whilst 13.9% said no. 66."
Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Ethics2_-_-_TEXT.html," a meeting on 31st May (with Ana in person!) and shooting sessions on July.
26/04/12 Skype meeting with Ana.
Aim of the meeting: We will discuss which are  the most relevant ethical issues that you envision in relation with your ""talking bacteria project"". We will also discuss the sources you can use to search and think of these issues. Finally, we will discuss how to translate those issues into a movie script.
Ethical issues discussed:
List of relevant issue in relation to talking bacteria project:
1. General issues/Bioethics:
a) biosafety (i.e. safety as related to lab practices)
b) biosecurity (uninteded consequences of biological research, i.e. bioterrorism, etc…)
2. Developing affective relations with your bacteria (ending up in addiction, physiological disorders, falling in love, etc..) 3. Colonization: bacteria becoming superior than us and taking over humanity 4. Autonomy: bacteria becoming autonomous/humans loosing autonomy 5. Control: Humans loosing control/Humans creating disorder in nature, how to recover balance in nature) 6. Issues related to nature/directed selection (again, autonomy/control) 7. Cyborgs/Robots ethics: humans loosing their identities: what is to be human? How are cyborgs different from humans?  8. Bacteria controlling human bodies and trying to imitate humans 9. What is artificial/what is natural 10. Bacteria can choose a human body (good looking, healthy, etc…): freedom of choice?  11. Bacteria becoming superior than humans 12. As bacteria become superior, issues of social segregation emerge (racism) 13. Bacteria living in human bodies (cyborg) become better than humans 14. Technologies will enable human-beings to transcend the limits of humanity: transhumanist ethics/Singularity)  15. Non-desired effect of scientific research: bacteria become conscious and autonomous beings.  16. Non-desired effects are related to uncertainty and the fact that scientists just do their work in an automated way and they do not stop to think 17. Uncertainty/non-desired effects: There are things that we do not know and things that we do not know that we do not know (known unknowns/unknowns unknowns 18.  Intelligent bacteria conquer the world subduing humans. They apply eugenic practices to bacteria population (selection of the best) and reverse eugenics to human population (selecting the most"

We then resuspended three lines of J23102, three lines of white chlor cells I732020, and three lines of our K1477014 (The new number for Ivy Tech South Bend). We also pulled a new line of k112806 (endolysin) from the 2014 registry plate #3, well 12K. We then electroporated and plated this line in triplicate, we also started three lines of I712074 (T7 promoter.) With this we will transform the promoter, k112806 ,and LacZoperon with the Ω part into destination plasmid pSB1AT3 to get our second registry part to submit.
We also made new plates, Amp large plates and all four antibiotic resistances on the small plates. We then tested both controls on all four antibiotics. Amp plate amp seems to grow. B. cereus has the capability to adapt to antibiotics such as chlor.

We transformed Top 10 cells through electroporation with registry parts K112806 (Endolysin,) I732020 (LacZoperon Mutant,) J23102 (p-con) and I712074 (T7 promoter.)
After streaking on plates, and leaving them in the incubator for a day, there was growth on all plates, showing that a successful transformation occured.
Plates containing J23102 were red-another sign of success. Unfortunately, it looks like contamination has arisen as well, and is spreading on plates with I712074 and K112806 growth.
The contamination persisted all week, but we were able to get plates with transformed parts that contained no contamination growth.
We then ran a DNA purification protocol of J23102 and I732020 to get them ready for a biobrick assembly protocol.

The data along with the fitted values of the model and the confidence interval are pictured below.

Residuals Analysis
We also run a residuals analysis to ensure this linear model is proper to fit the data. First, we                     draw histogram and QQ-plot of standard residuals.
Fig.5
Fig.6
From the histogram, the standard residuals equally drop in the two sides of zero, which means that                     the residuals are possibly independent. Also, the QQ-plot implies the significant normality of                     residuals.
Results and Inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of H2O2 and the                     fluorescence intensity divided by the OD value, which the H2O2 is in the                     interval from 0 to 2.5mM.                     And we also analyzed the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we can                     properly predict the output when the concentration of H2O2 is in certain                     interval.

A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our Y. lipolytica genome; assembly of the plasmid inside S. cerevisiae using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasmid into E. coli for amplification, and insertion of the gene cassette into Y. lipolytica using lox sites; and assembly of gene cassette/plasmid inside Y. lipolytica and integration into genome using lox sites. For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome using homologous recombination.

About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis. While some of us were writing, others were meeting with professors on campus to discuss our ideas and to pick up some S. cerevisiae strains to use as our experimental organism. We learned from Rohinton Kamakaka that we could insert Cre recombinase into our yeast using a plasmid, so now we are in pursuit of a method to both express and remove Cre recombinase once we no longer need it. Our yeast parents have been growing our Y. lipolytica and amplifying the plasmids that we have received. Our wiki boys have almost finished formatting the website to their (or our) liking and are now adding more content about our project itself. A few of our team members scheduled an interview with a representative from Family Planning 2020, but due to timing issues, had to reschedule.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," is directly  proportional to the density of type A cells. As the internal model however  demonstrates, this is a very rough approximation.  Bacteria behave differently based on their surroundings and  the signals they have been exposed to earlier. After all, protein concentrations  can fluctuate due to external disturbances, so the response to  signals from the environment can be heterogeneous across a bacterial population.  We can simulate this dynamic response using the internal model and therefore  incorporating the internal model into the hybrid model provides a path for  further improvement of our model and possibly more clues into the mechanisms of  pattern formation in nature. However, during our project we have decided to focus   our resources on  the individual models therefore we leave this next step for future iGEM teams  to explore.

Figure 9     Impact of lux pR leakage (on Safety Catch Plasmid) on the Performance of the System
Based on the previous results, both the transcription efficiency and the leakage level of lux pR seems to be crucial to the performance of the system. An optimal combination of transcription efficiency and leakage level is required. Thus, we seek to obtain a better mutant form of lux pR. In the end, we developed lux pR-HS, an improved version of the promoter.
Summary:
- lux pR leakage on Safety Catch plasmid influences the “threshold” of the system.
- Both leakage and transcription efficiency when activated should be taken into consideration when building an optimal promoter.
3.4   Effect of IPTG
IPTG can be added to the system to eliminate the effect of lacI. Addition of IPTG should result in increased production of guide RNA, making the system more difficult to induce. In other words, lacI helps to modulate the threshold of system activation and adjusts the rate of GFP synthesis. To validate this hypothesis, we run simulations of our model.
4.Sensitivity Test and Robustness of the System
4.1 Overview
What is robustness? Robustness means some properties of the system are able to remain the same under perturbations. In our case, if our model is ""robust"" to some extent, then perturbations of certain ""inputs"" of the model should cast little effect on the ""outputs"". As for the ""inputs"", they can be the initial concentrations of chemical species and biological parameters. As for the outputs, they are the simulated GFP concentrations at given time points.
First of all, we would like to determine whether the model is robust given perturbations in parameter values. theoretically, none of the values of these parameters can be exactly precise, so confirming that minor shifts from ideal values do not cause the result of simulation dramatically is naturally important. Robustness to parameter values is somehow closely related to ""sensitivity"" and ""sensitivity test"".... The sensitivities of an ODE system are defined as the derivatives of the solution with respect to the parameters. We choose to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis, which is meant to be used for exploring the sensitivity over a larger domain without calculating derivatives.
A scan of parameters as well as sensitivity test can be done using R, with the package ODEsensitivity. We primarily employ the ""Morris Method"" for global sensitivity analysis. Morris Method is also known as Morris' OAT Method, where OAT stands for ""One"

A new digestion of NAT1 was performed using EcoRI & PstI was made. Each of the NAT1 digests (N1,N2,N3) were ligated with both a digested backbone and a linear backbone resulting in the six ligates (N1B,N1L,N2B,N2L,N3B,N3L). These we subsequently transformed and plated alongside with the gibson transformants.  Experiment: Gibson assembly of NAT1 into backbone.
Using the prefix/suffix homologous ends of the linear backbone and our NAT1 PCR extracts, we performed gibson assembly for insertion of the NAT1 gene into the backbone. These were transformed and plated for growth O/N.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"
The iGEM team Aachen wants to produce the photocaged Subtilisin E and the organisms, which can produce the new enzymes. So they are in direct competition to companies like Novozymes or Roche, which offer enzymes for different applications. Until now they only produce in a very small scale. Maybe they can work together with other enzyme producing companies or directly with washing companies. It would definitely be necessary to have an industrial partner to benefit from their experiences on the global market, because the German laundry detergent market is too competitive and controlled by a few corporations.
Politic regarding the distribution of the new product
The distribution of the new product depends on the way the iGEM Team Aachen wants to introduce the new product on the market. On the one hand they can try to industrialize it with the help of already existing enzyme companies. One the other hand their product could be applied in the washing industry and used for washing detergents. That’s the most probable application of their protease. With the help of these already existing companies it is possible to distribute their product. For example it could be sold in local supermarkets and drugstores. Probably it won´t be sold in low budget supermarkets, because of the production and developmental costs. Moreover, the iGEM Team Aachen has to care about the distribution of their light tool. Maybe they can include it as a free give-away to the first bottle of washing detergent and start in this way promoting the use of its product.
Politics of communication of the new product
The new product of the iGEM Team Aachen should be communicated as an alternative to already existing washing detergents and there should be a focus on the ecological impacts of boric acid. The product of the iGEM Team Aachen should ban boric acid and make it possible to use the washing detergents with the same quality as before.  Instead of boric acid they want to communicate the use of light to activate the protease. As the iGEM Team wants people to activate the protease with light, they also have to communicate this difference. That’s where I see the biggest problem for the iGEM Team Aachen. They have to convince the people that they should not only invest more time in the washing process, but also to change their customs when it comes to cleaning their clothes. Moreover they would need to convince big companies.  Although the iGEM Team invented a gadget for activating the protease and in a survey the team performed the majority of the people said that they would spend more time for activating the protease, this idea has to be transferred"
MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," University of Florida, we developed an effective electroporation protocol. Our attempts at electroporation were based on protocol used successfully on other organisms. We evaluated parameters such as cell washing number and solutions, DNA concentration, pre- and post-electroporation incubation, and voltage of electroporation.
Goal 4: Clone or synthesize an ACC deaminase from bacterial or fungal sources
Dr. Gregory Bonito’s Lab at Michigan State University maintains a culture collection of fungi and bacteria isolated from plants and soil. Several of these isolates have confirmed or suspected acdS genes (coding for ACC deaminase), including Fusarium oxysporum, Trichoderma sp., Ralstonia picketii, and Burkholderia sp. From our own culturing, we isolated Pseudomonas and Burkholderia cultures which expressed ACC deaminase activity. We were successfully able to clone acdS from Pseudomonas sp. 1C2P-04, isolated from a wild grass species.
Goal 5: Transform the bacteria to allow for fluorescent labeling and ACC deaminase expression
We first attempted to transform the bacteria using a simple fluorescent expression vector, and we used BBa_K608011 for this purpose. After many attempts were were unable to see expression with this vector, and we attempted to express acds in bacteria and detect its expression by plating on DF-ACC agar. These trials were unsuccessful, and we transitioned back to proof-of-concept using fluorescent markers. After finally observing fluorescent colonies, we proceeded to construct the fusion protein acdS-eGFP in the part BBa_K2633000 . This part was first built using cloned sequences and was not restriction legal. A later synthesized version was constructed. While our transformed bacteria have been observed to be fluorescent, we have not observed ACC deaminase activity in the transformed bacteria.
Goal 6: Demonstrate that the transformed bacteria could reinfect a grass and persist in roots
Multiple attempts were made to infect Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, with our transformed bacteria. Early on we experienced poor germination rates, likely because the seeds were of poor quality. After our first plants had grown to maturity and produced seeds, we then had high quality seed for growing plants.

We were hopeful that this connection in creativity would manifest through the direct integration of art and science.

While at Walker, we described our project, gave a brief lesson in DNA composition, and then led an edible DNA demonstration for forty of Ms. Pagni’s students. Afterwards, we went on to describe the art competition. The overarching goal was to use art to describe and reflect the ideas of synthetic biology.
We received over forty submissions, of which only five of the students had heard of synthetic biology before our visit, but 38 of them were interested in further exploring synthetic biology. What we were most impressed by, aside from the sheer number of artistically talented students,  were the creative ways in which students approached the task. Some focused on mutations, while many used watercolors to depict cells. Using the DNA double helix as a guide, some students focused on the genes themselves. Ultimately, the artwork, some of which is pictured here, reflected an understanding and a unique way of approaching science.
Wastewater Sticker Project
Solving world problems is not always glamorous. When our team decided to further investigate wastewater, we were not sure what kind of smelly situation we had entered. In our visit to the local Rivanna Wastewater Treatment, Wastewater Treatment manager Tim Castillo quickly revealed that the toilet flush is just the beginning. In fact, the process of wastewater treatment is complicated, and we found this system, which would come to inspire our project, quite fascinating.
As we went about beginning to work with P. denitrificans, a main player in wastewater treatment, we realized that most people, quite like ourselves, knew little about water treatment aside from the pungent aroma.
We thought it would be appropriate to pay homage to the many employees who literally do our dirty work by educating the public about wastewater. We researched not only the modern-day processing of wastewater, of which there are several, but also the story of how such a process came to be. Dating back to the Minoan Empire of 3000 BC we tell the story of wastewater treatment through the ages. The link to our site is here .
The next step came in distribution. How were we going to get students, or anyone for that matter, interested in learning about wastewater? It was only too fitting to try to educate others about the business of wastewater treatment while they were doing their business. Creating and placing these attention-grabbing stickers in U"

Microbial Electrolysis Cell
what we built
Background
Microbial electrolysis reverses the flow of current in a more common microbial fuel cell (MFC) to produce hydrogen at lower energy input than other electrolysis technologies utilizing bacteria-mediated electron transfer. The basic components are a voltage source, media for the microbes, a cathode and an anode. Unlike in an MFC, MEC designs typically don’t separate the anode and cathode with a cation exchange membrane due to loss of hydrogen ion diffusion, increased costs and increased complexity with low gains in efficiency. Additionally, an MEC needs to incorporate a way of containing and collecting hydrogen gas produced by the cathode.
We looked at the drilled block design pioneered by Bruce Logan at Penn State and the 3D printed design made by Beiefeild 2013 IGEM team. However, we wanted to be able to insert and remove probes to analyze local pH, dissolved oxygen and potential at different parts of the cell in addition to adding a port for gas collection. We were also concerned about the hydrogen permeability of 3D printed parts, in which layers of plastic may not fully fuse and the program may insert small gaps during manufacturing.
Design
The design incorporated 6 plexiglass plates held together by long screws with rubber gaskets between plates and around ports for the probes, wires, electrodes, pump attachment, and gas removal attachment. Gaskets were secured around ports for inserted components by small screws. We built two chambers to run parallel experiments with modified and wild-type E. coli. We used carbon brush half electrodes to maximize available surface for Geobacter growth at low cost, planning to incorporate Geobacter on both the cathode and anode instead of using a platinum cathode. This design avoids the financial and ecological costs of an inorganic electrode and allows a greater opportunity to test improvements via synthetic biology since biological processes and cells are present at both electrodes. The half electrodes were heat treated at 290 degrees Celsius to improve their effective surface area for Geobacter growth.
This design was effective for low cost, rapid prototyping. However, the seal failed at the corners and ports for probes and wires. Due to equipment"

1.Introduction
1.1 Why do we need a model
Developing a mathematical model of the systems we established (or plan to establish) is a vital step in our project. A model, namely, is a mathematical representation of the system. The model can help us with the following:
- Confirming that our system has the potential to work as expected. For example, as for the Test System, the model should present us that both the self-activating component and safety-catch component work in theory.
- Determining optimal conditions for the system to work. e.g. Initial concentration of AHL.
- Estimating biological parameters.
- Understanding the mechanism of the system better.
- Optimizing the design of our final project.
1.2 What is our model about?
The model is basically established by using ODEs (ordinary differential equations) to describe reactions and events in the system. ODE is a powerful tool when it comes to modelling a dynamic system. It allows us to predict the behavior of the system at given conditions, and to analyze several features of the system such as robustness and stability. For the sake of simplicity, various assumptions are made when developing the model. These assumptions usually tend to simplify our systems, reducing our workload. According to the assumptions, many trivial details are omitted, while the overall properties and behaviors of the model remain unchanged.
When describing the reactions and events involved, we mainly apply the law of mass action, which assumes the system is in quasi steady state. When modelling reactions that resemble enzymatically catalyzed reactions and events that involve ligand binding, we refer to Hill Equation, which is simple but effective.
We focused on building a model for the “Test System”. The model depicts the behaviors of the Test System under several different conditions, and highlights some key features and properties of the system. The model is generally successful as it predicted the behavior of the system correctly, according to our experiments. We have performed various analysis regarding the model and pinpointed some intriguing characteristics of the system.
In addition to this, we also built a model for the Neon System. Using the model, we can simulate how Neon System works. It can serve as a “guideline” for our future work on the Neon System.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," should also be affordable, well-storable, sustainable and its synthesis should be straight-forward, safe and scalable. As documented on the design page , the search led us to the combination of a dextran hydrogel with a long sugar-binding adhesin derived from the Antarctic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis. The adhesin naturally binds glucose with high affinity (25). It is thus a good match with dextran, which is a polymer of glucose.
Dextran is biocompatible and has a high porosity which ensures bacterial viability. It is also freeze-dryable and has a high diffusivity (26). Dextran has been demonstrated to be suitable for tissue-engineering, and is thus expected to be suitable for biomedical applications (27). It is also relatively affordable (see our cost calculation below) and the synthesis procedure is relatively straightforward. Furthermore, it can be easily sterilized during polymerization (28). Finally, the gel has been proven robust even under harsh conditions. Besides our own efforts, Team Hamburg tried to dissolve our gel under several chemical conditions, but had difficulties finding a successful strategy. The synthesis does however require toxic components. To minimize the safety risk for manufacturers and allow easy upscaling, we researched alternative procedures as part of our safe-by-design principle. For more information, please check our Safe-by-Design .
To secrete lysostaphin, we made E. coli produce lysostaphin fused to a secretion tag compatible with the secretion pathway used for the adhesin. This allows for the efficient secretion of both lysostaphin and the adhesin while minimizing the burden on the bacteria. The different components of our system (adhesin, secretion system, lysostaphin) were designed to be individually inducible for optimal control over all components.
Results
Our microscopy results  confirmed the high porosity of the dextran hydrogels. The structure seemed suitable for bacterial viability, as viability experiments  indicated that large numbers of E. coli bacteria survive in the hydrogels for at least a week. Future experiments will need to provide more accurate results on the survival rate. Furthermore, it would be interesting to test survival over longer periods of time. Nevertheless, the observed survival is a clear improvement on the results of iGEM Groningen 2014 mentioned above. Leakage experiments have demonstrated that bacteria not only survive, but also stay inside the gel. With this combination of survival and containment, we have made a prototype living material. In addition, we confirmed  that the hydrogel is non-toxic, which is crucial for a wound healing"

Furthermore, the results, which the model has simulated the growth condition of the algae in limited light and nutritive substance, quite tally with the actual situation. In some limiting cases, such as limited light with unlimited nutritive substance or unlimited light with limited nutritive substance, these equations can be simplified into some common first order ordinary differential equations.</p>

 Orthogonal Protease Collection
Our Orthogonal Protease Collection (nominated for Best Collection) is composed of a set of site-specific proteases that recognize        different 7-aminoacid residue motif targets (PPVp, SuMMVp, SbMVp and TEVp). The proteases were tested and are deposited as single chain coding         sequences and as split protein fragments for light- and chemically-inducible reconstitution. The collection also contains the corresponding cyclic         luciferase reporters for each of the proteases. We determined that the new proteases are even more active than the TEVp that has been the standard         in biotechnology for several decades. We demonstrated that the split versions of all four proteases can be activated by different external stimuli,         such as small molecules or light, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the system. These proteases have been used to design signaling pathways         and logic circuits in mammalian cells operating at the post-translational level.

With the aid of DNAZone, the educational outreach center of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Nucleic Acids Science and Technology (CNAST), the iGEM team aided in the development of four kits/labs for students and teachers to use in a classroom setting. These kits were taken out into the community and classrooms to be beta tested for final production occurring in January. They were also shipped out to different points around the United States and to an orphanage in Bolivia for further testing.
Creature Feature Modeling Lab Beyond the Bench[mark] Lab
Our original iGEM baby, Creature Feature was a lab born out of necessity but kept and worked on due to its initial success with 60 seventh graders. In Creature Feature, students receive a creature’s characteristics (phenotypic candy) based on a genetic sequence (genotype) that they create out of beads (alleles). They construct this creature out of their materials and are told about evolutionary adaptation and how this creature’s features were a result of decades living in a very dry and hot climate. An environmental disaster is on its way, the great flood, and students are tasked to genetically alter the creature to become waterproof should they want it to survive. Extracting one of the three different waterproof genes from SuperCreature, students are handed an imperfect Ziploc to waterproof their creatures. Students then have to figure out a method and materials to complete the Ziploc bag, or at least seal it order to survive the Great Flood (a water-dunking test)!
Future Impact: Creature Feature took to students and teachers alike by storm! Created on June 6th on a winding down Friday afternoon, it was presented to 60 seventh graders as part of an 80-minute lesson plan the following Wednesday. Due to the popularity with the kids that first day, we decided to pursue this lab, back it up with scientific meaning, and present it to DNAZone as another kit for teachers to use. Approved with further testing, Creature Feature has become a hit on modeling synthetic biology and has reached 106 people so far with a"

Test of Green and Red Light Sensing-Imaging System
The procedure of experiment is the same as that of blue light test. The test started at 19:00, August 5th. After 22-hours' growing up, bacteria after centrifuge appear red, but not obvious like blue and green. However, the GFP seemed not influenced by light stimulation, which means it was also green in the darkness.
The whole result shows in the following, and 2 days later the OD600nm of all tubes is in the following as well.
Pattern Test
To test whether bacteria could produce a pattern with light stimulation, an experiment using projector to generate a pattern was conducted.
The pattern was this:
And the whole divice like this: a computer producing pattern, a projector which converts electric signal into light signal and an imaging box. Medium is put into the dark box and the whole process includes about 1 day.
Because blue light sensing-imaging system works well in our project, we used it to produced a shadow in the media and then added other bacteria later, just like engraving the picture in the earliest photographing.
Test of a sun pattern focused on sharp shape of a picture is in the following. The result showed bacteria could produce protein at the edge of the picture accurately.

Conjugation
Conjugation of red and blue photography system
After thousands of rounds of tests and condition improvements, red and blue light photography system has been successfully tranferred into C.crescentus using conjugation. The results are as following:
Blue conjugation
Protein electrophoresis also proved expression of amilCP.
Red conjugation
Verification of C.crescentus
We use Gram Staining to verify the C.crescentus:
Prepare thin smear bacteria on a clean slide.
Cover the smear with few drops of crystal violet for 1-2min.
Wash excess strain with water.
Add few drops of iodine solution on the smear for 1-2min.
Rinse in water.
Wash with 95% ethanol for 20s.
Rinse in water.
Stain with 1% safranin for 2-3min.
Wash stain in excess water.
Look at it under a microscope.
Growth curves for conjugation
To find the optimum of conjugation conditions, we tested the development of S17-1 and C.crescentus in liquid PYE at 30 degree centigrade separately, which is almost the same condition while conjugation though the real conjugation is"
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," for me to scent out that the majority of people lacked knowledge of synthetic biology, some of them even had deep misunderstanding of gene manipulation. Even though meticulously designing and preparing for the propaganda foldout, I found out that few people had interest in our project. So at the beginning, collecting the questionnaire was extremely difficult for us. After lectures and propaganda, we filled with elation and amazement for the results. The difference is significant!! Feeling our small efforts on raising public consciousness of petroleum engineering and synthetic biology affords us a sense of achievement and satisfaction.”

iGEM Asia Team Leaders’Workshop
NKU_China sent Professor Cheng Zhihui and the Team Leader Yin Zixi to attend the IGEM Asia Team Leaders’ Workshop, which was held in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on July 17th, 2017. The officials of IGEM expounded the biosafety issue, the assessment and procedure of the competition and other questions in which igemers were interested. After the workshop, Professor Cheng Zhihui and Dr. Pier Milett had a profound and practical discussion about the problems we came across in the project. Then, we took a photo together.

Team Tianjin and team TJU_China
Team NKU_China and Team Tianjin have communicated closely since the teams were built. On April 3rd, 2017, the newly formed team NKU_China and team Tianjin planned to have a meeting during team Tianjin’s stay for a campus talk on Begonia Festival. We came across the team TJU_China on the way to the meeting. We noticed that their project of blood type test attracted lots of visitors. Also we learned that it was the first time they had participated in IGEM. Due to the limit of time, we just took a picture together and waved goodbye to each other. Then we finally arrived at the site of the campus talk. Some girls from our team who just started to know about IGEM joined in an interesting science quiz organized by TJU, and they got pillows with begonia patterns as small gifts for their good performance. It is so lovely to see that the girls held the pillows tightly when they posed for a photo.

Signal amplifier
F.menolascina 19:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC): Wolkenhauer's group in Rostock recently published this paper on BMC Sys Bio. It describes a mechanism used in the JAK-STAT pathway to amplify a signal in a signaling cascade. The principle doesn't seem to be too complex and we could think to take it as model to add another important ""brick"" to the parts registry: a signal amplifier.
Solving combinatorial problems
F.menolascina 19:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC): This paper describes a quite interesting idea on how to reengineer bacteria to solve classical problems in computer science theory. This work resembles former applications of DNA computing in combinatorial optimization problem solving; however in this case living systems, rather than molecules, are used.
Other interesting stuff
Magnetotactic bacteria
Somewhere I read something about this 'magnetic' bacteria ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotactic_bacteria ) - maybe this can be used for orientation/movement. This organism is already successfully used to produce electrical energy.
Filippo Menolascina 12:30, 26 May 2008 (EDT): Bastiaan's idea seems very interesting...we could apply time-varying magnetic field stimulation to make bacteria move, or ""dance""! We could even think at some form of magneto-activated memory if MTB orientation can be selectively modified (something like the mechanism computer hard drives work on). Bastiaan, do you know anything about the issues in cloning the genes involved in biomineralisation stated in the wikipage you pointed out? (Bastiaan: No, not really)
Rad Haghi, 10 June 2008 I have something in my mind about this bacteria. As I understood they can be aligned into magnetic field. This procedure is like something that we have in piezoelectric materials. The material is aligned into the electric field so it can have a small change in volume which can be used for a small movement. Maybe it is applicable on this kind of bacteria to use them as an actuator that produce a precise movement. Definitely it has very small movement but this small movement can be used in microsystems and MEMS.

Petrobrick Overview
As a side project, we decided to characterize a previous team’s work on an existing biobrick. For that purpose, we chose to characterize the University of Washington’s Petrobrick. The Petrobrick, once transformed into E. coli, acts as a microbial alkane production pathway. Two enzymes are co-transformed to create this biobrick: Acyl-ACP Reductase ( AAR - Bba_K90032 ) and Aldehyde De-Carbonylase ( ADC - Bba_K90031 ).
AAR reduces cellular fatty acyl-ACP from bacterial fatty acid via into fatty aldehydes. ADC then removes the carbonyl group on the fatty aldehyde, resulting in an odd number alkane chain one carbon shorter than the original Acyl-ACP fatty acid. In turn, both of the enzymes convert fatty acids into an odd number alkane by means of a constitutive protein expression plasmid.

A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Welcome to our data page! Here we will summarise everything we achieved this summer. Of course, if you want a more extensive explanation, please check out the corresponding wiki page.
Since the European Jamboree, we characterized our bricks further via Mass Spectrometry studies of MeS and quantitated the aphid response to the EBF producing BanAphids .
Modelling
Our project aims to reduce aphid infestations and thus improve crop yields for the industrial end-user and the private customer. With an environmental project like ours, the importance of the computer and the feedback from our future end-users should not be underestimated. We adapted our project according to survey information and modelling results. Ultimately, we hope to reduce the costs of field tests via our in silico work.
First, we started our modelling on the cellular level ."

The final design of our product looks like this:
This basic design is the first step to tackling the concerns we came across when talking to professionals about our project.
It is a filter designed to target the desired bacteria (for our project we chose Vibrio cholerae and Shigella) and prevent it from causing infection. The small filter with the bacteria inside means the bacteria won’t be ingested, and therefore prevents any problems of the E. coli and RNA not surviving in the body. Also, having the filter come in a bottle would increase the chance of our filter being used in developing countries as well asproviding a container for storing water."

The calibration line of fluorescence versus mass amount GFPmut3 is given in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Calibration line of the fluorescence signal of GFPmut3 versus its amount in nanograms.
The corresponding function of the GFPmut3 calibration line is:
With massGFP in ng.
In the modelling, the fluorescent data in Figure 5 will be further converted to molecules GFPmut3/cell and the promoter activity will be calculated for both the 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) level of rhamnose induction. With this kinetic experiment, we have proven that our csgA-GFPmut3 construct is able to produce different levels of GFPmut3 by varying the rhamnose concentration.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for visualization of bacterial amyloid curli
Background
With our biofilm formation model we aimed to estimate how many times the nanowires overlap in order to predict the biofilm strength. One of the variables required for this model is the persistence length. In order to determine it, we have to visualize the nanowires produced by our engineered bacteria. Moreover we wanted to visualize the difference between induced and uninduced cultures containing the csgA_pSB1C3 plasmid with a rhamnose inducible promoter. These experiments  required using an electron microscope.
Electron microscopes use electrons to visualize nano-objects, such as the curli nanowires. In the large “gun” the electrons get enough space to accelerate before they illuminate the sample. As shown in Figure 7 after the electrons are fired by the gun, an electric field of several thousand volts is applied to the electron beam in order to point this to the sample. In the case of an TEM, the electrons pass through the sample where the detector can detect the sample (Boysen & Muir, 2011).
Figure 7: Transmission electron microscopy. The picture on the left represents a model of the TEM and on right the different elements and positions within the microscope (Boysen & Muir, 2011).
Methodology
At first we measured an OD600 of 3.00 of an overnight culture of ∆csgA_csgA_pSB1C3 cells. We diluted the sample down to an OD600 of approximately 0.05, with LB medium + CAM (antibiotic, chloramphenicol). To achieve an end volume of"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

From Idea to Project
We were inspired to join the fight against Emerald Ash Borers (EABs) - an invasive beetle to the Ash tree - because their infestation is a local problem in Missouri. We were familiar with the use of Bacillus Thuringiensis (BT) toxins in agricultural crops, and wanted to explore using BT toxins to help create Ash trees resistant to EABs.
Though it is unknown exactly how long Emerald Ash Borers have been in the US, they were first identified in Michigan in 2002. Since then, they have been identified in 30 U.S. states and have caused millions of dollars in damage. EABs are a beetle which originated in Asia; it is expected that these beetles came to the U.S. on infested wood materials. Because Asian ash trees coevolved with the beetle, they are immune, but American ash trees do not have this same benefit. Adult beetles lay their larva in the bark, where they begin to develop. As they grow, they feed on the tree and eat through the phloem. After generations, this is enough to kill the trees as nutrients can no longer travel into the canopy.
Ash trees are incredibly common in the U.S. Following the devastation caused by the Dutch Elm disease, urban foresters settled on ash trees to replace the fallen elms, because they had and have a great balance of quality attributes: fast growing, no smelly fruits, large canopies, and beautiful fall colors. This makes the disease especially devastating to urban areas, where ash trees can make up upwards of even 90% of trees in a city. Current methods for prevention of EABs can be too expensive for prophylaxis for many cities and neighbors. Additionally, often the beatles have caused too much damage by the time they are noticed for treatment to be effective as the trees are too damaged.

After focusing on EABs, we looked into viable options for genetically engineering resistance into trees. This may not protect trees that are already planted, but when speaking with urban foresters, we spoke about the importance of tree diversity. If every city were to have more varied tree species, a problem EABs or Dutch Elm could not be as devastating again. By leaving ash trees on the"

Selected mutants were then recombined and subjected to further mutagenesis.
An Improved T7 Expression System
Our first challenge in making Ampersand was to develop a system that limits basal expression of our peptide, due to its toxicity to the host. Several expression systems have been designed in the past, including the T7 promoter and T7 RNA Polymerase system, to suppress protein expression. The current BL21 (DE3) strain is leaky due to the weak suppressing promoter lacUV5 that drives T7 RNA polymerase in the DE3 strains. As a result, low levels of toxic protein are constitutively expressed, ultimately killing the host it was made in and in turn lowering the overall yield of the protein produced.
In order to reduce the expression of T7 RNA polymerase and create an efficient system for the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli we chose to introduce two levels of regulation:
Transcriptional Regulation: We will use pZE21 of the pZ system of vectors developed by Lutz and Buschard with the PLlacO promoter to inhibit the expression of T7 RNA polymerase.
Translational Regulation: We will use the artificial riboregulatory elements devised by Isaacs et al.. to restrict translation of the mRNA sequence encoding T7 RNA Polymerase.19 The cis-repressing RNA (crRNA) sequence will be inserted downstream of the promoter driving T7 RNA Polymerase and upstream of the ribosomal binding site (RBS). The crRNA is complimentary to the RBS and forms a stem loop at the 5’ end of the mRNA segment, blocking ribosomal docking and translation. A second promoter, PLtetO will express the trans-activating RNA (taRNA) capable of undergoing a linear-loop interaction that will expose the RBS and allow for translation of T7 RNA Polymerase. The ribo-regulated T7 RNA Polymerase will be ultimately incorporated into the genome of strain capable of high protein production. A second pZ plasmid will contain the gene of interest expressed by a T7 promoter.
In summary, the benefits to this type of system are its robustness, portability, and efficiency in that it does not require the cell to expend more energy on the constitutive synthesis of another protein. We theorize that by utilizing these two levels of control we will be able to reduce the expression of T7 RNA polymerase and produce a system with zero"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Another set of plates with 10-5 and 10-4 dilutions of Chloramphenicol were prepared.
The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.
A fluorinase gene can be utilized to bio-remediate the excess fluoride in water."

VII. Quorum Quenching
We did the experiment XIX to test the quorum quenching ability of QQ Device I (BBa_K2548000 + BBa_K2548006) and QQ Device II (BBa_K2548000 + BBa_K2548007), and the result is shown below. E. coli DH5a transformed with sensor device I was induced for 3 hours in the supernatant of cells containing empty RPG plasmid, QQ device I, and QQ device II after they were induced by C4-HSL for 4 hours. In Fig 8., the control group with empty RPG plasmid shows higher GFP concentration than the culture of QQ device I and QQ device II, indicating that C4-HSL was consumed by the two devices. The GFP concentrations reduced 18.5% and 20.9% for device I and device II compared with control group respectively, implying that QQ device I had better C4-HSL degradation ability.

VIII. Antimicrobial Peptides
We examined the length of protein we extracted by performing SDS-PAGE to the supernatant after ultrasonic lysis. The protein size of SCY is 12.54 kDa, 11.54 kDa for cPcAMP1, and 12.74 kDa for spALF4. Protein bands in the correct molecular weight range were visualized in the area between 15 kDa and 10 kDa. There was no protein band in the same area for control group, indicating that the three AMPs were expressed.

3) Identify the essential genes in the HMF pathway
After we complete the RFP knockdown, we will begin our combinatorial knockdown of the 19 HMF pathway target genes previously identified by graduate student Iman Farasat. Using double and triple gene knockdowns, we will be able to analyze which gene or combination of genes is responsible for the functioning of the pathway. We will do this using a 2-furoic acid assay, where we will incubate all constructs in 2-furoic acid (approximately 3 g/L) and monitor their growth and consumption of 2-furoic acid over a 24 hour period. Colonies that display reduced 2-furoic acid concentration demonstrate that the pathway is still functioning – we will look for colonies that do not deplete the 2-furoic acid concentration.  The latter colonies reflect that the pathway has failed to function, and we will use these to determine which gene combinations result in this phenotype.
4) Develop a program for automated genome comparisons
5) Engineer the pathway to function in P. fluorescens and E. coli
This is a late-stage goal that will most likely not be completed before the Jamboree. Once we identify the gene(s) that are essential for the functioning of the HMF pathway, we will insert them into the E. coli genome and evaluate the action of the pathway using the 2-furoic acid assay. If this objective is completed, industry and academic researchers will be able to use our E. coli strain to produce biofuels without the toxic effects from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural killing cell cultures. They will be able to subject biomass to more intense pretreatment procedures, increasing sugar yields and the amount of biofuels that can be fermented from these sugars.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic"
UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al. They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme’s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan’s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].
The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan’s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it. To screen a representative subset of FabI’s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data. We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].
Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it’s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI’s from different organisms[5]. AND, not all of them have the same level of sensitivity towards triclosan[23]. This is why we needed to screen a panel of enzymes in order to find the enzyme most sensitive towards triclosan with a nanomolar inhibition constant. (See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)
Reported triclosan inhibition constants:
Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex. IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%
From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI. We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum. Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set. We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn’t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our project
Of the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18]. From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI’s from algae, nor is"

Protocols
8/2/13
We ran the restriction digests out on low melt gel and set up ligations with DspB and the Pet15b vector. The ligation was left overnight at room temperature per the protocol listed on the protocols page.
8/4/13
We set up transformations into BL21 E. Coli for the DspB+Pet15b plasmid. The transformation was run per the protocol listed on the protocols page and was left overnight in the 37°C incubator.
8/5/13
We checked the transformation of our DspB+Pet15b plasmid into E. coli, but the transformation was not successful. We re-setup the colony PCR for DspB and Savinase.
We received a frozen culture of V. cholerae from Dr. Robison’s lab so that we can grow new plates and overnights. Cells are in 20% glycerol.
8/7/13
The DspB colony PCR didn’t work. We re-ran the PCR yesterday, so we will run the product on gel today, clean up the PCR and sequence it. We also prepped the Savinase for sequencing today since the DspB didn’t work and we don’t want to wait any longer. We also streaked a new plate of cholera with the culture that we received from Dr. Robison’s lab. New plate was placed in the 37° incubator.

Checking a Biobrick for iGEM Utrecht
The iGEM team of Utrecht came to us with a problem. In their project they were planning to use the Tar receptor, which was available in the iGEM distribution kit (2018). However, when they did the transformations, they saw something surprising. When they analysed the colonies using a biocular microscope, they were able to detect GFP expressions. However, the sequence of the tar receptor should not contain GFP. In order to find out whether the sequence for the tar receptor was correct they approached multiple iGEM teams to uncover the truth. We did the transformation like they did and checked if the colonies contained GFP like they saw. However, we were not able to see these GFP expressions. Like us, other iGEM teams also saw that there was no GFP expressions when they did the transformations, and therefore we claim this mystery solved. The given sequence of iGEM turned out to be correct.
Interview with NRC
iGEM Utrecht organized an interview with the NRC, which is a Dutch newspaper. All six of the Dutch iGEM teams were invited to attend this interview. On the 19th of September, we traveled to Utrecht for a sitdown with an NRC reporter. Several topics were discussed, such as the impact of Biobricks on the ease of synthetic biology, how to implement your system into society and so forth. We were glad that this opportunity arose since the iGEM competition, or even synthetic biology itself, is relatively unknown in the Netherlands and this would be a perfect way to increase public awareness the possibilites provided by this field of research.
Hydrogel exchange with iGEM Hamburg
During the European meetup in Munich we had an interesting talk with iGEM Hamburg right off the bat. Their project involved a mosquito trap that relies on a lure-and-kill mechanism. Their trap had 2 cultures, a culture of E. coli that produces mosquito attractants and are kept alive the second culture of S. elongatus. This culture produces glucose using CO2 and sunlight.  They were planning on using a hydrogel to act as a reservoir for odor bait molecules and insecticides, and to provide a surface for mosquitoes to land on. Since we are also working with hydrogels, this connected us easily. We told them that we were aiming at making a living material using a combination"
