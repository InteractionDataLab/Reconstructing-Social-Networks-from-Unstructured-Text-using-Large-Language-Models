Introduction
Stockholm team is working on cancer diagnosis by engineering of a bacterial sensor which could detect trace amounts of cancer biomarkers.
Stockholm Abstract:
""Synthetic biology offers many potential cost-effective healthcare technologies. One of those could be new ways to diagnose and treat disease at an early stage. Current techniques for biomarker detection (e.g. ELISA, RIA) are time consuming, expensive and require specialised equipment.
We intend to design a microbiological system for the detection of low quantities of biomarkers. This assay aims to be easier and more cost efficient than existing techniques and possible to perform in modestly equipped settings. Initially, we will focus on the expression of a receptor for the desired biomarker. Depending on the nature of the biomarker, the receptor will be either be native or designed.
Upon biomarker detection, signal amplification will be triggered by our receptor system to activate a read out/detection system (e.g. Luciferase, GFP) inside the microorganism to artificially amplify the extracellular signal. In the next stage, the team will go on to design a read-out system to measure the concentration of biomarkers in body samples. Finally we want to investigate if we can make this system transferable to other biomarkers, changing only the receptor part of the system.
The system would be cheap, fast and possible to distribute without advanced equipment. Our motivation is to improve patient prognosis and quality of life and to improve efficiency and reduce costs within the healthcare system.""
Our assistance to the team is to express a GPI-anchored Affibody [BBa_K1766012] on the plasma membrane of human cancer cells, which can then be specifically targeted by a compatible drug or toxin (Fig. 1).

Although the later can not get results quickly, as long as this method is feasible, patent of it can be applied firstly. The others could apply for another patent by changing something on the basis of our original design, which means the value of patent of device is limited. The method, nevertheless, is constant, and the application of patent of it could be better. At last, we asked Mr. Li if he had some suggestion for the promotion and going into market of our product. He pointed out that dialysis consumables are in great demand in China, and if our project is mature enough and possesses investment value, there must be companies purchasing our patent and putting the product into market. He thought our product has market potential.
Through the communication with Mr. Li, we got his affirmation of our device, and we also got suggestion that we should focus on the quality and matching problems of the device, and we should improve our device by miniaturization and ensuring safety. In addition, we learned about detailed methods, domestic status, laws and regulations, and strategies related to our later application for patent and promotion of product. Mr. Li answered our questions seriously and discussed with us on our doubts, which benefited us a lot.

After showing the functionality of the d-AuNPs to detect target DNA, we aimed to determine the sensitivity by using variations of target EPO DNA concentrations while keeping the total amount of DNA constant. We tested concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 1 nM comparing on- and off-target primers and determined our lower limit of detection is 1nM. To achieve comparable results to Baetsen-Young et al. 2018 (29 fM) further optimization are required.
Additionally, we evaluated the influence of background DNA present in the sample. We used 38 ng/ÂµL background DNA, equal to the expected cfDNA extraced during sample preparation. We were able to show that the presence of background DNA does not affect the sensitivity of the prescreening method. Further sensitivity evaluation are required before implementing the prescreening method.
Conclusion
The functionality of the prescreen was proven. We were able to visually detect the presence of target EPO DNA. However, to implement this prescreening, protocol optimization is required to reach a lower detection limit of at least 9 fM, based on data from our model. Thus, if the results of Baetsen-Young et al. 2018 can be reproduced, the detection limit can be lowered to 2.94 fM.
3. Fusion Protein - dxCas9-Tn5
In order to achieve targeted sequencing, we constructed a fusion protein by linking dxCas9 with Tn5 to be used in library preparation for sequencing platform. We constructed the strain that expressed our fusion protein, successfully purified them and tested their functionality in vivo and in vitro. We were able to show targeted integration by our fusion protein in vitro and sequence verified the integration products.
3.1 Strain Construction
Design: We constructed a fusion protein by linking dxCas9 cDNA to Tn5 cDNA with a linker coding for glycine helical peptide.
Results and interpretation: The sequences encoding the dxCas9 (3.7) and Tn5 were obtained via Addgene with plasmid numbers #60240 from Picelli et al. (2014) and #108383 from Liu et al (2018) respectively. First, we introduced a linker coding for glycine helical peptide to Tn5 cDNA and cloned it to pACYCD"

Our visit allowed first insights on how to approach the design of our laboratory open days and enabled us to get to know students we would later tutor.
Furthermore, we could collect first experiences as tutors by volunteering at Marburg's public Hands-on-Science Lab on the Day of the Visually Impaired. An advanced group of students, just before their A-levels, par-took in experiments to investigate the chemical differences in reactions of the same type. They displayed an analytical and observing mind, a funded knowledge that could put some university students to shame. Being amazed by their passion for science, we decided to devote not one, but two whole laboratory days with study-relevant content to give them a realistic look at the natural sciences in higher education.
In addition to these local experiences, we did broad research online to find additional information. It turns out that, in the English-speaking world, a number of helpful guides for laboratory work as a blind or visually impaired researcher do exist. Not so in Germany. These websites inspired further methods to be applied in a fully accessible laboratory.
Open Laboratory Days - Practicing Biology and Chemistry with the Visually Impaired.
Fortunately, our University is open to creative inclusive ideas. After some discussion, we convinced our Departments to allow two experimental open days for a small group of visually impaired under our supervision.
Since our project is about interdisciplinary approaches to synthetic biology, we chose to design experiments showcasing aspects of biology and chemistry when introducing, Vibrio natriegens.
Figure 1: Two people trying to figure out how to measure a growth curve.
Throughout, we discussed our plans and layouts with the respective teachers and gained insights from consulting an educational lecturer of our chemistry department who is heavily involved with inclusive projects. In consensus with their feedback and our first-hand experiences, both days took place in the same laboratory and seminar room to make adapting as easy as possible for our students. We put great emphasis on safety by ensuring that lab coats, and if necessary safety goggles, were worn at all times.
Also, we guaranteed unobstructed walkways and aided fully blind students through their new environment. The nine visiting students were divided into three groups to make assisting more simple.

I aliquoted another 250 uL of the fraction to syringe filter, all of the silk particles were trapped in the filter (checked under UV box).
some things we can try:
add more solvent to try to solubilize the Tamura particulates
I took 2 mL of ""Fraction 4"" from the Functionalization team
This solution is much more viscous, has much less particulates, and has comparable fluorescent intensity when checked under the UV box.
I will take Fraction 4 and mix it with the silk dope.
Considering how viscous both the silk dope and the Tamura fraction are, I should probably add some water to the mix
Will add 50 uL of ddH2O to bring the total volume of hybrid dope to 300 uL.
FINAL RECIPE that I am co-spinning:
50 uL ddH2O
185.7 uL of 20%w/v silk dope
62.5 uL of Tamura Fraction 4
Extrude at rate of 6 uL/min into 70% v/v ethanol
retroactive information added
our Tamura fraction 4 was found to have a concentration of 146 ug/mL.
Our recipe contained the total masses:
b.mori silk: 0.037g
Tamura: 9.125ug
Our Tamura to b.mori silk ratio was 2.466E-6
This is a very low ratio. Upping the ratio would increase fluorescent intensity. It also might destabilize the silk structure (which is already very unstable)
All in all, the hybrid dope that we spun was 12.3% w/v.
Results
I think it worked!

Question 4: The sustainability of the project needs to be improved. Answer: Apply for Entrepreneurship Project in NAU and industrialize this project. With the development of schoolâs Entrepreneurship Project and financial support, this research can be carried out more consistently. If you can find a company to collaborate with, the project will help the community even more, which will lead to deeper research by teammates.
Question 5: When using drones to monitor whether or not the wheat crop is infected with the virus, it requires a high quality of camera pixels. And the characteristics of the wheat are from a top view, which has a large difference in the picture of the diseased wheat in database.
Answer: Set up automatic cameras on the ground around the wheat field. This change has four advantages: The camera is close to the wheat plant so that the camera pixel required is not high; The picture in the horizontal direction is coincident with the picture in the database, which can improve the accuracy of the recognition; Â 
3. The plan is continuous monitoring so that the whole wheat growth cycle can be monitored for its disease;
4. Compared with drones, it is more more economical which is very helpful to the industrialization of this project.

Â  1.Background Â 
Â  We were connected by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct studentsâ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials.

Although we have tried our best to prevent human from these epidemic diseases, the global risk assessment has not changed. Hence, what we do now is to discover a suitable way to kill the special mosquitoes.
3.The Life Cycle of Mosquitoes
Mosquito is a complete metamorphosis insect. The life cycle from egg to adult is about 7 to 10 days. The mosquito goes through four separate and distinct stages of its life cycle: Egg, Larva, Pupa and Adult. Each of these stages can be easily recognized by its special morphological and physiological characteristics asÂ Figure1-4. <p style=""margin-bottom:0.0000pt"">

4.Action mode of CryÂ and CytÂ toxins
Sufficient evidence has proven that theÂ CryÂ andÂ CytÂ protein family fromÂ Bt., produced as parasporal Crystal components, can be greatly effective against insects includingÂ Lepidoptera,Â Coleoptera,Â DipteraÂ and nematodes. By forming pores on the cell membrane or inserting into membrane, these proteins can lyse insects' midgut epithelial cells, and then result in the death. However, proteins from both of theÂ CryÂ andÂ CytÂ families are harmless to human,other vertebrates and plants. In addition, they are completely biodegradable which lessen the potential hazard to our environment. Therefore, people are widely usingÂ Bt.Â to control pests in order to prevent the loss of agricultural production and spread of human disease.
Cry4Aa,Â Cry10Aa,Â Cry11Aa, Cry4b, Cyt1AaÂ andÂ Cyt2Â toxins fromÂ BtÂ ssp.Â israelensis (Bti.)Â have great toxic effect on mosquito larvae. Different types ofÂ CryÂ proteins' toxicity to different species of mosquitoes can vary a lot. For example, Cry4bÂ shows no toxicity to Culex whileÂ Cry4AaÂ does. However, mutagenesis of certain region ofÂ CryÂ protein can make it show toxicity to the species it never has before.
TheÂ CryÂ protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven Î±-helices bundle."

Protein Purification
Elution peaks of His-HOC-YFP from nickel chromatography (A) and gelfiltration (B) with corresponding 15% silverstained SDS-PAGE.
After the two chromatography steps, the purified protein had a final concentration of 70ÂµM and no by-products were visible by silver staining. The CD-spectra (minima of 218nm) of the protein corresponds to the model and the Ramachandran plot indicates that the protein was not denatured during purification. Then, the purified protein was intentionally denatured by thermal transition. Thereby, it was confirmed that the protein is stable below 40Â°C. This is of importance, as phage assembly is performed at 29Â°C.

The purified protein was added to the assembly mix. Bacteria were transfected with the modified phages. Unbound phages and protein were removed by centrifugation. Fluorescence was measured in dependence of the proximity to the bacteria. Theoretically, YFP intensity should correlate with the binding of YFP-HOC modified phages to the bacteria.

Purification of the modified T4 bacteriophage
To show the possibility of our manufacturing system we modified our T4 bacteriophage at the Hoc protein with the fusion of a His-YFP. In this experiment the His-tag was utilized to purify the bacteriophage solution from the cell extract after the assembly process.
The bacteriophages with the His-tag, were loaded on Ni-NTA beads which where embedded in chromatography columns. After four subsequently washing steps imidazole was used to elute the His-tag from the beads. As a negative control, bacteriophages without a His-tag were treated equally.
To test the purification a spot assay was performed. On the left there are the T4 bacteriophages which were eluted from the sample with the His-Tagged bacteriophages and on the right side there is negative control with the native eluted bacteriophages. The titer of the bacteriophages is lower in the right sample, due to the fact that single plaques are visible, which indicates a low concentration. In contrast the His-tag"

Therefore, every T3 RNA polymerase generates one mRFP transcript every 4.7 seconds. The resulting amount of mRFP transcripts  is shown in Figure 3. The script for our modelling can be found here .
Figure 3:Modeling on the amount of mRFP transcript transcribed through the two different models. In model 1 mRFP CDS lies is of the CDS of the gene of interest. In model 2 the CDS of the mRFP is downstream a T3 promoter and the CDS coding for the T3 RNA polymerase is downstream the CDS of the gene of interest.
The number of mRFP transcripts is a lot higher with construct 2 (our reporter constuct) even though model leaves out the fact that one transcript of the T3 RNA polymerase could be translated several times and enhance the signal even more. Despite the simplicity of this model, it shows the advantages of using the T3 RNA polymerase for signal enhancing.
Figure 4: Two Smear of two clones containing only mRFP under an uninduced T7 promoter (-) and containing the mRFP enhancing system under the same promotor (+), after 12 h of incubation at 37 Â°C.
To demonstrate the signal enhancing system we cloned either the part E1010 or our signal enhancing system ( BBa_K2201373 ) downstream of the part BBa_K2201900 . This plasmid was characterized in cells containing our positive selection plasmid. A smear of the transformants is shown in Figure 4. The uninduced T7-promoter  promoter leads only to a basal transcription level. Despite this weak transcription, the mRFP in the cells containing the signal enhancing system is clearly visible, while cells without the signal enhancing system remain colorlesse.
Figure 5: Picture of a negative selection round. The clone still containing the positive selection plasmid, thus the mRFP enhancing system, is red.
For the selection of tRNA/aminoacylsynthetase to incorporate non-canonical amino acids, we needed to check if clones still contain the positive selection plasmid in the negative selection round. Therefore, we decided to incorporate the mRFP signal enhancing system downstream of the CDS of our positive selection plasmid BBa_K2201900 . If the cells contain this plasmid in the negative selection, they should be visible as red clones. In contrast"

Northwestern,2018,Team:Northwestern#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the systems on paper. Although this transition has been proven to be difficult, our collaboration with Purdue and our extensive network of Northwestern faculty that specialize in cell-free reactions drive us to believe our system would function correctly. We have altered the repressor plasmids to contain T7 promoters, a type of constitutive promoter, and added a stability hairpin to facilitate a better output before transitioning to cell-free.
One of the major improvements that we would like to make is adapting the sensor to offer more information than a simple yes or no output regarding the presence of the heavy metal. This lead our team to attend a âBiosensor Practicumâ at Northwestern, where we were exposed to the world of possibilities that synthetic biology, namely biosensors offer. Specifically, the work of Dr. Mark Styczynski and his in vitro detection of zinc changed the way we saw our sensor impacting the world. His team developed a biosensor for zinc that had a tri-color output based on the concentration of the metal present. Thus, the sensor met the design requirements that citizens should be able to easily interpret results,  the results should be present  within a couple hours, and MetaSense should  have a high sensitivity. We were fascinated with the idea of having both the immediate feedback of a colorimetric output as well as the detailed specificity of being able to determine multiple ranges of the metalâs concentration. Thus, we would develop this sensor further to include those characteristics, time-permitting, in order to offer our userâs an easy-to-use and descriptive sensor.
Once the entire sensor was developed, the next aspect we would need to improve upon is the distribution of the system. The benefit to cell-free is that storage and transportation requirements are low, meaning we could partner with a distributor to provide MetaSense to citizens through their mail. In theory, we could partner with an existing paper-based detection company such as Micro Essential Laboratory and have them ship and distribute our tests across the US. Another option would be to partner with the Evanston water treatment plant and offer our sensor to citizens whose water is treated by the plant. By making these changes and addressing these future developments, we would be able to provide an accurate, simple, and efficient sensor for detecting heavy metal presence."

NDH-2 is a membrane-bound respiratory enzyme that generates low level H2O2 and superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 will permeate to neighboring colonies. Periodic production of H2O2 changes the redox state of a cell immediately and interacts with the synthetic circuit through the native aerobic response control systems, including ArcAB, which has a binding site in the lux promoter region. Before the oxidizing condition is triggered, ArcAB is partially expressed, so lux is partially repressed. When the concentration of H2O2 is increasing, ArcAB is gradually inactivated, and the repression of lux is relieved. With the periodically produced vapor phase H2O2 that can diffuse quickly among colonies, the oscillation is not only strengthened but also expanded to millimeter scales(Fig. 2-2).
Fig. 2-2  H2O2 functions as an activator to the quorum sensing promoter
When compared with the strong but short ranged coupling by QS, H2O2 might be weaker but long ranged because its disperse characteristic. These two levels of communication between cells formed the basic oscillatory system inside our host.
Reporter
A good reporter in an oscillatory circuit should be steadily expressed and can be easily detected by regular equipment in laboratory, so broadly used reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) came into our mind.
First, we built regular gfp gene into our circuit and it worked well. Its fluorescence can be observed by fluorescence microscopy under 1s of exposure time on the microfluidic array 1(Fig. 2-3).
Fig. 2-3 GFP under fluorescence microscopy on a microfluidic array
However, there is a newly found GFP variant Superfolder GFP, which has shown outstanding performance in many ways. It has two advantages in observing: 1) Fold 3.5 to 4 times faster than regular GFP; 2) Yield up to four times more total Fluorescence than regular GFP.
The greater the fluorescence strength is, the shorter exposure time will be needed, thus can decrease the photobleaching (GFP will be eventually destroyed by the light exposure that tries to stimulate it into fluorescing) that will lead into lapses in data processing.
Besides, we also want to make a comparison between two different GFPs' performances in our oscillatory circuit. For example, peaks, troughs and periods in oscillatory curves. The following picture shows the difference between GFP and sfGFP both on colE1 backbone.(Fig. 2"

Today was the Clotho boot camp.  Trying to build an application on the fly revealed how much I still had to learn about the infrastructure.  Most of what I'm missing relates to the Clotho connection and how an object is persisted.  I learned about the existence of a transient collection.
I also spent the better part of the boot camp tracking down an error that caused the Sequence View to crash.  Turns out it was just an xml error.  Xml errors and build file errors combined make up the vast majority of errors that I've encountered while building Clotho.
With the Sequence View stabilized in Clotho Biofab Edition, I can begin looking for quick conversions to a TopComponent.  I think I should be able to grab the Content Pane of the JFrame and then use that to populate the TopComponent.  Once I confirm this works, then I can begin completing the Sequence View.  There is a lot remaining to be done and learned.

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Growth Control_-_-_TEXT.html," volume, dissolved oxygen concentration, nutrient and product concentrations, pH, cell density, etc.). Because obtaining a steady state requires at least 5 volume changes, chemostats require large nutrient and waste reservoirs. Creating biological ""chemostat"" would circumvent these drawbacks.
Approach
What we want to reach is an early stationary phase that is inducible and can be relieved to continu onto its natural stationary phase upon depleting its nutrients. To be able to leave to early stationary phase the inductor needs to be degradable or blockable. However, to speak of an actual phase the degradation or inhibition should proceed slowly so not to end the phase too soon.
In undertaking such an endeavour there are several approaches possible, one is to create a switch that could simply stop cells from reproducing and focus them on to production. The other is to create a culture that upon induction begins to oscilate between cell death and cell growth. Because creating either possibilities should yield some difficulties, the project could be divided into three parts.
Inducing an early stationary phase (that focusses its metabolism on protein production, visualized by GFP)
Leaving the early stationary phase (leaving the early stationary phase should be optional in practice)
Creating an oscilating culture that remains between predefined limits.
Possibilities to think of might be a time switch so to continu growing after a set period of time, or continu growing as soon as certain demands are fullfilled (certain amount of production). However, both ways of leaving the early stationary phase are then induced intrinsically and not determined by us. The same problem for the idea of adding a substance that induces the production of an autoinducer simultaneous with an slow promotor of an autoinhibitor, as the concentration of the autoinhibitor rises to a certain point the effect of the autoinducer will be block sufficiently to continu growing.
It would be nice to work with NICE

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project#Ecoli_-_-_TEXT.html," coli team was to transform E. coli with genes that produce medium chain fatty acids and ethanol, both of which can be used as biofuels. In addition, the group wanted to develop an E. coli glucose insensitive inducible promoter that would not be down-regulated in the presence of high glucose concentrations. In our system glucose levels produced by Cyanobacteria may be unpredictable; therefore having an E. coli inducible promoter that is glucose-insensitive will provide more control over expression of the biofuel genes.

Production of Medium Chain Fatty Acids as a Biofuel
Bay Laurel Thioesterase Cloning Strategy
Bay Laurel thioesterase (BTE) is a gene that is naturally found in the bay leaves (Umbellularia californica)and used as a spice in cooking. The BTE produces medium chain 12-carbon and 14-carbon fatty acids (Voelker et al.,1996). The Nevada team changed the codon sequence for BTE based on the publication by Welch et. al. âDesign Parameters to Control Synthetic Gene Expression in Escherichia coliâ by changing the codons that are more common in plants to codons common in E. coli. The newly synthesized intermediate part (BBa_K558003) also contained an E. coli ribosome binding sequence, a His tag sequence on the 3â end of the coding sequence and an iGEM registry double terminator sequence (BBa_B0014).
The constitutive promoter sigma 70 from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (BBa_J23101) was classically cloned in front of the synthesized Bay Laurel thioesterase gene to create the Nevada BTE generator part (BBa_K558007). Many tests were used to determine the expression of the Bay Laurel thioesterase including SDS-PAGE, Western blot, colorimetric assay and gas chromatography.  The one assay that was most successful for measuring free fatty acid content in the growth media was purchased through Bioassay Systems (EnzyChromâ¢ Free Fatty Acid Assay Kit www.bioassaysys.com).

Example 3. Bistable Toggle Switch
Introduction
A good example of engineering in Synthetic Biology include the pioneering work of Tim Gardner and James Collins on an engineered genetic toggle switch . Here, we want to show how to tune parameters to guarantee bistability.
Mathematical Formulation
<math>\begin{align} \dot{u}(t) &=\frac{\alpha _{1}}{1+v^{\theta }(t)}-\beta _{1}u(t), (.....................................equation1) \\ \dot{v}(t) &=\frac{\alpha _{2}X^{\eta }}{X^{\eta }+1+u^{\gamma }(t)}-\beta _{2}v(t),(..............................................equation2) \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
where <math>X</math> is input, <math>u</math> is the concentration of repressor 1, <math>v</math> is the concentration of repressor 2, <math>\alpha _{1}</math> is the effective rate of synthesis of repressor 1, <math>\alpha _{2}</math> is the effective rate of synthesis of repressor 2, <math>\theta </math> is the cooperativity of repression of promoter 2 and <math>\gamma </math> is the cooperativity of repression of promoter 1. The above model is derived from a biochemical rate equation formulation of gene expression. The final form of the toggle equations preserves the two most fundamental aspects of the network: cooperative repression of constitutively transcribed promoters (the first term in each equation), and degradation/dilution of the repressors (the second term in each equation).
The parameters <math>\alpha _{1}</math> and <math>\alpha _{2}</math> are lumped parameters that describe the net effect of RNA polymerase binding, open-complex formation, transcript elongation, transcript termination, repressor binding, ribosome binding and polypeptide elongation. The cooperativity described by <math>\theta </math> and <math>\gamma </math> can arise from the multimerization of the repressor proteins and the cooperative binding of repressor multimers to multiple operator sites in the promoter. An additional modification to equation (1) is needed to describe induction of the repressors.

Engagement
To engage with the public and promote our project, we decided to showcase it to our two schools (St Paul's RC Academy and Grove Academy). The presentation allowed the pupils to have some insight to the work behind our project and give them an idea of the research being done in the field of synthetic biology, inspiring them to think about the opportunities available in a science career. Our presentations received great feedback through a questionnaire we made, which let us know that we successfully taught the pupils something they hadnât known about before. The questionnaire was composed of five questions and we handed out 20 of them to the students, teachers and advisors watching the presentation. Before the presentation 17 out of 20 wrote that they did not know what RNA interference was and how it could be used to treat bacterial infections. We then asked some questions with a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being the lowest score and five being the highest). The average score for the presentation was 4.2. We also asked how well informed the audience was after the presentation on the RNA intereference concept. The average score for this was 4.1. We also asked how easy the scientific part of the presentation was to understand (with 1 being easy and 5 being hard) and the average score for this was 2.4. Finally we asked if the presentation would be suitable to present in front of a general audience with varied levels of experience with science. 15 people out of 20 said it would be suitable. These results showed us that we successfully managed to create a presentation that was very effective at educating pupils the work we have been doing for iGEM."

Project Description
GI tract cancers are an enormous public health issue, and together are responsible for more deaths than any other form of cancer. One of the major difficulties with diagnosing and treating these cancers, especially when localized to the intestine, is access to the tumour - patients often do not exhibit obvious symptoms until the later stages, when treatment options are limited.
We looked into a few different ways of tackling this issue, from improving existing diagnostic methods to developing new avenues for treatment. One of the consistent themes that came up in our brainstorming process was the potential for us to use the host's cell-mediated immune response to fight cancer. Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field, and clinical trials for certain forms of leukemia are already underway.
Thus, this year, McMaster iGEM sought to augment the power of the host immune system to fight against GI tract cancers, using a specially engineered strain of commensal lactobacillus bacteria. When completed, our bacteria will be able to sense the presence of tumours in the gut, bind to specific receptors on tumour cells, and begin secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines in this tumour microenvironment. This will recruit T cells to the site of the tumour and elicit an anti-cancer response, effectively stopping the cancerous growth using the body's own toolkits. This summer, we aim to develop a proof-of-concept of our idea, and create a bacterial strain that can secrete IL-2 under tightly controlled, tumour-specific conditions

What is more, this system can also be used to comprehensively evaluate any other iGEM team projects to individual positioning and to simplify and to improve the lengthy evaluation work of iGEM judgers.
Our Evaluation System
In assessing the various projects from the whole world, a comprehensive evaluation contains divergence measurable indexes. We have done so much literature work to make sure that our evaluation system contains all related and useful perspectives. Finally, an overall and systematic evaluation system is established. The frame diagram of this system is shown in the Figure 1. The shape of the system seems like a tree, so it is also called evaluation tree.
Figure 1. The frame diagram of the team evalutation system (From TJU iGEM team 2012)
How to Use the System
The evaluation system is also very easy to use, we only need to rank the teams waiting for evaluation through the different perspectives at the leaf note (the points which do not have child note) of the evaluation tree. After collecting of the data, we only need to do some basic calculation to obtain the final result of the evaluation of these teams on different layer of evaluation index. All these calculation results will be very useful to help us to understand all these teams' performance in all possible level and perspectives.
The Inner Operating Principles: AHP
All the data are obtained from that of questionnaire. And the relative values are transformed through comparison matrix. All the other calculation procedures are flow the previous procedure of AHP method .

For the butanol production system, we find the reaction speed limiting step and the sensitive parameters. For the hydrogen production system, it is theoretically proved that the hydrogen production of the constructed Escherichia coli is relatively high. Click here for more details about our Model.
â Demonstration of Your Work
We have proved that the straw can be degraded by using of our energy conversion system. Besides, butanol and hydrogen has also been detected successfully. Click here for more details about our Demonstrate.
Special Awards
âBest Energy Project
UESTC-China is focusing on where energy is coming from and where it is going. Straw is our energy source in our project. It is produced in high quantity every year all over the world, but in low usage rate because of its complex structure. We used Xyn10D-Fae1A to efficiently degrade straw without pretreatment. Meanwhile, by taking into account that fossil fuel will be exhausted sooner or later and clean energy will become the trend of the future. Thus, our system was designed aiming at the production of hydrogen and butanol. After about five monthsâhard work, we successfully constructed an energy conversion system which could degrade straw into butanol and hydrogen. Click here for more details about our Demonstrate.
â Best Education & Public Engagement
To establish a bond which connect synthetic biology and public, we devoted ourselves vigorously to public education. We hosted âGene Goâ, a giant public education event which drove the public participation in synthetic biology. We promote iGEM in a more innovative way, such as DIY classroom and stage play adapted from our project. We also open up âiGEM Classroomâ for teenagers which contains experiment practice and iGEM classes both online and offline. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them forming their own iGEM team. Furthermore, we created a series of edutainment product such as Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Gene Card Online, Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. Above all, what we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is. Click here for more details about our Education & Public Engagement.
â Best Model
Our team should be in consideration for this award for embodying the value of continuous interplay between theory and experiment.

Abstract
Following genetic design of our constructs, we must express and process them into functional materials. Here, we highlight the methods that we used to take our silks from DNA to proteins and ultimately to fibers and films.
Introduction
To create functionalized fibers, we co-spun the NCSilkGFP with native Bombyx mori silk. The NCSilkGFP was designed such that the N and C termini have affinity to b.mori silk, allowing it to bind to the native silk upon spinning.
Methods for co-spinning silk with the NCSilkGFP
In brief, we followed the standard process as highlighted in the literature [1] to produce a concentrated aqueous solution, or dope, of commercially purchased b.mori silk. We then added aqueous NCSilkGFP to the concentrated b.mori dope so that the final solution had 750 grams of b.mori silk to 1 gram of NCSilkGFP. We then extruded this dope into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water and collected the resulting fiber on a godet. Detailed steps are as follows:
Degumming
Silk is comprised of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein of the silk and our protein of interest. Sericin serves as the âglueâ of the silk. Degumming separates and removes sericin and is an essential preparation step before dissolving the silk. We found that commercially degummed silk was not properly degummed for our purposes and this step had to be carried out in-lab.
To degum, we boiled 2.5 grams of B.mori silk in 0.02M sodium carbonate solution for 30 minutes.
Solubilization
The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium bromide, a strong"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," the promoter upstream of the cI is effectively induced by L-arabinose and repressed by D-glucose. The tested mRFP expression functions represents the position of the Cry toxin in the final envisioned system. Arrows between component indicate induction of expression, production or activation. The bar-headed line denotes repression.
To test the viability of the described subpopulation system, we constructed a plasmid where Î» and 434 cI encoding genes are under control of the pBAD/AraC promoter. This promoter can be induced with L-arabinose and repressed with D-glucose. This control over expression is useful to manipulate the formation of the subpopulations as envisioned in our design. Another operon was constructed with the modified Î» Prm promoter controlling mRFP expression, representing expression of the Cry toxin.
We hypothesized that the system can only work when the balance between the cI proteins is in a certain âsweet spotâ of ratios. To improve our chances of hitting this sweet spot we incorporated a library of 18 possible RBSâs upstream of the 434 cI gene. The library was kindly designed by Daniel Gerngross using the Redlibs algorithm 8 . This provided us with a library of limited size representing a linear increase in predicted translation rates. This way we varied the translation rates of 434 cI between clones, resulting in different ratios between the Î» and 434 cI protein levels for these clones.
DH5Î± cells transformed with the plasmid - containing both operons and the RBS library - yielded clones with varying intensities of red coloring on agar plates without L-arabinose and D-glucose (Figure 7). The variation in the red intensity is seen very clearly between the top three circled colonies in Figure 7.This diversity is a first indication that the assembled system works as intended: variation in the 434 cI RBS should cause different ratios between Î» and 434 cI protein levels, leading to differences in mRFP expression.
Figure 7. Close-up picture of culture plate with colonies containing the subpopulation two-operon plasmid including the RBS library. The blue circled and faintly red circled colonies were selected to be used in separate plate reader experiments.
To investigate the working of this subpopulation system we analysed RFP fluorescence in cultures from 95 colonies of the RBS library transformation. From these we obtained four colonies that showed either a unique or a representative RFP response to glucose for further testing. By comparing the population-wide RFP response in the presence and absence of glucose. Based on this comparison we selected two clones to"

Also while plating I poured antibiotics (Amp and Kan) in right amounts after the plates were solidified since I read antibiotics are thermal sensitive. Then the transformed cells were plated. While doing all these procedures I tutored the same procedure to Calin for his 4 biobricks as well.

Figure 8: Pellets collected after overnight co-cultures of IPTG detector ( BBa_K2205009 ) + processor ( BBa_K2205012 ) + sfGFP reporter ( BBa_K2205015 ) in ratios 1:1:1 and 1:1:13, with and without 1mM IPTG.
The three experiment sets clearly demonstrate that the framework is optimised when a higher concentration of cells expressing the reporter device is present (Figures 6, 7, 8, samples labelled 1:1:13). Although a background signal is visible in the systems expressing the pink ( BBa_K2205018 ) and the sfGPF ( BBa_K2205015 ) reporters, the blue reporter ( BBa_K2205016 ) due to its lowest background level, constitutes the most suitable reporter module for the Sensynova platform when customised as IPTG biosensor.
Conclusions and Future Work
The qualitative results detailed above highlight the crucial advantage of our multicellular, modular framework, as it enables each component to be optimised avoiding any extra cloning steps. As each biosensor may be different and require specific designs and optimisation, easily choosing and changing modules and predicting in silico the bacterial community behaviour is essential for the development of new biosensors.

Initial trials of manipulating these variables showed 2% xylose, no shaking, and 10% glycerol to lead to greater growth of colonies and therefore better transformation. More trials need to be conducted before we can make definite conclusions.
Although there was colony growth for all of the variables tested, none of the colonies turned red despite the vector containing an RFP cassette. We conducted colony PCR and ran the products on a gel, on which bands of the right size appeared. Literature search is still being done as to the cause behind the colonies not turning red.
We further tested for the insertion of the thrC vector with the threonine test, in which transformed colonies with the thrC insertion would only grow on MNGE media with the amino acid threonine but we did not see any growth on this plate.
Week 13: July 21 - 25
The team decided on having each subgroup present their findings in the form of a work-in-progress presentation at the weekly meetings and the Transformers were the first group to present. We received valuable input from our advisors, such as having quantitative results for our transformations instead of qualitative ones that consisted of pictures of plates.
We planned on making serial dilutions of each transformation next week and repeating conditions we have already tested in order to obtain quantitative results. We also researched on protocols available to make spores. We found one protocol, but we are missing one reagent required to make a media. We are still searching for this reagent and once we obtain it, we will immediately start working on making B. subtilis spores.
Week 14: July 26 - August 1
In order to quantify transformation, we did 1/10 serial dilutions of B. subtilis transformed with thrC and tested 1% xylose vs. 2% xylose, along with shake vs. no shake. All of the colonies were red, suggesting successful transformation. The amount of colonies consistently decreased with each dilution, except for the 2% xylose + shake condition, for which colonies only grew on the the 100% concentrated plate. Qualitatively, the 2% xylose + no shake condition resulted in the most number of colonies on the 1/10 000 dilution plate, however there were too many colonies to count and this suggested that we should dilute the colonies further in the future.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," project is followed up on. Synenergene is a four year program to promote the dialogue about the future of synthetic biology between relevant stakeholders, contributing to responsible research and innovation. Synenergene partners, including the Rathenau institute, are in close collaboration with several iGEM teams from all over the world.
Our collaboration with Synenergene consisted of two assessments: an application scenario and a techno-moral vignette. The assessments were intended to help us evaluate the viability as well as the societal impact of our envisioned product. We chose to combine both in a âResource from the futureâ. The Resource is the magazine and news website of students and employees of Wageningen UR, and by writing a Resource from the year 2030 , when BeeT will be available on the market, we aimed to bring up ethical issues around synthetic biology in a way that is fun and accessible for the public. At the same time, the magazine served to spread the word in Wageningen about our iGEM project.
RIVM
Together with the RIVM, we made a movie depicting the safety issues linked to our project. In the Netherlands, the RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu) is a governmental institute that is concerned with public health and a safe living environment. Part of their work is encouraging discussions about the development of synthetic biology from a policymakerâs perspective, which includes a collaboration with all Dutch iGEM teams since 2014.
For this collaboration, the teams were asked to depict their thoughts and concepts about safe by design in a video, podcast or other representation. We decided to make a movie that shows how safe by design is implemented in our project.
Screenshots of our RIVM ""safe by design"" movie.
Since the video is in Dutch, we will give you an impression of what we deal with and what we resolve in the video: In contrast to many other synthetic biology applications, BeeT is intended to be used outside the lab: In beehives. Even commercial Beehives are in close contact with nature. To get a better idea of the viability of our idea, and what it is like to request permission to use an engineered microorganism outside of the lab. We looked at the questions that are asked in such a request. After that, we discuss some of these questions that peaked our interest in the movie. Some interesting questions we had not thought about, such as âHow can a genetically modified microorganism be recognized among natural relatives?â. Some questions we did not expect, for example, here are"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship-Main_-_-_TEXT.html," point. The entire process was accompanied by our supervisor Louis Reese, patent officers from TU Delft, and patent attorneys (from NLO). In the process of filing, there were several important steps that are chronologically described in this section. Once we realized the novelty of combining the physical phenomenon of coacervation with Cas13a, it also appeared that there might be enormous potential for even broader applications. Therefore, it was decided to disclose our idea to the patent office from TU Delft. This amounts to filling in a standardized form in which the inventors are listed and briefly describe their invention. At this stage, the invention is still not to be made public, as this internal disclosure does not provide actual protection on the intellectual property. This meant that it still had to be protected against publication at this stage. As a team we had to decide that we can not communicate the idea to the public unless it has been decided if a patent will be pursued. We soon were invited to meet with Justin Kok, a patent officer from TU Delft, to further discuss the invention and so that he could assess whether it would meet the requirements for a patent application. Upon his approval, the next step could be taken, which was writing the patent.
How was the patent application written?
The writing of the patent application happened in close correspondence with an assigned patent attorney, who was responsible for taking our scientific input and write it in the format of a strong patent application. The legal text of a patent indeed is very different from a scientific text, and quite mind-twisting.
Who owns the patent?
Before the final document is sent it must be clarified who the owners of the patent will be. In our case, the employers of the inventors (TU Delft and NWO) share ownership rights, meaning that the inventors would not have to contribute to the costs of the patent application. As one of the students was also an inventor, things got a little more complicated. When students are involved as inventors in patent applications, they either have to sign to transfer their IP rights to the university, or they should contribute to the costs that come with the filing of our patent. In our case, the student involved chose to sign the transfer of IP rights. This means that the institutions TU Delft and NWO are the owners of the patent once granted, and that the institution will have exclusive rights regarding its licensing and selling. On October 20th, one week before the Judging Form deadline and twelve days from the Wiki-Freeze, the patent application was filed by the attorney and official confirmation of reception was given by the"

Environmentally, people are generally concerned with the wastewater that enters the ocean and the river. This gives weight to our project, because the quality of water is an important concern for the general public.
Two examples of general questions from our survey. (Left) 87% (201 out of 243 total responses) think that genes should be modified if the goal is to save or improve quality of life. (Right) 96.7% of the people surveyed care about the quality of wastewater (236 out of 244 total responses).Figure: Christine C.
Project-Specific Questions
The majority of people have heard of NPs and know that NPs are used in consumer products; however, they do not know why NPs are used.
The majority of people want companies to be required to disclose information about potential harms of NPs to the environment and the human body.
Most people believe that the government and NP manufacturers should share responsibility for the regulation of NP usage and disposal.
Two examples of project-specific questions from our survey. (Left) A majority of the people we asked (58.6%) do not know why NPs are used in consumer products (143 out of 244 total responses).

General Questions Project Specific
Policy Brief -- Nanoparticle Regulation Issues and Case Studies
Our team has conducted extensive research on existing regulatory laws and policies regarding NPs and nanomaterials. We have investigated chemical regulations, including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TCSA), the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, and the Clean Air Act (CAA). There are significant obstacles to successfully regulating NPs, such as conflicting definitions on NPs that lead to an inability to successfully regulate manufacturers. Research has also been conducted on the hazardous effects of NPs on the human body and environment. We decided to compose a policy brief highlighting the existing challenges in NP regulation and the lessons learned from previous failure to regulate new chemical substances. The brief was sent out to regulatory agencies, government agencies, and news outlets to raise awareness about the issue. We feel responsible to let others know about the damage NP waste can do to the environment. (Policy Brief created by Ashley L.)

The modeling consists of three parts:

the generator model.
Part 1 The Plane Distribution of Proton
Theory and Method
We use the promoter PureI which is sensitive to the concentration of H+ to start the process of quorum sensing of E.coli. As H+ is the foundation of following steps, we need to build an environment with a proper gradient of protons' concentration. Therefore, we use a pole which we can put acid into, and take it as the maximum concentration of acid (Fig.1). We utilize two poles, one of which is instilled by acid that can supply H+. With the diffusion of H+, a gradient of protons' concentration is able to form. A schematic view of the specific equipment is revealed as following. Correspondingly, we build the distribution of protons and get the solutions of diffusion according to Fick's Laws of Diffusion: $$j=-D\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$$ where $J$ is the diffusion flux. $J$ measures the amount of substance that will flow through a small area during time interval. $D$ is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity in dimensions of $length^2 time^{â1}$ $C$ is the concentration in dimensions $X$ is the position.   Method Formation of hydrogen ionsâ concentration gradient    In our assumption, we first design a concentration gradient of hydrogen ionsâ concentration as in any other traditional practice in the water channel. We filled two pools with waste water of different pH values. Then, just link the two by a water channel. As the channel may be rather small comparing to the pools, we may simulate that the pH value of two pools keep the stable pH value of its own in a long time. In the end, the hydrogen ionsâ concentration gradient can be constructed in the water channel.  The formulation can be listed below. Supposing that the"

The PLA system
The PLA system
Starting from the simple idea of producing a biological alternative to regular plastic, we had to think about how to engineer bacteria to reach this goal in the most efficient way. As explained in Design , we first carefully chose our chassis; we proceeded with a basic analysis of the pathways to produce PLA; and we designed the implementation of the necessary genes.
Choosing a chassis
In literature, bioproduction of PLA had already been reported in E. coli. However, we detected several criteria that would set other organisms as better chassis for PLA synthesis, and thus accomplish our purpose: improve PLA bioproduction.
Over different potential candidates, we set P. putida KT2440 as the best chassis, as argumented in Project Description .
Basic pathway analysis
Metabolism of P. putida KT2440 has been well described in literature [1] . Taking into account the reaction steps indicated in Jung et al., 2010 [2] for bioproduction of PLA in E. coli, we studied P. putida KT2440 pathways and clarified which were the minimal genes to express to have PLA. The schema in Figure 1 indicates the reactions that we would need to introduce in our chassis.
From this, we proceeded to think about the design of our biobricks, which would contain the PLA involved genes.
Figure 1. Engineered Pct and PhaC. Propionate Co-A transferase and PHA synthase are the two genes needed for PLA production from lactic acid.
Biobrick design
Clearly, we needed two genes for PLA biosynthesis: an evolved Propionate CoA transferase who can take lactate as subtract and convert it into Lactyl-CoA, and an evolved PHA synth"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Prospects_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant silk for wound healing, it could also be interesting to prepare a three dimensional scaffold of the silk. Here a number of methods, such as salt leaching, gas forming or freeze-drying, have been reported to generate porous three-dimensional matrices Nazarov, R., et al. (2004). ""Porous 3-D Scaffolds from Regenerated Silk Fibroin"" Biomacromolecules 5: 718-727. .
The detailed description of how we want to proceed with a 4 monomer silk construct can be reviewed on this page .
The hybrid silk fibre
The idea of the hybrid silk fibre was to incorporate bacteriocins between silk monomers. From the literature, it is known that silk does not lose its function when other proteins are combined with the silk Gomes, S. C., et al. (2011). ""Antimicrobial functionalized genetically engineered spider silk."" Biomaterials 32(18): 4255-4266. . We also found that proteins incorporated in silk monomers does not lose their functions either Gomes, S. C., et al. (2012). ""Biological responses to spider silk-antibiotic fusion protein."" Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 6(5): 356-68. . This is why we believe that if the bacteriocins were to be incorporated in the silk monomers, then both components would maintain their functions and thereby their effects. We are also interested in creating hybrid silk with more than one bacteriocin incorporated, to see if they have a better effect than single bacteriocins between the silk. Our hypothesis is that silk fiber, which is proven to be immune neutral and promotes wound healing, combined with the antimicrobial effect of the bacteriocins, would create a synergistic effect resulting in decreasing infections and also a decrease in healing time in patients with severe wounds.
We tried to ligate the bacteriocin together with a silk fragment, but we did not succeed despite having the proper overhangs. The next step will then be to make more experiments with the goal of making a successful ligation between the bacteriocins and a silk construct. In theory we should succeed, so it might just take some more trials before we do.
Improving the production of PHB
PHB should be used as the envelope for our Bacto-Aid. To do this, we first need to optimize the production of PHB even further. This can be done by changing the current gene (phaCAP) in the BioBrick from Tokyo Tech 2012 Â with a stronger"

Conclusion
In conclusion our main goal has been to promote synthetic biology to a wide target audience. This has been achieved mainly via the Biosensor project and via the documentary.
The Biosensor project ensures that the average high school student receives an introduction into the world of synthetic biology, whereas the documentary spreads the message to a more general public. The Snakebite Detectives iGEM project has been the backbone of this journey, standing as an example of the potential of synthetic biology, BioBricks, and hard work.

In 2014, ATOMS-TurkiyeÂ desired to build two different devices which work synergistically and fix these two distinct situations, hypoxia and oxidative stress. Team ITESM-CEM a preventive gene therapy for atherosclerosis, based on the use of microbial enzymes.
Since cardiovascular disease is strongly associated with atherosclerotic plaque, three teams chose this disease to design their projects. Their solutions are expressing some key enzymes to degrade atherosclerotic plaque, the same with some treatments. Apart from atherosclerosis, hypertension is also the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. One Asian designed their project as the treatment of hypertension. In consideration of versatility of cardiovascular disease, one team paid attention to prevention of cardiovascular disease, its scope becomes larger. The same with our project: the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia, it can solve a few kinds of cardiovascular disease. They used genetically-engineered bacteria or reform cell. However, we use adenovirus to transfer into HEK293 cell lines. The project about treatment much than prevention, may caused by the serious status of cardiovascular disease. There is no question that all of them try to solve the problems than havenât been settled by the medical profession. It is really challenging and significant.
Meanwhile, as the Reports of cardiovascular diseases in China in 2014 show:
a. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease
The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in China is on the rising stage. Currently, an estimated 290 million cardiovascular disease patients across the country, including 270 million hypertension patients, stroke patients at least 7 million, 2.5 million patients with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure patients with 4.5"

The comparison of weight and thickness of BC showed that on the condition of equivalent carbon source and inoculated ratio of G.xy and E.coli is 4/1, the yields of BC will at least advance 11.5% compared to other groups. At the same time, we as well as discovered that the capacity of G.xy secrete BC has been significantly improved  with the ratio of glucose and glycerol is 3/2~4/1.
After setting up the inoculation level and the range of carbon ratio,  we moved forward to optimize the carbon source through RSM. During this process, we collected a series of data which based on the yield as main target and  the pH residue as co-factor, the data is present below:
The finally optimize formula which has already reached the ideal ultimate pH and visibly  improved the yields of BC is :

this optimized formula has similar carbon ratio to what we have measured  in the culture medium of  previous experiments, therefore we ultimately set up the carbon ratio as glucose/glycerol=3/2 of our co-culture medium.
There is what we have gathered after utilized 3/2 medium in the co-culture system based on the former experiments:
Compared the pH residue of single G.xy culture and co-culture during the fermentation, obviously approximately 15h after inoculation, pH of co-culture started to significantly drop while the yields of BC from co-culture clearly outnumber the yields of single G.xy culture.

The event was a great success; teams attending said 'I hadn't really appreciated just how big an impact this area of law could have on scientific development and particularly on synthetic biology - it's given me a lot to think about!'. We had a great time and there were some really interesting and insightful debates and comments - thanks especially to iGEM Cambridge for their passion on this topic!
Another team member stated, 'I don't think our team had really put much thought into the IP ownership of our project - it's definitely something we should consider though, as we would want to be able to stop anyone using our project for potentially harmful research'. 'I always thought IP was kind of a binary question - you either patent something, or you give it away. But there are so many options in between. It's a very nuanced area of law, I think that's the main thing I hadn't really appreciated, there are lots of different ways you can share or protect your ideas'.
View and download the Oxford iGEM powerpoint presentation used as the basis for our workshop below!
Special thanks for the success of this event are owed to:
Bethan  Wolfenden and Philipp Boeing for organising and iGEM UCL for hosting the YSB event
Andrew Russell, Glen Gowers, and Philipp Lorenz
Dundee, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and all the other teams which attended and took part in the debate!
...for his assistance with proof reading the presentation
Government Policy
Legislators have the difficult task of balancing a number of diverse and often conflicting intellectual property considerations. On the one hand, the government must incentivize innotvation - IP is an essential means of achieving this, as demonstrated by studies showing how patents can positively influence innovation by a margin of 15-25%2 .
The flipside of this is the responsibility of the government to prevent the creation of monopoly and to ensure that ideas are shared so as to maximize productive research. Again, there is research indicating that intellectual property is crucial to maintaining this balance, as some studies have expressed concerns that patents on initial discoveries may 'delay, hamper, or deter' innovations building on the patented work. The transaction cost of working with patented material is unattractive to many researchers, particularly individuals and start-ups.3.
Based on our research and our experiences during iGEM and in the field of IP, we believe that one of the most important roles for the government is to lead a new, more imaginative line of thinking about intellectual property protection, and to move away from analyzing these issues within the traditional and deeply engrained innovation"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"mpR-P. This then diffuses away from the red light sensor, and can bind to a specialised OmpF promoter sequence which is upstream of the HO-pcyA gene which codes for cyan pigment and stop codon. This is then transcribed and cyan pigment is produced.
When Cph8 is exposed to red light, the phosphorylation of OmpR ceases. The OmpR is not capable of diffusing away from the red light sensor, so does not bind to the OmpF promoter before the cyan pigment gene. This means that the cyan pigment can not be generated.  Cyan pigment in this system will be repressed, whereas magenta and yellow pigments will still be produced, which when mixed create a red pigment.
Green light pathway
The green light module works differently to the red and blue light modules but it still uses a light sensor (CcaS), intermediate protein (CcaR) and a specialised promoter. However, when the system is exposed to green light, CcaR is phosphorylated and CcaR-P is generated, allowing the synthesis of the magenta pigment to be up regulated instead of prevented. To make an overall green colour, we only want the yellow and cyan pigments to be transcribed, so production of the magenta pigment is problematic.
To overcome this issue, we will introduce an inverter system. CcaR-P will be produced when the bacteria are exposed to green light, but instead of binding to a promoter placed before the gene coding for magenta pigment, it will bind to a cI repressor system.  The subsequent transcription of the cI repressor protein will prevent the synthesis of the magenta pigment, as it will bind to a cI promoter. Binding of cI to this promoter ceases transcription of any following genes, therefore magenta will not be produced.
Blue light pathway
The YtvA/FixL blue light sensor phosphorylates FixJ to FixJ-p in the absence of blue light.  FixJ-p then binds to the promoter for the yellow pigment gene and stop codon.  In the absence of blue light the Yellow pigment is produced.
The blue light module works in much the same way as the red light module; absence of blue light allows the phosphorylation of an intermediate protein (FixJ) by the blue light sensor (YF1). FixJ can then bind to its specialised promoter which controls the transcription of the yellow pigment (amilGFP). Exposure to blue light leads to the suppression in production of the yellow pigment.
The remaining pigments, magenta and cyan, will combine to form"

May 14, 2014
--CS-- Today we did the plasmid preps of the J23108 and J23110 bacteria that we grew up overnight. I also added 1 Î¼l CIP to the restriction digest of the pIG91 vector for an hour and ran it on a low-melt gel. When we went to cut out the DNA though there was no DNA in the well for our plasmid (the ladder had DNA though so the gel worked fine), so it appears that the freezer sample of pIG91 DNA must not have been a good sample. We will try the procedure again with some of the pIG91 plasmid that was isolated yesterday.

Assisted Nano-dropping the recently purified pIG91 plasmisds, all concentrations were approximately 100ng/ul.
Assisted in setting up ligation of digested pIG91 (treated with CIP), with the digested Bla. Both were digested using SpeI HF and XbaI. This is so that we can then have our part in the iGEM registry plasmid to allow for quick and easy future cloning.
--CS-- Today we redid the restriction digest of pIG91 using some of the plasmid that Julie and Bri isolated on Tuesday. We followed the protocol and used the XbaI and SpeI enzymes. We added 1 Î¼l CIP to the digest an hour before running it on a low-melt gel at 80V for about 50 minutes. We then checked the concentrations of the J23108, J23110, and pIG91 plasmids that we had isolated during the week. Everything checked out pretty well in terms of concentrations and purity.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that we should model our MDA reaction first in order to know what length distribution of product we should expect and what effect the substrate nucleotide might have on DNA amplification.That was an important aspect to consider, because while exploring the literature we have found that even though phi29 does not incorporate many modified nucleotides, when it tries to do that it is inhibited and falls of. That might result in large number of short fragments, which is not ideal when using Nanopore Sequencing. Therefore, we have written a mathematical description of Phi29 DNA amplification which takes into account Phi29 inhibition by substrate nucleotide, in order to find maximum amount of Substrate Nucleotides we can use without worrying about short sequencing reads. To see the model, please click here .

Week 33
We have redesigned our prototype by adding the MDA reaction. The negative aspect of turning to MDA was the usage of dsDNA as a template, as we did not know whether the Rolling Circle Transcription (RCT)  would work, because all of the literature describes RCT only using circular ssDNA template. Gladly, we have later demonstrated that RCT works well with double stranded circular DNA molecules.
Week 34
Another issue we had with our first Prototype was the inefficiency of droplet merging. It is very important to merge all of the droplets containing the Product Nucleotides, as each droplet that is not merged is lost information about a specific mutant. At that time, our efficiency was lower then 1 merged droplet for every 20 to 30.
Week 35
To solve this huge issue we have met with Physicist and Microfluidic Technology expert Valdemaras Milkus from the Institute of biotechnology.
More
We have hoped to receive insight about how could we effectively solve that problem. Valdemaras has told us about how he approached similar problems. In his case it was precise-size droplet generation. He solved this problem by modelling and suggested for us to do the same. According to Valdemaras - even though the microfluidic models are extremely difficult to write, it is a lot harder to experimentally find the right parameters when there are multiple unknown variables. It might be like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Week 37
Following Valdemaras advice we have derived a full mathematical description of the active fusion of droplets inside of a microfluidic chip. Using this model we have solved multiple parameters which we then tested experimentally. The predicted parameters have successfully provided perfect droplet merging conditions which we have then continued using in the"

Unesp_Brazil,2018,Team:Unesp Brazil#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," if there already is any regulations about engineered probiotics and if there are clinical trials or companies using engineered probiotics in these countries. This work was done in collaboration with teams Chalmers-Gothenburg , IIT Delhi , Jiangnan China , TecCEM and Lambert . Thank you very much for all of the teams for your research!
China
In China, there is no regulation for genetically engineered probiotics, the present tests in the country approach pathogenic potential, and patronized standards for food evaluation. No companies or clinical trials that uses engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
India
In India, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) in partnership with DBT (Department of Biotechnology), created an official guide to evaluate probiotics in the country, so any probiotic product needs to be on this guideÂ´s pattern to be released in the market.
Before being approved and released, food is submitted to standardized tests for identification and characterization of its new chains, such as PCR, in vitro tests mimicking the gut environment, in vivo testing to check the effectiveness in live animals, safety assessment for human use, evaluation of efficacy in humans, also there are standards patterns that need to be followed for the process of food packing and management.
Currently, the probiotic market in India is dominated by multinationals, which mainly commercialize fermented food products. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic, but food containing GM or transgenic compounds are not identified, even though there are biosecurity laws and norms for regulation, such as SEP, CIBIOGEM, SAGARPA, SEMARNAT, SHCP and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer.
In terms of the norm, the Official Mexican, Norm NOM-056-FITO-1995, is in force and regulates everything related to GM mobilization in the country, so all public and private company must fulfill the requirements in the norm to have their food with genetically engineered compounds transit through Mexico. Furthermore, the law of Biosecurity of GMO and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer controls the release for consumption and commercialization of pilot projects besides regulating importation and exportation of GM in the country. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.

First, we used PCC7942 as our template to do the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to gain the sequence of Lycopene-US and Lycopene-DS. And we used the backbone pPIGBACK we had made as the PCR template to gain AmpR sequence. Second, with the primers we designed, we conducted a three pieces fusion PCR to connect these three sequences as the following orderï¼Lycopene-US + AmpR + Lycopene-DS.
Third, the constructed plasmid containingâ Lycopene-US + AmpR + Lycopene-DSâ is transformed into PCC7942. There is a probability for Homologous Recombination11 to occur in the genome of PCC7942 through this transferred plasmid. The Lycopene cyclase gene (CrtL) will be replaced by AmpR in Homologous Recombination. Finally, the âGene Knock Outâ is completed.
To conform to the iGEM part registry, we use IDT service to synthesize the DNA sequences of Lycopene-US and Lycopene-DS. Compared with two sequences from PCC7942 wild type, the IDT sequence synthesized sequences will not contain the Restriction Enzyme sites (RE site) of PstI and XbaI because we have changed codons in each RE site according to the codon usage table of PCC7942. The submission parts to the iGEM Parts Registry are
BBa_K2350007(Lycopene-US)
BBa_K2350008 (Lycopene-DS).
BBa_K2350014 (Lycopene-US + AmpR + Lycopene-DS).

Functional Test
We expect the transformed PCC7942 with CrtZ gene could produce zeaxanthin and become more yellow. Just like our prediction, the results show that the transformed PCC7942 is more yellow than wild type apparently.
Moreover, we expect the transformed PCC7942 which produces zeaxanthin would change wavelength absorbance and have better photosynthetic efficiency.
Wavelength Absorbance
To test this hypothesis, we used spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of CrtZ and wild type at 400 to 700 nm. The outcome is that the OD value of CrtZ transformant at 400 to 500 nm is higher than wild type. The result verified our first prediction, a change of wavelength absorbance."

We have successfully cloned SpPCS  in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1526000 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
We have successfully cloned the intermediate construct pYodA + SpPCS in pSB1C3  ( BBa_K1526004 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
We have successfully cloned Gsh1* ( BBa_K1526001 ) in pSB1C3 into E.coli DH5Î±
We have successfully cloned CysP in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1526003 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
Characterizing the parts:
Creating the regulator LacRS
In order to characterize the parts we have created a new BioBrick compatible with our chassis. As E.coli DH5Î± does not have a lac repressor system we have assembled together basic parts J32100, B0033, C0012, B0010, B0012 and R0010 to create the composite regulator Lac Repressor System (LacRS)
Our first functionalization test coupling LacRS upstream the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Biobrick (E0040) showed expression of GFP under UV light when the system is previously induced by IPTG.
We have successfully cloned and tested the functionality of LacRS in pSB1A3 ( BBa_K1526009 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
Creating Inducible monofunctional constructs:
Each gene from our project was assembled downstream our LacRS Biobrick in order to allow a better characterization of the parts.
We have successfully cloned LacRS+Gsh1* in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1526005 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
We have successfully cloned LacRS+SpPCS in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1526006 ) into E.coli DH5Î±
We have successfully cloned LacRS+MntH  ( BBa_K1526007 ) in pSB1"
Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#perception_-_-_TEXT.html," biologist, and we realized how important the contact and the discussion with the population is when dealing with such a sensitive topic. In our case, both the risks and the potential benefits are huge, leading to very polarized opinions among the interviewees. I strongly believe that scientists must make an effort to increase the transparency of their results and not push their ideas if the population doesn't accept them, in order to reduce the gap that now separates them from the rest of the population.
The most remarkable thing I learned from our human practice project is the level of public awareness on genetic modification. I am not a biologist myself, and before I did not really care about this field--I always thought 'the experts knows better'. But after seeing the debate and even the discussion among high school students about this field, I was surprised with their opinion showing how much they actually aware. I guess it may be a bit related with the different education culture in France and in my country where the students are less encouraged to speak about their thought; but as a prospective scientist I learned that I should care more about public opinion, as well as expose myself with new knowledge and information.
Our project was initially based upon the idea of genetically modified bacteria that could be sprayed along with DDT. The bacteria would degrade the DDT after some time, hopefully having a less drastic environmental impact, as the DDT would soon disappear. We started to consider consider human practices as an important issue and realized that the DDT project could have other unaddressed dangers. What if the DDT degrading genes were transferred to other species? DDT degrading gene could be transferred to mosquitoes, and then our system would have done something far, far worse than the its potential for good. But I know that there must be worthy risks in terms of environmental applications of genetically modified bacteria. Through human practices I learned that most people would agree, through a proper weighing of benefit vs. risk, certain projects should be applied in the environment as long as we use proper genetic safeguards for safety.
I could not imagine how anyone in his/her right mind could be opposed to synthetic biology and its applications. I was convinced that if people were, it was because they did not really know much about the field, because they are ignorant. Therefore if we educated them, they would realize how GREAT SB is and would accept it.
Now, thanks to the human practice project, I realized that this naÃ¯ve vision of things is completely false and also very dangerous! First realization: People have the legitimate right to be opposed to synthetic biology. There is no link between ignorance of SB and rejection of its applications Second realization:"

Local biosafety group
We have a local biosafety group at our institution, and they have advised us to follow standard safety protocols for genetic engineering and molecular biology that are the standard practice at our institution. None of the BioBricks submitted in this project comprise any elevated danger of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety, if the standard practice is followed.
Other safety measures
At the institute all equipment used for bacteria are cleaned with cetyl and autoclaved. This treatment kill the bacteria but the DNA might still be intact. In order for the DNA to be inactivated more autoclaves would be needed. Another way to inactivate DNA is by using chlorine. However, this raises an issue with regard to nature.
When working in a class II laboratory it is important to handle all waste carefully. This means that everything should be autoclaved.
The Department for systems biology have developed an safety protocol that we have all read, signed and followed during the duration of our project. This applies to the given laws and regulation.

Caleigh: Ordered the Universal RBS from IDT. Began investigating United States Food and Drug Administration regulations that would affect implementation of our proposed therapy and began reaching out to experts for Human Practices purposes. Oversaw transformation of GFP from kit plate.
Katie: Attended a SURF seminar about performing a literature review. Contacted the on-campus experts Dr. Sors recommended about the creation of a lung model, Dr. Gert Breur from the Purdue Veterinary School and Dr. Andrea Kasinski from the Purdue Department of Biological Sciences. Received replies from Dr. Breur and his colleague as well as from Dr. Kasinski and her post-doc and graduate student pertaining to their donation of rat lungs to the project. Conducted a literature search in order to evaluate the lung model methods. Looked into pricing for the decellularization/recellularization bioreactor creation.
Kevin: Began more extensive research on the promoter preceding the atpI gene, including looking at conserved regions of its predicted promoter sequence amongst different species of bacteria. Of these bacteria, there was a consensus region of approximately 30bp. Using the relative frequency of base pairs from a weblogo plot as well as a random number generator, 20 possible new universal promoters were designed. All promoter sequences were run through a promoter predictor algorithm and the 12 that were recognized and given a score progressed to the final test. From these 12 promoter sequences, 5 were chosen based on their scores and how conserved  the -10 and -35 consensus regions were.

There is a difference in fluorescence and normalised fluorescence between CRP constructs and controls.  (therefore, CRP constructs produce GFP)  This difference can be seen in fluorescence after 4 hours, but can only be seen in normalised fluorescence after 12 hours.
The fluorescence is however still about 10-11 fold less than constitutive GFP.
There appears to be slight repression of GFP fluorescence due to glucose for 0.05% glucose and 0.5% glucose.
However, this is only shown after about 12 hours, and there does not seem to be a clear change in time delay with increased glucose.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#miniSymposium_-_-_TEXT.html," to your fellow iGEM teams: a meet-up was missing in the current way iGEM teams approach their nearby âcolleaguesâ. So we, with agreement of TU-Eindhoven, started the initiative to host a mini symposium for all the Dutch teams, to have a chance to get involved with each other. The idea was simple, we arranged a lecture room and everyone was offered 30 minutes to show their dreams and indicate where they might need some help of other teams. We included enough time to have small discussions about the projects, and organized a barbeque in an old laboratory to informally bond with the other teams and celebrate the ending of a useful day.
iGEM BBQ!
We were very pleased that every team was enthusiastic and every team was able to join for the full programme. Thanks to the WURtv, we were able to record every presentation and broadcast them on the internet for everyone who was interested but was not able to join. These movies are still available:
Presentations part 1 and Presentations part 2 .
After the presentations we arranged a nice indoor barbeque (Dutch weather) in one of the old university buildings that is not used anymore. We could not have dreamed of a better surrounding to interact with our fellow iGEM teams: an old laboratory room. Every team stayed until the last opportunity to take a train back home, which is of course a great indication of how they have enjoyed the experience of that day.
One of the good things that was obtained from this day was that every team got a honest feedback about their project and everyone was motivated to help each other out to advise how to approach certain problems. More importantly, the day was a unique experience for everyone, and a real opportunity to test the presentation skills needed for the jamborees and when you approach investors. Because of the informal setup and the iGEM audience, it was a perfect first trial to give a talk about a project, and see how people react to your story.
Last, but certainly not least, the day was the base of a true bonding of the iGEM teams. On this result alone, we would recommend all the next iGEM teams to host such informal meetings in an early stage of the competition, to learn what your close competitors are up to and to get involved with them. After the evening, there was a big need for a national interaction and collaboration. Some of the initiatives that started after this event were:
A follow up meeting before the regional jamboree to show each other what we are willing to present on the jamboree and to practise"

Parts
As the chassis B. subtilis is not as used as E. coli,  it was sometimes hard for us the get or find desired parts.
However, with the collaboration of other iGEM and a synthesis compagny, we managed to obtain or make the following parts:
Submitted parts
We have deposed X new BioBrick parts to the Registry.  All of them were cloned into the standard plasmid pSB1C3, tested and sequenced.
Chemotaxis
BBa_K1364000: Strong RBS for B. subtilis ( K780001 )  + Chemotaxis code  + Double terminator ( B0015 )
N-acetylglucosamine based chemotaxis:
This part is designed to enable a N-acetylglucosamine  based chemotaxis in Bacillus subtilis.
Design:
The encoded protein is a chimera of two proteins:
- the methyl accepting Chemotaxis protein (McpA from Bacillus subtilis which is required for taxis towards glucose.
- the N-acetylglucosamine regulated methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein from Vibrio cholerae (VCD).
The chimeric protein contains the intracellular domains of McpA from Bacillus subtilis to enable the transduction of the signal:  these domains correspond to the amino acids 1-37 and 282-610.  The extracellular domain of VCD is inserted between the intracellular regions of McpA  to sense N-acetylglucosamine and corresponds to the amino acids 31-310.
Type
Translation unit
Tests
