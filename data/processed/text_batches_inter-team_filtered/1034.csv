Hello!
I major in molecular biology and have received a doctorate degree from The Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and published a paper about UV radiation-responsive proteins in rice leaves by proteomic analysis in the academic journal:Plant Cell and Physiology. The iGEM competition is interesting for me and my students. The process of preparing for the competition was hard, but funny, and exciting for us. It improved the ability of our students and promoted friendship between them.
Team idea
During the early stage,  nearly all members of our team came up with multiple ideas about synthetic biology. Many of them are devoted to the improvement or protection of the environment. Others focus  on drug developement. Finally, after many discussions, we conclude that Tina’s project about copper detection is more practical and easy to implement. So our team focus its dedication to studying improvement of copper detection.

Hi. My name’s Sally. I’m a grade 11 student and I’m the leader of the BFSUICC-China. My major job is doing experiment and preparing the essay of our team.
My favorite thing is spend whole day at home and keep doing something crazy rarely. Because in my view human brain would be so tired if it keeps doing thing alright,                   so being crazy is a good way to relax.
Hello, everyone. My name is wang yuyao.，English name is Tom I am an 11th-grade student from BFSU-ICC. I am interested in equestrian. I am now studying a-level major in computer and economics. The reason for me to participate in IGEM this time is that I have been interested in biology since my childhood, and I want to know more about biology in my spare time. I hope that I can make more friends and learn more about biology in this study and exchange activity.

However, their growth in such medium was quite weak, which made us change to test this circuit in LB medium. The general protocol was firstly to culture seed bacterium in LB medium for overnight. The seed medium was added to fresh LB medium in the next morning to adjust the initial OD600=0.05. When OD600 of this new medium reached about 0.6, IPTG, tryptophan and tetracycline were added to adjust the final concentration to be 24mg/L, 2mM, and designed concentration, respectively. OD600 was measured and growth curve was obtained for further analysis. All the condition test experiment was conducted in 24-well plate with 1.5mL LB medium in each unit and further confirmation was conducted in a 100mL flask containing 20mL LB medium. In the first round, we tested some low concentration of tetracycline (0, 12, 18, 24ug/mL) which was added when induced by IPTG and tryptophan but found no significant difference in growth. Therefore, we increased the concentration of tetracycline and added it at the initiation of the growth. Some interesting results were obtained and described as the Figure below.
Figure. 11 bitter pressure part function: growth rate against tetracycline addition  (extracellular addition of tryptophan)
It was found that growth of microorganisms was significantly influenced by tetracycline, which was shown that as the increase of the concentration of tetracycline, the growth rate decreased. We also found that for pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS-ori_tetA, its growth was severely inhibited by the induction of IPTG. The growth of bacterium in the condition with zero IPTG and tryptophan addition proved that the leakage expression of tetA existed so that our desired condition should be in a high tetracycline concentration.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to produce biofuels. The costs of biofuels are not favorable compared to current fossil fuels due to the production costs. Therefore, the students from the capital stated that they believe that the Netherlands should invest in such innovations, even if it would lead to a less favorable economical situation in the near future.
The last Dutch team was Eindhoven, who introduced their modular device to biosense diseases. Their statement was that the patent regulations should not apply for applied research. This was met with the most ambiguity throughout the audience. There were comments stating that patents were only used if the “new” products made with the help of patented items, had to be payed for, and not if used only for research.
Drinks and acknowledgements
The day was finalized with drinks and an opportunity for the audience to mingle and discuss further with other professionals.  It gave us an unique chance to talk with people who deal with these kind of issues on a daily basis. We also had the insight that the discussion after the presentations could even be more fruitful by raising specific situations instead of open-ended statements. Moreover, a lot of people agreed that the open source system has a lot of promises, but that we should look at the consequences and at each case specifically. This also relates to the aim of our policy and practice tool.
We would like to thank the RIVM and Rathenau institute for making this day possible. A special thanks  to Virgil Rerimassie, Korienke Smit and Jaco Westra! And also to Loesje Praktijken for making the nice pictures!
Science Center
In the spirit  of the Science Centre, we want to inspire children by letting them design their own imaginary bacterium through their own creativity. In order to achieve this, we set up a workshop about synthetic biology. We designed the workshop in such a way that every future iGEM team could use our format if they want to.
When asked what they want to be when they grow up, children often reply with pilot, firefighter, police officer, veterinarian or any other “superman”. Kids usually don’t scream out “MICROBIOLOGIST”.  By inspiring children in the field of science, they will be more prone to develop interest in research and technology. This is a challenging goal we have taken on. We would like to both reach out to the public and educate them about the wonderful world of synthetic biology. For this, we believe that the Science Centre of Delft is the perfect place. The museum turns the Delft University of Technology inside out and allows you to see the role technology"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#kr_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic biology considering the fact that synthetic biology has wide applications in biotechnology industries (Hranueli, 2013).
The report states that in 2011, out of 921 biotechnology businesses that responded to the survey, the three main biotechnology industries were biopharmaceutical industry (274), biochemistry industry (196), and biofood industry (206). Other biotechnology industries include bioenvironmental industry, bioenergy industry, and bioelectronics industry etc (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).
The report also suggests that biotechnology business in Korea is growing. In 2011, around 35,600 people were employed in the biotechnology industry and within that group around 22,100 people were researchers. This number represents a 3.4% increase compared to the number of researchers (21357) in 2010. Also, the total market value of biotechnology industry in 2009 was around US $4.0 billion, growing annually at 17.6%. In 2011, the total market value had risen to US $5.5 billion (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).
Only one Korean company, Bioneer, is listed in the SynBio map inventory. Bioneer has gene synthesizing technology that is the foundation for synthetic biology (""Synthetic biology project,"").
Biotechnology Industry Funding
We present information of biotechnology funding as a whole. ‘Bio-Vision 2016’, the second Korean national framework plan for the promotion of biotechnology, is currently under way. Under this plan the Korean government will provide around US $9.7 billion in 2012 to 2016 for expanding local biotechnology industries. This pledge was reaffirmed by the prime minister during the Bio-Korea 2012 conference held in Seoul. The plan also mentions that the government should increase support for the development of synthetic biology. Additional details, however, are not provided in the framework. The Ministry of Health and Welfare mentioned that the government would eagerly support the development of biotechnology in terms of policies and international collaboration (Lee, 2012).
In addition, private funding in 2011 was round US$ 1.3 billion. This value represents a 26.6% increase compared to the US$ 1.02 billion generated in 2010. 89.9% of the total fund is from the three major biotechnology industries in Korea which are biopharmaceutical (63.8%), biochemistry (13%), and biofood industry (12.5%) (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).

A novel discipline always needs effort to be spread out, a simple and clear way, of course, is necessary. Textbooks? Papers and Thesis? They may not be accepted by the busy public. A brief picture is much more effective and meaningful than a manual book. By collecting the great achievement and famous scientists in the Synthetic Biology map, it's simple enough for you to know the key point of SynBio from 1980s, when it was proposed, to now. Nothing can raise your desire but our Map. Who defined synthetic biology? What's its first achievement? What trouble did it caused? Come on and take a look at the moment that you have lost in Synthetic Biology.

Human Practice Modeling
Gene Contamination has been proposed as a potential hazard by Chinese specialist. Transgenic suffered from 3 aspects of nondeterminacy, the chain reactor after the altered of life structure, the potential risk of the food chain and the transgenic contamination, propagation, proliferation, and clear. Until the beginning of the 21st century, transgenic contamination has occurred in many countries world widely, such as Starlink Corn in America, transgenic canola in Canada and corn transgenic contamination in Mexico. All of these facts prove that the hazard of transgenic contamination could not be regarded. But for the limitation of the statistics, many prediction and analysis couldn’t be conducted. In our modeling process, we start from the most fundamental problem, trying to construct a right stream of proposing, analyzing and solving problem from detail to macroscopy. Two models concerning proposing problem predicted the hazard of genetic contamination. The analyzing model focused on a variety factors relating with the attitudes of four major group in society, government, industry, public and institutes. The solving model emphasized on two hands, one is the effectiveness of our project and, on the other hand, the publicizing strategy referring to the necessity of the mastery of the genetic safety knowledge. What's more, parts of our modeling can be adapted to most of the similar issues, which is a acceptable reference for the followup teams.

Flux Balance Analysis
FBA is a mathematical method for simulating metabolism by calculating steady-state metabolic fluxes for large metabolic networks. The modelling subgroup deemed that flux balance analysis will help us find an optimal pathway for maximizing production of PHB in E. coli BL21 (DE3) after inserting our genetic construct . MATLAB has Cobra toolbox that is used for flux balance analysis and visualization of metabolic networks. Thus, the modelling subgroup installed the toolbox and searched for models that contained E. coli’s reactions/metabolic networks. We found that the E. coli core model contained pathways and reactions of our interest. We decided to use this model as a proof of concept because it was not possible to visualize the E. coli BL21 (DE3) model and was computationally expensive due to the presence of large number of reactions (edges) and metabolites (nodes). We loaded the core model and and visualized it using Paint4Net functions . The reaction nodes are represented as rectangle, metabolite nodes as ellipses, zero rate fluxes as grey arrows, green edges represent positive-rate (forward) fluxes, and blue edges represent negative-rate (backward) fluxes.
Figure 1. Visual representation of E. coli core model with optimized fluxes for the bacteria’s biomass.
After reading the model containing metabolic networks, the toolbox has ‘optimizeCbModel’ function that calculates steady-state flux for the metabolic network. The objective of the function can be changed to a different metabolite. In our case, the objective was changed to PHB because we wanted to find the optimal pathway for PHB synthesis after inserting our construct .
Results
The first step for FBA analysis was to insert the genes that utilize products of glycolysis pathway ( phaC, phaB, and phaA ) and beta-oxidation pathway ( phaC1, phaJ4 ) into the E. coli core model . The team was able to add the phaCBA genes into the core model . The model was visualized to look for any changes in the pathway.
Figure 2. Reaction nodes for phaB and phaC. The red rectangles show that the reactions are dead ends.
We noticed that our model showed that the new reactions as a result of adding phaCBA were ‘dead ends’. The result of optimizeCbModel was 0, which means there was no steady-state flux for the objective selected i.e. optimal pathway for PHB. The product (PH"

As such, we designed an EGFP-GLB1 fusion protein to act as an alternative base editing reporter for potential testing in a disease model in the future. Based on published work on GLB1 mutation genotyping in patients and its corresponding residual enzymatic activity (Table 1), we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on 319T → C, which leads to phenylalanine at amino acid 107 to be changed to leucine (TCT mutant), and on 1166T → C, which leads to leucine at amino acid 389 to be changed into proline (CCG mutant). These two single nucleotide substitutions are expected to result in total loss or minimal residual beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity.
Using colourimetric (X-gal, ONPG) or fluorescent (DDAOG) beta-galactosidase substrate, we can then check for the restoration of GLB1 enzymatic activity after base editing in transfected cells. A successful base repair by our RESCUE Editor system would allow the conversion of a mutant GLB1 to a functional GLB1, thus leading to restoration of enzymatic function (Figure 2). At the same time, the EGFP reporter can act as transfection/expression control for internal normalisation.
Figure 2. Schematic illustration of EGFP-GLB1 reporter. EGFP and GLB1 gene are separated by the linker which contains a stop codon for EGFP and a Kozak sequence for GLB1 translation initiation. This ensures both proteins are expressed as their native sizes. Our RESCUE Editor system will change UCU to UUU for the TCT mutant and change CCG to CUG for CCG mutant to restore enzymatic activity.

Presentation to NEWBio Teachers - Penn State Center for Science and the Schools
Since past iGEM teams have been very active in outreach and education, we began this summer with the goal of doing the same. We found a perfect opportunity with NEWBio, also known as the Northeast Woody/Warm-season Biomass Consortium. NEWBio is ""a regional network of universities, businesses, and governmental organizations dedicated to building robust, scalable, and sustainable value chains for biomass energy in the Northeast (NE). Driven by the broad societal benefits that sustainable bioenergy value chains could provide, NEWBio aims to overcome existing barriers and dramatically increase the sustainable, cost-effective supply of lignocellulosic biomass while reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing ecosystem services, and building vibrant communities.""
The purpose of NEWBio is to help train secondary school educators in the principles of bioenergy. In this way, NEWBio seeks to ""train the trainers"" that will have an impact on the future career's of the nation's youth. The program is a week long workshop where teachers are exposed to the many areas of biology in a variety of ways.  The week is spent listening to talks led by professors and groups, exploring the campus, and ultimately making new lesson plans for the school year.
We presented to a group of 10 teachers on our research and the need for biorenewable fuels. Our message to them was how the tools of synthetic biology can be used to combat energy and environmental crises and demonstrate how they can introduce simple synthetic biology techniques to their classes. Through this outreach we facilitated the flow of information from the bench to the classroom. The iGEM team is a great asset to this program, as we can provide the teachers with information in a way that students would enjoy and understand.  This is also a great experience in learning how to better discuss our iGEM projects and present to groups of people who may know little about the subject.
Here we were able to show these teachers ways that they can explain synthetic biology to their students.  These are easily reproducible activities and are fun, too!

Hypothesis
It has been reported that TAL effectors target genes efficiently in many eukaryocytes like mammalian cells and yeasts. However, the former experiments with E. coli indicate that TAL effectors don’t work well in E. coli cells. There are a variety of factors can possibly be attributed to its low efficiency, and homologous recombination is a highly possible one.
As is known since the discovery of Holliday junction, homologous recombination can happen to DNA sequences sharing common region, and only depends on the homology of the two sequences. We have introduced that TALE is composed of many highly conserved repeats, with only the 2 amino acids at position 12 and 13 in difference, which reasonably leads to in cell homologous recombination under the functions of Rec family proteins.

What current and upcoming research in the field of synthetic biology are you most excited about?
""I'm deeply interested in the work being conducted into potential mechanisms for combating infectious disease. The German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich believed that a chemical compound capable of exploiting the differences between eukaryotic cells and bacterial cells could be harnessed as a ""magic bullet"", capable of destroying bacterial cells while leaving human cells intact. With the advent of synthetic biology, it is highly likely that a bacteriophage could be developed to act as Ehrlich's bullet. Engineering viruses to specifically attack microbial pathogens offers a highly promising solution to the clinical challenge posed by the growing inefficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. The success of such measures is crucial, as bacteria become ever more resistant to our antibiotics. Using viruses to solve this problem is a pretty neat idea. America should get on that.""
Montgomery IGEM | Skillman, New Jersey  What inspired you to found iGEM for Montgomery? What has been your most exciting experience and what is one project that you have always wanted to pursue?
""My inspiration for founding iGEM was really as an escape - a place to discover and explore new grounds. Our school didn't provide many outlets for lab experience or medical extracurriculars so I figure I'd give it a shot. iGEM has always been to me a way to explore new heights and challenge ourselves. My most exciting experience - it sounds cheesy - but it was definitely our first meeting. Seeing the eyes of the members just light up when we mentioned ""bacterial transformation"" or ""genetic engineering"" was just a magical experience. That's when I knew the club was going to be something bigger than just the science. As for the project, I've always wanted to do something in neuroscience. Perhaps a protein that would increase neurogenesis and thus the pathways that our minds can follow to think of new ideas.""
Ridgefield, Conn.
""I think GMOs should be safe for human consumption, and synthetic biology should be okay to use in medicine especially if they have to be used in order to save someone's life. It shouldn't be used for human cloning though. If I had a superpower using synthetic biology, I'd like to be something that could help people or save lives.""

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html,"ycin concentration, we get no favorable evidence in explaining calcium ions could regulate the enhancer-promoter. In theory, after adding 5μM Ionomycin, it would have a significant intracellular increase of Ca2+, which would show a great up-regulated expression of luciferase.
Explanation: In order to explain the result, we searched for more research and studies and find out that there is calcium in the cell culture (proximally 2mM) and that concentration might be enough to start transcription. Then we come up with the idea to reduce the calcium concentration using EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) a polyamino carboxylic acid, a chelating agent that is related to the better known EDTA, but with a much higher affinity for calcium. The result will be shown below.
2. Promoter functions without Ca2+ from medium
Result: The figure below strongly demonstrated that CRE-JeT promoter has dramatically promotes the level of expression with the stimuli of calcium/Ionomycin, compared with the control group (whose Ca2+ concentration is reduced to almost zero with the help of EGTA).
While there is still the problem that the expression level of luciferase when there is no calcium is relatively high. Similarly, we tried to figure out the reason for this phenomenon by referring to the mechanism of the CRE enhancer. As is shown in the project page, there is no research showing that the CRE enhancer has the function of blocking transcription. And the activation function is based on epigenetical mechanism as well. In that case, the unexpected transcription initiation is the result of JeT core promoter.
3. Could ChR2 and CRE-Jet work together as expected?
Result: Unfortunately, there is no positive result in this section because instead of increasing, the fluorescent value decreased slightly after illumination treatment.
In the beginning, we thought this result is hard to explain because the previous experiment has suggested that CRE-JeT promoter be sensitive to Ca2+ stimuli. However, after close look at the mechanism of Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, we figured out that this result is explainable and reliable.
Future: Research by Professor Grigory Krapivinsky suggested that NMDAR (another Ca2+ channel) is coupled to ERK-MAPK pathway by interaction with Ras-GRF1. And further studies suggested that concentration increased as a result of Ca2+ influx through ion channels is localized. Researchers believed that this localized increase will have little effect on cellular MAPK pathways unless Ras-GRF1 appeared in the nearby region (such as"

Ethics
As with any other technology, the implementation of Mantis in society raises concerns that must be addressed. One way of addressing these concerns is an ethical analysis of some questions posed by our technology. To perform such analysis we talked with several experts whose input served as inspiration for our personal analysis presented in the following graph and texts. These experts were Prof. Dr. Marcel Verweij (Head of the Department in Philosophy from Wageningen University & Research), Dr. André Krom (Ethics Expert from the RIVM, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment), Dr. Ghislaine van Thiel (Medical Ethics teacher at Utrecht Medical University), Prof. Dr. Tsjalling Swierstra (Professor of Philosophy at Maastricht University), Dr. Ree Meertens (Associate Professor of Health Promotion at Maastricht University) and Jaco Westra (Coordinator of Synthetic Biology at the RIVM). The conclusions of this research were implemented in the Roll-out Plan .
Risk Perception
Here you will find an analysis of safety and risk, and how risk has an important subjective component. Also, we thought about how Mantis could be perceived by society considering different factors for risk perception (Figure 1).
Risk Perception: What is safety and how important is it?
What is safety? In our case, safety is the condition of a technology  that makes the user, the environment or any other individual free from any risk"

We added 200uL HAc/NaAc(pH=7.5) to 4800uL protein solution. And then, we used shaker to make them mixed at the speed of 300r/min and 20 centigrade working about one hour. We added butanol which is 5 times volume of detergent to do reverse extraction. Centrifuge was used to make them separated and finally in the lower phase (water phase), we got pure target protein.

Figure 6. In this picture of gel, the first lane is marker. The second lane is the original solution of GFP-sJanus. The third lane is the system adding 2% and the fourth is that adding 5%. We can see clearly that other proteins have been removed. Unfortunately, because of some unknown reasons, there isn’t any line about BFP-sJanus in this gel.
Figure 7. We used Bandscan5.0 to analysis the gel. The percentage of our target protein in total proteins is 11.5% before separating. It increased to 59.1% in the third lane(2% Berol 532) and 88.7% in the fourth lane(5% Berol 532). Many other proteins have been removed.
Figure 8. We can see the green florescence in the upper phase. This picture was shot in ultraviolet.
We did the second group of experiment. In this experiment, the concentration of protein solution and volume of Berol 532 changed. The total volume of protein solution is 6mL. The conditions doing this experiment is same as above.

The APTES also contains the amine-residues on which the NHS-biotin can bind to biotinylate the glass surface that then can be used for streptavidin-affinity-tags (Lapin and Chabal, 2009). In our project, we used this workflow for biotinylation of BSA to induce the immobilization of a GFP-streptavidin fusion protein on a 96 well plate. Additionally, the biotinylation of glass slides can be used to produce more robust and reclaimable biotin surfaces for affinity and binding experiments.

Help from Dr. Xiaoqiang Guo
During the experiment in our project, we encountered a problem of DNA sequencing. The result tented to be confusing. We couldn’t tell whether the mutant BRAF in melanoma cells had been cleaved. It seriously influenced our experiment process, so we asked for the experienced expert for help. Dr. Xiaoqiang Guo from Peking University suggested that we can solve this problem by using TA cloning assay. With his help, we got satisfactory results.

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," 1:12 for over the weekend. This of course depends on the confluency reached by tomorrow.?Could also do a split that is 1:24 (which would last 4 days roughly before splitting), and see how that turns out by Monday.
May 17th, 2012.
Cells in NK dish were properly confluent (80%). Seeded two plates, one at 1:3, which will then be split tomorrow at 1:12. The other 1:24, and to be safe/relatively consistent with the other plate, will do a media change tomorrow.  By Monday, going to check which looks more viable in terms of media colour, confluency etc. Then going to decide which to keep. (Serial splits, or one large split)
May 18th, 2012.
Cells in 1:3 were confluent... Pipetted up and down to detach from the plate instead of trypsin (don't want to loose healthy cells that may not have adhered). Final volume was 10 mL, so split 1:10. I checked under the scope before placing in the incubator, and they look similar to the 1:12 splits, so they should last until monday. To be safe, will check on Sunday their confluency. 1:24, changed media. But it is possible that some cells were washed away in the process (especially if they didn't adhere). Will check sunday as well, but the populations looked incredibly low. It may make sense for the summer to bring up a new stock from the freezer (depending on how high passage numbers are getting from my plate, which is all we have in culture now).
May 19th, 2012
Both cell populations looked incredibly low. The 1:24 split obviously has less cells than the serial split. However, neither were even 50% confluent, and the media still looks rather healthy. Will probably check on Monday for media color and see if a media change is necessary.
May 21st, 2012
Both cell populations looked low, but the serial split plate looked better than the 1:24. Changed media in the 1:24. Trypsinized the serial split to break up the large clumps of cells to spread more evenly in the plate, but did not split at a ratio (13 mL of cell solution went back into the dish). Will check on Wednesday.
May 23rd, 2012
Serial split plate was destroyed, none of the cells adhered/recovered from tryp"

Learn more...
Overview
On Oct.30th, we were honored to have the opportunity to hold a short interview with Dr. FU Xiongfei, who specialises in quantitative synthetic biology, and Dr.HUANG Shuqiang, who specializes in analytical chemistry and microfluidics, at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology. The consulting interview was separated into 3 sections: 2 individual interviews and a general discussion. The main topics of the talk included prospect of synthetic biology, technology commercialization and suggestions for fledglings in the scientific biological field.
Extract of the interview (translated)
Q: Could you please share some suggestions for high school iGEMers with us?
Dr.F: To begin with, for high school students, having decided to participate in iGEM competition is a great, commendable action. iGEM provides an excellent chance for you to show dispositions to and cultivate makings of being professionals  in scientific research field. Moreover, different from other academic competitions, iGEM requires adequate knowledge in a variety of disciplines and this is especially beneficial to high school students since your points of interests are not yet limited by specific majors. By being exposed to miscellaneous subjects, you may find your favorite field and therefore you will be able to develop a more concrete goal in college.
Q: Since you are the advisor of the collegiate team SUSTech_Shenzhen, I wonder what are the main differences between collegiate teams and high school teams in iGEM?
Dr.H: Speaking for myself, high school and university are actually two distinct periods. For high school students, the significance of participating in iGEM lies in the exploration and expansion of interests. If you find yourselves quite intrigued by the field of biology, you could start to dig deeper into this discipline so that later on in your academic journey,"

The peristaltic pump displaces fluid, such that bacterial culture is kept flowing through the cuvette . This allows the sensor to take continuous measurements.
Design - Improvement!
This peristaltic pump is an improvement on the design by the 2015 Aachen iGEM team. We chose to build on their design since their pump was also designed for continuous pumping in a bioreactor. Three modifications were made.
IMPROVEMENT 1 - CIRCULAR ROTOR BASE
The first modification replaces their pentagonal spring rotor base with a circular rotor base (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Pentagonal spring rotor figure (left) against our rotor design (right)
This was so that we could countersink flat-head bolts into the rotor structure, compared to having raised bolts such as pan-head bolts (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Aachen 2015’s rotor with a pan-head bolt installed (left) and our rotor with a flat-head bolt installed (right). The choice of bolt for the Aachen rotor was arbitrary and is for illustration purposes. Their wiki simply instructs one to use an M3 bolt there. Our flat-head bolt is flush with the bottom face of the rotor. The height of our rotor’s base was thickened slightly to accommodate the countersinking feature.
When we recreated Aachen 2015’s pump, we discovered that no matter how carefully we mounted the rotor onto the shaft of the stepper motor, one screw head would always drag along the pump plates, implying that the rotor was tilted at an angle.This caused the pump to have insufficient torque to move fluid through the silicone tubes.
The screw attaching the rotor to the stepper motor shaft is a flat end screw, and the rotor should not be tilted at an angle. Troubleshooting further would yield diminishing marginal returns, as other possible sources of error such as inaccuracies in 3D-printing would not be within our power to resolve. Moreover, the angle was very slight and"

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project. The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others. For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

GerminationSTOP
The goal of this module was to yield  Sporobeads which are safe (unable to germinate) and consistently functional (maintain their spore shape and structure throughout time). To achieve this, we sought to remove the germination capability of our spores, while keeping their necessary structural functions intact.
Gene Knockouts
We picked important germination genes and knocked them out. Subsequently we combined the single mutants into quadruple mutants and successfully prevented germination.
Suicideswitch
In case of germination gene knockout failure, we invented the suicide switch. If spores still germinate, the production of a toxin leads to immediate cell death.

<ref name=""Bezeichner"">Blablablub</ref> Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations.
Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline [3] . Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to endogenous signals (referred to as ""synthetic promoters"" in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in [4] ). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract [17] ) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.

LASA High School
We have also reached out to help another high school team, team Austin_UTexas_LASA , a high school team from the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas. Their team is working on a L-DOPA production, sensing, and control system using a two-plasmid regulation system. One plasmid, a “production” plasmid, produces L-DOPA in vivo. Another plasmid, a “detection” plasmid, detects L-DOPA and uses a Venus gene as a reporter system.  In addition, they are also planning to integrate a control system in which the Venus reporter will regulate the production plasmid. They hope to use this system as a new exciting way to elucidate the mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease.
We had a videoconference session to give advice on their project design, offered advice and critique on their wiki, and our presenter and leadership team has given feedback on their presentation.
We are amazed at the amount of effort this new team has put in! We wish them the best of luck at the Jamboree and hope to develop more collaborations with them in future years!
Gifu University
One of our outreach members, Lahari, went to Japan to work in an internship. While she was there, she connected with Team Gifu , an up and coming excellent team from Gifu University. Developing on a previous iGEM project, Team Gifu is creating a LAM (Lactic acid-mediated) communication system utilizing the GAR+ prion. GAR, or glucose associated repression controls the usage of glucose of yeast. Using this technology, they have tried to make a biosensor to sense a phenomenon called “hiochi” in Japanese sake.
Ryo from Team Gifu communicated with Lahari about our respective projects. They offered some advice on some wetlab issues we encountered, and some alternatives to our violacein expression mechanism. We hope that we can help each other by sharing suggestions on our presentations!

Using differential gene-expression. For the iGEM competition, we would like to identify highly up and downregulated genes, so that their respective promoters can be used as gravity BioBricks. This will allow other contestants to use our promoters which will ensure their intended system also works under Martian gravity. Furthermore, we want to asses whether E. coli displays the same changes on Mars as observed in space. Perhaps the Martian gravity is sufficient to suppress potential pathogenicity and perhaps we will uncover that it will be just as dangerous as in space! Either way, this information is extremely valuable to Martian colonizers, since they will be able to anticipate to the expected changes.

The protection of wild yew trees goes well in Yunnan province. And the support to scientific research                     and forestry study from government are strengthened these years. As Dr. Zhang said, government                     should focus on protection, and leaves the yew market to itself.

Public research
In order to learn about the public attitude and knowledge to yew protection, we carried on a public                     research in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming Botanical Garden, Kunming.Here is our                     result.

At the same time, the understand of yew trees varies a lot in different people.
Fig.4 How do people from different places know about the application of yew trees
People living in Kunming and surrounding counties have a better knowledge than tourists from other                     provinces. In Yunnan province, many folk prescriptions mentioned yew barks as a traditional Chinese                     medicine, which may be one of the reasons why people know a lot about medical therapy.
Fig.5 Knowledge of application of yews change with age.
Among these people, the teenagers have a more comprehensive knowledge about the application of yew                     trees, while the old know more about the medical value of yew.
Fig.6 Are there markets selling yew handicrafts
Through the random investigation we learned that almost half of residents know some markets selling                     yew products while tourists know little about this. And after we ask further we noticed that these                     markets usually distribute in the aggregation place of wild yew trees such as Lijiang.
Besides, over 90% people thought that there are not many yew trees in the wild and they needed                     enhanced protection. But when it comes to the present situation of yew protection, the understanding                     of different people varies a lot.
Fig.7 How does people thinks about protection of yew.

During our interaction with stakeholders, Prof. Hagan Bayley from Oxford University (one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies) suggested multiplexing with  additional barcoding to reduce time and costs.  Multiplexing is the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples from different athletes using one sequencing device. To assign the output sequences to the corresponding athlete, the output sequence should be labeled with an athlete specific mark. We designed a system to embed a personal DNA barcode for each subject. Implementing barcode length of 17 nucleotides would provide enough variation to cover every single person on Earth. We developed a tool that generates a 17 nucleotide unique sequence that indicates specific features from athletes. For more details on this module, please visit our improvement page .
4.4 Nanopore Targeted Sequencing
Aim:
Sequence different DNA samples (plasmid and linear) prepared with ONT fragmentation kit on a MinION device.
Assess whether DNA that has not been processed with transposase is identified and sequenced with MinION sequencing.
Replace fragmentation step from Rapid Sequencing Kit with targeted integration of sequencing adapter by fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5.
Approach: Sample with pool of different DNA molecules We generated different DNA molecules to mimic gene doping. These molecules included intronless EPO (insert in BBa_K2643004 ), EPO with unnatural introns ( BBa_K2643005 & BBa_K2643006 ), and EPO in a plasmid ( BBa_K2643004 ). We used a pool of these molecules at different molar ratios to perform library preparation with rapid sequencing kit from ONT and sequenced them using a flow cell FLO-MIN 106. After sequencing, we base called, filtered and aligned the data generated to a reference sequence for analysis in distinguishing different sources of different groups of reads.
DNA without adapters During library preparation, once the DNA molecules were fragmented by transposition reaction, we added a new known sequence (pACYCduet-1). This molecule entered the ligation reaction with the second adapter (with the motor protein), but should not be ligated due to the absence of the first adapter. After the sequencing run, we aligned the sequence reads to pACYCduet-1 as a reference to determine how unadapted sequences are read with Nanopore.
Replace fragmentation step from Rapid Sequencing Kit with targeted fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 using sequencing adapters.  We took the functionality of the fusion protein a step forward to attempt targeted sequencing. This was done by replacing the rapid"

During this meetup we introduced and held an open discussion about our respective projects, asking key questions, giving feedback, and helping each other understand our projects from a ""judge's"" perspective in preparation for the regional Jamboree. We exchanged information about resources and helped form, we hope, a stronger sense of community and cooperation between teams.
We have developed a prototype database to help promote sharing and openness among iGEM teams. Our BioBrick Characterization Data Depot (The Depot) is a resource through which teams can share their raw characterization data. While originally proposed as a way for our team to share the multivariate characterization data for our RiboTALs, The Depot was expanded to promote sharing in iGEM for any BioBrick type. As a test run, we asked teams from around the world to help us populate our database with characterization data of the Anderson Promoter Collection. We hope to expand this so future teams can upload their project data in a standardized and easily accessible format. Please see our page about the Depot for more information!

Marburg,2016,Team:Marburg#Modeling#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the Parallel (OR), Serial and Parallel (AND) designs. Parallel (OR) – implementing a topology that allows destroyed branches to be backed up – shows by far the smallest escape                 probability. Where a single mutation is capable of destroying the Parallel (AND) and Serial design, a destroyed pathway can be compensated by the                 functional regulation pathway for the Parallel (OR) design.
Figure 7. For \(\eta=1.63275\cdot 10^{-3}\), the escape probabilities of                 the three kill switch designs are shown against the incubation                 time. The Parallel (OR) design has the smallest escape                 probabilities. The explanation can be found in the text.
Concluding, we suggest to implement a redundant toxin regulation for kill switches. This significantly increases the evolutionary stability and decreases                 the escape probability of genetically modified organisms into the environment. Biotechnological applications ranging from small to industrial scale can be                 made safer with having this in mind.
However, introducing additional topology such as multiple redundant toxin regulations increases a kill switches complexity. There are more points of contact                 for mutations to destroy the topology. Translating this in the model we use, more complex kill switches have more ODE parameters that can be mutated. Therefore,                 the escape probability is expected to somehow scale with a kill switch's complexity.
This remaining question of a trade-off between kill switch complexity and desired network topology to find a robust kill switch is studied in the last chapter.
(d) Comparison between BNU China 2014 and Parallel (OR) kill switch
We compare the escape probabilities of the BNU China 2014 design and the hypothetical Parallel (OR) kill switch. The latter introduces on the one hand                 redundant toxin regulation but on the other hand an increased complexity. That manifests in almost double the number of ODE parameters in comparison                 to the BNU China 2014 design.
Figure 8 shows that the stability-optimized Parallel (OR) kill switch is more robust against evolution and mutations than the BNU China 2014 topology.                 The gain in evolutionary stability through the additional regulation units overcompensates the introduced complexity. Finally, this leads to a more robust                 kill switch when using a redundant toxin regulation.
Figure 8. Comparison between BNU China 2014 and Parallel (OR)                 kill switch. The latter one shows better robustness in terms of                 escape probabilities.
This result has various applications in real life. Redundant toxin regulation not only ensures projects in Synthetic Biology to be safer but also enables                 longer incubation times until a certain threshold in escape probability is reached. Organisms can"

Q: Do you think that negative publicity, for example for Monsanto, can influence the people?
A: Sure. Farmers for example are seen like saints. But words like „chemistry“ or „genetic engineering” imply something negative. That’s because people can remember scandals better than positive news. And you never get rid of infamy.
Q: Why do you think that GMOs are more accepted in USA than here in Europe?
A: There certainly is a difference in culture. That’s why we have now a different understanding of things, than Americans or other cultures. Europeans may also be more sensitive and therefore are more susceptible to what they read and hear.
German original Version
Q: Ist die Verlängerung des Moratoriums ein Indiz für die geringe politische und gesellschaftliche Wertschätzung oder die Angst vor der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der GVP in der Schweiz?
A: Ich denke schon. Es gibt eine grundsätzliche Zurückhaltung in der Schweiz und generell in Europa gegenüber gentechnisch veränderten Pflanzen. Begründet sicher auch durch Erfahrungen durch Lebensmittelskandale. Zwei Beispiele wären da EHEC oder auch BSE. Die Konsumenten sind generell sehr sensibel insbesondere gegenüber Nahrungsmitteln.
Bei der Gentechnik warten wir auf drei Punkte:

Koexistenz von Gentechnik freier Landwirtschaft und Gentechnik
Nebenwirkungen?
Die Augen sind natürlich jetzt auf der Forschung um diese Punkte aufzuzeigen. Ich würde aber die Forschung keinesfalls zurückbinden.
Q: Diese Beispiele mit EHEC und BSE sind jedoch keine Fälle, die mit Gentech zu tun haben. Denken Sie daher nicht, dass diese Angst aus der mangelnden Aufklärung der Bevölkerung hervorgeht?
A: Je mehr wir Richtung Globalisierung und hochtechnisierte Welt gehen, desto mehr sehnen sich die Menschen nach unberührter Natur, Kultur und Werten und die Leute versuchen sich zumindest die Nahrungsmittel als unberührtes Rückzugsgebiet zu erhalten. Die Leute sagen grundsätzlich „"

#2 - Speed Improvement
The goal of our group was to enhance the motility of E. coli in order to allow them to reach their targets more efficiently in later applications. This also results in a a faster selection of our Homing Coli and quick generation of results. The BioBricks we designed are therefore primarily directed at flagellum efficiency or number. We selected five different genes that were tested along our project in different strains. E. coli strain BL21 was used as our main object of research because this is a typical lab-strain and therefore usually not very motile. Our goal was to find a way to accelerate BL21 E. coli by transforming them with our constructs. Here is an overview of the genes we tested and the corresponding results.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Design2#_-_-_TEXT.html," it with more electrons and speed up the reaction by up to 12%. The paper proposed a bioreactor in which DPRB (disparate perchlorate reducing bacteria) grew on a cathode, supplying ions that seemed to be a limiting factor in the reaction. Hydrogens would pass from the anode to the cathode through  a cation selective membrane, aiding the reaction in the diagram (left). This would speed up the first half of the process, converting perchlorate to chlorite, as this is the slower half. We would simply replace the DPRB with modified E. coli.
Design 4
A meeting with Dr Mike Allen from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory introduced us to the concept of Swirl Flow Bioreactors (SFB), which would allow us to mix the perchlorate with the E. coli as well as separating the oxygen, all in one chamber. We took the design of a typical swirl flow and adapted it to fit our needs of having immobilized E. coli and a cathode.
Design 5
In a second meeting with Dr Mike Allen, he also told us valuable information about how our bioreactor would be received within global markets. He informed us of his experience with selling and developing his own bioreactor, and from that, he advised that we focus more on the Mars travel side of the the bioreactor as there wasn’t much room in the market for a bioreactor on Earth.
During this meeting, we decided to remove the cathode from our design as it would provide the opportunity for unexpected chemistry, as well as sparks which would react badly with the oxygen we are producing.  This allowed our bioreactor design to simplify significantly and we started making quick progress.
Design 6
Our first SFB without cathodes involved four chambers, one to mix the regolith with water to extract the perchlorate, and three to consecutively reduce the perchlorate into oxygen until none is left. The vortex created in the SFB would sort the contents according to density, forcing the oxygen into the centre of the tube. A manifold at the end of the tunnel containing a small central tube would carry the oxygen out of the bioreactor while everything else would be carried into the next chamber via a larger tube surrounding the oxygen outlet.
Design 7
With a solid base, we began to tweak the design based on the needs of stakeholders *add specific stakeholders*.

I. Discuss about our project:
1. SNS:
To complete this project is hardly possible. While it is likely to realize part of it, such as a system which is able to create and sense signals. But we need to confer our project some new meanings.
1) About making a signal disappear, according to Mr. Hong, we can add a rapid degradation label onto the signal.
2) We are afraid that the colony is too small to create an appropriate concentration gradient. According to Mr. Hong, it won’t be a big problem.
2. Solve the graph colouring problem using E.coli
1) In fact, we will only use E.coli to emit light in different colors, and all the algorithm for solving graph coloring problem is processed artificially.
2) We need to consult professors in Chemistry Department about constructing structures using ssDNA.
3) The scale of DNA strand is far too small than that of E.coli.
4) The fusion protein of Zn finger and the Ag43 would be very useful. We can think about how to make use of it.
3. Fatigue of specific stimulus
1) comK is a protein produced by bacillus subtilis and “competence” is a state of it. The possibility of turning into competence state is proportional to the amount of comK. We can substitute the protein involved in competence state for the protein we need.
2) The system can be used as a special lock.
3) How to make circuit one recover its function as quick as possible?
a) by means of protease?
b) by means of aptamer?
II. Set up groups to continue brainstorm
III. Make plans for the whole term.

LCmut
LCmut is a 51kDa large protein with an extinction coefficient (E) of 48440.  The expression and purification can be seen in the assays shown.
Fig. 17 LCmut expression
Fig. 18 LCmut purification
The purification and expression of LCmut was similar to that of LCwt. These also denatured during dialysis due to instability. However, more of the inactivated enzyme could be purified at a final concentration of 1.33 mg/mL.
Summary
After dialysis and shock freezing, all proteins used were analyzed again by SDS PAGE and their purity tested. The results are shown in the figure below:
Fig. 19 ToxAssay components
In conclusion, it can be shown that all proteins could be successfully purified and were subsequently used for the ToxAssay, which showed that the native structure of the proteins was still retained.

For this experiment the Split Nano Luciferase System of Promega was used. These two protein fragments are separated. The Interaction between the two fragments bings them in close proximity to allow them to form a functional reporter protein whose activity can be measured by luminescence.

It is to mention that the Light Chain (LC) and the Heavy Chain (HC) are coupled with a disulfide bond. It’s cleaved during the SDS preparation prozess. That’s why two bonds where expected in the gel.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the fragments can integrate into the genome. This Insertion will be proved by colony PCR. The second component for the Flp/frt system is introducing a functional FLP recombinase into the cells. We will involve the pBR-FLP plasmid that was used to establish the Flp/frt system in other Vibrio species like V. cholerae (Blokesch 2012) into the Marburg toolbox  using primers with compatible overhangs. Assembling different parts of this toolbox to a plasmid with a full transcriptional unit, we will create a plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase. Because we already use all inducible promoters of the Marburg toolbox for inducing tfox or the T7 system , we decided to use a constitutive promoter for the flp recombinase. The plasmid will be assembled using K2560007 as a constitutive promoter, K2560010 as an RBS, K2560011 and K2560012 as connectors, K2560271 as the coding sequence of FLP, K2560046 as an ori, K2560057 as backbone with a kanamycin resistance and K2560035 as a terminator.
Figure 3:he process of Flp mediated excision. Flp is recognizing the frt sites that are in the same direction and is cutting the antibiotics cassette out, leaving a FRT scar behind.
Introducing this plasmid into V. natriegens and expressing flp, the recombinase will recognize the integrated frt sites that are in the same orientation. By Flp mediated recombination, the resistance cassette will be cut out of the genome, creating the deletion of the desired gene.
Afterwards the strain will be cultivated without chloramphenicol and screened for chloramphenicol sensitive clones. The excision needs to be proved by colony PCR. The next effort is to get rid of the Flp plasmid and its kanamycin resistance because we want our strains to be compatible with all your constructs. Due to its high growth rate, V. natriegens loses plasmids, with some exceptions like pMMB-tfox (Hayes et al., 2017) , very fast if there is no selection pressure by antibiotics in the medium. The Flp encoding plasmid will be selected out, cultivating the created strain without kanamycin and screening for kanamycin sensitive colonies on plate. A colony PCR, negative for Flp will prove the loss of the plasmid and the strain is ready for the usage"

We performed a preliminary experiment to check the normality of the Taqman system.
The preliminary experiment was performed on a sample of saliva from Professor Daniel Berkowitz.
In order to ensure that the system is reset and works properly on every one of the SNP ordered.
Below is a sample of 15 primary results received for the different SNPs. We checked for the haplotype of all genotypes tested, using the Fluidigm gene chip array.
SNPs are screened using the Fluidigm BioMark apparatus (Fluidigm Corp.) with 15 Assay-specific TaqMan.
Assays along with PCR master mix run by loading 5µl into each well of the primed 96.96 Fluidigm Chip.

The following thermal cycling protocol are usually used: 50˚C (2 minutes), 70˚C (30 minutes), 25˚C (10 min), 50˚C (2 minutes), and 95˚C (4 minutes). This is followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C (10 seconds) and 61˚C (30 seconds).
Data is analysed and cycle threshold (CT) values are determined using BioMark PCR analysis software (Fluidigm Corp.), and automated genotyping calling is carried out using an algorithm based on the change in CT (DCT) values between wild-type and mutant calling.
Taste SNPs will be marked by FAM dye, Non-taste SNPs will be marked by VIC dye Below is a sample of 15 preliminary results received for the different SNPs.

In what we succeded
We did succed in constructing the lanthanide sensor in BioBrick standard and cloning its parts into pSB1C3 and sending seven of them to the Registry. As for 17.10.2014, we are trying to measure pmrC not activated by PmrA and also we are trying to measure GFP expression both in presence and in absence of lanthanide ions in the environment. We also measured the relative strenght of pmrC promoter in the absence of lanthanides.
What would we do (given more time)
Given more time, we would certainly try to test more lanthanide binding tags and to construct a system to effectively bind those ions, not only detect them. We would also try to quantify better our existing system.

We added an additional kill switch , to reinforce our biocontainment strategy. As a chassis for BeeT we wanted to use a bacterial strain developed by Mandell and colleagues (2014) 5 . This “biocontainment strain” is auxotrophic for a synthetic amino acid, para-L-biphenylalanine (BipA). We aimed to complement this strain by adding a measure to prevent horizontal gene transfer.  Our objective was to cleave heterologous DNA with a modified Cas9 as soon a BeeT runs out of BipA. When BipA is present, the synthetic amino acid should be built into the active site of Cas9, making it catalytically dead. However, in the absence of BipA, the native amino acid is incorporated, partially restoring cleaving activity. This active Cas9 will cut heterologous DNA. We managed to incorporate BipA in Cas9, which is shown in Figure 11.

Testing BeeT in a Beehive Beehave
Ideally we want to test BeeT in a beehive. This is, however, not a feasible  option for this iGEM project. Allowing genetically modified organisms to be present in the environment is far from responsible, moreover forbidden. Because of this we had to find an alternative way to test BeeT. First we proved in an experiment and with a model that BeeT can survive in the sugar water, the medium used to apply BeeT to the bees. Secondly, we modeled the influence of BeeT in an open source model called beehave. We adapted the model in a way that it could predict what the effect of BeeT on virus epidemiology, mite population dynamics, and bee population dynamics is.
Using Flux Balance Analysis we describe the relationship between the metabolism of E. coli and the osmotic pressure of sugar"

Many brainstorming sessions took place in order to discuss objectives and to decide how we should make our first attempt at the iGEM competition. With great input from ULB Professor L. Van Melderen (Université Libre de Bruxelles), the academical supervisor of the ULB iGEM Team, a calendar was set: the team would take part in the iGEM 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Once solid, the project received Vincent Blondel, the rector of UCL, approbation and the team could finally focus on the project elaboration and start gathering funds. By that time spring was well and its way. They had no time to loose…

Building with Biology
July 29, 2016
While hosting the iGEM Regional Meetup at Missouri S&T, iGEMers from University of Nebraska - Lincoln and Washington University in St. Louis joined our team in putting on a Building with Biology event for the Rolla community. We invited families to participate in a variety of biology related events from designing a superhero and extending those ideas to designing a super bacteria to matching certain qualities to different types of microbes. Children were encouraged to consider in depth ways that synthetic biology could affect their lives and ask questions of iGEM members to expand their knowledge.
National Engineers Week
February 26 and 27, 2016
iGEM members traveled to St. Louis Science Center and joined organizations from Missouri S&T and other area universities to showcase STEM fields to younger children.  Our team brought cultures of photosensitive bacteria with different designs created in them and bioluminescent bacteria glowing both red and green. Team members explained the manners in which bacteria can be both beneficial and detrimental to our health. One of the members even had the chance to involve a family by communicating with them in Spanish.
Visiting Professor from Missouri State University
January 29, 2016
Dr. Tomasi visited iGEM to present to our team and other department members about animal energetics and hibernation of bats. He was able to highlight the potential dangers of bats continually awakening from hibernation which is often caused by infection with White Nose Syndrome. He even brought a bat recently captured in a building at MSU for us to meet!
Newburg Children’s Museum
August 25, 2016
iGEM was asked to attend the grand reopening of the Newburg Children’s Museum, a museum located about 20 minutes from Rolla, Missouri. This museum gives children a safe and flourishing place for them to come after school and learn. We brought a interactive game where kids could learn the parts of a gene in bacteria and create an operational gene with floor puzzle pieces.
Bat Day
April 29, 2016
Students of the iGEM team organized and orchestrated an on campus Bat Day to inform our fellow students about iGEM and about White Nose Syndrome. This day was complete with trivia, bat fact handouts, prizes, carnival games, and cookie decorating.

pBAD synthetic promoter library
A synthetic promoter library (SPL) is a library of cells which contain a promoter that has been randomly mutated to give different expression levels. This promoter upstream of a fluorescent protein like GFP/RFP. The term was first coined in 1998 and used in Lactococcus lactis [1]. The method was adapted by 2010 DTU iGEM team to make a SPL for E. coli that enabled the modulation of constitutive gene expression with great precision. They even made a new standard for this method with the use of biobricks ( RFC 63 ).
We used the method to build a non-leaky arabinose inducible promoter as a tool for expressing lethal proteins in E. coli. The reason we did this is that many of the proteins we are working with are membrane bound or integral membrane proteins and will be lethal if expressed in high quantities.
For testing our pathways we needed to grow the transformed cells to a certain concentration, and attempting this with the genes constitutively expressed was often not yielding viable colonies.  We needed a inducible system, but the standard arabinose inducible system was way too leaky and we with this promoter we can into the same problem as before. Therefore we needed to either build or buy (if possible) an inducible system with great tightness that is able to be induced easily. We choose to build such a system.

BioBrick tutorial, Danish Technical University
The 10th-12th of March 2017, the iGEM-team from DTU arranged the BioBrick Tutorial for the Scandinavian teams , with the intention of lecturing the different teams on the BioBrick-standard, assembly of biological systems, coaching in techniques for presentation and project pitching, as well as socializing and networking. We had a delegation of three team members join for this conference; from this we were able to teach the basics of biobrick-assembly to team members with no background in bioscience, practice presentation techniques, and go to know friends and future collaborators from the different Scandinavian teams.
Online ethics Discussion, Uppsala
iGEM Uppsala organized a set of online discussions on the topic of synthetic biology and bioengineering between several different teams. On the 11th of August 2017, two members of our team participated in one such discussion on the topics of uncontrolled release of our biological system as well as potential misuse of our project. Along with the other teams, we attempted to answer those questions to the best of our ability, and it was refreshing and interesting to hear the thoughts of other teams with different projects on the subjects
Collaboration with NTNU
There are two iGEM-teams in Norway; UiO and NTNU. Because of this, it is quite natural for us to be collaborating and communicating together, and on the 1st-3rd of September, we traveled to Trondheim to meet the other team. This meet-up had three main purposes: networking, setting up a future laboratory collaboration between the teams, and holding mock presentations for both teams and be able to get feedback. As one of the main supervisors of the NTNU iGEM team is a former iGEM judge, both teams were able to get solid feedback on the contents, structure and technique of their oral presentations. There was also socialization and an agreement to collaborate on the labwork further. Overall a great weekend!
As a laboratory collaboration, we tested two of the plasmids in the system NTNU used; pLA230 and MP6 ( BBa_K2265000 ), as part of our laboratory collaboration."

This year Macquarie Australia submits 14 parts as a collection. Together these collection of parts [BBa_K1998000 - BBa_K1998014] allows us to express the genes of the photosynthetic pathway within E.coli to produce hydrogen from sunlight. The collection is split into three parts.
The first collection of parts [BBa_K1998000 , BBa_K1998001 & BBa_K1998013] are those within the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and lead to the production of chlorophyll a.
The second collection of parts [BBa_K1998002 - BBa_K1998008 & BBa_K1998014] are 17 genes that allow for  the assembly of Photosystem II in E.coli. Photosystem II generates oxygen and electrons via the oxidation of water molecules.
The last collection of parts [BBa_K1998009 - BBa_K1998012] allow for the generation of hydrogen gas using hydrogenase. This will enable the production of hydrogen gas in a clean and sustainable way which could be used as a future energy source.

In order to measure and compare fluorescence in all test devices, these were transformed into DH5α E. coli. They were then checked via digestion and ran on a gel to verify size and to ensure that all plasmids were in monomer form. Once all the parts had been verified, 2 single colonies were picked from each test device and the fluorescence and OD600 for each was measured in the plate reader.
Growth
The OD600 shows how well the E. coli are growing with each of the different test devices. As can be seen from Figure 2, all test devices are growing at the same rate except for test devices 1 and 4- these two test devices share the J23101 promoter.
Figure 2 Shows the average OD600 (average of the 4 technical replicates of the two biological replicates) of the 6 test devices and the two controls across time points of 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours. AU= arbitrary units
Fluorescence
Fluorescence shows the gene expression levels of GFP, from figure 3 it is shown that in all cases the fluorescence is increasing over time. However as this doesn’t take into account the differing growth rates of the test devices this doesn’t allow us to make any meaningful conclusions about the relative intensities of the test devices and so the efficiency of the promoters and ribosome binding sites.
Figure 3 Shows the relative fluorescence intensities (average of the 4 technical replicates of the two biological replicates) of the 6 test devices and the two controls across time points of 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours. AU= arbitrary units
To allow conclusions to be made the fluorescence values were normalised to OD600, a graph of this can be seen in figure 4. The time point of 4 hours was chosen as this minimised any large standard deviations (due to dividing by very small numbers in the first few time points) and negative values caused by the background. The controls have worked- no fluorescence is seen in the negative control and fluorescence is seen in the positive controls- and it appears that test device 1 is the strongest out of all the test devices.
Figure 4 Shows the OD600 corrected fluorescence values for the two controls and the 6 test devices (average fluorescence/ average OD600) for the monomers in DH5. Error bars are standard deviation. AU= arbitrary units
Firstly, looking at the differences in RBS strength - if we compare test device 1 and 4 which both"

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
Note
This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Cameron Roots LinkedIn
Kevin Li
Cameron grew up in the North Kitsap area of Washington State, eventually making his way to the University of Washington. A rising senior, he served the main wet-lab portion of UW's iGEM team as the ultimate lab monkey—taking on tasks anybody else lacked the time or confidence to complete—before continuing on as BioBricking co-lead. Cameron joined iGEM seeking the in-lab versatility to complement his knowledge-versatile majors: Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. While his educational inspiration stems from the self-coding language that is DNA, Cameron steps away from science for his leisure, enjoying Dungeon and Dragons, PC gaming, hiking, playing guitar, public speaking, and more.
Been with the UW iGEM team for around 4 years, which makes me an old man practically. Currently serving as an advisor and webmaster. I handle the wiki and parts of dry lab as well as administrative duties, which include recruiting and team member management. I presented in 2013 in Toronto at the North America Regional Jamboree. In my spare time, I am a complete nerd, which shouldn't surprise anyone. Cosplay, DnD, or video games. You can decide, which is worse. I do get out of the house for a run or to boulder. Jokes aside, I am currently going into my Masters in Bioinformatics and applying to Medical School. I hope to get into VR/AR with regards to cardiology.

Queens_Canada,2017,Team:Queens Canada#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," administrators for guidance and advice on developing our new course, as well as establishing the design and purpose of the course. QGEM members have been hard at work brainstorming ideas for the course syllabus throughout the summer, and we also received generous guidance from Dr. Trevor Charles from the University of Waterloo's Department of Biology. Dr. Charles was able to share with us his experience in teaching a third year synthetic biology course, BIOL 349, being offered at Waterloo.
Our synthetic biology course will be offered through online lectures, and feature a group project design assignment that students will work towards throughout the entire semester. The lecture material will focus on the fundamentals of molecular biology and synthetic biological circuits, covering topics ranging from the central dogma of molecular biology to cloning techniques and plasmid design. Throughout the course, students will work in groups of 3 to design a novel synthetic biology project. This will include writing and submitting a project proposal, submitting an electronic project poster detailing project design and methods, and submitting a final project report that takes into account potential obstacles and a detailed methodology. Throughout the course, students will also be involved in weekly discussion forums focused on recent synbio publications, government policy impacting synbio advancement, or the importance of ethics in synbio research for society. By the end of the course, students will be capable of advanced problem-solving and critical thinking as well as collaborating through a teamwork environment.
The details of our course outline can be found here . We aim to have the course running and available to students by the beginning of the 2018-2019 academic year.

Because of its high hydrophobicity and low volatility, decane was chosen to extract and solubilize farnesol from the culture broth. The decane was overlaidy in the two-phase culture media, but it did not affect the cell growth, and farnesol could be well solubilized in the decane phase with negligible volatile loss. We adopt used 1 mL of decane to overlayid to the 5 mL of culture broth. Two-phase The culture of E. coli JM109 (BBa_K165025) was carried out in 2YT medium containing 1% glycerol at 29°C for 48 h. The decane phase of the two-phase culture was collected to analyze the farnesol content by GC-MS.
