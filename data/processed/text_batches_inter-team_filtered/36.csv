Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," glgC in both samples shows that more glycogen was present. Therefore, the functionality of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is proved.
K1585320
This composite part combines glgA and glgB for glycogen synthesis. GlgA uses ADP-glucose for chain elongation (α-1,4 linked) whereas GlgB uses existing chains to form α-1,6-linked branches.
K1585321
This composite part combines all 3 enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis. The ADP-glucose pyrophophorylase (GlgC) forms ADP-glucose from ATP and glucose-1-phosphate, the glycogen synthase (GlgA) elongates α-1,4-linked chains and the branching enzyme (GlgB) catalyzes the formation of α-1,6-linked branches. This construct is an extension and improvement of BBa_K118016 .
Usage and Biology
In order to upregulate the whole glycogen synthesis pathway, the polycistronic plasmid was built. The glgC coding sequence is based on the part BBa_K118016 from Team Edinburgh 2008, but he RBS B0034 was added to the existing Biobrick. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. The expression of all three enzymes GlgC, GlgA and GlgB was tested in Bl21 Gold (DE3) strains containing BBa_K1585321 in a pSB1A30 expression vector.
SDS-PAGE of glgCAB in pSB1A30
glgCAB in pSB1A30 was expressed in Bl21 Gold (DE3) strains and IPTG induced. The small arrows indicates the expected bands for all three enzymes. The Bl21 Gold (DE3) wild type was used as negative control.
The combined functionality was characterized by iodine staining (see picture below). It was performed with Lugol's iodine which dyes glycogen in a brownish color. If more glycogen is present, the color of stainend cultures is darker. The darker staining of Bl21 Gold (DE3) transformants of BBa_K1585321 picture indicates considerably more glycogen accumulations compared to the wild type.
Iodine stained samples of Bl21 Gold (DE3) with glgCAB compared to the wild type
The samples were taken from overnight cultures in LB + 20 mM glucose and were adjusted to the same OD before staining with 200 µl Lugol's iodine solution.

Summer Camp week! Read about the blast that we had with our students here. Unfortunately, lab progressed fairly slowly due to our staff dedicating a majority of their time to the summer camp, but no regrets, as our students had a wonderful time.
July 24th – July 30th
This was the highly anticipated week of the Bioengineering Summer Camp! Overnight campers began to arrive on Sunday night and the rest of our campers joined us on Monday morning for a jam packed week. Campers were asked to take the same survey before and after the summer camp to gauge the impact that our camp had on them. Check out our wiki for more information on this week.
August 2016
July 31st – August 6th
The surveys that were filled out by the summer campers were evaluated and organized onto bar graphs. We also received survey responses from the WELS teachers which were then arranged onto pie charts to be analyzed.
August 21st – August 27th
New freshman students were welcomed to campus this week. Jack and Harrison set up a table at the campus “Org Smorg” to recruit for the iGEM team for the following year. We set up a poster to give the new students a better idea of what iGEM really is.
September 2016
August 28th – September 3rd
This was the first week back to school and the first time that the entire team was able to be together at once. Thursday night was our first meeting and we decided that there would be weekly meetings from now until the Giant Jamboree. This week our wiki design was finalized and various parts of the project were sent to Troy to get uploaded onto our wiki. The team also decided that we would be holding another Biotechnology Information Night on campus to better educate the new freshman on the various concepts. The team discussed the easiest and most efficient ways that this could be advertised throughout campus.
September 4th – September 10th
Elise and Ching-Tzu started again working on moving our BioBricks into the shipping plasmid. The analysis of the various surveys we conducted began to take place. We needed to put all the survey answers into bar graphs or pie charts.

Testing the Biobrick - first tests
Having made our first biobrick, the next step was a series of basic experiments comparing its behaviour in an environment with nitrogen versus one without.
Two 5mL overnights were set up, one without any nitrogen and one with 20mM of Potassium Nitrate KNO3. This level was chosen as previous work by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team had shown the promoter strongly active by this point.  After growing the cultures overnight the solution with nitrate was visibly green whilst the one without was not, suggesting our new biobrick worked at least at the most basic ‘on/ off’ level.

This year, our project researches the issues of the field sobriety test. We visited the judges, the policemen, the wine tasters, and the health care workers, who we considered as experts who may give us advice. Surveys were designed for the public concerning the breathalyzer test. We also met iGEM teams (NCTU, NTHU, CGU) and attended 2016 iGEM Asian Conference to exchange project ideas and share experience. In addition, a biotech company, BIONIME corp., provided us with technical supports. This page particularly presents our efforts concerning the Human Practices events.
Scenario: One day, a man drove lively on the road after eating lychees. Suddenly, he lost his control and his car bumped into the tree on the sideway. And he fell into a coma. For a while, a police officer came up and asked him to take a sobriety test. It turned out that he exceeded the legal alcohol limit in a breathalyzer test. He felt upset and decided to take action. How could we help him prove that he was innocent?
After researching news concerning the field sobriety test, we found many debates against the breathalyzer test such as individual metabolic differences, diabetes, refusals, people dead or in coma. We studied the principle behind the test and believed that there’s a way more reliable. Therefore, we went to the judges in the court, the police officers in the police station, the health care workers in the hospital and the wine tasters in a working place to discuss the issues and seek for opinions. We also designed a questionnaire to survey the public about their experience in the sobriety test. On campus, we educated the younger schoolmates with biotech skills and engaged the school’s teachers to experience the breathalyzer test. To connect iGEM community, we met teams hosted by NCTU-Formosa and attended the Asian conference held by NCKU-Tainan that provided us opportunities to exchange ideas and share experience. To work with iGEMers, we collaborated with NCTU-Formosa and helped them to confirm a function of one of their BioBrick parts. To develop IGEM BLOOD"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," dye FM4-64 and subsequent fluorescence measurements in a plate reader. The experiment followed the membrane staining protocol . In order to calculate the concentration of vesicles from the measured intensity, a calibration curve of synthetic liposomes was made. Figure 38 shows the following linear function which was fitted through the measured data: $I = 4.7865 \cdot C + 950.0159$. In this formula, $I$ is the intensity of the fluorescence in arbitrary units and $C$, the concentration of the liposomes in mg/µL.
In Figure 39 the concentration of vesicles is represented. It can be seen that little to no vesicles are produced in the wild type strain compared to the KEIO strain. Furthermore, the concentration of vesicles after growing overnight is much higher than 3 hours after induction, thus showing that more vesicles are produced over time. Also, the concentration of vesicles with and without induction differ only with around 2 mg/μL which is not that significant considering the error bars. The reason for this could be the use of a high copy plasmid in combination with a leaky promoter. Besides this, it is confirmed that the presence of the TolR plasmid does not result in large differences in vesicle production.
Figure 38: Liposome calibration curve. Calibration curve of liposomes. The intensity (a.u.) is put against the concentration of liposomes. The liposomes were stained with the membrane dye FM4-64, which only fluoresce when it is bound to the membrane. A linear fit is made, with the formula $I = 4.7865 \cdot C + 950.0159$.
Figure 39: Concentration of vesicles. The concentration of vesicles present in the purified samples of TolR and pET-Duet in the KEIO strain and pET-Duet in the WT strain. The concentration, in mg/µL, plotted for the different samples at 3 hours and 20 hours after induction.
TorA-GFP plasmid assembly
We ordered our TorA-GFP from IDT and assembled the part on pSB1C3 by digestion assay with EcoRI and PstI and consecutive ligation . We transformed the construct into a TOP10 strain and screened some colonies with colony PCR (with primers IG0006 and IG0013 ).

August 27th
We receive our first sequencing results of mtr complexes. Unfortunately, we found a single base pair substitution at the very start of mtrA (changing the aminoacid lysine to glutamic acid) and a nonsense mutation in mtrC. However, the mtr construct with promoter contained an additional nonsense mutation within mtrA, this is the point where we decided to give up on this one and try and fix the other, more sensible biobrick.
So we ignore the single base pair substitution (as it is not part of the protein motive compared with other mtrA analogs) and order new set of primers for the Site-Directed Mutagenesis of mtrC.
August 30th
We receive the primers for mtr SDM from IDT and do it immediately the same way we did it last time.
Samples for sequencing of the peptides and gold sensing constructs were sent today.
September 4th
We do the β-galactosidase assay on the gold sensing device for which the results can be found elsewhere.
The mtr part was sent for sequecing again to see if the SDM was successful.

Finally, DNA of the parts for submission is prepared and is finally sent to iGEM HQ on September 16th.
February 21st
Today the iGEM team divided to discuss about the two main ideas, chosen from over 100, after meeting with potential supervisors.
The first idea is making a mouthwash which contains harmless, live bacteria which normally reside in the mouth. These bacteria will be genetically engineered to secrete pleasant odours (e.g. menthol, rose, banana  - parts for which have already been submitted to the iGEM registry). The scope is to have the bacteria colonise the mouth; to prevent the smell being secreted at all times, their production could be controlled by controlling gene expression, depending on external signals (such as concentration of oxygen, glucose or stress).
Becca, Evaldas, Andy, Jonas, Andra, Hannah and Caroline looked into the idea in more depth. One of the major concerns is that safety issues would prevent the mouthwash from being regarded as a product which can be used, since it involves introducing live, genetically modified bacteria into humans. Also, the idea is not conceptually very challenging.
The second idea is to create an improved microbial fuel cell, a type of battery that uses live bacteria for current production. The bacteria releases H ions and electrons into the environment, when encapsulated in an anode"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," medical applications, i.e. genetically modified bacteria used in cancer-treatment to environmental and manufacturing projects, i.e. the construction of a watch-like counter consisting of living cells. In contrast to classical genetic engineering where only one gene is transferred from organism A to organism B, synthetic biology goes forward into the construction of whole new systems with a completely new function. Therefore, all iGEM-Teams get access to a gene- Database called registry, where hundreds of different genetic parts with characterized functions are available in a “plug-and-play” –like format. These parts can be simply stuck together to build functional systems. The rising number of iGEM-Teams over the last years as well as the upcoming public interest in iGEM, the iGEM-Teams’ projects and synthetic biology in general shows, that synthetic biology will for sure have a great impact in many different fields of both scientific research and every-day life.

Additionally, we sought to leverage the versatility afforded us by the Standard Biological Parts Web Service to integrate a search box that would allow users to query the BioBricks database and retrieve relevant characteristics. Once completed, users will be able to search the Registry for BioBricks that fit search parameters (such as operator sites on promoters, or proteins produced by Coding DNA) and pull them into the convenient and user-friendly interface in SynBioSS. Though this project was not accomplished in full, an embryonic version of a Coding DNA search is already integrated into the live version of Designer, and hopes are high for future development.
Finally, we also adapted the software to handle polycistronic brick sequences.
Eugene
The 2009 Berkeley Software team is developing a forward engineering DNA assembly language called Eugene . BOL is a human writeable language designed to describe standard biological parts, devices, and systems, thereby facilitating communication of biological designs between members of the bioengineering community. In an effort to support this language as a new technical standard, SynBioSS Designer Designer can accept Eugene as input, as well as output any networks created (or edited) in Designer as Eugene if a user so desires.
SynBioSS Wiki
The inaccessibility of requisite kinetic data complicates the generation of detailed mechanistic models. We address this barrier by creating a web accessible database curated by users in a “Wiki” format. SynBioSS Wiki is a significant extension of the open-source Mediawiki software. The Wiki stores reaction kinetic data in a formatted and searchable scheme with references to the relevant literature. This framework allows for the input of reactions whose rates are described either by elementary first & second order rate equations or any arbitrarily complex rate equation defined using MathML (e.g. Hill type reactions). Reactions may be searched via participating molecules which may be proteins, DNA sequences, small molecules, etc. Once located, reactions of interest (along with their associated kinetic data) may be collected. The completed model may be exported in SBML format for additional editing or simulation.
It is also through the SynBioSS Wiki databases that SynBioSS Designer can access and proliferate kinetic information related to the simulation of BioBricks, thus extending the utility of the database for the benefit of the greater modeling community. To jumpstart the process, we have entered the known biomolecular interactions in the expression and regulation of well-studied operons, such as the lactose, the tetracycline and the arabinose operons.

Chemoreceptor and Chemotaxis
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random - walking pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 1, left panel).  While an attractant or repellent appear somewhere in the environment, the cells’ locomotor responses specific runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement towards preferred environments.  (Fig. 1, right panel).
Fig. 1  Random and biased walks. Left: A random walk in isotropic environments. When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments push the cell forward. When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle. Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion. Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions. Right: A biased walk in a chemoeffector gradient. As cells swim up a concentration gradient of attractant, they spend more time smooth swimming than tumbling; this modulation of swimming behavior is manifested as a chemotactic response.
The pictures are from Parkinson Lab - University of Utah ( The website address [http://chemotaxis.biology.utah.edu/Parkinson_Lab/projects/ecolichemotaxis/ecolichemotaxis.html])
E. coli has five chemoreceptors, four are methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (McpS) which have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 2).  The McpS initiate a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates methylation-independent aeroTCAtic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 2).

For device A, the dynamic equations can be listed as follows:
Concentrations of $psicose$ are different inside and outside the cell, so the diffusion rate of $psicose$ is proportional to the concentration difference between inside and outside of the cells. so the rate at which $psicose$ enters the cell by diffusion is $$-\gamma_F([PsiO]-[PsiI])$$
Where $\gamma_F$ is the diffusion coefficient.
Considering that the volume of the cells is small enough to be negligible relative to the external solution, so the amount of $psicose$ that diffuses into the cells is very small. We can think of the concentration of the external solution as constant, which means  $$\frac{\text{d}[PsiO]}{ \text{d}t}=0$$ When reducer psicose combines with repressor, the process is $$\eta_1 PsiI+pPsiR\rightarrow CCI$$ Where $PsiI$ is the intracellular $psicose$, $pPsiR$ is $psicose$ dependent repressor, $CCI$ is $psicose$-repressor complex and $\eta_1$ is coordination number of $psicose$ for $pPsiR$.
The change in concentration of $PsiI$，$pPsiR$ and $CCI$ contains three influencing factors: the binding reaction of $pPsiR$ and $psicose$, and the degradation reaction of themselves and the reverse reaction.
Here we consider the binding reaction as a second order reaction and the degradation reaction and reverse reaction as first order reactions. According to law of mass action, reaction rate is proportional to the product of the reactant concentration, so we have  $$\frac{\text{d}[PsiI]}{\text{d}t}=-\gamma_F([PsiI]-[PsiO])-m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI]^{\eta_1}[pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{PsiI}[PsiI]$$  And considering $pPsiR$ is constantly expressing, we can get $$\frac{\text{d}[pPsiR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pPsiR}-m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI]^{\eta_1}[pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{pPsiR}[pPsiR]$$ Where $m_{pPsiR,Psi}$ is the coefficient of reaction rate of the binding reaction, $\"

S.p.a. (a company specifically founded for this purpose) the financial resources required to the creation of laboratories, a library and other educational infrastructures.
The new reality has then represented a significant example for a further development of the University of Bologna towards the Romagna territory, which had no university structures at the time. In the last decades, thanks to the commitment of the University of Bologna and to the contribution of local entities, the teaching offer of Cesena  has gradually expanded in accordance with the acquisition and the creation of new infrastructures for the location of classrooms, offices and high-tech laboratories.
In 2001, as a consolidation of this process, the Polo Scientifico-Didattico of Cesena  has been founded within the Multi-Campus Project of the University of Bologna: this is the scenery in which, in 2002, the II Faculty of Engineering was established. The Biomedical Engineering curriculum, which characterizes the new faculty, mirrors the economical reality of Emilia Romagna, which houses one of the most important disctricts of Biomedical devices design and manufacturing.

mKeima, eGFP and mRFP Characterization
We had biobricked mKeima as expression cassette into pSB1C3. On the other hand, we also extracted eGFP [] and mRFP [] expression biobricks from iGEM 2013 distribution kit and helped to characterize their specs. Transformed bacterias were grown up and lysed. Then we characterized their excitation and emission spectrum on 96 well plates. Note the huge stoke shift of mKeima compared to eGFP and mRFP.

Improving Glucose Sensor
pCSTA promoter is repressed by presence of glucose. It is used as an indicator of glucose level in media, a very useful component in bioimaging. However, one potential hurdle is the ability of fluorescence to shine out of thick, dense culture media. Considering application in vivo or mammalian cell bioreactor, higher readout wavelength is more favored due to low attenuation of red light through living tissues. Higher wavelength light can pass through living tissue easily because most living tissues consist of blood and they are red which means they absorb lights of wave length below red light.
In this experiment, we wish to show that mKeima can be brighter, stable and more quantitatively informative than common fluorescent proteins such as eGFP and mRFP. pCSTA.mKeima, pCSTA.eGFP and pCSTA.mRFP are first amplified in tubes overnight. Then their OD600 is measured and their density is normalized with dilution. The normalized cultures are grown in 96 wells plate over a glucose gradient in LB media with antibiotics overnight in platereader at 37C. Kinetic data is obtained over 12 hours at 20 minute intervals.

in vivo
One of the already existing sensors we used for our system is the mercury sensor consisting of MerR the activator and the mercury specific promoter pmerT. The promoter is regulated by the MerR, which binds Hg2+-ions. Similar to the former sensors we added a sfGFP for detection via fluorescence.
For our mercury sensor we used parts of the mercury sensor constructed by iGEM team Peking 2010. These parts consist of the mercury dependent mer operon from Shigella flexneri R100 plasmid Tn21. The expression of the genes in the mer operon depends on the regulation by MerR its activator and promoter PmerT. For our sensor we used the codon optimized activator ( BBa_K1758340 ), under control of a constitutive promoter,( BBa_K346001 ). Additionally to this activator we designed and constructed the specific promoter PmerT( BBa_K346002 )(figure 2). For our sensor we added a 5’-UTR downstreamd of this promoter, which increased the fluorscence of the used reporter protein sfGFP.
Figure 2:  The concept of our in vivo mercury sensor ( BBa_K1758343 ), which consists of the activator under the control of a constitutive promoter BBa_K1758340 )and the operator and promoter sequence of the mercury inducible promoter. An untranslated region in front of the sfGFP, which is used for detection, enhances its expression ( BBa_K1758342 ).
Figure 3: During  cultivation the sfGFP signal in reaction to different mercury concentrations was measured. The induction with mercury happened after 165 minutes. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Figure 4: Fluorescence levels at two different stages of cultivation. Shown are levels after 120 minutes and 190 minutes. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
We tested our mercury sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene, to test the functionality of the system. Moreover we tested different concentrations. The kinetic of our sensors response to different mercury concentrations is shown in figure 3. A strong increase in fluorescence levels is notecible after induction with mercury after 120 min. For better visualization the kinetics of figure 3 are represented as bars in figure 4. A fluorescence level difference for 120 min and 190 min is represented"

ABACUS:
ABACUS is a submodule of team USTC-Software-2016's project. ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.

Figure 2: EM picture showing accumulated selenium nanobodies in V. natriegens (Fern`ndez-Llamosas et al. 2017).
Recently, a study revealed that V. natriegens, surprisingly, is the most effective producer of selenium nanoparticles yet described (Fern`ndez-Llamosas et al. 2017). These particles with a diameter from 100-400
nm
have applications in diverse fields, such as medicine, microelectronics and more. Producing the nanoparticles in living systems has benefits over other methods, for instance, the low energy consumption as well as a coat of proteins preventing agglomeration of the particles. Also, V. natriegens exceptionally high resistance to selenite suggests possible applications in bioremediation of contaminated water and soils.
Working with V. natriegens
ATCC
14048 is the most commonly used strain of V. natriegens. Most results from earlier studies were generated from this strain. We recommend using
ATCC
14048 in order to ensure that the findings will be applicable to your work and to adopt it as the standard strain. It is also the fastest strain known (Weinstock et al. 2016) so you won´t miss out on its incredible doubling time.
Stemming from subtropical regions, V. natriegens has not the same tolerance to low temperatures that we are used to from E. coli, but it is still much more resilient to cold than B. subtilis. At the root of that lies the low catalytic activity of V. natriegens native catalase at low temperatures, which is then unable to detoxify reactive oxygen species. To address that problem, scientists from
SGI
introduced homologous catalases, thereby creating a strain with comparable cold tolerance. With this adaptation, storage on plates can now be extended beyond the four weeks at room temperature by placing the plates in the fridge (Weinstock et al. 2016) In storage at -80°C in a standard 20% glycerol stock the cells stay viable almost indefinitely. And even when working with the wildtype, your cells won´t die overnight when placed at 4°C. Only after a week they will notably start decreasing in viability.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html," the organisms that can be created by synthetic biology, afraid that these organisms will somehow grow out of our control or have unexpected properties and will become dangerous for humanity. Our iGEM team observed this while talking to the general public on the streets of Bordeaux. For more information, look at our Cap Sciences section on this page.
In order to limit this fear, the question of transparency is important for scientists. Besides publishing his results, the researcher has to be able to explain his research process and the challenges of the project by stating the explored and the ignored areas. The general audience has to be able to understand his whole scientific approach. Results found, thanks to this approach, contribute to the production of new knowledge and innovation that could be shared to the general public. It is also important for the researcher to analyze his results, looking at the possible negative impacts of his research and estimating the safety and environmental risks and as well the ethical problematic. However, the researcher cannot be the only one in charge of the safety and ethics of his research.
Legal framework in France and in Europe
Creating guidelines and a legal framework is essential for safety reasons and to reassure the general public. In Europe, there is no law specifically concerning synthetic biology but synthetic biology is framed by common biology laws. In France, the first laws concerning bioethics were put in place in 1994. [2] Before, general laws existed but did not deal with the particular ethical aspects which come from biology and using living organisms. On the 1st of July, the law n°94-548 presents guidelines for data processing in medical research. This updated the law n°78-17 (1978) relative to informatic and big data processing in all fields of research. Quickly after, on the 29th of July 1994, two laws were put in place: law n° 94-653 and 94-654 which deal with respecting the human body and products which come from the human body. These laws cover the protection of patients which was then introduced in the Civil code, organizational rules in medical sectors and guidelines to be put in place to protect people involved in medical research programs. In march 2002, patient rights are put in place and certain end of life guidelines are discussed. Futile medical care is banned. Ethic committees set up by the European Union also exist to complement these laws for example, the European Commission, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the Inter-service Group on Ethics and EU policies, and the Executive Management for Research and Innovation

HUMAN PRACTICE
01 AT A GLANCE
“Technology alone is not enough. It is technology marry with liberal arts, marry with humanities, that yield us the result that makes our hearts sing.”           -Steve Jobs
 
“We discovered the true inner beauty of iGEM humanity, which is, being ethical, being versatile, and being creative.”           -ZJU China
 
Humanity in cut-edge science has always being a fascinating topic in synthetic biology. We cast eye over the 8 years of iGEM teams’ human practices, embraces the beauty of creativeness in science outreach. Greatly inspired, ZJU-China produced a handbook summarizing the previous iGEM human practices, deeply digging and fully analyzing. We’ve compared most of them in the real practice in our campus, and detailed a new video approach, which has the most impressive influence. We made efforts to  discover the true inner beauty of iGEM, which is, being ethical, being versatile, and being creative.
 
Don’t hesitate to join our journey with a view of fantastic iGEM human practices.
02 EXPERIENCE A REAL IGEM
This year, ZJU-China made full use of our Synthetic Biology Club. We recruited 60 members throughout the campus. They are coming from different majors,such as mathematics, computer science, biotechnology, agriculture, food science, clinical medicine, bioinformatics, polymer materials science and engineering, plant protection, geographic information systems, optical engineering, accounting, business, electrical engineering and automation, energy and environmental engineering, tea science and chemistry. All of them took part in our annually ""experiencing iGEM"" activity, namely, ZJU Jamboree.
 
This year, ZJU-China did a few lectures to widespread the value of iGEM, participated in some scientific activities to display our projects and gain funding ourselves, put special highlight on our high school friends, provided opportunities to others who were interested in experiencing a real iGEM lab life.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU#GreenGEM#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"4: Share Equipment with Other Labs
Sharing space in freezers, shakers, and incubators helps reduce energy consumption by consolidating, and allows labs to split costs of equipment. Sharing equipment also helps keep equipment well maintained by splitting maintenance duties between two or three different lab members.
#5: Have Fun!
A good collaboration can be incredibly fun for everyone involved, and it can introduce scientists to lifelong friends and useful resources! Collaboration can be a wonderfully productive positive experience, and making sure collaboration is sustainable only makes it more positive.

Figure 1. The three toxin-antitoxin complexes RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2.
The expression of both RelE and RelB is regulated by the relBE promoter, which is influenced differently by each of the complexes, as seen in Figure 2. When small amounts of RelE is present, RelB2 and RelB2RelE repress transcription through relBE by binding to the operator sequence. However, when high amounts of RelE are present, the toxin mitigates this repression by reacting with complexes bound to the operator sequence Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 .

During starvation, the half-life of RelB decreases significantly due to a Lon-protease Overgaard, M., Borch, J., Jørgensen, M. G. and Gerdes, K.

Molecular Microbiology, 69: 841–857. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06313.x , causing a shift in the equilibrium of RelB and RelE to a higher level of RelE. In a non-starvation situation, the interactions with the operator sequence keeps the amount of free RelE at a low level, thereby stabilising the system Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N.

The first aim of our modeling is to estimate AHL production rate κm in marine cells. The synthesis of AHLs by marine bacteria involves the transcription of certain genes when the secondary structure of RNA thermometers was melted and then output Lux I promotes AHL production by catalyzing the reaction of the two AHL precursor molecules, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and hexanoyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein).
The reaction can be summarized as,
Where S, C6, A and M are SAM, hexanoyl-ACP, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and the waste product, respectively.
In marine construct, output of Lux I occurs at a constant rate L0 as indicated in Figure 1 and decays at a rate of λL. Noted that λL was not the natural decay rate, the degradation of LuxI was accelerated by introducing LVA tail in marine cells.
Fig. 1 Schematic of the quorum sensing system LuxR/LuxI system. The reactions in the dashed box which occur only in the marine cells and the rest of reactions happen in polar and coast cells. The cloud-like icon stands for two substrates that produces the AHL, the wavy lines represent transcription of the protein and the “*” represent degradation.
We further assumed that the concentrations of SAM and, C6-ACP are"

Nissle 1917 was our choice of probiotic E. Coli strain for Oncoli. It is famous for its harmlessness in the body meaning that it can be taken orally with no adverse effects and continue its life within the boundaries of colon. Possible questions regarding our project is stated below:
1) Is there a possibility of probiotic bacteria causing systemic effects once inside our body?
Each member of our team was assigned to research the literature for the answer of this question before verifying our project. Despite assuming the answer we wanted to guarantee that Nissle would not harm our system. Many articles have been scanned and read on websites such as NCBI in which we did not encounter any stating that it is dangerous to the body. On the other hand, we contacted a popular scientist whom has released a lot of articles regarding his works with Nissle 1917. During our Skype chat, the same question was asked to Professor Szalay and his exact reply was ‘Nissle is absolutely harmless to the body. It has no side effects.’ He also mentioned that many years ago Nissle would be bought by many people in the form of powder for the amendment of their digestive tract illnesses.
2) Will the products produced by our Nissle 1917 bacteria such as nanofactory,apoptin, AI-2 change the balance in intestine? Will this result in high proliferation of bacteria in the intestine, and cause harm to the body?
1) The abundance of our bacteria will be minor compared to intestinal flora 2) Flora is constantly renewed for this reason there will be no accumulation of our substances 3)Is there a possibility of our bacteria exchanging genes with the bacterial flora which may result in a high degree of apoptin production? Maybe this situation is possible. But we can keep our plasmid from"

Tripeptide Production
Peptide Production and Secretion
The Stony Brook iGEM team was successful in building the construct coding for the sequence of repeating QSP tripeptides. This sequence is under the OmpC promoter, allowing it to be induced under conditions of high osmolarity. It was marked with the HlyA secretion tag.
After conducting a successful transformation, we wanted to induce the system in various osmotic conditions. The supernatant of the cells was then to be isolated and, through a combination of Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, the production and secretion of the peptide sequence into the extracellular space was to be quantified. If the system were to function correctly, a direct relationship would be expected to be seen between the concentration of solute in the environment of the cell and the presence of the peptide string in the extracellular fluid.
Unfortunately, while plasmid sequencing confirmed that the designed biobrick was successfully constructed, we were unable to confirm the function of the biobrick due to time restrictions and equipment inaccessibility.
Protease
The Stony Brook iGEM team was successful in building the construct coding the sequence for proline iminopeptidase
After successful transformation, it was our goal to isolate large quantities of the protease to determine a kinetic baseline for its degradation of L-proline p-Nitroaniline, as monitored over time in time-lapse Infrared Spectrometry. The results of the experiment were to serve as a comparison to the activity of the enzyme when compared to the construct designed to express this protease on the membrane with the OmpA membrane display tag. Prolyl endopeptidase was the protease we originally wanted to test with cleaving our tripeptides. Unfortunately, the sequence was too large to synthesize so another protease, proline iminopeptidase, was chosen instead. While proline iminopeptidase only acts on an N-terminal proline and cannot successfully cleave the peptide sequence into tripeptides, we wanted to see if our system could successfully produce a proline protease in sufficient quantities and we believed that the results of this experiment would be representative of the production and action of prolyl endopeptidase.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints and"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA was analyzed using DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
The next step was to identify if reference nucleotides - in this case 5-methylcytidine triphosphates (5mC) are accessible to phi29 polymerase and do not inhibit the reaction. Once again 50 pL droplets were formed containing MDA reaction reagents as previously, only this time it contained 300 uM concentration of methylated instead of simple dCTP molecules. The generated emulsion is incubated off chip at 30oC for 6 hours. As seen from the amplified DNA analysis on agarose gel (Fig. 12), the methylated nucleotides pose no problem for the reaction to occur and produce a heavier (expected because of additional -CH3 group) DNA fragments. These results conclude that 5-methylcytidines can be used as reference nucleotides, which can be differentiated from other forms of cytidine nucleotides during nanopore sequencing.
Figure 13. Analysis of activity amplification reaction product.The concept of catalytically converted nucleotide incorporation (activity recording) was tested by performing in bulk (20 µL) or droplet (50 pL) MDA reactions. Both of the reaction were incubated 30oC for 6 hours. 1. No primer contro; 2. MDA reaction with standard cytidine nucleotides; 3. MDA reaction with substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidines; 4. MDA reaction with substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidines with added CAT-Seq esterase enzyme. L and HR correspond to GeneRuler 1kb and High Range DNA Ladders.
When the working concentration of the MDA reaction have been established in droplets, we ought to test the simplified approach of our system. For this, our catalytic biomolecule of interest, which catalyzes the hydrolysation of substrate bound nucleotides was purified using 6x histidine tag. MDA reactions containing substrate nucleotides as the only source of cytidine triphosphate (no reference nucleotides) were performed in bulk and 50 pL droplets with or without the addition of extracted enzyme. The amplified DNA product agarose gel analysis results prove, that the presence of added enzyme enable the MDA reaction to take place. The substrate bound nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase meaning that the reaction mix is missing 1"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html,"Device Committee” was formed; a small group of wet and dry members who would begin the design of a physical unit to house and interpret the output from our engineered bacteria.  This began with background reading on creating a GFP-fluorescence reading device. Order initial parts to build a light sensing device based on LED light source so we could modulate the light levels. We considered that we would have to use MatLab to carry out calculations. Our visits to the clinic took a more direct focus, and during the interviews we were conducting each week, we started asking patients for their thoughts on the design of the physical detector.
Week 7
Sequencing results for rpfG QuikChange™  showed that it was actually rpfC…oops! Steps were made to rectify this quickly!
All promoters had now been successfully cloned and sequenced and so the job now was to clone them along with their fluorescent reporters into pUniprom.  Our two sequences of BCAM0227 were successfully returned from the sequencing company, Dundee Cell Products, for us to work with. The two separate sequences were digested, and work commenced to try and ligate them together into pbluescript...easier said than done!
Initial experiments with a photodiode, Arduino and a green LED for the physical device, commenced. First designs showed us that we would need an excitation source to induce fluorescence, this would necessitate the inclusion of filters and amplifiers…extremely complicated! Discussions were had with the entire team about eventually using firefly luciferase as a reporter in the place of fluorescent proteins.
Week 8
After lots of modelling of the PQS system, and trying to troubleshoot why our system was not expressing mCherry, the decision was made to design another two biological sensors for P. aeruginosa, which would detect another quorums sensing molecule Pseudomonas autoinducer 1 (PAI-1). Lots of work for the wet team!
An overnight culture of E. coli MC1061 transformed with the DSF plasmid was pelleted and prepared for western blotting for detection of our proteins - alas, RpfC-HA is not being expressed! Back to the cloning board… BioBricking of rpfG was undertaken upon receiving good news from sequencing that our illegal EcoRI restriction site had been removed.
Week 9
The tricksome BCAM0227 was successfully ligated together into one gargantuan sequence, and swiftly cloned into pUniprom (already containing the Pcbld-gfp fusion).

These few super shedders are important factors to pre-harvest contamination as the source of 80% of O157:H7 strains isolated from beef carcasses are from the high cattle density and rapid turnover environment of the processing plant and transport trailers, not the original feedlot (Arthur, 2009).
We also met with and discussed E. coli markers with Dr. Glen Armstrong, professor and head of the Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary. Dr. Armstrong suggested that we implement multiple TALEs to target different markers to identify E. coli serotypes.
Primers containing the target sequences of TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B( BBa_K782006 ), and variations of the target sequences (with point mutations in different positions) were used to perform a PCR on RFP generator ( BBa_J04450 ); the product of the PCR would be the target sequence of the TALE and a part of the RFP gene which is 660 base paris (figures 1, 2 and 3). The PCR products were purified and digested with XbaI and PstI and inserted into  a vector; RFP generator was also digested with XbaI and PstI to prepare the vector.
IPTG inducible promoter with RBS ( BBa_J04500 ) was transformed with competent cells and plated on Amp and Chlor.

Background
Cockroaches are among the most common and obnoxious household pests, they harbor in damp and unsanitary places such as sewers, garbage disposals, kitchens, and bathroom, feed on human’s and pet’s food. Besides its importance as a sign of poor sanitation, cockroaches have been implicated in the transmission of several pathogenic organisms such as E.coli and Salmonella enteritidis which can cause diarrhea, pneumonia and so on[1]. Also, expose to cockroach feces and body parts of dead roaches over time can trigger allergies and asthma[2]. So it’s not safe to ignore these pests.
Current solution
People rack their brains about cockroach control. Currently, there are two mainstream ways to control the population of cockroaches, physical and chemical methods. However, a chemical method like foggers, boric acid, and gel bait may cause environmental toxicity and the development of resistance in cockroaches[3]. A physical method such as “cockroach house”, only trap few cockroaches. Neither chemical nor physical method can’t achieve the goal of environment-friendly and efficient control.
Our solution
This year’s SZU China team want to tackle the cockroach control issue by using synthetic biology. We choose a kind of entomogenous fungi, Metarhizium anisopliae , as biological chassis. It is considered a safe and prospective choice for causing disease in insects only. But its lethality is still needed to be improved, which limits it's widespread used. We construct a system to enhance its virulence. Our system contains three parts: HsbA, BbChit, and MCL1. These three genes work sequentially during infecting"
UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," you know what their decision must have been.  I was eight, too old for any of the rich young couples to want me, so my parents made me take pills reversing the effects of HGH to make me look younger (we could barely afford it but it was my only chance to survive).  Then one day, with my parents crying, people came to our house and whisked me away in their fancy air-conditioned car.  They spoke a strange language that I didn’t understand and dressed me in clothes entirely devoid of color.  When I got there I was given a very simple shot to take care of the malaria.  That shot, in those five seconds, saved my life.  My parents gave me up for that shot, and now I was stuck with the rich.  I was instructed to learn from people who didn’t understand me or know my story.  I lived the rest of my life in a cold, dark, very sterilized world, and now I want to go back.  I want to go back to the lively vibrant culture and familiar people of my childhood.  I want to go back home.

Human Practice
Overview
Human Practice Philosophy:  big dreams with  applications
Behind our Human Practice we have one simple idea. We have a vision to transform our dreams in new applications to excel in  achieving social goals.  Our vision for Human Practice has been  shown in report on Future Lanthan Hospital Model. It is a bottom-up strategy  to transform healthcare by launching collaboration on the boundaries of several disciplines aimed at inducing openness and sharing, not only in business and academia but also in the society itself. In Human Practice we would like to show the perspective and context for Cellulare. To tell the truth we would be pleased show you big dreams with application and encourage you to collaborate with us!
We  believe that the person with a great idea behind is more powerful than one who depend merely on facts. So, everything what we have done was based on that philosophy. We do not give you complete solutions,  but a vision and a strategy to develop and apply. Our first goal is not to be the best iGEM project, our goal is to initiate the project which could be developed further, outside iGEM by people of different skills and different potential  to solve complex problems on the larger scale. We are aimed at  design both Cellulare itself and its Human Practice to serve social goals which could be developed far beyond synthetic biology.

Recycling ideas:  recovery - transformation – new application
We have started from listening what others want to say and, asking them questions to understand better the context of our project (Figure 1).  This is how new application for Celulare  has emerged. Our ultimate goal of the Human Practice is to add valuable contribution to healthcare transition by proposing a more synthetic biology-oriented approach for medicine. At the same time we want"

We performed the gibson reaction of eYFP::CheY again. The gibson product was transformed directly to DH5α. Furthermore, a Gibson overhang for the CheZ and LuxAB fragments was created by PCR with primers that were extended. The PCR products were ran on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel revealed faint bands, but no ladder. Hence we didn’t proceed with these samples.

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"TE. Based on fact that single domain have independent function[3], we assembled domains in some order to create new module of PKSs that can synthesize new polyketides[4]. We chose a part of PKSs of erythromycin and obtain its sequence DEBS1, DEBS2 and DEBS3 to begin our project[5][6]. We first standardized every domain from DEBS1 and TE domain from DEBS3, and then assembled the DEBS1+TE as its original sequence(figure1). At the same time, we exchanged the some domains with the same function to compare their efficiency. Further, the heterologous loading modules were selected to substitute AT-ACP which is the loading module of DEBS1 so as to produce different kinds of triketide lactones[7]. In order to fulfill Programmed Polykitide Synthesis (PPS), we try our best to establish the database which can provide the proposal and protocol for choosing the functional chassis and the standardized domains you need for synthesizing novel polyketides.
Figure1:We arrange the DEBS1 as its original sequence.
Functional Chassis
These biomolecules, polyketides, are synthesized from some simple build blocks compounds such as coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA[8]. The DEBS1+TE utilize propionic acid or propionate to start the synthesis of polyketides chain. To make sure the substrate of building block is enough to produce polyketides, we first deleted the prp operon that is responsible for propionate catabolism in E.coli BL21(DE3), so that the catabolism of propionate in BL21(DE3) was destroyed. In this way, the ability of DE3 to utilize propionate as a carbon and energy source was eliminated. The prp operon include prpRBCDE, but the prpE gene is thought to convert propionate into propionyl-CoA, so we just have to delete the prpRBCD[2]. After deleting prpRBCD, we engineered the pathway of (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis, which is the another building block of polyketides chain. The propionyl CoA carboxylase (pcc) genes from S. coelicolor which can synthesize the correct isomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, are transfered into the BL21[5].  Besides, domain ACP requires the gene sfp to transfer the"

Summary
Due to exams and other commitments only a small turnout was possible. Need to make sure that once exams finished that times of meetings allow everyone to attend. Schedule for weekly meetings will be setup at next meeting.
It is important that everyone is aware of the deadlines and key dates for iGEM. This needs to be sent to whole team in e-mail and discussed at next meeting.
Funding is still in the processes of being finalised. Further details will be provided once available.
Unfortunately no one was able to attend the instructors meeting, however, as Mario has participlated before, and having contacted MIT it seems this will not be a problem.
Actions
(Everyone) Need to invite everyone to the Google group to discuss projects.
(Everyone) Wiki needs to be updated with current details and templates for team members.
(Everyone) Looks through the ideas document produced and think about new ones.

Our Goals
We will use synthetic biology principles to help treat chronic wounds by targeting the overproduction of wound site protease.
For Aim 1 we will genetically engineer E. coli to produce a protease inhibitor and platelet derived growth factor.
For Aim 2 we will purify the protease inhibitor and platelet derived growth factor in a bioreactor.
For Aim 3 we will design a collagen bandage that mimics the human extracellular matrix, and infuse it with purified protease inhibitor and platelet derived growth factor.
Our approach is two-fold. By infusing the collagen extracellular matrix with platelet derived growth factor and protease inhibitor, chronic wounds should be able to progress past the inflammation phase and begin healing once again.
What We Accomplished →
Aim 1
We were able to design constructs for two therapeutic proteins, aprotinin and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Our goal was to use these therapeutic proteins to decrease wound healing times. Aprotinin, being a matrix-metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor, will inhibit wound-site proteases, preventing these proteases from breaking down the healing extra-cellular matrix (ECM). PDGF will stimulate cellular regeneration in chronic wounds, helping to speed up and fortify the wound healing process.
Experimental Data →
Aim 2
We designed, created, and tested a bioreactor to grow our bacteria in conditions so as to maximize protein production. With this optimal environment, we hoped to create a sustainable, cost-effective protocol to mass-produce our therapeutic agents.
Experimental Data →
Aim 3
We made a control collagen matrix to compare with a collagen matrix that will be infused with our purified proteins, aprotinin and PDGF, which would imitate the human extracellular matrix. This would give the wound bed all the resources it would need for a speedy recovery.
Experimental Data →
Conclusion
Coupling a bioreactor with our Kil protein secretion method, we will be able to purify large quantities of DsbA tagged therapeutic protein from the supernatant with a continuous flow through process. Western blot analysis helped us to confirm the identity of our purified PDGF-B protein, and the bioreactor allowed us to produce large amounts of our secretion proteins.
Gold Medal Part Improvement
A big part of the 2016 TTU iGEM teams project relied upon being able to produce Aprotinin (BBa_K1456006), a protease inhibitor for infusion into a collagen scaffold. To increase our chances we decided to improve upon this"

Constitutive Promoter: Represents a DNA sequence that promotes RNA polymerase binding and transcription in the forward direction.  The open square indicates constitutive
transcription.  The arrow and its presence on the DNA strand indicates directionality.
Inducible Promoter
Represents a forward promoter that is induced.  The ""+"" sign indicates that promoter needs to be induced to initiate transcription.
Repressible Promoter
Represents a forward promoter that can be repressed to block transcription.  The ""-"" sign suggests the promoter's repressibility and the rightward arrow, as in the case of the rightward constiutive promoter, indicates directionality.
Promoters With Operators
A combination of two symbols, one indicates a forward promoter.  The open boxes on either or both sides of the promoter indicate an upstream or downstream operator.  The box can be filled with information about the specific location and functionality of the operator.
Open Reading Frame
Represent an rightward-facing ORF.  The tag shape emphasizes the single continuous DNA fragment of the ORF and then arrowhead at the end of the tag represents the 5' to 3' directionality of the reading frame.
Translational Start Site
Represents a Shine-Delgarno sequence in the rightward strand of prokaryotes, IRES in viruses and ribosome loading structure in eukaryotes.  The half-circle is intended to visually represent the ribosome binding to a DNA strand.
Terminator
Represents the location on the gene where transcription ends. The ""T"" shape not only reminds one visually of a ""T"" for ""Terminator,"" but also the t-structure visually represents a hairpin structure that is formed at the end of transcription.
Primer Site
Represents the location where the primer binds in order for transcription to occur.
Ribonuclease Site
Represents the site where RNA is cut. In this icon and the following, a dashed line corresponds to functional elements encoded on RNA. The ""x"" is supposed to correlate to the ""cutting"" of the RNA.
RNA Stability Elements
Corresponds to the stability of the RNA linked to secondary structure at this point. Once again, the dashed line signifies an RNA-encoded function. In this image and the following, the size of the circle is representative (on a log-based scale) of the half life of the RNA, aka its ""stability."" The larger circle appearing here signifies a stable molecue, with decreasing size corresponding to decreasing stability.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html,"5-4 clearly shows the change of the concentration of heavy metal ions in the supernatant. Firstly, the Cu yeast works smoothly. The concentration of copper ions declines over time while that of cadmium ions barely changes. 12 hours later, we add galactose to the solution. Situation changes. Galactose induces the enzyme, changing Cu yeast to Cd yeast. It leads to faster adsorption of cadmium but slower for copper..
DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
In the experiment, we find the LIMT doesn’t appear as ideal as we thought. In the future work, we plan to read involved references in order to complete protein modification by rational design.
Moreover, it’s a pity that we have no time to combine our genetic circuit and SCRaMbLE yeast. In subsequent experiments, it deserves a try to transform fragments into SCRaMbLE yeast, checking if it will double the absorption capacity or even better.
In the nutshell, we will be dedicated to improve the absorption efficiency and better our genetic circuit.

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.

Fig. 2-5 Plasmids A, B and C in oscillation circuit
You may have noticed that these three plasmids have different resistant genes and replication origins on their backbone. Different resistant genes are used mainly for selection. And since different replication origin means a different copy number of target genes in this plasmid. Using different replication origins is to produce different target proteins in an appropriate ratio, and only in this way can oscillation be observed. Just like a glee needs Soprano, Tenor and Bass to cooperate to finish a song. Besides, three artificial plasmids with same copy numbers always have a competitive relation in one cell and cannot be well expressed.
Plasmid A has two different backbones with high and middle copy numbers respectively. We built them to see the copy numbers' effect on oscillation. Results can be seen in Improvement (For a better Glee).
All of the plasmids we constructed are confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and result can be seen in Parts, where you can also get the link to parts we submitted.
After the onerous construction work, our glee is ready to perform the synchronized oscillation song, so we have to find them a stage. Let's go to see the beautiful opera in Microfluidics (Stages).

Safety in the lab
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.  (http://www.uleth.ca/risk-and-safety-services/)
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge High School iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.  (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/index-eng.php)

As you can see the Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team project will be environmentally and economically useful. However, how synthetic biology, and our project, is perceived in our community is extremely important. Will synthetic biology be a profitable, and therefore continuous, field in southern Alberta? This is important for our team to consider.
With the continually advancing field of biotechnology and the emergent industry of synthetic biology there is a growing demand for graduates with a strong science background. However, North America is experiencing a decline in the number of graduates majoring in science. One of the goals of the 2009 Lethbridge iGEM team is to view the trends of science interest and knowledge in Southern Albertan high school students. Although many similar surveys have and are being conducted, ours is geared towards students in our immediate vicinity, Lethbridge and the surrounding area. This is important, as Southern Alberta is a highly conservative area that puts a lot of emphasis on religion and tradition. Thus it should be interesting to see how the up and coming generations of science students feel about synthetic biology.
To assess the interest levels and general attitude that high school students have towards science we have conducted a survey of grade 10 classrooms in three separate Lethbridge high schools. The survey and its results are discussed below.

We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data.

Cells were spun down, resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCL, 250 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA) and lysed by sonication (4x15 sec, 25Am).
Protein concentrations were measured with a Bradford assay.
20 ug of each extract was loaded on SDS to check for Cas9 expression. The expected weight of Cas9 is 156 kDa, of dCas9-Ala10TAG is 1 kDa (can’t be seen anyways), and of dCas9-Ala840TAG it is 97 kDa. No such bands could be observed (possible also due to a background band of the same size)
because for the original iGEM construct, the band seemed to be a bit more pronounced, I grew new cultures and repeated the experiment. This time, it was really obvious that expression levels were too low.
in vitro transcription of guide RNAs By the time of transcription, guide 3 had not been verified by sequencing yet, so only guide 1, 2 and 4 were transcribed and purified, according to the protocol .
I only have a picture of the gel after cutting the RNA bands, but they were present.
After purification, guide 2 and 4 had decent concentrations of ~350 ng/uL. Guide 1 had only 35 ng/uL.
Cloning of Cas9 variants in expresso vector
After discussion with an employee in the departement who has experience expressing Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, it was decided that expression from pdCas9 is probably too low to visualize on SDS-PAGE, and perhaps not suitable for further in vitro testing.
So it was decided to clone Cas9 in the Expresso c-rham vector system .
First, Cas9 variants and the Expresso vector were amplified by PCR . The following reactions were performed:

Secretion of p53 into the cytoplasm
To efficiently transport p53 to the eukaryotic cells the endogenic E. coli secretion system responsible for secretion of hemolysin by uropathogenic strains will be used. It is composed of three transport proteins HlyB, HlyD and TolC [10]. TolC is present in the genome of the lab strain derived from K12 strain. To ensure efficient secretion hlyB and hlyD have to be introduced into the genome and proapoptotic protein has to be fused with 60 amino acid long C-terminal sequence of hemolysin. [5].
Directing bacterial proteins to mammalian mitochondria.
One of the nescessary objectives is to direct a fraction of secreted proteins into the mitochondrion. This will be achieved by fusion of mitochondrial leader sequence from human protein Cox1 to the N-terminus of proteins. It has been shown that  40 amino acids long N-terminal sequence is enough for effective transport of Cox1 across the mitochondrial membrane. First the efficiency of the process will be assessed by detection of Red Fluorescent Protein with confocal microscopy. The red fluorescence should be visible in the mitochondria of the cells invaded by bacteria expressing RFP fused with the mitochondrial leader sequence. Then the ability to induce apoptosis by mitochondrially directed p53 will be investigated. Apoptosis induction will be confirmed by flow cytometry [8]. In addition we will use confocal microscopy to monitor the process. In both cases cells will be stained with propidium iodide and annexin V.
Targeting the tumor cells via recognition the specific receptors on the cell surface
The specific delivery of drug molecule or larger particles like artificial liposomes, dendrimers or even whole bacterial cells  to tumor cells mainly relies on the potential of the associated vector to specifically head for the malignant center. This implies the identification of tumor markers which are appropriate target. One of the major strategy consists in targeting proteins that are highly specific or directly over-expressed on tumor cells. Nowadays,  the set of potentially interested ligands for the specifically targeted anticancer agents is remarkable large but only a few class of these markers appears to be promising as a targets for the new generation anticancer drugs. Nowadays plethora of proteins that are responsible for cellular signaling pathways are known, involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation in neoplasms with the targets amenable to therapeutic interventions in cancer therapy.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#LinkerJournal_-_-_TEXT.html,": June 3 - June 7
Based on the research we have done in the previous weeks we have decided to plot out some experiments that will help us characterize our coils. We plan make use of a Ni-NTA column and His-tags on our coils to characterize our coils. The idea is that we can have a His-tag located on one of the coils and this coil will bind to the column via the His-tag. The second coil will be fused to protein such as GFP ( BBa_K648013 ). This second coil will not have a His-tag and when passed through the column it ideally should bind to the other coil already immobilized via a His-tag. By varying the conditions within the column we should be able to characterize the binding of the coils. If the coil fused to GFP falls off of the other coil it should be located in the collected fluid. The presence of the GFP can be detected by both fluorescence and SDS-PAGE.
Three proposed experiments that we have making use of this are detailed below:
The first test will just test the binding of the coils to each other under standard coil binding conditions (pH = 7). A K-coil will be bound to a drip Ni-NTA column via a 6x His-tag C-terminus fusion.  An E-coil with an N-terminus GFP fusion can then interact with the K-coil that is bound to the column. If the interaction is successful the GFP will not be found in high quantities in the wash steps. The GFP fusion should elute when imidazole is added to the column. The levels of GFP can be verified using both emission measurements and SDS-PAGE.
The second test will make use of this column but will measure the effect of pH on the binding of the coils. Different columns will be set up with different pH washes (3, 5, 7 and 9). It has been previously reported that the coils begin to dissociate at a pH of 5 (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008).
The third test will make use of a spin Ni-NTA column. This test will testthe ability of the heterodimer coiled-coils to resist shearing due to applied forces. The columns will undergo centrifugation at different steps after the proteins have been bound to determine if the forces present have any effect on the binding of the coils.

Public Engagement
Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Public Engagement page. Public Engagement and outreach is fundamentally the communication between fellow scientists and non-scientists.
Nottingham iGEM 2018 participated in the University of Nottingham Discovery Day an open day for young children and parents. This was our first Public Engagement event and it helped the team establish a dialogue with members of the public.
We also held workshops at 3 schools with students ages 15-18. They engaged strongly and positively with the activities and showed ample curiosity towards synthetic biology. Not only did this open a new avenue but it helped us understand just how much students knew about synthetic biology and different components of our project, we hope this can be developed further for future curriculums that will be taught in schools.
Finally, we published articles for local newspapers describing what possibilities our project could bring, as well as encouraging readers to engage with us.
Discovery day
16th June 2018
Nottingham iGEM took part in Discovery Day 2018 at the University of Nottingham! We put on a range of fun activities for kids aged 4-10 to learn more about synthetic biology and bacteria microbes!
First, the children got the opportunity to make their own plasticine microbes and put them in petri dishes! They used inspiration from our fun cuddly toy bacterium friends and produced some amazing results.
After that, both kids and adults had a go at guessing which mode of transport had the most bacteria- bus, train or plane. The answer- bus surprised a lot of people- including the adults!
Finally, everyone had a go at seeing how much bacteria was on their hands by using a special gel, then showing their hands under UV light to see how dirty their hands were. It seems that the kids had cleaner hands than most of us university students!
Overall it was an amazing day where we educated kids all about synthetic biology! The parents feedback to our team was incredibly"

The sequencing results from psb1c3+T7 promoter+silk+GFP came back, the first sample looked very clean with the exception of a noisy middle region (inaccurate sequencing after 500-700 bp). The other two samples had more mutations. I will be designing a primer to sequence the middle region."
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Classes_-_-_TEXT.html," fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany. The iGEM team from Darmstadt played a small part in this issue but the following iGEM teams in Germany will also do so.
1. Junior
9th September 2012 Lab course with students from Highschool
To make not only the iGEM competition, but also the Synthetic Biology well known in the public awareness, the Darmstadt iGEM team decided to host a student internship. At the beginning of September came about 20 students of the Ludwig-George Highschool to the biology campus of the TU Darmstadt. In this laboratory course, students were able to transpose their theoretical knowledge of molecular biology techniques into practice. As molecular detectives their task was to analyze an unknown meat sample on its species. For this purpose, the students were allowed to purify mitochondrial DNA and perform a PCR for amplification of a specific mitochondrial gene. After a restriction digest and separation of the resulting fragments with agarosegel-electrophoresis the students were able to define the species of their samples. During the breaks, the iGEM team used the opportunity to present their project to the students and to discuss the importance of synthetic biology. The students were very receptive to the topic and immediately recognized that such issues playing no role in school and should be discussed more often. It was not only a new experience for the students, but also for the iGEM team to discuss ethic issues of Synthetic Biology and how the society could learn more about the opportunities which are given by that.
We really enjoyed the day with the iGem Team . We learned a lot of new things, but we also repeated what we already knew from school. It helped a lot that we could do the experiments on our own, because in biology it is very difficult to understand experiments if you don´t see them in front of you. If we had questions, we could ask the iGEM team and they explained it very well. They also explained us the idea of the bacterium which is able to recycle plastic and the whole group liked the idea. Altogether it was a very interesting and informative day and it should be possible for every class to take part in something like this.
