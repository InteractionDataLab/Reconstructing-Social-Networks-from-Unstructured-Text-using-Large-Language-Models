RNA Thermometer
What is it?
RNA Thermometers(RNAT) are temperature-sensing RNA sequences in 5’UTR of their mRNAs. At low temperature, RNAT folds into the structure, blocking access of ribosome; at high temperature, RNAT switch from off to open conformation, increasing the efficiency of translation initiation[5].
Why choose it?
Unlike other thermosensitive regulators, especially those dependent on protein conformation change, RNA sequences of RNAT is short, conforming convenience. In addition, based on conformation changes, RNAT responses to temperature change in a more immediate manner[5].
How to?
Select the best assembly
TUDelft-2008 has modified 3 kinds of RNAT: ROSE( BBa_K115001 ), FourU( BBa_ K115002 ), PrfA( BBa_K115003 ). We constructed each RNAT under the control of 3 different constitutive promoters: BBa_J23101 , BBa_J23106 , BBa_J23119 and use RFP as a reporter(Fig.2.). After construction, the 9 circuits were transformed into DH5α.

Agar plate test
According to the results of TUDelft-2008, the temperature threshold is 37℃ for FourU and PfrA, 42℃ for ROSE. Thus, we set the culture temperature to 28℃, 37℃ and 42℃. For one temperature, we spotted one strain on 3 different plates, each plate containing 9 different strains(Fig.3.).

Mars BioTools: Synthetic Biology for Space Exploration
One of the major challenges of space exploration is the limited payload mass that can be launched on a rocket and the difficulty of resupply mid-mission. Any long term settlement will require more resources than astronauts can initially bring with them. Synthetic Biology has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and settlement. Biological tools have a major advantage over classical tools: the ability to self-replicate and regenerate.
The emerging field of Synthetic Biology will allow us to engineer microbial factories that will largely circumvent the limiting payload factors. These cellular factories will generate fuel, food, medicines and building materials for settlers, but will consist of engineered cells that could be stored in a single test tube, and regrown to production scale on-site, as needed.
The Brown-Stanford iGEM team is excited to work on three different projects, under the common theme of developing Synthetic Biology applications for space. In addition, as a response to the ethical and philosophical considerations, we interviewed prominent researchers and leaders in the field. Click on the astronaut in the corner to view our series.

Week 2
Wet Lab:
We picked colonies of S. Oneidensis for overnight culture and minipred the plasmid with our LDH and LDP mutants the next day. We sent the for sequencing and found that some acquired new mutations during conjugation.
We minipreped the all RBS mutant reporters and sent them for sequence verification. 7 out of 36 RBS mutants shows negative results while the rest have correct mutations i.e. the desired substitution has occured. We picked another colony for those that are wrong and sent again for sequencing. For those that are correct, we transformed them into WM3064 and picked colonies for overnight culture the next day. Then we conugated the RBS mutant reporter into S. Oneidensis.
In summary, we sucessfully created 35 out of 36 RBS single base pair mutants.  Substitution of the 6th base pair from G to T was carried out three times but was unsucessfull.
Week 3
We measured the growth curve of 6 LDH and 8 LDP mutants over a 36 hour period and took measurements at 2 hour intervals. Welcome to have a look at our method. We also picked all remaining colonies from our plates, which will be our second batch of mutants. However, for our second batch, we will ligate mutant LDH with wild type LDP and vice versa into an operon with pLac as a promoter. Hence, the resulting construct looks like this
We got all the the 7 mutants right for the second colony picked. Then we started to carry our characterisation of the RBS mutants which have been transferred into Shewanella.
Week 4
We started out construction of the LDPWT-TT by ligating the wild type LDP gene into the TT vector. and the same is done for the LDH wild type gene. We continued on to miniprep all the LDH mutants which is 14 in total for our second batch.
After conjugation, most of the plated mixtures of WM3064 and MR1 gave too much colonies and picking single colony out was very hard and was met with failures. Hence, we redid conjugation for plates that shows smears rather then single colonies. Moreover, we were also working out a protocol to measure the GFP intensity with the Tecan Plate Reader as our"

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," service by using known computer centers such as NCBI and its API to perform Blast alignments, but the computing time was still high and this library does not count with every plant genomes.
The off targets’ search does not take into account the chromatin state, so in diploid systems or with polyploidy we could find false off targets.
That is why we decided to analyse only the gene, and our empirical tests showed the good level of the sofware and the scoring system in comparison with other tools.
API
As it has been introduced before, we have developed an API so that more people can easily use our scoring system and our database without need to share our algorithms.
First of all, we have to define what an API is; API (Application Programming Interface) is currently understood as the set of subroutines, functions and procedures that a library offers for being used by another software as an abstraction layer.
Our API routes are the following:
http://hypeit.cloudno.de/api/scoringsystem
http://hypeit.cloudno.de/api/findByNameAndSpecie
http://hypeit.cloudno.de/api/findByPhenotypi
http://hypeit.cloudno.de/api/findByGeneName
In the first API route we make our scoring system disposable for other softwares, in the other three, we share our database, thus we are going to explain how to use an API and how we have create it for allowing its use to users with limited programming skills.
As it is known, a web service based on http allows petition communication through a minimum of four routes: ‘get’, ‘post’, `put` and ‘delete’. Each one has a different internal mechanism. Get routes allow information recovery, i.e. our web explorer does something similar to http.get(‘www.google.es’) and receives the html that can be visualized in the screen. for sending any message to the web server, we need to use the other instructions, generally, the API use the ‘post’ command, which allows creation and query, but unfortunately, a url-based explorer cannot make a petition post, reason why we chose to create both; the ‘post’ route for future users and a “get2 one that can be read by the explorer, but at an informatic level it is not correctly interoperable by other applications.
In the following web: http://hypeit.cloudno.de/api/scoringsystem two backend listners have been activated for receiving post and get petitions. However, as the API needs to be fooled by a protocol that is not the expected one, we have to"

Cell Lysis:
Samples collected from cell growth on Saturday were lysed today using enzymatic cell lysis.
Cell samples were pooled together in one 50 mL Falcon tube, with a final cell weight of 7.5 grams in 22.5 mL of lysis buffer.
Lysozyme was added to thawed cell solution on ice (4.5 mg, or approximately 0.0045g) and incubated on ice, swirling periodically for 30 minutes.
PMSF was added to the cell solution following lysozyme at a final concentration of 1mM from a 100mM stock (225uL of 100 mM PMSF stock).
While stirring vigorously, 11.25g of Deoxycholic acid was stirred into solution.  Lysate was then incubated at 37 degrees for 20 minutes.
20 uL of DNase I was added to the lysed samples, and incubated for 30 minutes at RT on a shaker.
Sample centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3,300 xg at 4 degrees.  Supernatant transferred to a 50 mL conical at heat treated for 10 minutes at 80 degrees in a water bath.  Cells were respond and the supernatant was recollected as the protein extract.

I
In the very beginning just after coming up with the idea of losing weight, we tried to figure out people’s attitudes towards being fat. Thanks to the software designed by  SYSU-Software, we successfully recorded what emojis netizens are using when they talk about body weight, obesity or slimming on microblog through the technique of web crawling. By the end of April, a great amount of information had been accurately recorded and specifically analyzed. We found that people tended to use negative emojis when mentioning about their growing weight, while positive emojis when expressing the wishes of regaining slimness. By investigating people’s attitudes in this way, we felt the strong urge and necessity to help people with weight control, and then came our complete project.
II
To better understand people’s expectation of weight-losing therapies, we carried out a questionnaire survey among ordinary people. According to the feedback, 60.85% of our respondents had trouble with controlling weight and longed for slimming down, implying that our project did cater to the need of a large number of people. Moreover, despite the difficulty of persisting, going on a diet and taking exercise were still the best choices to most people, which revealed that there is still plenty room for the improvement of obesity treatments in a long run.
III
In May 2017, we participated in an academic debate competition held in China Pharmaceutical University, which was about the better use of biotherapeutics. And later in August, some members of our team attended the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC-2017) held in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. During this meeting, we shared the ideas and experience of our project with other iGEM teams all over China together, learning useful suggestions from each other.
IV
Two months ago, a patient who had suffered from obesity type II diabetes for many years accepted our interview in Nanjing Military General Hospital, helping us to further understand the real situations obesity patients were confronted with.
When talking about the best method of losing weight, the patient gave most credit to the treatment of useful medicine, compared to other ways like diet or exercise. Our interviewee believed it was subcutaneous drugs that helped him reduce"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

$$ \Delta T(n) = -(n-n_c) \Delta I + n_c \Delta C, \qquad n_c\leq n \textrm{ and } n \in [1,N] \tag{3}$$
For convenience, we normalize the $P_{clv}$ through division by the cleavage probability for a matching (on-target) sequence and find R, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target.
$$ \mathcal{R} = \frac{P_{clv} (s|g)}{P_{clv}(g|g)} \tag{4}$$
From a numerical implementation of the model (in Python), we can now determine Cas13a’s tolerance for mismatches between the target and guiding sequence for several model parameters (the energy gain $\Delta C$ and energy penalty $\Delta I$).
Off-target simulations
Although scarce, there are some experimental data illustrating the mismatch tolerance of Cas13a ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 , Figure S19 and S21). We observe there is a central seed region between nucleotide 9 and 15. Two consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the two ends of the spacer, while three consecutive mismatches are only allowed to occur between the nucleotides at the 3’ end of the crRNA spacer and thus the 5’ end of the target. We consider these data, adjust the model parameters and compare the data to the computed tolerance for mismatches using our model. We find a decent parameter fit by eye to be:
$$ \Delta C = 0.25 \tag{5}$$ $$ \Delta I = 2.5 \tag{6}$$
Figure 3 displays the computed mismatch tolerance for single mismatches, two consecutive mismatches and three consecutive mismatches and shows that single mismatches are not tolerated in the central seed region, two consecutive mismatches are tolerated at the ends of the spacer and three consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the 3’ end of the spacer.
Figure 3: Cas13a tolerance for mismatches. Cas13a tolerance for mismatches ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). The cleavage probability relative to the on-target is plotted for different types of mismatches. Single mismatches (blue line) are"

iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania
Our first collaboration took place in March, when the iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania team  came to Tartu for a visit! They gave us some valuable pieces of advice as to how to successfully manage our whole project. Furthermore, they additionally described the different spheres we ought to pay special attention to i.e. human practices, public relations, modelling ect. For our team’s first iGEM experience this collaboration was very valuable as it gave us a better understanding of what steps we need to take in order to yield a successful project. We briefly discussed their idea for this year's competition. During the collaboration weekend we organized an excursion to the Estonian Genome Center - we had a really informative and science-filled weekend!
Unesp AQA iGEM
In May we got a collaboration request from a Brazilian team and altogether came up with some great collaboration ideas. As UNESP AQA was focusing on Diabetes type 1, we helped them to gather the data comprising Diabetes type 1 frequency, treatment possibilities and costs in Estonia and Europe. Brazilian team helped us with gathering information on ethylene production in Brazil and setting up our crowdfunding campaign. Our collaboration lasted for 2 months via various emails and online calls.
Peshawar iGEM
In the middle of the summer we contacted a Peshawar team and had interesting conversations via Skype calls concerning our projects. From that we gained some useful advice and a good feedback on our concept.
Toronto iGEM
In the beginning of July, the University of Toronto’s iGEM team invited us to participate in their podcast exploring how synthetic biology intersects with different disciplines ranging from engineering, law, business to the arts. We gladly decided to take part in it and on 12th of August, we had a meeting with one of the team leaders from Toronto, in Tartu. We had an interesting conversation during which we introduced our team, project and also discussed the further development and real-world application of our project.
Aalto-Helsinki iGEM
After several Skype calls, on the 24.08 another half of our team travelled to Helsinki to have a bilateral collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki team. We were having problems with our wiki and they prepared a workshop for us on that theme. This workshop was essential for us as we learn how to improve our"

The L.A.S.S.O. could be used as part of a telemedicine system where medical staff can carry out a check up over the internet, similar to a currently running project in Australia2. This is also reflected in the L.A.S.S.O. Interface. At the Cystic Fibrosis Trust conference this year Tim Kelsey, National Director for Patients and Information for NHS England, talked about how “the biggest challenge right now is electronic record keeping in hospitals”. He mentioned that the NHS “don’t have a personalized data system” and highlighted the “safety and imperative of digital records”. As the software shows it is possible to easily create a digital record of a patient's test results allowing for analysis of the trends over time. This could be expanded to look for patterns over a patient's life, e.g. at certain times the levels increase, allowing for the possibility of more informed preventive treatment.
But before the L.A.S.S.O. moves towards becoming a home use device there are ethical issues that need to be answered. A point of concern that was raised by medical staff about the device being used alone by patients would be their reactions when they receive positive results. It could depend on the individual, and their circumstances, what the reactions could be. Example being, if a patient is waiting for a lung transplant and the results show they have contracted Burkholderia cenocepacia, the patient may not then be eligible for their lung transplant and be rather distressed. With no guarantee for a medical professional immediately being available, the device has gone from helping to harming the user. On the other side of it, the patients we talked to were very positive about the results being available. They felt this would help them understand what was happening and be more involved in discussing their treatments. There are pros and cons to how they should be used in the future and this would take further research and testing to decide on the best practice.

Because we use the standardized promoter and RBS in this part, so this part can be used in more expression system and control its expression by ourselves as the decision making output actuator. It may extend the applicability of gvp floating device.

iGEMers of Jilin-China, USTC, BNU and XJTU-China had a nice meeting in USTC. Each team presented their projects and had an extensive discussion about ideas, collaborations details in experiment and modeling, and competition details etc. We learn how to prepare our project and how to present our ideas from the discussion.
CCiC
Location: Shanghai;
Teams: More than 60 Chinese teams
As a communication platform for Chinese synthetic biology enthusiasts, CCiC develops in reform and innovation during 5 years. The 5th CCiC was hosted by ShanghaiTech University. There are more than 60 teams participated in the conference, with more than 500 people. During the five-day meeting, we met and communicated with other iGEMers, exchanging our ideas and experience.
Meanwhile, Vice President of iGEM Miss Meagan Lizarazo and some experienced advisors thought highly of our projects, and provided us a lot of valuable advice. We benefit a lot from this meeting, and based on the suggestions, we changed our track to “Manufacturing” and focus more on D-psicose.
Xi'an meetup
Location: NPU, Shannxi;
Teams: XJTU-China, NPU-China and NWU-China.
This summer, three teams in Shaanxi came together and shared their thoughts in the first stage of the iGEM season. It was a great chance for us to share the sparks we had in brainstorming and the obstacles we met during lab (especially in InterLab, by then), to share the resources we have, and to talk about the experiences we had in building up the team and managing all the experiments
During the meetup, we all shared our conceptions of iGEM projects. After it, NPU and NWU teams have shared their experiences in attending the Giant Jamboree. We have learned some very useful tips in Boston. At last, we shared our thoughts about how to pass our knowledge to younger iGEMers, and how to involve them in our current labs, so that they will be familiar to the protocols when building up a team of themselves.
In summary, it is very important to meet and collaborate with other teams, sharing wonderful ideas and solving the problems together.
Summary
Our product, D-psicose, can be used as a sweetener and has certain medical value. In order to fully understand it, we have done a lot of related work. The communication with experts offered us a opportunity to deep understand the value of D-psicose. To know more about the current market"

Our plasmid is composed of three parts: a promoter and a terminator Biobrick as well as a novel addition to the biobrick library, the phsABC gene that is known to encode Thiosulfate Reductase.
(1) phsABC gene and vector
phsABC in pSB74
This central component encodes Thiosulfate Reductase. The gene phsABC was obtained through Addgene from Dr. Jay Keasling's laboratory at University of California, Berkeley. According to their results, thiosulfate reductase encoded in the plasmid pSB74 showed the highest activity catalytic activity, so we obtained phsABC from the plasmid pSB74.
Table from Keasling’s research: comparison of Thiosulfate reductase activity
Figure from Keasling’s research: Sulfide production by phsABC in various plasmids. pSB74 (orange) showed the highest reactivity.
(2) Biobrick Promoter
Promoter used was designed by Caitlin Conboy and was found within the parts registry. This promoter is a Quad Part Inverter: “that is, a PoPS-based inverter composed of four sub-parts: a ribosome binding site, a coding region for a repressor protein (e.g., lambda cI), a terminator, and the promoter (e.g., pLambda) regulated by the encoded repressor protein.” Research into promoter activity by previous groups has suggested that this promoter has a strong on state with a noticeable  background in the off state .
Promoter B0034
Biobrick Part:BBa_Q04121.
Length 1370 bp
IPTG-induced (regulatory)
(3) Biobrick Terminator The terminator used was the 129 bp BBa_B0015 designed by Reshma Shetty.  It is actually a double terminator composed of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 and the BioBrick assembly scar & was chosen for its reliability and availability.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," or highly efficient binding reactions and, also as you do, include fluorescence, which is always a factor to enhance sensitivity because fluorescence can be measured at very sensitive levels. This is on sensitivity, but the specificity issue is different.
    In developed countries it is important to have species specific detection of Chlamydia. On the one hand it is important that you detect in the patient Chlamydia trachomatis and not another one so you can complete your diagnosis and can adapt the treatment accordingly. But in an area where the trachoma is endemic it is not important to bring the specificity to a certain level, because once you can establish that the patient has chlamydia the treatment will be the same. It will be sufficient for the physician to know that the patient has chlamydia in order to treat the patient properly. So there are certain areas where the species specificity is not such a big issue also in other areas where you have a single chlamydia species present like in certain animal infections.
Kai:
Which animals are affected by zoonotic infections? How are people infected?
Prof. Sachse:
Psittacosis has been there for centuries in South America. This chlamydia infection is by Chlamydia psittaci and is transmitted usually from parrots or other birds to humans. It is an air borne transmission, and can also be transmitted by direct contact between the bird and a patient. After infections the individual develops an atypical pneumonia [...] you see a typical X-ray picture, which is different from other pneumonias. The disease can be cured very quickly using certain antibiotics but the problem in many countries is - if there is no association between the patient and a bird [...] - if this association is not considered the possibility of the atypical pneumonia psittacosis will not be considered and the patient will not be given the right antibiotic. We even observe few fatalities every year, even in developed countries. Just because diagnosis is not done properly. Generally it is a pity that the detection of Chlamydia psittaci is not part of the routine diagnosis in the medical labs, while Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae is part of the routine diagnosis. That's why certain cases can be overlooked. Awareness has been increasing in the last few years but there is still room for improvement. This is psittacosis.
    Another zoonosis is Chlamydia abortus the infection of pregnant women. Pregnant women can be infected by contact with lamming sheep, because sheep are often carriers of Chlamydia abortus"

The Horizontal axis is the time of growth (in days) and the Vertical axis is the OD565 (the maximum absorbance of AMB-1). The AMB-1 enters log phase after about 7~10 days.
We measure AMB-1's growth under OD565, which is the best absorption wavelength for AMB-1. For electroporation operation, it is important to find out the log phase, since it’s the best time for electroporation.   By keeping AMB-1 in ""log phase"" (approximately 3~6 days in Enrich-MSGM, 7~10 days in MSGM), best results of electroporation are achieved. And after seven days, the bacterium would go into stationary phase. During the phase, the growth slows as a result of nutrient depletion and accumulation of toxic products. Growth rate and death rate of bacterium is best likely to meet equilibrium in this stage.

MZHWK Protein Results
Fig 2.Protein Gel of fractionated  MZHWK expressing E. coli. Lane 2 soluble protein fraction, lane 3 urea washing of pellet and lane 4 insoluble pellet) over expressed. MZHWK   is shown here to be the correct molecular size (27kD). Following SDS treatment and boiling this single band remains in high yields suggesting  it has an extremely hydrophobic nature.
This Biobrick construct is a composite part of 5 individual genes.  Each gene encodes a protein which range in size from 4 kDa for the smallest to 9 kDa as the largest. When expressed these proteins combined size   is 27 kDa, which is exactly the size of the protein produced in E. coli containing this plasmid induced with IPTG as it appeared on our SDS-PAGE  protein gel (Fig 1).  We have a single band, expressing at a very high yield, representing a homogenous complex of the 5 expressed protein.
The complex is present as  both a soluble protein and as an insoluble aggregate.  The complex is also extremely stable. We cannot dissociate the individual proteins from this complex in any extreme condition tested (boiling  with 50% SDS and 500mM DTT). We believe this extremely hydrophobic and stable complex could be membrane associated. In addition, digestion with Trypsin and MS proteomic  analysis does not produce any identifiable peptides. This is consistent with the difficulty in ionisation of hydrophobic peptides by MS. In addition,  there are very few Lys or Arg residues producing Tryptic peptides within the size range 700-4000 Da predicted to be produced by any of these proteins.
Trying to understand more about this we spoke to Professor Min Chen, a leading expert in the biochemical mechanisms of photo-regulated processes  in photosynthetic organisms, at The University of Sydney. Prof Chen was very excited to see our results showing the expression and assembly of   this complex. The function of this group of proteins is unclear, but it is suspected that they are important in assembly of Photosystem II,   possibly in the delivery of chlorophyll. Prof Min Chen commented, that the complex, and in particular psbM, is ‘one of the most hydrophobic   proteins known’. Prof Chen also said that the function of the complex may be to bind chlorophyll"
Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," yeast as our controls and other strains of bacteria and fungi as our non-model organisms. We would test out how promoters would differ in their activity across all these strains by the use of GFP.
6/24 Throughout the day, we sent out emails to sponsors for lab supplies. We also worked on a problem that Karthik gave us to do in which we had to construct a plasmid with an origin of replication and a PhoP promoter controlling PFP expression as the insert using iGEM registry parts. We also started cloning with Will.
6/25 We took an inventory of the chemicals we had from before in our lab and of the contents in our freezers. We met with Karthik again to discuss the solution we came up to the problem he gave us to do. In addition, we brainstormed project titles and created a tentative timeline for the summer. Lastly, we read a paper by Paul Freemont of the Imperial College of London that talked in detail about cell free systems being accurate representations of E. coli cells.
6/26 This day had relatively more wet lab work. We started by running PCR, and then running a gel for 1000 base pairs to confirm if the PCR worked. After analyzing our results, we researched promoters that we could potentially use to test for our project. We also searched for professors and labs around campus from which we could get strains of non model organisms. The final task we did was shadow Dr. Jian Li, a member of Jewett lab who showed us how to collect cells for lysate preparation and observation.
6/27 We started our day at the Jewett lab where a grad student, Rey Martin, showed us how to lyse E. coli cells and perform extract. We made another gel and tested for ladders. Meanwhile, some members of the team made M9 media and then autoclaved it. Two of our members met with a representative of IDT to talk about buying their products. Lastly, we continued researching promoters and reaching out to labs asking for non-model organisms.
Week 3
6/30 We met with the professors to further discuss our project and our overall timeline.  We gained information about cell-free systems from the meeting. We also decided not to use fungus as a non-model organism as eukaryotes would make the project overly complex. After, we had a meeting with Joe to talk about mathematical modeling. In our discussion, we also tried to refine and narrow our project idea.

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for our constructs, we have constructed a plasmid with sfGFP fused to the N-terminal tag. When transforming this vector into E.coli along with the pUNI-ABTUNJK vector, we observed high-density fluorescence spots in those cells that expressed both the microcompartment and microcompartment-tagged sfGFP. This is shown in the image on the left, whereas the image on the right shows a control sample without the pUNI-ABTUNJK vector, thus expressing sfGFP evenly in the cell.

(Figure 3 B - Right) Fluorescence image of E.coli transformed with a vector (pOxon1) containing microcompartment-tagged sfGFP only
In order to further our understanding of the systems we are dealing with, we developed the following simulations:
1. Microcompartment Shape Model: (see 'Predicting the microcompartment structure' ) a model that simulates the effect of random point deviations in the microcompartment structure from the perfect icosahedral structure seen in carboxysomes.
Figure 4
The output of the microcompartment shape model is a simulated microcompartment structure (blue) plotted alongside the perfect icosahedral structure of a carboxysome (red) which we used as a starting point for predicting the geometric structure of a microcompartment.
2. Prediction of number of enzymes per microcompartment: (see 'Modelling the number of enzymes in a microcompartment' ) By modelling enzymes as ellipsoids with axis length dependent on the maximum x,y and z dimensions of our enzyme complexes, this was broken down into the well-documented sand-packing problem. This enabled us to predict the maximum theoretical number of enzymes that can be packed into a microcompartment.
3. Effect of microcompartments on collision rates: (see 'Microcompartment rate of collision model' ) By using our stochastic diffusion models and discretizing the motion of our simulated particles, this compared the rate of collision of two particles when spatially constrained within a microcompartment versus in unconstrained motion.
Figure 5
We have plotted the trajectories of two different molecules along random, stochastically driven discretized paths. What we illustrate here is that the rate of collision (marked in red) is substantially increased through the use of spatial constraints.

Electrophoresis for the PCR vials.
Colony PCR: we chose the 4th screened colony (A6-4, lane 5). No amplicons for the almost evaporated reaction (A6-2, lane 8)
Gel results: the almost evaporated reaction (A6-2) did not show any amplicon (lane 8). All the other reactions showed the amplicon with the expected size (~1100 bp).
We chose the 4th colony (A6-4): we filled A6-4 incubated culture with LB + Amp to reach a total volume of 5 ml and let it grow overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 15 ul of these glycerol stocks (to prepare samples for sequencing):

Online survey
To prove the importance and demand of our project, we started an online survey. We sent it to the other iGEM teams and published it on our social media pages. Around 60 users have contributed by answering questions about their lab working habits and TALEs. The first diagram (figure 1 ) shows general user characteristics. The results show us that most users are from the field of biology (55%) and engineering (15%). Only a small number of people come from chemistry, physics, medicine or IT. We can also see (figure 2 ) that 56% are working with bacteria, 13% with human cells, 10% plant cells while the rest work with animal cells, fungi, viruses or phages.
Figure 3 shows you that most people have not used TALEs already. (figure 3 ) The main reason is because they don’t know how to handle them or have no knowledge about the function and design of these special proteins. Other reasons are that TALE’s are not established in their research group or they don’t have the necessary equipment. If they are already using different methods than TALEs to edit genomes, they mentioned CRISPR/Cas9.
In the second part of the survey, we asked participants about the different operation fields and criteria of proteins for a good lab work. (figure 4 ) The average answers are that the detection, modification and purification of DNA are all very important but the main point is the modification of DNA. (figure 5 ) If we compare the four criteria- stability, easy handling, specificity and isolation- for the work with proteins, we can see that stability and specificity are the most important ones.
The outcome of this survey is that with our project we could solve a big problem. Normally, the more specific a protein is the less stable it is however through the stabilization of TALE’s we can have both. The users saw this as well and, the majority said they would work with TALE’s if they would be more stable and usable for in vitro experiences.

NTNU_Trondheim,2014,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Project#Considerations_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA between genomes, and is distinguished from vertical gene transfer were generic material is transferred from parent to offspring. Considering evolution and adaptation, HGT has been essential for the development of the earth’s species to what they are today, but introducing synthesized and genetically modified material into the mix can lead to loss of biological integrity. Moreover, the number and severity of the consequences of introducing synthesized and modified genomes are largely unknown.
While working with the genetically modified organisms in the lab, it is imperative that the accidental release of these organisms from the controlled environment is avoided to the greatest possible extent. This is controlled by strict laboratory routines for working with, and disposing of, GMOs.  Although the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cyanobacteria would struggle to survive outside of the laboratory, precautions were taken when disposing/cleaning of any material containing or been in contact with the GMO.
Before further development of the genetically modified cyanobacteria can be used to fixate carbon in a less controlled environment, it is presumed that removal of antibiotic resistance cassettes from the genome (used to make the initial genetic modifications) would have to be undertaken. Additionaly, a way of preventing HGT from the cyanobacteria to other organisms would be of importance since the strain would carry non-native, synthesized and heavily modified genetic information that could be detrimental to ecological integrity. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the organisms toxicity with the exogenous DNA incorperated into the genome would prevent potential natural catastrophes. Despite this, wild type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a non-toxic, non-pathogenic cyanobacterium which poses no known threat to mammalian health or the environment.

Construct stably transfected HeLa cells!
Introduction
In our project, we have to get rid of gene and DNA that lentivirus has integrated into ours genome by Cas9 protein.
So we select green fluorescent protein gene to simulate gene of lentivirus such as HIV and HBV. Then we stably tranfect GFP into HeLa cells, which represent that the lentivirus genome has integrate into human genome. Then we stably transfect Cas9 gene into HeLa cell, which represent we modified Hematopoietic stem cell and integrate Hematopoietic stem cell with Cas9 gene.
In the experiment we use piggy bac transponase to integrate gene into HeLa cells. Next we integrate Cas9 gene and EGFP gene by PB transposon. Cas9 is under control of Teton 3G promoter, so we can induce expression of Cas9 by treating cells with doxycycline.

FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," increased up to the level of those with biofilm by adding an excess of TiO2. In other words, the biofilm solar cells require less metal oxide semiconductor to provide equal or higher currents. The standard cells (see fabrication procedure in the lab journal) using ZnO and TiO2 provide extremely low currents, which is likely caused by the irregular morphology of their surface after the sintering process. Frequently, the semiconductor layers did not attach properly to the FTO glass, thus reducing the potential currents significantly.
Instead of first growing a biofilm and later adding pre-synthsized ZnO nanoparticles to this system, we chose the different approach by adding Zn(OH)2 as a salt to initiate the biomineralization process. Different concentrations of Zn(OH)2 were added and current was measured with and without sintering the ZnO layer. The results are shown below.
Figure 2: Comparison of biofilm-ZnO solar cells using different concentrations of Zn(OH)2. Photosensitizer = hibiscus tea.  ZnO layer has been formed by biomineralization.
Without sintering, adequate current values close to those of solar cells without a biofilm were recorded. However, sintering the ZnO layer led to a higher current level. For a Zn(OH)2 concentration of 100 mM, a current of 1498 µA was achieved, which is remarkable for any kind of DSSC. Compared to the unsintered cell, this corresponds to an 83-fold improvement.
Solar cells without a biofilm but with fluorescent proteins as photosensitizers have been tested as well. The results are shown below.
Figure 3: Comparison of solar cells without biofilms using hibiscus tea and GFP as photosensitizers. All metal oxide layers have been sintered after addition of TiO2/ZnO nanoparticles.
TiO2 cells using GFP instead of tea performed quite well. The average current and voltage of those cells has been even higher than the average of cells using tea. However, the improvement lies within the standard deviation of TiO2 + tea cells, meaning that it cannot be generalized that GFP is a better photosensitizer than hibiscus tea. When looking at the same cells using a ZnO layer, GFP cells performed very poorly. Here it becomes noticeable that hibiscus tea is simply a better absorber for sunlight than GFP. In sunlight, wavelengths between λ = 500 – 510 nm possess the highest intensity. While the absorbance"

Delft & Aalto Helsinki
Hence our first collaboration, with iGEM Delft would have started way to late in the current competition. We developed further ideas as how to combine projects most of which did not work out, this specific example however is something that we want to share because it would have been amazing and did fail due to one reason alone: The lack of time.
So how did it start? Delft informed us, that they were working on tardigrade proteins in a side project, which can help folding and unfolding proteins during and after states of cryptobiosis. Which essentially means damage through repeated freezing and thawing, clumping and the like are prevented by the proteins.
Aalto Helsinki, who worked on antimicrobial peptides as well informed us earlier, that they didn’t have access to security level 2 labs to test their peptide on real causative agents, so we offered them to test their peptides on some clinical strains that we could work with in our security level 2 lab. Aalto Helsinki told us that they would have problems to send us their peptides due to activity loss and too little time.
Which led to our conclusion to bring both teams together which was the start of a wild ride. After proposing our idea to Delft, they told us that one of their team members would travel to Helsinki in the next couple of weeks in October, which would allow the transportation of the tardigrade proteins to Helsinki. So that Aalto Helsinki could freeze their peptides send them to us so that we could test them on strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
In the end it did not work out, as mentioned above due to a lack of time, but we are still positive that the attempt was totally worth it and want to encourage future iGEM teams to think big, even if it might not work out in the end.
Heidelberg
Since the beginning of our project we experienced difficulties performing gene amplifications. After tedious trial and error using different gradient-PCRs, experimenting with GC-enhancer solutions and DMSO concentrations we figured out a way to amplify eleven out of our twelve genes and gene fragments. The only one that did not function despite our efforts was the AraC family transcriptional regulator. Luckily the iGEM Team Heidelberg offered a PCR First Aid – Service this year which we gratefully accepted. After a skype call in which we described our problem and attempts at solving it in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0."
NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Food Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," fins and scales. From birds, only those not expressly prohibited by the Bible and from the remainder, birds that closely resemble in appearance and behavior those traditionally or historically eaten by Jews. From land animals, only ruminants with split hooves. And from insects, only four species of grasshopper.
• Kosher land animals must be ritually slaughtered.
• Another relevant kosher law is the prohibition against mixing dairy products with meat products.
As possible precedents for this issue there are two cases of food biotechnology that kosher authorities have ruled on in the past: gelatin and cheese. The OU, the world’s largest kosher supervision organization has this to say about the gelatin issue:
""Since “real” gelatin is derived from animal sources, it has been the focus of debate for nearly 100 years among leading rabbis. The question is: Can gelatin from non-kosher sources be permitted? Although cows that were not ritually slaughtered, and, of course, pigs, are certainly not kosher, some rabbis were lenient in allowing products that had very small amounts of gelatin added. This is because they felt that the gelatin extraction process caused the skins and bones to be sufficiently denatured, to the point that they are no longer considered food.""
This is not the mainstream position. It has been rejected by every major kosher certifying agency.
An additional consideration in the gelatin debate was the fact that the gelatin was made from pork bones, a non-food item, and as such would only be subject to a rabbinic, not biblical, prohibition.
As this excerpt suggests, modern kosher gelatin is made only from kosher animals. Either fish or beef serve as the basis for kosher gelatin nowadays, with the further requirement that beef for gelatin is ritually slaughtered. The fascinating upshot of this discussion is that the finished gelatin product is not considered a meat product and is therefore allowed to be used with milk. This precedent does not bode well for the kashrut of in vitro meat product grown from the cells of non-kosher or unslaughtered animals.
The cheese-making enzyme complex, rennet, presents another landmark issue in the kosher regard for biotechnology. The Star-K a major American Orthodox kosher supervision agency describes rennet and its kosher-related traits as follows:
""Rennet is an extract of the fourth stomach of a calf, rich in rennin, an enzyme which is used to curdle the milk in the cheese making process. It makes no difference whether the rennet comes from a non-Kosher species, a non-ritually"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html,"literally). The essential idea is based on bacterial conjugation , where an F plasmid in F+ E.coli is transferred into an F- E.coli. In an experiment done by Berkeley in iGEM 2006 , they took the origin in the F plasmid (which is a signal to transfer the F plasmid from one E.coli to another) and put it in a micro F (mF) plasmid instead, so that the mF plasmid was transferred, and not the F plasmid. Our plan is to extend on this idea by applying oscillation, self-destructive gene and timer, but we are still not sure what research question it can answer. So the idea is there, but we still need to figure out the purpose. :-P

5th June 2009
Dear Diary, did we have a long discussion today! First of all, we determined how to divide the work among us (each one said what his skills were, and we decided who will do what in the project). Obviously, some of us took more managerial positions (taking care of planning, logistics and what not), and some were more on the employer/slave side (Emreh even suggested that a whip might come in handy...)
Later, we discussed the initial steps of working with the self-destructive plasmid, which pretty quickly turned into several simultaneous conversations: whether we should use a selection marker or not (somewhat pointless, since the marker would be already given in the plasmid supplied from MIT), methylation of the plasmid nucleotides (which no one really knew how it is affected after replication of E.coli) and the rate of plasmid degradation compared to gluing them back together. In the end, we gave some tasks out: Daniel was responsible for finding the top 10 restriction sites in the E.coli plasmid, Sriram was in charge of going over the registry of the bio-bricks of iGEM to seek a useful promoter, and Orr would look into methylation in E.coli to expand more on how it works and how it is affected by replication.
In short, much to do, for all of us. LET'S GET WORKING!!! :-D

Brazilian Meet Up
In collaboration with other Brazilian teams USP-Brazil and Unesp_Brazil , and also with former and future iGEM teams, we organized and participated in the Brazilian Meetup: Jamboré Brasuca. This event, named in honor of the Giant Jamboree, is a tradition among Brazilian teams, happening since 2010.
This year, the Jamboré took place at USP-ESALQ (Piracicaba-SP) on March 2nd and 3rd. There, we presented our 2018 project and saw other team projects from 2017 and future ones. Also, we had several lectures with synthetic biology experts including the international speakers Drew Endy, David García Gomez, Thomas Landrain and companies like Braskem and SENAI-CETIQT.
Latin America Meet Up
On early July, the Tec CEM iGEM team hosted a meet up for the Latin America teams. Via Skype, we presented our project's development until that point and received some great feedback.
Many of the comments that were made helped on the improvement of our presentation and our wiki, specially related to the Background and Design of our project.
The event had the participation of 8 teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and México. Also, with these same teams it was created a WhatsApp group for us to keep communicating.
Labs Like you
Tec CEM team also had the amazing idea of creating a parody of “Girls Like You” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5, and invited all iGEM teams to participate. For us, it was a really funny moment that made our iGEM routine happier. These are the teams you can see on the video:

Name: Mike Dorothea
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
She is a very well organised people and very responsible. She always ask us for the content we need to present before the general meeting and then send the email. It is lucky for us to have her to be our secretary. Also, she is good at using photoshop and other software and is willing to teach us to use it. It helps a lot when we need to design a team logo and t-shirt. And she loves singing, she always sing when she is waiting for the PCR or gel.
Name: Olivia Winata
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The Gel Loader. Olivia, or usually called OW, is super helpful and responsible in everything. She is very good in handling any work in the busiest days in the lab, she’s also known as the gel loader due to her talent in it. Her hobby in the lab is filling pipette tips box, while singing. Basically she sings every time there’s any waiting time in doing lab work, even during heat shock or cold shock. Funny thing about her is her panic response. Whenever she suddenly finds out something wrong, she will say “eh.. eh..” with a slightly louder voice.
Name: Raymon Rui Chen
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Raymon spends a lot of time studying and aiding the work in modelling for the tri-stable switch. Moreover, he is always willing to provide help to people who are short in hands. He is the kind of person that you want to work as a partner since he is hard-working and willing to pursuit an accurate and reliable result which often requires more work. All in all, Raymon is a reliable and undoubtedly valuable member to the team.
Name: Sharon Suet Man Lai
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The Laugher. Sharon is a very cheerful and humble person. She is a bit quiet and reserved when you first meet her, but she will be talkative once you’ve known her. She is hard-working when she’s in the lab, but you will only be able to meet her coming in the afternoon (P.S.: she cannot wake up early in the morning). She’s also talented in designing logo and other publication materials.

In particular, GtfB and GtfB seem to be the most important in biofilm production-mutations in the gtfB and gtfC genes disrupted microcolony formation on saliva coated surfaces(Koo et al., 2010). Our idea was to use a bacteriophage (a virus that only infects bacteria) to deliver micro RNAs or small interfering RNAs to silence those genes. One of our supervisors works with phage so she would be able to guide the wet lab team. We opted to silence the toxins rather than kill the bacteria because we wanted a way of preventing glucan formation without disturbing the balance of the oral microbiome
mRNA interference of Clostridium difficile
Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium capable of forming spores (meaning it persists in the environment). Clostridium difficile infection(CDI) is a major infection which causes hospital and community acquired-diarrhoea. It particularly affects those who have long-term hospital stays (especially the elderly), are immunocompromised/immunodeficient (for example due to chemotherapy) and/or are on broad-spectrum antibiotics. CDI has a heavy financial burden-according to Zhang et al. (2017), the annual costs due to C. difficile infections in the US alone are an estimated $6.3 billion with almost 2.4 million days spent in hospitals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1999 and 2007 there was an increase in the estimated number of deaths due to CDI from 3,000 to 14,000 which was seen across Europe and Canada as well (McDonaldet al., 2012; Lessa et al., 2012). This has been linked to a hypervirulent, resistance strain of C. difficile.
Within the SBRC, our supervisors work with a wide range of Clostridial species in the Clostridia Research Group. Unlike with S. mutans, there was more experience within the team and so the supervisors would be able to work with us more closely and advise us on this project.
It was hard to decide between working with Ideonella sakaiensis, Streptococcus mutansor and C. difficile. But in the end, the team voted and chose mRNA interference of C. difficile which became our project; Clostridium dTox.

Compared with the work of 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we find that both of their biobrick BBa_K515102 and our biobrick BBa_K1405004 (originally found in P. aeruginosa and P. putida separately) have chemotaxis towards two kinds of TCA intermediates, malate and succinate (Fig.7 A). Estela Pineda-Molina, et al. reported high-resolution structures of the ligand- binding region of the cluster II McpS chemotaxis receptor (McpS-LBR) of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in complex with malate and succinate (Fig.7 B& C) . The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the malate and succinate cocrystal structure is only 0.2 Å indicating that differences in the nature of the ligand do not significantly alter the protein structure (Table 1). In a sequence alignment of McpS-LBR homologs containing McpS-LBR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the amino acids involved in malate and succinate binding are conserved. R60 is almost fully conserved, whereas the remaining residues are conserved to between 30–80% (Estela Pineda-Molina, et al.)

Malate binds to a cavity formed by α1 and the C-terminal segment of α6, and its coordination is achieved through interactions with R60, R63, R254, and T258 from one monomer and Q65 from the other monomer. Residues R60, R63, and Q65 form part of helix α1, whereas R254 and T258 are part of α6. Succinate binds to McpS-LBR in an almost identical manner as malate. Unlike malate, succinate has no hydroxyl group at C2. Therefore, the two hydrogen bonds that are established between the malate hydroxyl group, and the protein cannot be formed in the succinate structure. The remaining interactions of succinate with R60"

Paris_Saclay,2013,Team:Paris Saclay#PCBs_-_-_TEXT.html,", but are still found in the environment. In water of Seine, PCBs are present in substantial quantities in sediments due to the high molecular weight, but they can also attach to the surface of organic matter, clay, and micro-particles so move to the overlying water when water current suspends those particles.
worldoceanreview.com/wor-1/verschmutzung/organische-schadstoffe/
PCBs in air are from PCBs in soil by volatilization. They deposit on land when it rains or snows. Like PCBs in water, PCBs present in air can also attach to particulate matter. PCBs in air tend to move to colder polar region (high altitude) because of global distillation.
PCBs can also be found in organisms especially in the aquatic system. The lipophylicity of PCBs leads PCBs accumulate in animal fatty tissues, then the quantity of PCBs amplifies by the food chain. After this bioaccumulation of PCBs, the concentration of PCBs in animal or human’s body can be hundred times greater than in the food they eat.
How can PCBs affect our health?
Studies in humans provide supportive evidence for potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects of PCBs. The different health effects of PCBs may be interrelated, as alterations in one system may have significant implications for the other systems of the body.
Non-carcinogenic effects that have been associated with PCBs include acne-like skin conditions in adult and neurobehavioral and immunological changes in children. More precisely, they are:
immune system (suppress the immune system);
reproductive system (decrease in the number of human sperm, increase the rate of sperm deformity, increase the rate of female infertility, decrease the animal fertility, reduce the birth weight);
nervous system (brain damage to human body, restrain brain cell synthesis, developmental delay, reduce the intelligence);
endocrine system (decrease thyroid hormone levels,  make the aquatic animals to feminization);
Other health effects (dermal and ocular effects, liver toxicity).
PCBs can cause cancer in animals and humans. IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) has taken the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as a carcinogen to humans, carcinogenic effect is the major toxic effects represents by the PCBs after reaching a certain concentration in the human body.

Jeffrey Lee
Hello! I am Jeffrey, a rising senior majoring in Biology and minoring in Public Health. I am working with Ben to develop a light regulated transcriptional mechanism. When I’m not spending copious amounts of time in lab, I can be found working on applications for medical school, playing Ultimate Frisbee, tossing frisbees, and any other activity relating to frisbees. I enjoy cooking, reading and late night/early morning runs around campus.
Benjamin Huang
Oh hey there! I'm Ben, a rising sophomore who is planning on majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I am part of the group that is working on gene expression with light. Outside of lab, I am the web designer for our iGEM team. It is the first time I am coding in html and css so there is a big learning curve, but it is a lot of fun regardless. In my free time, I like to go to the gym, watch netflix, and am attempting to learn to cook!
Caroline Focht
Hello there! I'm Caroline, and I am a rising sophomore majoring in chemistry with a biochemistry concentration. This summer, I am working with Richard to get a nif cluster from a cyanobacteria working in E. coli . When not doing lab work, I work on the team's social media presence and outreach program. We're filming a short web series for our YouTube channel, so you should check it out! When I can tear myself away from those things, I enjoy watching period dramas, trying out new restaurants, taking a jog in the early evening, and talking to friends.
Richard Li
Hola! My name's Richard. I am a rising sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics.  I work on attempting to express nif clusters from cyanobacteria in E. coli strains in various environmental conditions. As lab manager of the iGEM team for WashU, I enjoy interactions with scholars in institutions as well as with prokaryotic cells in media. Viewing our team's job as inception of agricultural future, I am glad to"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#News_-_-_TEXT.html," practice task force"" will now meet at another time. Additionally, we will now meet every Wednesday before the general meeting to discuss dry lab work, for example the homepage. To remove the problem that our strains only start to swim after three days of incubation, group 1 decided to ask for other strains in other labs.
12 July 2012,In today’s weekly meeting Christian told us about the European teacher meet-up in Paris.
In today's meeting we had some guests: Christian, a PhD student workin in Heinz´ group and Miguel, an intern, who participated in the iGEM competition last year and won a silver medal with his team! Christian told us about the European teacher meet up and gave us a lot of advises regarding human practice. We are very thankful for their help! Regarding human practice, we decided to discard the idea of the open day as most of the former iGEM projects seem to be hard to copy in a short time. Instead we will now organize a city wide survey to the topic of synthetic biology and a panel discussion with the same topic in which the survey results will be presented and discussed.
Group 1 determined the strain with the fastest movement but movement can only be detected after three days of incubation and no difference between the various promotors for the inserts can be observed. But luckily this is not the case for the Tar inserts! They showed a promotor dependent movement towards tryptone. Group 2 has selected 5 different genes and is now cloning them into the BioBrick vector. Group 3 finished the first round of mutations, but since the yield was very small they will repeat the process.
04 July 2012,Let there be light!
We now have a light microscope in our lab! Now we will be able to determine whether our strains move at all. Group 1 observed directed movement in other strains and is now trying to find out which strain and which promotor is the most suitable for our project. Group 2 will now start selecting other proteins whose overexpression could enhance the swimming ability and clone them into a vector. Group 3 is still working on the mutagenesis of the Tar receptor. Jan had an additional idea for human practice: a radio podcast!

Graph 1. Cell density against EamI concentration (Wild).
Graph 2. Cell density against EamI concentration (Modified).
Complex behavior
In comparisson with the previous behavior, the Complex concentration in the wild cell also tends to reach a stationary value at .1893 (as seen in graph 3), remarkably lower than the observed in the EamI concnetration. Altough it does not seem very relevant, from an initial condition of zero to its stationary state, it does represent an important increase in the P concentration.
Now, in the modified cell (graph 4) this does not happen and instead we observed a slowly increasing behavior that tends to 1.7257x10-5, we can even say that it relatively stays at zero. Under the same contitions of time horizon and cell density range, we again found an inhibited behavior in the modified cell.
In both cases, the Complex will always depend on the EamR protein concentration (RT) because the total number of EamR monomers will determinate the amount of finite complexes that can be formed. In this case the RT parameter was fixed at 0.5, avoiding that the any Complex concentrations exceeded this value.

Intracellular AHL behavior
In the both graphics we observed that the intracellular AHL concentration is influenced by the value of the cell density parameter. But, that the level of influence also is affected by the presence or absence of aiiA gene expression.
In the left graphic, representing the wild cell model, we identified in this particular scenario (with  a cell density range from 0 to 5000) that there is not until the cell density reached a value near to 1800 that the Intracellular AHL concentration increased considerably from zero to 0.7276 . Notice that there is not a stationary value showed in the graphic.
In the right graphic, representing the cell model considering the presence of aiiA gene, the increment of Intracellular AHL concentration is not significant,  as it went from 0.00067 to 0.0017 reaching a value 99.76% smaller than the one obtained without the influence of the aiiA.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg

What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:

All the values are blank subtracted. A titration assay was also done with lower concentrations of probe 1 by means                           of real-time fluorescence measurements with SYBR Green I (not shown here).
Time limitations did not allow us to investigate the whole range of hypotheses, but we are confident that, with further optimization, our detection assay could indeed be successful, as explained in Conclusions/Improvements.
Promiscuous Cas12a activation: probes as a target
After starting testing our amplicons with Cas12a and DNase Alert, we realized that the probe itself (more specifically the product of RCA in the absence of miRNA, i.e. with no amplicon) was triggering the Cas system causing                               a very high fluorescence signal, comparable to the signal obtained for the samples with miRNA (i.e. with probe+amplicon).
As already explained (more details in Detailed Design), both probe 1 (as also the other probes) and its amplicon contain a sequence complementary to the original gRNA, due to the fact that the                               binding of the gRNA was designed to occur on the double-stranded stem part. Nonetheless, since the (single-stranded) PAM sequence was only contained in the amplicon - and not in the probe itself -, we would not have expected                               an activation in the case of the samples with probe alone, due to the fact that the gRNA requires a PAM sequence in the double-stranded target in order to activate Cas12a.
Nevertheless, Chen et al., 2018 demonstrated that LbCas12a can target and cleave also single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA), and that this cleavage is PAM-independent, i.e.                               it does not require the presence of the PAM sequence; the kinetics of DNase Alert cleavage is however less efficient when triggered by ss-DNA targets compared to ds-DNA targets.
Having knowledge of this behaviour, we tried to understand whether cleavage triggered by ss-DNA target could actually explain our unexpected results. We therefore considered the thermodynamic properties of the probes we designed,                               more specifically Boltzmann distribution.
As already specified in the design page, we had already used available servers ( ViennaRNA , MFold ) to verify the secondary                               structure of probes and amplicons and check the absence of unwanted minor secondary structures. Nonetheless, these softwares not only specifically provide the minimum free energy (MFE) structure, but"

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," for sequencing and overnight cultures for ARDam was made for miniprepping.  Transformation plates from yesterday and the day before looked bad. The nonselective plates showed a lot of growth while the selective plates don’t. Seems like we need to do ligations and quickchange again…
Eliot then worked frantically to get something done! He quikchanged MutD, DnaE, MutL and TyrR. Then, he re-ligated UmuD’C and DinB into IPTG+GFP.  Sequencing results:  We have our mutated samples of mMutL, mMutY and mMutS and AroF+mCherry+mMutH! There was an extraneous mutation in TyrR that we used for all the ligations though. Fortunately, one of the templates (PT3) has a silent mutation. We could continue using this and make new quikchange templates of TyrR.
Wednesday
Sent in ARMEmrR and ARMDam for sequencing! However, overnights of ARMDam appear to have no growth...Made overnights again for miniprep and glycerol stocks. WE FOUND A GLYCEROL STOCK FOR THE ARM BACKBONE!! Quickly plated them for miniprep.
Thursday
ARMDam overnights finally have growth! Glycerol stocks made and miniprepped. Checked the mutation rate assay plates but not all of the selective plates have growth. We’ll check them again tomorrow! Made overnight cultures of XL1-B and JW-1316-1 for competent cells and ARM backbone for miniprepping. Also digested and ligated mMutY and mMutS into ARM backbone with 5:1 ratio. We ran out of competent cells so we’ll transform the products once the competent cells are made!
Friday
Miniprepped ARM backbone from yesterday’s overnight cultures. XL1-B and JW-1316-1 were cultured and competent cells were made. What a long day in the cold room! The cells were tested for their transformation efficiency using the iGEM kit.  Quikchanged MutL, MutD, DnaE and TyrR. Ligations from yesterday and these quikchanged products were transformed into competent Xl1-B and plated.
Saturday
Transformation efficiency of our competent cells is approximately 2X10^6. Hmmm it’s a bit lower than what we want but we’ll just go with it.  More overnight cultures of the mutators on IPTG+GFP were made for the mutation rate analysis!

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," 11 shows that E. coli DH5α with the construct PA2652 is capable of chemotactic response towards L(-)malic acid. Due to the quantitative nature of the assay, we can also see the extent to which cells perform chemotaxis towards a chemoattractant. The highest response towards attractant can be seen at 1 mM malate concentration. Also we can conclude that bacteria without construct are not capable of performing chemotaxis towards malate as the cell count of the control did not increase at any of tested malate concentrations. This shows the functionality of our construct ( BBa_K515102 ).
Figure 12: BD FACScan could be used to improve data collection from the capillary assay. (Image by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
After confirming that our construct works, we want to test whether our E. coli cells can respond to concentrations of malate released by the roots. The concentration of malate released from the root depends on soil acidity, which in turn is linked to soil NO3- levels. In alkaline soils (low in NO3-) plants have unbalanced excess cation uptake[4]. In this case the concentration of malate released from the roots is 10-6 M. In neutral soils, where plants have balanced cation/anion or in acidic soils, where plants have unbalanced excess anion uptake, the concentration of malate secreted is lower[5].
We are currently testing the chemotactic response of our chassis to physiologically relevant malate concentration levels below 10-6 M. To obtain these results we have reassessed the data collection method based on flow cytometry, because this should speed up the process of data collection and accuracy. To distinguish our bacteria from the background particles we have cotransformed our chassis with a low copy plasmid pTAC1 containing GFP, so our cells can be uniquely visualised using flow cytometer even if their size is similar to the size of backround particles. Hopefully this new strategy will produce results for presentation in Boston.

Through widespread interviews, we have sought to validate our business hypothesis with the purpose of generating evidence of the needs, pains, and gains of our customers as well as the proposals they can come up with, these last ones commonly called value propositions.
Once we finished the stage of interviews, we have been able to identify all the key pain points of our customers, not only their hassles and worries but also their mechanisms of action against this pathogen.
Throughout this process, our initial hypothesis has constantly been changing until we reached a point where we obtained coherent parameters. At this point, an important tool was implemented to generate this data, Canvas. The de facto tool used to describe the activities of new start-up businesses using the Lean Method and existing businesses as well as proposed new business transformations. Most pitches for start-up investment use this model for the key points, to illustrate prospective investors.
Based on the business model canvas, we split our business model into seven parts:
After a long process in which we identify all the key factors of our customer segment supported by Canvas tool, we verified the three key pains of most of our customer segments within the agricultural community are:
High prices of antibiotics related to fire blight
Low efficiency of products on sale
The time lapse in which the product is active is relatively short.
Our archetype interviews clarify the pains felt by our customer segments, these interviews were our key factors to determine the value propositions of our product as well as the acquisition of the knowledge of what we intend to solve with our product which are the last 3 pains listed at the beginning.
In order to ensure the viability of our product, a session with the major leader of apple production and distribution in Latin America “La Norteñita” took place, we discuss and got into the same argument; the high efficiency of a product and a profitable investment are the most important keys to get into the industry.

Introduction
In Singapore, a nation-state with a population of 5.5 million, 37 people are diagnosed with cancer every day. It is estimated that in 2015, over 13,000 people were diagnosed with cancer, and this number has been increasing since 2010 (Raymond et al., 2016). Singapore’s Ministry of Health often issues guidelines and support tips on how to combat or deal with the illness, in terms of finance, family and overall psychological well-being.
The standard method by which doctors determine the specific kind of cancer present in a patient, is via a biopsy - the removal of tissue from any part of the body in order to examine it for the presence of cancer cells. Biopsies tend to be highly invasive and lengthy, and may also may result in complications. Current methods of non-invasive biopsies are now being pursued; an example would be the European project LiqBiopSens that is developing a liquid biopsy technology for the early detection of colorectal cancer (Williams & Segal, 2016).
Our Project: The RIOT System
The RIOT System provides an incentive of having a reduced cost and potentially provides better efficiency in cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly in lesser developed countries where facilities and medical technologies are limited or not present at all. The system is suitable as a diagnostic tool and its financial sustainability and easy mobility allows it to work well as a business, as outlined in our business plan. This gives it the capacity to perhaps reach out to these lesser developed parts of the world in the future.
However, we anticipated that the public might be averse toward using bacteria as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool, due to its role in disease. It may not appear natural to many people to inject bacteria as a means toward curing an illness, rather than causing it. Therefore, the team believes that it is important to explore the Human Practices with regard to public perception of such a system"

The sample was allowed to return to room temperature before it was ligated by mixing 1µL 10µM annealed oligos and 50ng/µL of digested construct with T4 DNA ligase (#M0202). Reaction was setup according to the manufacture's protocol. 1µL ligation mix was transformed into chemical competent NEB DH5α E. coli cells (#C2987) according to the manufacture's protocol. Transformants were selected overnight on LB agar plates containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol.
Transformants with the cycloviolacin Y1 or tyrocidine split-intein casette were selected and grown overnight in 3mL LB media containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol. Plasmids were purified using Qiaprep spin columns (#27104). The expression casette was combined with promoter BBa_J23101  from Anderson's promoter library. BBa_J23101 was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and the split-intein expression cassette was digested with EcoRI and XbaI for 15 minutes and subsequently heat-inactivated at 65ºC for 5 minutes. The digested expression cassette and BBa_J23101 was mixed with T4 DNA ligase in 1:3 and 1µL ligation product was transformed into chemical competent NEB DH5α E. coli cells, as previously described. Transformants were selected overnight on LB agar plates containing 6µg/mL chloramphenicol.

Table 4
Delay ${{\rm{t}}_0}$ for bacteria with different TA system at different concentration of inducer.
At a same inducer concentration, a shorter delay ${{\rm{t}}_0}$ indicates a higher efficiency of antitoxin. From table 3, we can conclude that the corresponding antitoxin of toxin 6249 is most efficient.
Secondly, we add aTc at a concentration of $1.7\text{ }\!\!\mu\!\!\text{ g}/\text{mL}$ and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at different time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig. 8.

Table 5
Delay ${{\rm{t}}_0}$ when inducer is added at different time.
The result shows that a much longer time is needed for bacteria to overcome the effect of toxin, if antitoxin is induced later than toxin. On the contrary, bacteria are not influenced by the toxin inducer when antitoxins are expressed earlier.
From another perspective, we can see that toxin 134 is inactivated before the antitoxin is induced by IPTG, which is because the leakage of antitoxin promoter or the instability of toxin. It takes the longest time for bacteria cells to overcome the effect of toxin 6249 after antitoxin is induced, therefore toxin 6249 is most toxic and also stable.
From the analysis mentioned above, we can conclude that toxin 6249 is most toxic and stable, its antitoxin is most efficient in neutralization as well. Thus, toxin 6249 is our final choice. The demonstration above shows how to select an appropriate TA block with the mathematical model.

As always, the ligation product was tested with the colony PCR and the positive colonies were inoculated to extract the plasmids. The final BioBrick was tested with an EcoRI/PstI cut, giving our insert long 921 bp, whilst the plasmid is 2000 bp (see figure below).
To make LAS- ""n""lator suitable for our system, this plasmid was ligated to the PromLasR - TraI BioBrick and inserted into the kanamycin resistant vector pBBR1MCS-3.
Generation of: PromLasI - RBS - TraI - Terminator To build this plasmid we used the following parts:
    -  Promoter Las R regulated BBa_R0079 - 157 bp
    -  RBS BBa_B0034 - 12 bp
    -  TraI from A. tumefaciens (New!) -  639 bp
    -  Terminator BBa_B0015 - 129 bp The BioBricks BBa_R0079, B0034 and B0015 were resuspended and transformed into DH5α cells. The PromLasR was digested with EcoRI/SpeI and checked on gel electrophoresis. The purified fragments were ligated upstream of the EcoRI/XbaI-digested RBS and then transformed into DH5α. Then a colony PCR was run to check the transformed colonies (primers: Vf2 & Vr). The protocol used was the following: 93° 5' | 25x(93° 30"" | 50° 30"" | 72° 40"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ The positive colonies were expanded, their plasmids extracted and then linearized with a SpeI/PstI digestion.
Meanwhile, a PCR amplification of TraI was made from the gDNA of A. tumefaciens with TaqPol, following this PCR protocol (oligos on parts page): 95° 5' | 10x(93° 30"" | 56° 30"" | 72° 40"") | 23x (93° 30"" | 65° 30"" | 72° 40"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ The TraI amplification, to which the EcoRI and P"

With the Flight iGEM, each member ot a team will be able to participate in their wiki creation.
No matter where you are, you will be able to update the contents of your wiki online. 
Your files can be uploaded to the official server of the iGEM directly through Flight iGEM.
With the contents for wiki and a template you have designed in advance, Flight iGEM can generate a wiki for you automatically.
With the help of Flight iGEM, we hope that all the iGEM teams can say goodbye to the “code soup”. For more details, please visit our page for Flight iGEM .
Collaborations
During the CCiC summit, we happened to know the vector pBBR1MCS-5 we are using in our project is an urgent need for the team NUDT_China. We sent them the plasmid immediately after the summit, and they sent us the vector pBBR1MCS-2 in exchange.
This year, our team has developed an online platform named Flight iGEM which can help all the iGEM teams to simplify the procedure of wiki building.(See more details about  Flight iGEM ) With Flight iGEM, each member of a team will be able to participate in their wiki creation, and this will significantly increase their efficiency. We introduced this wonderful platform to other iGEM teams during the CCiC summit. Many teams showed great interests in it, indicating that they were willing to use it. This platform has already assisted the team NUDT_China with wiki creation. We sincerely thank them for their suggestions on the improvement of our platform. (See their wiki here)

Transformation can be a major roadblock in assembling DNA constructs.  Ligations can be hard to transform, especially with large inserts.  DNA blotted on paper from the registry tends to be even harder.  We have had a great experience with the following protocol from Inoue, getting near lawns of transformants from ligations:
Based on the OpenWetWare page: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Preparing_chemically_competent_cells_(Inoue)

Results
The homology search showed that some of our effector proteins have very closely related proteins with a known structure. For example there are very similar protein structures available for the SypCatcher, PP1 and GFP each with identities of over 90%. Some other effector proteins such as XylE, Laccase or the DDT Dehydrochlorinase have less homologous proteins, whose structures still give good hints on structural questions. However there are also effectors where only badly matched structures are known, which can only be used as a very rough indication of the fold. The NanoLuc luciferase, which is a highly engineered protein derived from shrimps and was only published this year, is an example of a protein with no known structural homologue.
The structures obtained here were used to design our experiments. A homology"

Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.
Our lab workers have three years experience in undergraduate laboratory work and are familiar with basic safety requirements such as lab coats, gloves, etc. We have been instructed in correct disposal procedures for everything we use: physical items generally go to be autoclaved.
Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?  If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
The relevant laws in the United Kingdom are found in the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 .
Ideas
Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or security issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?

A word of advice from 2010 Korea University iGEM team members
- Think again about the meaning of Synthetic Biology. Stick to this concept and try to come up with an idea.
- Come up with ideas that may potentially be useful and have a value as itself.
- Don’t be too held up with coming up with new ideas. You can always use existing ideas and be creative with them. Or, you can also try to prove that same result can be obtained through a different process.
-Simple detection is NOT original. Approach same subjects from different perspectives.

Group 1
1. Hydrocarbon absorption
Because it is hydrophobic, it will not be difficult for it to diffuse through the membrane and the cell wall.
Other teams for example: used AlnA ptn to increase alkane solubility.
AlkB2 and ladA were used as transporters. We can try to knock-out those genes that enable microorganisms to degrade alcohol to keep the alcohol stored within them.
Suggestion 1) HAE1 gene, AcrAB genes are an option
Suggestion 2) Increasing absorption rate: increase metabolic rate to speed up the rate at which alkane is degraded.
Suggestion 3) Instead of looking for a suitable transporter, focus on increasing efficiency in synthesizing and extracting wax.
2. Determine the types of enzymes in E.coli
3. Study about alkane monooxygenase

Culture C.crescentus and Ecoli.S17-1 overnight with the liquid medium.When the OD of C.crescentus reaches 2 and S17-1’s reaches 0.5,we can stop cultivating.
Mix S17-1 and C.crescentus  in a volume ratio of 2:1.Centrifuge it with 4000r/min and suspend the thallus again with 200μl LB liquid medium.
Spread out an 0.45μm nitrocellulose filter on the LB solid medium without antibiotics.
Spread the mixed bacteria liquid in step 2 onto the filter and incubate it at 30℃ for 3-7h.
After incubation,elute the thallus from the filter with 200-1000μl LB liquid medium.
Spread it on the PYE solid medium with antibiotics and incubate it at 30℃.Then we can get the C.crescentus with the target vector.
Conjugation of red light sensing-imaging system
We transfer the red and blue luminous plasmid following the conjugation protocol. [Pic][Pic]
Verification of C.crescentus
We use Gram Staining to verify the C.crescentus:
Prepare thin smear bacteria on a clean slide.
Cover the smear with few drops of crystal violet for 1-2min.
Wash excess strain with water.
Add few drops of iodine solution on the smear for 1-2min.
Rinse in water.
Wash with 95% ethanol for 20s.
Rinse in water.
Stain with 1% safranin for 2-3min.
Wash stain in excess water.
Look at it under a microscope.
Regular Protocols
Gel Electrophoresis
Standard 1% agarose gel
(Generally, 0.7%~2% agarose gel is  widely used in lab)
Measure out 1g agarose in scale, and then put the sample into conical flask.
Add 100mL 1XTAE into conical flask"
