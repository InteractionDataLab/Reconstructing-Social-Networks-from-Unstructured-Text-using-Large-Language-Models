Note: Using more elution buffer will increase overall yield of DNA but will result in final solution of eluted DNA being less concentrated.
Tip: To increase the yield, use 20 uL of Michelle’s Zymo Elution Buffer instead
Tip: To decrease chemical contamination from ethanol, after step 13 spin the tubes with the filter for 1 min at 13,000 rpm without the lid in order to evaporate ethanol from the filters

Therefore, we contacted with the Zhejiang qiumei food CO,LTD, which is the leading enterprise of Zhejiang province. Its pickle products once won the “The best agricultural products”, rewarded by the Zhejiang Department of Agriculture.       We were invited to the headquarters of Zhejiang Qiumei Food CO,LTD, and visited their integrated modern product shop.       After comprehending the idea of our experiment, the boss of the company told us that this is a feasible method, and she is looking forward to a further and deeper cooperation.
We also formed a strong partnership, and obtained major sponsorship which supported our project. SHOUT FOR QIUMEI FOOD!       Several lab assistants introduced to us by the boss promised to give us further technical support.
July 18th - 22nd, 2017
Visit to Qiumei's Lab
We came to the lab in  Center of Qiumei Food CO,LTD, and had a discussion on several issues in the pickle's production process. Knowing that under the enforcement of the Food Safety Law, there is no nitrite exceeded pickle products on market anymore. We obtained the concentration curve of nitrite(during the producing process).
According to the chief engineer, we knew that the ultimate pickled products would be in accordance with the existing food safety standard. So we had to change our experiment goal—final chassis will be B.Substilis. Luckily, we found out that although the nitrite level in pickles is below the standard, the degrading process is time-consuming, thus it is still very useful to develop enzymes to decompose the nitrite and accelerate the producing speed.
Second visit to Qiumei's Lab
We went to the laboratory again for farther understanding. We realized that the peak period of the concentration of nitrite is 4 to 9 days, and then it decompose naturally as inverse function form. Under the regular production process, the flavor of pickles is as same as the final product in 13 days; however, because of the excessive nitrite, the pickles cannot be listed on the market. Our method, of which our enzyme could digest efficiently, which brings no harmful effects, is explained to the engineer. The chief engineer is amazed by our product. After applying our product, the production cycle of the pickles is cut down from more than 50 days to within 15 days.
We also learnt that the bacteria this company utilizes during the pickling process would spontaneously convert nitrate to nitrite, which ulterior"

For fear that our PstI cutting enzyme would cut the wrong place, we mutated the two PstI cutting sites.After mutation, we split eIF4A ( BBa_K411100 ) at 215&216th amino acid.
The template of eIF4A on a pGEX-4TI vector was kindly provided by Pro.C.Proud.
Fusion parts
GFP fusion system
We fused the split-GFP part with split-eIF4A part via PCR to get two sequences: split-GFP-A+linker+split-eIF4A-A( BBa_K41111 )and split-GFP-B+linker+split-eIF4A-B( BBa_K11102 ) We then added terminators in the back of both sequences and inserted them into one plasmid.
The picture shows the templates of PCR potocol. The split-GFP part and split-eIF4A part both have complementary linker sequences, which will anneal during the PCR process.
RFP fusion system
Similarly, we fused the split-RFP part with split-eIF4A part via PCR to get two sequences:split-RFP-A+linker+split-eIF4A-A ( BBa_K411103 )and split-GFP-B+linker+split-eIF4A-B( BBa_K411104 )
aptamer
We performed PCR to get the required aptamer based on sequence showed in the paper (Valencia-Burton et al., 2007).
We first designed primers by adding a prefix in the front of the aptamer sequence and a suffix at the end of the aptamer sequence. We digested the aptamer with Xbal&PstI cutting enzymes and the pLac with Spal&PstI cutting enzymes. We then used ligase to join them together.
Advantages
1.Tests the promotor strength in a speedy way.
Conventionally, inducible promoter strength is tested by a reporter gene (e.g. GFP) downstream from the promoter. To do know, one needs to wait for protein folding (four hours for GFP). In our design, we can test the promoter strength at the mRNA level and only needs 3 min for the split GFP to reconstitute into functional protein.
A strong promoter will result in more RNA aptamers. The more RNA aptamer, the more our split GFP will combine to emit a stronger fluorescence. With a weaker promoter,"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Biocontainment_-_-_TEXT.html,"ive the only place BeeT is capable of surviving in.
Even though the biocontainment of this organism is assured, heterologous DNA may remain in the environment. Since DNA is rather stable under certain circumstances 2 , there is a risk it is taken up by other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer 3 , 4 . In our project, we proposed to complement the biocontainment strain by creating a switch to cleave heterologous DNA, depending on the presence of BipA. Additionally, auxotrophy for BipA can be further strengthened by targeting genomic DNA as well.
Using Cas9 to Reinforce Auxotrophy
To create the switch, we aimed to engineer Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9Cas9 is a well-studied nuclease that is involved in bacterial adaptive immunity . Wildtype Cas9 has the ability to make double-strand DNA breaks, guided by a small RNA (gRNA) that has a sequence complementary to the target DNA. 5 to undergo the change from catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to partially active Cas9 (nCas9) when BipA is not available. nCas9 can be made by changing either one of two residues important for cleaving to alanine: the Asp10 residue or the His840 residue. nCas9 can still make single-strand DNA breaks, or nicks. However, it has been shown that nCas9 is able to cause double-strand DNA breaks when gRNAs are available to nick DNA on opposite strands in close proximity 6 .  If both Ala10 and His840 are replaced by alanine, all cleaving activity is lost, resulting in dCas9 7 .
In this project, we replaced the codon for Asp10 (GAT) of the His840Ala-version of nCas9 to the TAG stop codon. We gave a new function to this codon by providing the translation machinery for it: a tRNA that recognizes the TAG codon (tRNACUA) and an amino-acyl-RNA-synthetase (aaRS) that charges the tRNA either with BipA 8 (resulting in a new version of dCas9: dCas9-Ala10BipA(TAG)) or aspartate 9 (resulting in nCas9, or in our case nCas9-Ala10Asp(TAG)). Normally the TAG stop codon is recognized by Release factor 1, thereby terminating translation 10 . For this reason, we used a genetically recoded strain that lacks any TAG stop cod"

Extreme genetic engineering: an introduction to synthetic biology by the ETC Group
There seems to be so many different areas of research that are considered synthetic biology.  Which areas apply to iGEM and which area(s) will the VCU team be involved in? - GMcArthurIV 16:44, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
The New Synthetic Energy Agenda section on page 27 reflected the type of work the VCU team will be doing.  The cellulose to biofuel and bio remediation to biofuel projects would fall well under this area of syn bio.  Obviously our projects will pertain to biofuel production but the section regarding synbiosafety cannot be ignored - Bussingkm 21:34, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
What you've mentioned certainly fits within the scope of the research currently going on in the Systems Biological Engineering Lab, but let's talk a bit more broadly.  This paper lists five major research areas in synthetic biology: minimal cells, assembly-line DNA, artifical cells, pathway engineering and novel genetics.  Which areas do you think we could or will be involved in? - GMcArthurIV 00:08, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
As you could guess from my comment below, I think the effects of the cellular ""environment"" on the functions of individual genetic parts is fascinating and of critical importance, in the same way that your boundaries must be defined for any engineered system.  To this end, I think the minimal genome work is very interesting.  In what situations is it better (or not) to pay attention to all the varied species nature provides us rather than engineering rational systems in the carefully designed, minimal environment provided by a minimal or artificial cell?  My work with thermocellum and the lab's work in general with T. fusca and others tends to rely on existing systems.  At what point do we scrap all that and build the pathways we want into a blank or"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Figure 1: All the awesome people from the Nordic Jamboree. You guys rock!
A huge part of iGEM is collaboration and open source community. In the spirit of iGEM, we went to Lithuania from the 1st to the 3rd of June to help the Vilnius iGEM Team getting started on their project. Through the experience of former SDU-Denmark iGEM team participants, we were able to aid the Vilnius University with their very first iGEM team. We intoduced them to techniques for organizing the lab work, how to navigate and use parts registry, how to interpret the iGEM medal recuirements, wiki tips, and important iGEM deadlines.
Figure 2: The silver medal was earned by helping the 2015 iGEM Team from d'Aix Marseille Université by sharing their survey on chewing gum.
While pursuing the goals for our project we collaborated with other iGEM teams and participated in both a Danish and a Nordic Meetup.  The Danish Meetup was hosted by the DTU iGEM Team. This meetup took place the 24"

The listed complementary primers added, besides the Freiburg-suffix, a two amino acid glycine-serine-linker to the end of the CBDs. This is a very short linker, but as GFP-experts and publications described GFP and CBDs are very stable proteins and should cope with a very short linker. The benefit of a short linker is that protease activity is kept minimal.
The GFP <partinfo>K863121</partinfo> used in the assay was an alternated version of the <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo>. The primers that were made added a Freiburg-pre- and suffix to the GFP coding sequence and a His-tag to the C-terminus to get it purified for the measurements. This part <partinfo>BBa_K863121</partinfo> (GFP_His) should be easily added to the CBDs and assembled to the fusion-proteins <partinfo>BBa_K863103</partinfo> CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His and <partinfo>BBa_K863113</partinfo> CBDclos(T7)+GFP_His.

Since a His-tag was added to the end of the GFP, an alternate version of the <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo> had to be made to compare binding of GFP with and without CBD. Therefore, a forward primer was made, to amplify the whole <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo> with the GFP_His_compl-primer to add the His-tag to the C-terminus.

Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," rest of the    conversation was dedicated to devising solutions to these challenges. Firstly, it is important that    the synthetic biology community finds a suitable definition for its work which would be agreed by    all of its members. The second focus shall be improving education at the undergrad level to increase student interests in synthetic biology. All the iGEM teams present were very eager to share their    experiences in recruitment and outreach, members from the University of Western have especially    shared their path of creating a program for synthetic biology at their university. The discussion    was concluded with remarks on actions to be taken to gather resources and suggestions for future    Canada-wide conferences.

Directed Evolution: Queens iGEM & Stony Brook iGEM Collaboration
This project sought to perform some sort of directed evolution on our constructs. While    reading about other team’s projects, we came across a fellow iGEM team located at Stony Brook University    in New York was evaluating the use of directed evolution of Synechococcus elongatus to create    sustainable sucrose feedstocks for ethanol biofuel production. This discovery created the basis for    further discussion about which protocols are most efficient when performing directed evolution. Upon    speaking with our fellow iGEM team, we learned about other directed evolution techniques, such as UV    mutagenesis and phage assisted continuous evolution. With these ideas in mind, we collectively decided    that other teams may also be trying to determine the most effective type of directed evolution for    their project and thought we could combine each of our groups’ knowledge and experiences to aid future    iGEM teams. We believe that an effective route to convey this information would be in the format of a    short, detailed video, that both of our teams could collectively contribute to, as well a pamphlet    highlighting a variety of directed evolution techniques, available resources and current literature.
Check out our Directed Evolution pamphlet below and download it here.

Even cancer cells collaborate so that they can invade our bodies and spread their wrath. For us, collaboration is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries in the medical and scientific field.And it is the superpower that we can all turn to to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves,that will help make the world a better place. Collaboration is the superpower that our team turn to, to help us fight cancer. And we are confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
iGEM is a great platform for us to improve ourselves. Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. Not only we can gain experiences from our own project, but also by learning from other teams to spark more innovative inspiration. Throughout the course of our project, we interacted with many teams and helped each other out in meaningful ways. Here is a record of ours collaborations.
XI’AN JIAOTONG - LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY (XJTLU )
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the XJTLU  iGEM  team. Together, we gave feedback on each other’s projects face to face in Shanghai’ s meeting.They helped us have a deeper understand of Model, and offered their suggestions about  our project design. And also, we proposed ours  idea about how to characterize their biobricks. Except the verbal communication, we do have experimental collaborations. As both our projects are related to exosome, which functions as a vehicle to carry target particles, we offered our exosome-booster biobrick when they get stuck in its construction. At the same time, they helped us finished our exosome-booster’s efficiency model. More details for model ,please click here
Nanjing Agricultural University (NAU-CHINA)

Human Practices
14/03/12. Started mailing.
We started to discuss the aim of the human practices team and its role in iGEM projects.
23/03/12. Skype meeting with Ana and Dorothy:
Brainstorming ethical issues. We came up with the idea of shooting a short film.
1. The movie is a 'medium' to do ethics. So, the first thing you would need to do is to decide which ethical issue(s) is important for you.  2. Then, you will have to decide what story is best to articulate that ethical issue(s) 3. When you make your script, you need to have clear in your mind what the 'use' of this movie will be: are you finally going to show it to the public to trigger ethical debate? or will you give it another use? The point is: movies are always made to address a certain audience and to cause a certain effect on those audiences, keep this in mind!  4. Finally, please take into consideration that this is a low-cost project: needs to be cheap and short. Cheap: like I say, the cheapest is that you use what you have that is yourselves and what you can produce. Images retrieved from visual archives are often expensive. Timing: In my mind the movie should last between 3-7 min.
From last meeting onwards:
-We discussed ethical issues related to our project.   -We studied those issues and gathered information about them. Scoping exercise: it consists in scoping and mapping a number of ethical and social issues that are relevant for our talking bacteria project.   -As a source of inspiration we watched several films from the Synthetic biology film festival  -Ana talked to Artefactando, who will give us a hand shooting the film. -We are planning a meeting on 31st May (with Ana in person!) and shooting sessions on July.

The Petri dishes were incubated over night at 33 °C. 5. The colony with the fastest swimming behavior was identified according to the size of the halo. 6. The yellow Eppendorf pipet tip was cut at its first mark with sterilized scissors. 7. Agar pieces at the marked sites were cut out using a shortened tip, respectively. 8. The pieces of agar were placed in a glass test tube or an e-cup with or without the tip. The cultures were incubated for at least one hour at 37 °C with 180 rpm. 9. The cultures were spun down for 10 min at 1.5k X g. 10. 8 x 12 cm plus one control Petri dish were filled with 0.3% tryptone swimming agar, a 2 x 2 cm Whatman paper was soaked with an attractant and placed in the center of the agar plate. 5 µl of the resuspended (as described above) pellet was dropped on the agar three times, the strain containing the parent plasmid was dropped once and marked as “Ref.” 11. Steps 5 to 10 were repeated another two times. 12. A 10-2 dilution of each culture was plated on LB-agar containing chloramphenicol and incubated over night at 33 °C. The clones were used to inoculate an overnight culture from which a plasmid preparation was conducted. The plasmid DNA was sequenced subsequently.
In figure 2B, exemplary pictures of a round of selection are shown. Swimming on tryptone agar could be observed every time after one overnight of incubation at 33 °C, but the observed halos at the different attractants varied in size. The halos had mainly a roundish shape and no direct chemotaxis effect towards the attractants could be identified. The reference strain, containing the parent plasmid of the mutagenesis library, also swam but never as fast as the cells containing the library. The"

2.How can we recycle Tb3+ from the recycled REEBOTs? Maybe we can extract them (Tb3+) by some chemical solutions, and then purify them by replacement reaction or others.
3.We can optimize the pmrC promoter and triple LBT by modeling and doing some orthogonal experiments. Besides, we should consider how to improve the efficiency of the sitag by designing the shape of our silica board. The suggestions given by Prof. Chen brought us a way to enhance our REEBOT system, which directly advanced our project progress.

Specifically, water monitoring is focused on assessing the nature and extent of contamination from oil sands waste in the Athabasca watershed. Currently, water is sampled on a monthly basis to test quality at multiple sites, with a few automated sondes beginning to be installed.
While this new plan seeks to address many of the concerns raised by the WMDRC, it can still be significantly improved by efforts like our own. Specifically, our sensing platform is continuous, long-term, and can be implemented relatively cheaply, allowing for more deployment sites. In addition, biosensing in general is highly specific relative to chemical methods, and biological systems can be refined to be highly sensitive and have very low limits of detection (this flexibility is not necessarily afforded by chemical methods). Our device also can submit data wirelessly to a remote server, allowing for automated collection of data. Our vision for this device is to create a sensor network that collects continuous data, with identical, well-calibrated sensors whose data can easily be compiled into one consistent database for subsequent analysis. This network would account for short- and long-term trends and allow for any necessary adjustments to spatial distribution.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#28 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," attempted to write something on what the results tell us, I got stuck. I have included what I wrote at the end of the update.
APEGGA article
I wrote up my section and sent it to Carol and Chinee. We’ll put everything together tomorrow.
Main points in my discussion section
Original purpose of project: develop a BBk form of a gene that codes for a mutant protein that can be used to test our BioBricked version of the AI-2 system (originally from V. harveyi and soon to be in E. coli).
We have developed 3 biobricked versions of that gene, which can be used in conjunction with LuxOD47E for testing
It is useful to have the 3 versions in case somebody else wants to use the functional unit as a whole, or alternatively choose their own promoter/terminator sequences
What's next: precisely where this biobricked gene will be useful
More on what's next: characterisation and modelling of circuit behaviour!
Other potential applications  is there another use for a protein with this shape? Can we tie in the alanine mutation that makes most proteins defective, especially when it replaces an amino acid with a large and/or charged functional group?
Evaluation of challenges in the experiment: not every cloning attempt was successful and we had problems with negative control contamination. Is there a credible way to explain why?
Be sure to mention what this will contribute to the scientific community (this is probably tied into the reason why we want 3 biobricked versions
etc...

Abstract
CdS is a kind of Ⅱ-Ⅵ type semiconductor which is well studied previously, that can guide our experiment to optimize the system efficient by modeling .In this part, we'll show some factors affecting the electron flux transformed into E.coli. and come up with some practical strategies to improve the efficiency of our system.
Basic theory
Carriers density:
According to quantum theory, states of electrons could be described by energy band:
Fig. 1 | The distribution of energy level and the process of creating free electrons
Ef is Fermi energy,which gives the average level of electrons' energy.
Ec is the minimum energy of conduction band.
Ev is the maximum energy of valence band.
Generally speaking, Ef and Ec,Ev have no direct relationship because Ec,Ev are derived from Schrodinger equation and Ef is determined by the real circumstances of electrons.
And the density of carriers is:
Among them, E represents the energy of each electron. g(E) represents the density of state(one energy line in the energy band image). f(E,Ef) shows the possibility whether the states will be occupied by one electron(Pauli exclusion principle tells that one state can only be occupied by one electron at most).
The concrete form of f(E,Ef) and g(E) is:
Expression of f(E,Ef) is called Fermi-Dirac distribution,which is derived from statistical mechanics,and g(E) is from the periodical boundary condition because we regard the CdS as the ideal crystal, that means, no dislocation, no impurity.
ε:difference of E and Ec,represent the electrons' kinetic energy.
m:valid mass of electron.
h:Plank constant

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Similarly, for amino acid positions that are more variable only the residues most likely to occur at this position were tested for rather than using all possible 20 amino acids. Therefore, based on the amino acid conservation we can narrow our search space for only relevant combinations. Looking only at CDR3, which is the variable region most important for conveying specificity, there are  approximately 1011 sequence combinations. This number increases significantly when including the sequence combinations for CDR1 and CDR2, highlighting our designed library complexity.
To select for sdAbs we chose to modify a bacterial-2-hybrid system.  Our construction employed a two-plasmid design, with one plasmid harbouring both an RNA polymerase alpha subunit and fluorescent reporter constructs, and the other containing a randomized library of single-domain antibody sequences. The fluorescent reporter construct allows for strong and weak binders to be sorted using a fluorescently activated cell sorter (FACS).
Summary
The design of our project adopted a two-pronged approach for identifying and detecting various pathogens within EMS vehicles. Our approach is comprehensive as it is able to identify any bacterial or eukaryotic species present utilizing universal ribosomal DNA primers.
Additionally, we are able to generate sdAbs to any epitope or surface protein and readily detect the presence of organisms within EMS vehicles. This approach is also portable: the MinION sequencer is more compact than a smartphone, and new developments in technology and library preparation will facilitate ad hoc sequencing and rapid detection. Additionally, cloud-based sequence analysis will enable rapid detection and tracking of the microbiome of an ambulance over time.
Moreover, our group has adapted the generation of sdAbs into an easy-to-use, extremely rapid test kit based on an ELISA for day-to-day monitoring of the pathogen load of an EMS vehicle. This test kit can be used in any location at any time and will provide a real-time answer to first responders. Most importantly our solution is designed to be used by the individuals on the front lines, the first responders; this is why we have made our ELISA-based test system easily adaptable and ready to use without any special training required.
Moving forward, a significant amount of value lies in the standardization of our approach. We were able to develop a new, standardized method of sample preparation for a cutting-edge sequencing platform. Our device can be utilized not only by environmental sampling groups, but also future iGEM teams around the world. Our standard parts for generating a sdAb library are also available in the iGEM registry for use by any future iGEM team.
Given that the sequencing platform from Oxford Nan"

Hospital Interview
What is reality? Reality is not only the theorem, formula and definition we learned in textbooks. It also not only the report and data we read in papers and journals. It is supposed to be the changes of surroundings and the joy and sorrow of human beings that we can really see, hear, touch and feel. How can our scientific research make some differences to people’s daily life? What we should do first is to discover the reality, thus the doctors’ clinical experience and the patients’ living condition are the reality we are concerned about initially. Answering the doctors’ concerns and doubts about current therapies and meeting the patients’ needs and hopes about current treatment are the goals that we are always pursuing. The next one is to put our idea into reality. We spent the whole summer vacation on the experiments and data analyses hoping to achieve the initial goal. Afterwards, we interviewed doctors again to ask for advice for our preliminary results to improve our project. The third one is to respect the patients’ real feelings and thoughts however positive or negative. We all must esteem the reality.
Why we do such a human practice project? We believe that the meaning of human practice is not only to give suggestions and feedbacks to the laboratory work but also to discover and realize the real world and connect our idea with the people, environment and even the world. When we learn about all the sever problems such as the increasing frequency of cardiovascular diseases, the sufferings of patients, the incapability of treatment, the complaints of medical staff and the tensions of physician - patient relationship, we may just read, learn and forget it some time. However, when you really go to the outpatient clinics to see the doctors heavy work (A doctor in the cardiovascular unit of a major hospital is always seeing 100 or 200 patients from morning till night.) and go to the wards of inpatient departments to see the lean, pale and painful patients who are tortured by the daily treatment, you will be really touched, shocked and desired to spare no efforts to make your project better.
Our human practice may give us not all the positive attitudes and compliment, even more negative concerns and doubts, but we still don’t give up and try our best to achieve our dream, because your project is not only your own"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"1:100,000.
We will need to assemble a control practice library from the 18 practice plate oligos.  We will basically formulate a negative control pool with equal amounts of each of the 18 oligos, and spike this pool with varying amounts of Zif268.  We will then transform our selection strain with these pools with varying amounts of Zif268, and measure how specifically we can pick a winner out amongst non-winners (so instead of a bacteria dilution, it will be a plasmid dilution).  We will use 8 different concentrations:
Positive control (all Zif268)
1:10
1:100
1:1,000
1:10,000 (this is approximately the ratio we expect for a winner amongst a pool of 9,149 non-winners for the chip subpools)
1:100,000
1:1,000,000
Negative control (only contains the 18 practice plate oligos)
We will start figuring out the procedure for converting our expression plasmids into Biobricks for submission.  This entails locating and eliminating all of the five specified restriction sites from our biobrick part (XbaI, SpeI, NotI, PstI, EcoRI), and assembling the part into a Biobrick submission plasmid ( pSB1C3 ).  This may be accomplished through the use of isothermal assembly to combine the Biobrick shipping plasmid backbone with our Biobrick part (the omega subunit + zinc finger array).

TolC selection abandoned.
Wolfe
There appears to be low selection for the Wolfe strain as well. i.e. 1:10. One possibility is that the wrong strain was picked, the other. In the absence of the 96 well plate, we will use the culture tube, and possibly the 100 well, plate reader plate.

GFP reporter strain
We looked at the plate of GFP reporter that grew colonies and had the correct Shine-Dalgarno RBS with the correct spacer, putting it over the blue light of an e-gel box.  We have glowing colonies!  Only about seven of the ~250 colonies glowed, which may be due to an extra leaky promoter.  We then picked a glowing colony and put it in the warm room to grow overnight in preparation for miniprep.

GEL 1-Touchdown 1
Gel 2-Touchdown 2
WEEK 2
Monday
The linker primers and the EPD primers have arrived today.  Touchdown PCR to amplify the promoter     parts was set up. The touchdown PCR was as before. The forward ALDH1A1(EPD) primer was paired with the reverse primer     ALDH1A1-RV. The EPD designed primers for ALDH3A1 were tested.
RESULTS: It worked a dream!     We have got lovely bands for ALDH1A1(EPD), ALDH2 and     ALDH3A1 (EPD). However the band observed for ALDH1A3 was almost twice the     expected size. The size expected was around 900bp and the size seen on the gel     is around 1500bp. Parts cut from the gel were ALDH1A1 (EPD), ALDH3A1 (EPD) and     ALDH2 (Wmin). DNA was gel extracted and purified. DNA     was then run on a gel to verify the extraction process. An overnight digestion     was set up to create the Biobrick overhang parts. Only     the ALDH1A3 digest from previously was kept. The other digests were discarded     at this point.
Tuesday
Today the restricted parts were cloned to the pSB1C3     backbone and transformed to E. coli.  Parts cloned were the ALDH1A1 (EPD),     ALDH2, ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1. Transformed E.     coli was plated to chloramphenicol plates which were incubated overnight at     370C.  More plated and     broth were made up ready for use. The parts required from DTU Denmark and Serrano     are being arranged for delivery to us.
The following promoter parts have been mad ready.
ALDH1A1 – BBa_K940000
ALDH2 – BBa_K940001
ALDH 1A3 – Bba_K940002
ALDH3A1 – BBa_K940003
Wednesday
The linker primers were hydrated ready for use. We are still     waiting for the parts from DTU and Serrano. There have been a number of issues     with delivery but we are hoping to have them sorted and the parts delivered by     Friday. Colony PCR was done to confirm the inserts ligated yesterday.

Degradation
We pinpointed the localization of two MlrA constructs in yeast
Our results show that our constructs, MlrA (MlrAY) and MlrA with mating factor α (MlrAYa), both localized in the fraction comprising of inclusion bodies, plasma membrane and cell wall (Figure 10, P2 fractions). MlrA was also detected in the fraction containing only cell wall and plasma membrane (P3 fraction), indicating that the protein is localized in the plasma membrane. The absence of MlrAYa from the S3 and P3 samples is most likely due to technical errors in the experiment, and, based on this, we can’t conclude if the protein is in the plasma membrane or in the inclusion bodies.

We proved that our enzymes are active
Based on our final enzyme activity assay, both MlrAY and MlrAYa have activity. The earlier assay with non-diluted enzyme had shown that either there is high activity or that there is no activity at all, but with this final activity assay we managed to prove that the enzymes degrade MC-LR. The results show that the three different dilutions degrade the MC-LR at different rates, with 1:10 dilution having the highest activity and 1:1000 having the lowest (Figure 11). Based on the graphs it seems that the plain MlrA has a bit higher activity than MlrA with the mating factor α.

Purification
Dpn1 Digestion (Purification)
Introduction
When higher amounts of plasmid template must be used in the PCR reaction, it is recommended that the PCR product be digested with Dpn1 (NEB #R0176) in order to destroy the plasmid template before setting up the assembly reaction. Dpn1 cleaves only E. coli Dam methylase-methylated plasmid DNA, but does not cleave the PCR product, since it is not methylated.
Basic Terminology and Concepts
Safety Precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment. This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by leads and managers. Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.

Formation – The creation of a genetically-altered micro-organism through deliberate or accidental means. For our purposes, our modified organism was altered intentionally, thus we know all of the donor organisms and the recipient organism are not hazardous.
Release – The deliberate release or accidental escape of some of these microorganisms in the workplace and/or into the environment. Our product consists of naturally found peptides and not the genetically modified organism itself that essentially stays in the laboratory setting so the the surrounding environment will not have to deal with any release of microorganisms.
Proliferation/Competition/Establishment – The subsequent multiplication, genetic reconstruction, growth, transport, modification and die-off of these micro-organisms in the environment, including possible transfer of genetic material to other micro-organisms. The inclusion of the ecnB gene in our organism severely impedes growth, so even if our organism was to escape the lab into the environment, it couldn’t survive. Also, the ecnB gene has to be expressed so the organism wouldn’t be any different in that sense from other strains naturally found.
Effect – The subsequent occurrence of human or ecological effects due to interaction of the organism with some host or environmental factor. Ideally, our cells would not have an effect on the environment or any other host as they are constrained to the laboratory setting. However, if there were to be a leak somewhere in the lab, the largest concern would be if another organism were to somehow take up DNA lost from our cells. This would require a naturally competent bacterial strain to come across a leak that yields an intact plasmid, and the plasmid would have to be able to replicate. In all likelihood, in the absence of selective pressure, the plasmid would actually be deleterious to the cell due to toxicity of the EcnB peptide.[10]
Comprehensive Environmental Assessment
The EPA’s Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA) is a tool to allow scientists to broaden their perspectives by incorporating the experiences, expertise, and concerns of diverse stakeholders. CEA differs from traditional methods of risk assessment by recognizing that risk assessment is fundamentally a decision-making process in which scientists, experts, and the public should be engaged in transparent dialogue. The goal is to evaluate limitations and tradeoffs to arrive at holistic conclusions about the primary issues that researchers should be addressing in their research planning.
The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., recently launched efforts to lay out a framework to apply CEA to synthetic biology. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology"

Safety
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose risks to lab members, security, the general public, or the environment?
None of the biological materials used in our lab pose pose any sort of risk. The main biological part that we are using in this project, the mtd, does not affect any organism other than Bordetella bacteria. Furthermore, all of our work is done in-vitro, and our product is not packaged within a vector. As such, there is no chance of our materials impacting the public or the environment outside of the controlled laboratory environment.
If your project was scaled up from a lab study to a widely used industrial product, or if the knowledge and methods produced from your project became widely available, what new risks might arise?
No new risks would arise. Our project has no inherently malicious utilities.
What are your institution's biosafety guidelines?
All biological research at UCLA is overseen by the Environment, Health, & Safety department's Biological Safety Division . Per EH&S's requirements, Members of our team took the Lab Safety Fundamentals Concepts course taught by UCLA's Environment, Health, & Safety department. The course covers fire safety, chemical safety, and mitigation of hazards in the lab. We also consulted with EH&S regarding the safety implications of our project. Initially, we had planned to conduct our experiment in-vivo using the BPP-1 phage and its host, the Bordetella bacteria. However, Bordetella causes infections in humans and smaller mammals, and our lab facility was not equipped to handle such a hazard. As such, we decided to switch to a completely in-vivo approach.
In the USA, the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health provide biosafety guidelines for the nation.
What is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
Our lab has a BSL rating of 2.
Does your project involve any high risk organisms?
Our project does not involve the use of any chassis organism. We only use standard strains of E. coli for the transformation/replication of our plasmid (XL-1 blue), as well as for screening purposes.

Cooperation with other iGEMers
Do as a new iGEM team, our knowledge of iGEM competition was limited, so we searched for some instructions and suggestions about how to carry out our project. When we met obstacles and setbacks and then, we had been seeking advice from 3 teams. NUDT-China, as a team has been attending the competition for 5 times, was invited to ShangHai to introduce the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in details with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas. For example, in our project, AAV has been used to evaluate the nanobody effectiveness. They warned us that virus should be carefully used in the experiment for consideration of biosafety. Under they help, we communicated with our hq and finally ensured the safety. During the visit to  TMMU-China and Fudan-China, they showed us the details on the experiment operation and helped in avoiding unnecessary mistakes. We also attended in the 5th CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community)，which is one of the best communication platforms for iGEMers in China. During the conference, we learned from other teams’ experience that we enriched the form of human practice parts and tried more interesting ways to promote our projects.
Promotion with social media
After CCIC, we are inspired by other teams’ experience. And then, we decided to try some new media to promote our projects. WeChat public platforms, as a popular form of media for all-round communication and interaction of text, pictures and voice among groups, have been widely used in recent years. In order to promote our project, to let more people know about our project and to achieve the promotion of synthetic biology and iGEM project, our team established our own Wechat public platform, the Internet Work Number. Whenever our team has a influential social practice, we will send a WeChat push to record the moment. For example, the summer camp, attending CCIC, you can find the details in our WeChat public platform. As a new media, Shakes is appealing to the youth for the characteristics of short, fast and trendy. Our team used Shakes to record the details of our experiment, both happy and sad memories. Through this comedy form, we can record the problems we encountered in the operation of the experiment. In this way, we can not only spread the idea of joyful"

We expand on your Human Practice activity by integrating the investigating issues into the design and execution of your project. During the Investigation of Taxus yunnanensis in Yunnan, we learned that the yew plant bases in Yunnan are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution of wild yew trees is dispersive and in small population. They are affected by both natural and human aspects. See the Human Practice page for more information.
We demonstrated our whole system working under simulated conditions in the lab. We used our fusion protein to detect the exsistence of taxol in our lab.
And we won the gold medal finally !

Collaboration for silver medal
When we met so many difficulties with the site-specific genomic integration via the pOSIP plasmid collection, we looked for a possible collaboration partners among the other iGEM teams. We found the Edinburgh UG iGEM 2017 (SMORE). Our new friends were so kind to help us with sending new constructs for use in our genomic integration efforts. We obtained the Serine Integrase Bxb1 under T7 promoter and the recombineering plasmids pSIM7 and pSIM9, so now we have the so needed alternative methods of chromosomal integration in E. coli. We were able to help the SMORE team back with their human practices. To do so, we found students and engineers to answer their detailed skill-exchange questionnaire, giving a better understanding of communication between biologists and engineers.

Other collaborations
We participated in number of iGEM surveys in order to exchange both knowledge and experience.
One of the first surveys we took part in was submitted by the Minnesota team. It was a Biological Safety Collaboration Survey. The team was doing a booklet on different safety systems that they used to ensure the safety of the synthetic biology systems they were working on. They provided us with a form which we filled with our answers on topics such as potential hazards of our project and what precautions we are going to be put in place to avoid them. This survey was very useful and could help everyone considering a hypothetical release of GMOs in the future.
The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team kindly sent us another survey which was also very interesting. It was about reducing methane emissions from cows. They were interested in what degree were we familiar with this problem and what are the ways it could be avoided. We filled the 10 questions hoping we contributed to their cause.
Our next filled survey was about Directed Evolution and Artificial Intelligence by the Heidelberg iGEM team. They wanted our opinion on different questions regarding their project. We found them very interesting and innovative. Our general opinion was in support of"

Thinking about Squid
In order to make the Synthetic Kingdom more lively and to help people get familiar with it I have decided on some squid buddies for each station. There would be certain requirements and purposes which they serve:
Animated: Some squid should be animated in order to give a sense of being more alive
Interactive: At the very least they should be able to talk when you click them so a person will be more immersed
Notecards: Squid should give out notecards with more information about the station
Instructional: Help people not only understand more and learn about Second Life controls but tell them how to carry out the tasks at each station easily

Modelling and lab meeting
Our matlab, membrane computing and lab teams met today. On the matlab side, we have well-defined ideas for how we're going to approach simulation and characterisation, but they seem really disjoint. We will address this later this week. Thane also provided us with much greater detail on the biochemical foundation of the AI-2 signalling pathway, with special reference to kinases and non-specific phosphatases. This will help us find reaction constants for these particular bodies. Our teams will meet again on Thursday, where Afshin will give us a thorough briefing on membrane computing and we will begin to discuss how the two link together.

- Investigate public’s opinions towards synthetic biology

Description
We arranged workshops on DNA models and DNA extraction in the “Summer Science Party 2017” organized by the Hong Kong Science Park.
Achievement
Although the target audience are children from 4 to 12, we were able to receive feedbacks from parents regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms.
There are 79 parents doing surveys. Out of them, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs.  Not only they 63% know that the gene inside organism is changed, equal percent also viewed that GMOs greatly affects ecosystem followed by 54% who voiced GMO negatively affect human health  (put charts/ data)
Whereas actually there is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. The misconceptions that GM food is harmful is possibly due to research bias or rumours. This could be a major barrier to the development of synthetic biology.
From this science park event, we got a number of facebook followers, majority are participants from the event. We continued to write a short article sharing knowledge about synthetic biology from the small group of facebook followers to a larger group of public, hoping people can engage with scientific world with more thoughtful point of view.

At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually.

Lastly, we wanted to make a real impact in people’s lives who were experiencing cataracts. Despite our project’s goal of delivering cataract relief non-invasively, we realize that surgery is currently the most effective way to eliminate cataracts. So, we held fundraisers (in the form of bake sales and club fairs) in order to donate to those who don’t have funds or access to surgery. We raised enough money for 14 surgeries through the Himalayan Cataract Project, which serves underprivileged cataract patients.

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", both plasmids were co-transfected in yeast. Liquid cultures were inoculated with the transformed yeast and different hormone concentration were added. The hormones were extracted from different contraceptive pill containing either Ethinyl estradiol (EG) or Ulipristal acetate (U). Hormones were added at nanomolar level and luciferase assays were performed after 6 and 9 hours. In addition yeast cells containing only the pFET3-nLuc construct were treated with the hormones, aswell (see figure 7 and 8).
Figure 7: Relative luminescence levels normalized to OD600 after 6 hours.
Figure 8: Relative luminescence levels normalized to OD600 after 9 hours.
In general one can see that the cells containing the pFET-nLuc construct show a higher luminescence signal than the cells that contain in addition one of the two mPR constructs. The negative control (no hormones added) show a comparable decrease in the luminescence levels than the cells that were treated with the different hormones. We expected to see a drop in the luminescence levels for the hormone treated cells, while the untreated cells show a stable luminescence signal. A possible explanation for this observation is that the used hormones do not bind to the receptors, since these hormones are no Progesterones or the presence of the mPR receptors impair growth of the cells.
Background and Goal
The team we sent into the race in 2014 sadly was not able to characterize all of their parts. We did not want to let this stand, seeing how we put so much effort into the project last year. So we set out to characterise one of the parts from 2014. As a part to characterize we chose the Ssp GyrB split intein (K1483003) .
A look back at the theory
Inteins are self-splicing proteins. The part that is spliced out is referred to as intein, the parts which are joined are called exteins in analogy to introns and exons. In split inteins the intein is divided into two parts to be seperately expressed or synthesized. These parts are only active when combined.
In the case of the Ssp GyrB split intein, there is a larger protein (150 amino acids) and a small peptide (>6 amino acids). Both parts can for example be expressed in fusion proteins, however, the small peptide can easily be synthesized in vitro and coupled to matrices or fluorophores. Upon reaction, the intein (both parts of the split intein)"

We use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the stochastic process of the reversal after Cre binds to Loxp sites. We can see from the result of this part that the inversion only happens when Cre protein binding to Loxp sites exists and about 50% of genes flip to the state we want. readmore
Sensitivity Analysis
We analyze three parameters and the third parameter –the degradation rate of Cre protein –have an obvious effect on the final percent of the genes in different state. readmore
Feedforward
By introducing a feed forward to the system, we increase the percent of the genes flipping to the state we want.And the system is more stable. readmore

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," apply our cells in confocal microscopes, but Mr. van Dijk recommended us not to do this, because the confocal pinhole is specifically designed to select a small range of data, and losses are minimal. However, Spinning Disk microscopy does cope with high losses of light, and information, so it would be much more viable to apply our microlenses there. There is already a patent for the use of conventional microlenses in Spinning Disk microscopy, so we should really show our cells are different than current systems. Furthermore, he recommended us to find out the exact price over quality ratio of our lenses.
One of our biggest competing fields would be sprayed plastic lenses, which are also cheap and produced in high numbers. Therefore, we should be able to produce our microlenses for either a lower price or with a higher quality, which is very useful information for our business plan. The talk with Mr. van Dijk gave us a lot of new input, especially for the entrepreneurship part of the project, but he also underlined the potential of our project in the optics industry:
“Light is a limiting factor in imaging, adding a microlens array to a microscope would be an interesting solution.”

Today we talked with Aurèle Adam, an assistant professor at the optics group of the TU Delft. We had a conversation with him about our model for the biolenses and how to interpret the graphs we plotted. Furthermore, he introduced us to his PhD student Daniel Nascimento-Duplat who has been a valuable collaborator of our project. Daniel gave us valuable guidance in debugging the COMSOL models and interpreting some of the results. Additionally, we used the specialized software CST Design Studio to model our biological micromenses and performed the most complicated calculations in his server.
Pieter van Gelder - Professor in safety science
Date: 01-08-2016
We had an interesting talk with Pieter van Gelder, a professor of safety science at the faculty of technology, policy and management of Delft University of Technology and director of the TU Delft Safety and Security Institute. Professor van Gelder explained to us how his research group analyzes the safety of projects. They use a lot of statistical data in combination with models in order to analyze risks in a systematic way. He stressed that, for example about the risks within the chemical industry and the chance of dike breaches is much more data available than about the risks within a new research field such as synthetic biology. “I think a very comprehensive"

LINK-IT - gaining acceptance by overcoming fears
In the beginning of our project we wanted to achieve the gold medal criteria for policy and practice by doing lot of public work like informing the public about our project. After our balloon Saturday night fever action and talking to friends and family we became aware of the fact that the main reason people are skeptical towards synthetic biology were safety concerns. These concerns were often not funded. To gain statistically funded data about the opinions regarding synthetic biology we started a survey about synthetic biology in general and the main concerns of people towards synthetic biology. (Auswertung ergab_ ) As a team from Germany we dealt with a lot of prejudices about genetically modified organisms. To point out the general opinion, we created a mindmap giving you a small collection showing mixed opinions of the public.
We also wanted to consult experts on the field of scientific law and ethics. Therefore we partook in a symposium, learning about conferences from the experts. We also consulted an expert of synthetic biology ethics, Dr. Joachim Boldt. During this learning process, starting with talking to the public to consulting different experts, we became more and more aware of the problem we really wanted to encounter: How can we, as a small student group alleviate concerns that running through all walks of life. For us it was crucial that the only way to gain acceptance was to overcome the fears.
This is the reason why we started LINK-IT. Becoming aware of the safety concerns, let us see our project from a different angle. After doing so we also concerned ourselves with the ethical aspects of our project. The problem of safety concerns does not only lie in"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"acervation. This process can under some circumstances be observed by the naked eye, as coacervates generally cause solutions to be more turbid. A key physical property of coacervates is that they require polymers of a certain length to form. In general, only polymers that are ‘long enough’ form coacervates.
Figure 1: Schematic description of coacervation. Long, mutually attractive polymers can phase separate into dense, polymer-rich regions known as coacervates, and a polymer-poor region consisting of the solvent.
The underlying reason for this can be explained theoretically and experimentally . These latter facts directly imply that (changes in) polymer length can be visualized to the naked eye, which we utilized to design a novel detection method coined CINDY Seq . However, as we will argue in greater detail below, the method has potential to serve as a far broader method to characterize existing and future BioBricks, and the activity of many enzymes that show synthesis or degradation of any (coacervating) polymer.
The coacervation method in our project
In our project we developed the Coacervate Inducing Nucleotide Detection of Your Sequence (CINDY Seq) method for visualizing the activity of Cas13a into a readout visible to the naked eye. When Cas13a binds to its RNA target, it undergoes a conformational change and engages in a state of collateral cleavage. In this state, it non-specifically cleaves the RNA it encounters ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ; Gootenberg et al. 2017 ; Liu et al. 2017 ). Long sequences of RNA have been demonstrated to form coacervates visible to the naked eye with spermine ( Aumiller et al. 2016 ). The RNA sequences will likewise be cleaved by the activated Cas13a. After cleavage, the previously long ‘collateral’ RNA is no longer able to form coacervates, and thus the method allows the naked eye detection of Cas13a target recognition. In absence of the RNA target, Cas13a will remain inactive and the collateral RNA remains at its original length at which it still coacervates with spermine. The solution will show increased turbidity. This difference in turbidity (see Figure 2) shows whether Cas13a has been activated or not. This indicates the presence or the absence of the RNA target. We were in fact able to demonstrate that coacervation can be employed as a reliable method. More elaborate experimental results can be"

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Notebook#20 June 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," was made clear that Parts should be well documented and more than just test . Because parts, in contrary to some believes are not only the sequence of the parts but also experiences and everything. So please edit bad parts was the message, the partsregistry does not yet want to delete parts . A nice example to add to your parts are measurements of promotor strength as with Jason Kelly's promotor strength kit .  Also the possibilities of iGEM was discussed, with commercial applications being in the near future and publishers thinking about publishing iGEM Specials.
So much for an introduction, of to Developing & Refining an iGEM Idea. How do you get idea's? Well ofcourse they mentioned:
Talk to people
Think about topics and relevant subjects ( Resveratrol in Biobeer )
Look at previous wiki's (especially medals might give an insight to interesting subjects)
Look at interesting applications (e.g. Bactoblood )
Think about using new organisms (like Harvard and their Shewanella oneidensis)
Also it would be nice to look at the general purpose tools (e.g. terminator , inducible promotor , Ribosomal binding sites or plasmid backbones .
Most importantly, let the students choose... but help them make a smart choice. Supervisors can do this by pointing at the following.
Local skills, if no one around is experienced.. who to call for help?
Assembly stages, how many parts and how long does it take?
Independent subgoals, so to make sure that they can finish something
Unnecessary to make brand new idea
Characterizing is widely appreciated
Combining devices will provide enough fun
Making parts
First needed for making parts is ofcourse the sequence, which was in the example taken from Ecocyc . But could also for example been taken from DDBJ , Genbank , or EMBL . Next the sequence can be added to the registry and giving it a short description (including the parttype) and a long description (What is the part? What is interesting about it? What's its function?). Mentioning the source where you got the idea, wikicodes are possible to refer. And adding design considerations, use in project, purifying it of restriction sites. And adding features to specify. All parts added are automatically put in your sandbox , which was referred to as 'child's play' and so it is possible to start adding parts soon during the process and should be done. To appear in search tables the part needs to be tagged in categories.

Oxford,2016,Team:Oxford#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," toxicity by binding copper in the periplasm then exporting it, periplasmic proteins may reduce toxicity to the host.
Using these criteria we found two copper chelators that we thought would be useful. We designed gBlocks, codon optimised for E. coli, containing these parts both alone and linked to super-folder GFP . This form of the fluorescent protein was used because the standard GFP doesn’t fold particularly well in the periplasm where one of our chelators is intended to travel to.  The proteins, both alone and attached to sfGFP, were ordered with C-terminal hexa-histidine tag so we could purify them. A concern was raised that the His tag would also weakly bind copper potentially affecting the results. However we decided that increasing the copper-binding would only improve the proteins' intended function.
Copper Storage Protein 1
Copper storage protein 1 is a protein discovered in a methane-oxidizing alphaproteobacterium called Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. (OB3b here stands for “oddball” strain 3b). This bacterium has a high demand for copper for use in its particular methane monoxygenase enzyme. Vita et al.(1) discovered Csp1 in 2015, characterised the protein’s copper affinity and obtained crystal structures with and without copper.
TAT Csp1
Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix bundle subunits. Each monomer can bind up to 13 Cu(I) ions meaning that the tetramer binds a maximum of 52 copper ions. Vita et al. crystallised Csp1 with and without copper bound. The copper is bound inside the pre-folded helical bundles by Cys residues in contrast to metallothioneins, which are unstructured until they fold around metal ion clusters. Vita et al.(1) found an average copper affinity of approximately 1x1017M-1.
Csp1 has a signal peptide targeting it to the twin arginine translocation pathway (TAT).  This means that it is likely a periplasmic protein. However they also found cytoplasmic homologues in many species challenging their and our assumption that copper storage occurs only in the periplasm due to copper toxicity.
We codon optimised Csp1 to E. coli and replaced the original TAT sequence with a TAT sequence from the E. coli protein CueO , which is also involved in copper regulation. To get Csp1 from the shipping vector to the pBAD expression system for testing the"

MITOMI: Protein-DNA Interaction
Back to protocols .
made on 16.05.2011
Purpose
To detect potential protein-DNA interactions
Chip
MITOMI device bonded to epoxy slide spotted with DNA samples, bonded at 40C overnight (alternatively @room temperature)
Method
• Load all control lines with dH2O, at ~5 psi, check that all valves work
Usually “B” valves are starting to load earlier (leave the button unpressurised prior to the pressure increase, it tends to stick to the slide.)
Increase the pressure in both “A” and “B” valves till ~13-15 psi and make sure that you can see that all chambers are separated. If no – increase the pressure
• 2mg/ml BSA-bio @ 5psi for 20 minutes; chambers (B3): closed
• You can prepare the ITT mix meanwhile and put it at 25C for 3-4 hours (it takes that long to express your TF with a GFP tag)
• PBS for ~2 minutes (or as long as the preparation for next step takes)
• 500ug/ml NA PBS for 20 minutes
• PBS for ~5 minutes
• Close button, continue PBS for 1-2minutes making sure button is closed
• 2mg/ml BSA biotin for 20 minutes
• PBS for 10 minutes
• Antibody-GFP-biotin in PBS for 4-5 minutes
• open button, continue antibody for 20 minutes
• PBS for ~10 minutes
• flow the expression mix with expressed protein for 10-15 minutes, when  ~2-3 cm of mix left in the inlet tube :
• Close outlet B4 and open B3 (isolates spotted DNA in a chamber) and load chambers with the same expression mix
To do so you should close the outlet first (“B4”) and continue"

Centrifugate: 5000x g, 4 °C, 12 min
Discard supernatant
Repeat steps 4 to 6 two times
Centrifuge a last time at 5000x g, 4 °C, for 5 min and remove residual washing buffer by pipetting.
Flash freeze pellets in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C, unless you want to proceed with sonication directly.
Sonication
The following strategy can be pursued if there is no access to a sonifier which can display its energy output in Joule per second or alike.
First, prepare multiple reference samples which are absolutely identical (see below for further requirements). Right before sonication, ensure the temperature of the liquid. Sonicate for a defined time interval. When sonication has ended, measure the temperature of the liquid again without any delay.
Equation to calculate the necessary sonication time for a given setup. P: Power in W or J/s, respectively; V: sonicated volume in L; c: specific heat capacity of water (at room temperature); Δϑ: temperature difference between starting temperature and temperature after heating in K; Δt: time difference between both temperature measurements.
Perform at least triplicates for every interval. To calculate the power P of your sonifier in Joule per seconds and thereby calculate the necessary sonication time for a given setting, use the nearby equation. You need to consider the following:
The Amplitude of the sonifier must be kept constant during experiment to eliminate the influence of viscosity or heating on the result
The starting temperature must remain the same in all reference measurements
The liquid as well as the vessel used in the reference experiment must be similar to the ones in the intended experiments
For our setting (see below), a sonication time of 290 s was appropriate for a total energy input of 800-900 J.
Our lysis procedure is described in the following section
Sonication of the pellet from Cell harvest with the HF-Generator GM 2070 in combination with UW 2070, SH 70G and MS73; setted at 70% amplitude and no cycles
clean the sonifier tip with 70% (v/v) EtOH prior to usage
resuspend the pellet in 1 mL S30 buffer per gramm pellet
aliquot the cell suspension à 1500"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," . Because you do not want to have a chromosome integration or homologous recombination in a Cloning strain, this gene is mutated in the E. coli strains. For our VibriClone we also want to have a greatly reduced single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity for RecA (Bryan, 1988) (Figure 2).
KatG
The katG gene encodes an enzyme with a catalase and peroxidase activity. Peroxidases use hydrogen peroxide as a substrate. A special form is the Catalase, which is also KatG. Catalases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. The fact that they make hydrogen peroxide harmless has a protective effect on the cell. Many aerobic organisms including E. coli have a catalase because they contain flavoenzymes that contribute to peroxide formation (Fuchs 2017) . Due to the catalase activity it is possible to store E. coli at low temperatures, which is very useful in the laboratory. That's what we want for our VibriClone, too. Because we will have the working with VibriClone as comfortable and practical as possible.
The lac operon
Figure 3:Gene Cluster of the genes belong to the lactose operon (green). Next to these genes are genes encoding for a putative cyanate transporter, a mhp operon transcriptional activator and a propionate hydroxylase.
The lac operon plays an important role in the transport and the degradation of lactose in bacteria and it is a section on the chromosome of E. coli. It contains the three genes lacZ, lacA and lacY, which are regulated together. They encode enzymes for the utilization of lactose. The lacI gene is no longer counted to the lactose operon. The Lactose repressor (LacI) has an central importance for the regulation of the expression of the lactose operon. This is an enzyme that occupies the cell membrane of the bacterial cell and is responsible for the transport of lactose into the cell (Santillánet al., 2008) . The ß-galactosidase (LacZ) convert lactose to glucose and galactose (Serebriiskiiet al., 2000) . The glucose can then be metabolized normally by glycolysis. The exact function of the Thiogalactoside transacetylase (LacA) is unknown, but it may act as an detoxifying enzyme. Transcription of the lact"

Investigator: Roman
Aim:
Dilution of dried pUCIDT- Amp vector, which contains the gene synthesis products. Afterwards, transformation of pUCIDT_CaXMT1, pUCIDT_CaMXMT1 and pUCIDT_CaDXMT1 in chemo competent XL-1 blue e.coli- cells, to make the genes available for cloning in pSB1C3 and pTUM104
Operational sequence
Basical vector data of pUCIDT
length: 2752 bp
resistance: ampicillin
About 2 µg of dried vector (containing our inserts) were delivered. By dilution with 20 µl bidestillated water (after centrifugation), a final concentration of about 100 ng/µl was adjusted.
Transformation
Transformation in chemo competent cells was performed as previously described. Unconcentrated plating (100 µl) was performed on ampicillin containing LB agar plates, whereas the rest of the transformation- batch was stored in the fridge at 4°C (previous experiments showed, that unconcentrated plating led to enough colonies). The plates were incubated at room temperature over the next two days.

Overview
""Technology is only a means,  in itself it is neither good nor evil.   Everything depends upon what man makes of it,  for what purpose it serves him,  under what conditions he places it."" - Karl Theodor Jaspers
iGEMers should never be restricted in laboratory. To solve a real-life problem, STEP was created for cellular immunotherapy. But will it serve people in a responsible way? How can we perfect it by involving the world into our project? What shall we do for the public? Inspired by the idea of opening science, we delivered several lectures to students from kindergarten to college, from Shanghai to Canton. A video, a set of cartoon ‘tuanzi’ and a reportage were created to help the public better understand our project and the true living condition of sci-researchers in China. We contacted experts and stakeholders to help us add social, ethical and juristic considerations to our project. Professionals from synthetic biology, pharmaceutical industry and computer science also put touches into the design and application of STEP.

Education & Engagement
Synthetic biology has its unique magic:  every element works together for one purpose in the system we design, just like an imaginative idea can act as a magnet to draw people together. Involving the public stays on in our mind. In this spirit, we delivered a set of lectures and mini-labs to students of all ages to unlock a world of synthetic biology for juniors. Excitedly, vibrant students from High School Affiliated to Fudan University applauded the idea of synthetic biology and newly established an iGEM team on our instruction. In addition, inspired by the principle of opening science, we interviewed"
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Why Colonize Mars_-_-_TEXT.html," round tables with orange background. While the petri dishes with agar helped facilitate conversation about how we work in the laboratorium, the clay helped inspire to a more general conversation about how to build a sustainable society.
Survey about predicting Mars colonization and voting for and against Mars colonization
As we were quite curious about people's expectations of the future in terms of colonization, we decided to make a survey with five questions. The survey was meant to make people talk about the questions together and thereby inspire them to think about the future. 36 persons answered the questions, you can see the results here:
We also made a vote on colonizing Mars or not, where people simply put a pasta in a glass if they thought humans should colonize Mars and a pasta in another glass if they thought we shouldn’t. The poll was also made with the purpose of making people think and talk about whether colonization of Mars is a good idea. 114 participated in this poll.
Findings
Our conversations with people at the Tycho Brahe Planetarium helped us understand different ways of thinking about colonization. Though most of the people we spoke with had a positive attitude towards Colonization, many of them were hesitant to jump to conclusions immediately. We consider that finding very positive as it shows that people (at least the ones we spoke with) want to take their position on informed basis.
Another observation from the event was that a lot of people were concerned with sustainability both on earth and on Mars, questions like  “How can we make sure that we will take better care of Mars than we have taken care of the earth” and “shouldn’t we be more concerned with sustaining our own planet instead of focusing on a new one?” were asked a lot of times during the night. The questions are related to some of the arguments analysed in the report, and it was very interesting for us to discuss these considerations with people. Through the conversations we gained a better understanding of people’s considerations about sustainability.
Integration of findings
Our process of writing the report and interaction with the visitors at the Tycho Brahe planetarium has made us think more nuanced about the reasons for colonizing Mars and which considerations we need to make before taking such a decision as a society. We have become more aware of thinking about sustainability and seeing the potential colonization of Mars as a democratic decision.
Due to our conversations with people at the Tycho Brahe Planetarium, we have decided that we want to make sure that our product is as sustainable as possible by considering our choice of design and material for the chamber. We do not want to jump to conclusions, and therefore this is an issue we plan to"

Toronto,2012,Team:Toronto#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we found our extraction sample to have a density of 20ng/µL – good miniprep. Performed a transformation using K414007, so as to keep plates in the fridge with this part handy.
  June 1
Competent E. coli were made using the CaCl2 protocol. The transformation from yesterday was successful. We put K414007 into the -20°C freezer. The primers for the following BioBricks we intend to make as part of our constructs were designed: Kozak, HSP18.2 terminator, PHT1;2 promoter, Extensin signal, AtPAP15, and PhyA1 (which has two exons, and therefore, four primers needed). We also miniprepped the K382024 terminator, and made a long-term stock as well as a lab stock.
  June 4
The BioBrick K414007 was grown up so that it was possible to make a long-term stock. We did so by inoculating a colony on an LB and chloramphenicol plate. Our competent cells from June 1 were tested by transforming K414007. A restriction digest was run on K382024 using EcoR1 (E) and Spe1 (S).
  June 5
K414007 was miniprepped and a long-term stock was made by suspension in 1000µL 40% glycerol and placed in the -80°C. The nanodrop showed densities for K414007 of 78 and 100 ng/µL. As a test for competency, the newly-made competent DH5α was transformed successfully. We now have a stock of 49 aliquots in the -80°C. The chemical cupboard in the lab was also organised.
  June 7
A 20% SDS solution was made for DNA isolation next week, and PCR primer designs were finalised.

The IPTG inducible lacI regulated promoter  ( BBa_R0010 ) was tested electrochemically to demonstrate its leakiness when not used in conjunction with strong expression of regulatory elements. This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
A β-galactosidase (LacZ) inducible generator construct existing in the registry ( BBa_I732901 ) was found to possess a frameshift mutation, affecting its functionality.  This part was replaced with a new circuit ( BBa_K902090 ), which was characterized for functionality both qualitatively as well as electrochemically.   This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
( BBa_K590025 ), the PetroBrick, submitted by the Washington team in 2011, was characterized for a novel function: the conversion of naphthenic acids and 2-hydroxymuconate- a catechol break-down product from from the xylE gene ( BBa_J33204 ) into hydrocarbons and potential value added products.  This data can be found on both the Decarboxylation page and the Decatecholization page.  We feel that these new and meaningful applications of this part present a distinct improvement on its usefulness for other teams.
The output of ( BBa_K590025 ) was also optimized through a program we developed in MATLAB for the  optimization of metabolic pathways in synthetic biology metabolic networks.  The program allows you to build an artificial synthetic biology network in E. coli and predicts substrates that should be fed to the organism to increase production of the compound.  This was characterized and validated in the wetlab with the Petrobrick. This data can be found on our Flux Analysis page.
An existing xylE gene in the registry ( BBa_J33204 ) was constructed with a constitutive promoter instead of the glucose-repressible part available within the registry.  This allows for increased output"

After showing stability of TnrA-pAlst sytem by using the RFP fluorescence protein, Toehold-TEV protease will be replaced with RFP for binding to AND gate system.
QS dependent promoter pLsr
There are two promoters on LsrR’s operon Lsr . these promoters are called LsrA and LsrR, and they are repressed in the absence of AI-2. The location LsrR binds on these promoters(p-lsr-Box)  are shown below. Dark ones indicate the common sequences in both promoters. We preferred to use lsR promoter as it is one of ATOMS Team’s parts in 2013.
FIGURE 5:LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia Coli AI-2 quorum sensing (Ting Xue, Liping Zhao, Haipeng Sun, Xianxuan Zhou and Baolin Sun).
We aimed to show repression of LsrR protein on pLsr promoter and dereppession of it in the presence of AI-2. For this purpose, we gathered LsrR protein gene sequence and pLsr sequence on the same biobrick. We put RFP as a reporter in front of pLsr promoter. To produce th repressor protein Lsr in a high amount, we put LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence in front of J23100 constutive promoter .  We added RFC prefix on 3’end , RFC suffix on 5’ end of  LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence.
LsrABCD operon, which makes AI-2 getting into the cell, already present in E.coli; so it is expected to be enough when an AI-2 sensing promoter system placed into E. coli. Thereby under the absence of AI-2, Lsr promoter will be heavily repressed by LsrR protein. If Quorum Sensing molecule sensed successfully AI-2 will be phosphorylated and LsrR’s suppression on pLsr will disappear. Thus RFP expression will occur.
We chose to use the part J23100-LsrR-pLsR-RFP(BBa_K1202108) as 2013 ATOMS IGEM TEAM designed. After showing LsrR-pLsrR system’s stability by using RFP, Trigger RNA will be replaced with RFP to connect the inputs to the And gate system.

Supplementary Information
Introduction to synthetic biology
Most of the participants are non-biology workers, who had no basic knowledge in synthetic biology. For public education, as also to prepare them for using MagicBlock, we spent 40 minutes to introduce synthetic biology.
The main goal of this introduction is not to bring details about biotechnology, but to familiar people with the logic of building genetic circuits. Similar to the programming in the IT, genetic circuits also need information inputs, processing, and outputs, which correspond to bio-sensors, bio-logic-gates, and reporters respectively.
We gave three examples to illustrate the basic logics, covering the issue of social problem solving, BioArt design and signal processing.

Overview
Goal:To lyse E.coli stains above 42℃ and test mutant temperature-sensitive device.
Achievement:We built a new temperature-sensitive device and designed the mutant type of CIλrepressor.For measurement , we finished qualitative measurement and quantitative measurement of these parts and devices.Results indicate that temperature-sensitive killing device can lyse E.coil above 42℃ .
Part:BBa_K1919100

Introduction:
Background:To achieve the goal that once people wear shoes, the CecropinXJ(BBa_K1919000) can be released from cystolic, we design a temperature sensitive killing device (BBa_K1919100) .This part consists of a composite promoter (BBa_K608351)and hokD (BBa_K1497008).Composite promoter (BBa_K608351) is a part of CIλrepressor system. When the temperature is raised to 35℃, CIλrepressor start to denature and can’t bind with promoter ,then hokD gene will be expressed to kill the bacteria. At 42℃, the repressor is totally denatured.
Otherwise, human body temperature is about 37℃(In modeling part, we did more experiment for the acute temperature), obviously, wide-type temperature-sensitive promoter can not express efficiently at this temperature. For searching essay ,we found that some sites were important for CIλ repressor, then, we design a new mutant type having five important changed sites. In the later measurement, it expressed better than wild type temperature-sensitive promoter.
Design
1) Part: BBa_K1919101
2)
Function: This is based on part(BBa_K608351).Composite promoter (BBa_K608351) include the mutant type CIλrepressor so that it can express above 37℃.Compared with the part(BBa_K608351),it is more sensitive at 37℃.According to the essay, we choose five important sites A44G, G92A, C188T, G378A, A629T, which may enhance more than tenth times expression at 37℃，compared with wild type(BBa_K608351).

Therefore the substitution of the two hydroxylated amino acids, that are prolines at the positions 402 and 564 with alanines, would generate a HIF1A (P402A,P564A), that is stabilized and interacts with HIF1B under normoxic conditions (Ziello et al., 2007) to activate the hypoxia response element (HRE).
In return for our help with iGEM team Heidelberg's mutagenesis assay, they offered to help us with their Golden Gate cloning expertise to perform a site directed mutagenesis and generate the constitutively active HIF1A. It would be used by us as a positive control for CoCl2 induction in analysis of HRE.
Unfortunately, Heidelberg faced some challenges during the cloning. Due to the lack of time when the plasmid was finished and arrived in our lab, we were not able to test it anymore.

Integrated: Equality and Diversity
Overview Background Does sexism in
science exist? What is being done? What can we do? Future
Overview
Our ‘Integrated: Equality and Diversity’ section of the Human Practices seeks to address the issues of gender inequality and lack of diversity in science. For this, we highlighted the work of academics and students at Exeter University and opened up the discussion to a wider audience. With each interview, we integrated the key issues raised in the prior interviews to formulate a balanced, grounded argument. Issues such as the problem with maternity and paternity support, and the need for a massive social and structural change. This meant that we could host a panel show in front of a live audience, which was streamed online and broadcasted on the radio, because of the weight of information and experiences we had gained through every interview with academics and students.  There is great scope for future iGEM teams to undertake Equality and Diversity work, and we believe that it should be a requirement, or at least highly recommended in the Human Practices section.
Background
The fundamental reason we have for targeting equality and diversity within science, is that synthetic biology has the chance to be hierarchically and systematically equal from the beginning. If those working in the field can encourage the importance of diversity to younger generations, then when synthetic biology becomes better recognised publicly as a field of science, it has the possibility of being known for its progressive nature towards gender, racial and socio-economical equality.
We started our work on Equality and Diversity after we spoke to Dr Robert Smith of Kings College London, at the UK iGEM meetup in Westminster. He spoke to us about our progress with the Human Practices section and emphasised that our idea for a study into diversity and equality in science had not been extensively studied, to his knowledge, within iGEM. We therefore thought that we would have the possibility of making a significant impact in this field by highlighting and addressing some of the issues surrounding the lack of gender equality and diversity in science overall.
Our original plan was to create a short video investigating the issues surrounding the lack of gender equality in science and to demonstrate what could be done in synthetic biology to address these issues. Dr Smith encouraged us to look more broadly at diversity in science as well, emphasising that the problem doesn’t"

It is important to explain them that the probability of these scenarios happening is very low. How to do this is further discussed in bio-ethics and education section.
7. Additional safety remarks due to comments given on the regional Jamboree: prevention of horizontal gene transfer
If our suicide mechanism would fail e.g. because of a mutation, than the probability of the plasmids being transferred into other organisms in the neighborhood would increase. This process is called horizontal gene transfer. The future plans of using E.D. Frosti commercially for the induction of ice crystallization in ice rinks and prevention of ice formation on the roads requires the release of a huge amount of cells into the environment. This brings the E.D. Frosti in contact with other bacteria and the survival of E.D. Frosti could lead to horizontal gene transfer. If we take into account that these bacteria are well adapted to the natural habitat, we can assume that the probability of the apocalyptic scenarios occurring would increase enormously after horizontal gene transfer.  To minimize the chances of these scenarios, we searched for new safety mechanisms to prevent horizontal gene transfer and additional safety mechanisms to ensure the cell dies when released into the environment.
Horizontal gene transfer
While brainstorming for a mechanism to prevent horizontal gene transfer, we concluded that the best solution would be to avoid the use of plasmids. Horizontal transfer occurs when a plasmid is transported from one bacterial cell into another cell. If all biobricks could be incorporated into the bacterial genome, the probability of horizontal gene transfer would drastically decrease.
The mini Tn7 biobrick of the Sevilla iGEM team 2011 is an excellent example of this mechanism. [14] We could insert the AFP- and INP-genes in a mini Tn7 plasmid. The mini Tn7 would transfer these genes into a specific site of the E.D. Frosti genome. The remaining residues of the plasmid would be broken down and horizontal gene transfer would be disabled. Besides preventing horizontal gene transfer, this mechanism gives us also the possibility to remove the genes that are coded for antibacterial resistance.
Additional safety mechanisms
Biological containment is the most essential safety measure. Scientist can do this physically by keeping the bacteria in the lab or factory (industrial productions). But we plan to release E.D. Frosti into the environment, so as solution to biological containment we have inserted a cell death mechanism. We cannot control mutations in the genes coded for cell death"

BioFactory
Modular Terpenoid BioFactory
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project.
Starting from the assumption that a synthetic biology project is founded on the design of the proper genetic construct being transformed into an organism, it follows that most of the versatility of the project rests on the proper planning strategies applied to the DNA molecule. This would allow for distinct parts of the construct to be exchanged, added, or eliminated, depending on the development and focus that is ultimately given to the entire project.
Considering restriction enzymes as the basic tool for molecular cloning, it is possible to strategically locate the proper restriction sites in a genetic construct for the entire cloning process to be optimized. The proper design can come up with a master molecule from which a great number of sequence combinations can be derived using a limited number of enzymes. If certain restriction site pairs are assigned to each specific module, it would enable the future manipulation of each of these specific parts separately in the most efficient way possible.
The ability to manipulate specific portions of the genetic constructs opens up possibilities in the project execution that allow it to be more dynamic and adaptable. When working with a synthesized construct, one of the barriers for its proper realization is the high costs of producing long nucleotide sequences by oligonucleotide synthesis. This modular design strategy, by allowing to make multiple sequence combinations of the already synthesized construct, enables to study different sequence setups without having to synthesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and ligation reactions, but multiple reactions convey an additional expense on reactants, mostly enzymes. Because a desired sequence exchange could be done by a single digestion and ligation, the modular strategy also promises a reduction on costs in this area. Even further, oligonucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design Regulatory_-_-_TEXT.html," as a control. Next, we have measured the same constructs using the CAT-Seq system.
2. Regulatory part interaction recording
Next, we want to give an example on how to record regulatory part interactions using CAT-Seq. In this case, we will be using Toehold Switches.
The Toehold Switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the Switch and Trigger. The Switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. The Switch RNA forms a hairpin structure that includes the RBS site. While the hairpin structure is formed, the translation is inhibited. The Trigger RNA is a molecule that can selectively bind to the Switch RNA region and expose the gene RBS site for ribosomes. Once that happens, the protein translation can be initiated.
While these riboregulators are extremely useful in engineering synthetic biology circuits, there is still a huge lack of orthogonal Toehold Switch and Trigger pairs. The orthogonal pairs are needed in order to create complex circuits, which require a large amount of logic functions. Yet, finding properly working pairs of Toehold Switches is still difficult, as in-silico methods still require more experimental data to generate well-working Toehold Switch pairs from scratch. Moreover, creating a Toehold Switch pair that is not only working by itself, but also does not cross interact with other pairs is an even more daunting task.
To give an example, if we had 50 working Toeholds and wanted to see how they would interact with each other using currently available methods, we would have to do 2500 separate measurements. For that reason, we want to demonstrate that CAT-Seq allows to measure regulatory part cross-interactions simultaneously and with ease.
Once again, only the first part of general CAT-Seq design needs to be changed - the library preparation. Instead of using a catalytic biomolecule library, a single enzyme is used. Then, libraries need to be prepared - one for Toehold Switches and another for Trigger RNA. The Trigger RNA libraries also require a separate T7 promoter for RNA expression. Then, both of those libraries must be ligated to the enzyme DNA fragment. Resulting library contains fragments which have the same catalytic biomolecule, yet each of them have a random combination of a specific Toehold Switch and RNA Trigger.
After the encapsulation, the droplets which have the correct Trigger RNA and Toehold Switch combination (in which Trigger RNA binds to that specific Toehold Switch), can produce catalytic biomolecules. In turn, those catalytic biomolecules can produce the Product Nucleotides.
