USP_UNIFESP-Brazil,2016,Team:USP UNIFESP-Brazil#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," victims treatments. Then we studied about burns in order to find an interesting enzyme that could solve some problem and we learned that one of the most important problems affecting burn victims is sepsis. In this way, we sought for antimicrobial enzymes and we found the endolysins. Endolysins are very interesting enzymes because they are able to combat multi-resistant bacteria and they are specific, avoiding problems like the antibiotic resistance.
For these reasons our project goal was the spider silk production in microalgae, polymerize silk proteins and endolysins in order to make an antimicrobial silk that would be applied on burn victims to fight sepsis.
Improvement of a previous part
The challenge when working with a new chassis is the development of new tools and parts. In order to access the protein expression efficiency, reporter genes are the state-of-the-art. With that in mind, we decided to improve mCherry characterization ( BBa_J06504 ), a robust fluorescent protein, perfect for accessing the expression systems efficiency (such as ours!) as well as characterizing promoters, terminators and signal peptides. We further characterize this reporter by expressing and codon optimizing it in a new Chassis Chlamydomonas reinihardtii. The full data about our improvements in characterization and function can be found here .
The first improvement in characterization we made was the mCherry analysis and purification by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) . FPLC is an Ion exchange purification that exploit the protein net electrostatic charges, in pH values different from their pI (Isoelectric point). We developed a purification protocol for mCherry. First, we performed a gradient purification to establish the best salt concentration to elute this fluorescent protein.
Gradient Set Up:
Column: Resource Q (6 mL) - GE Healthcare
Buffer A: Sodium Phosphate 50 mM, pH7.5
Buffer B: Sodium Phosphate 50 mM, pH7.5 + 1M NaCl
Equilibration: 2 column volume (CV)
Injection: 0.5mL 40X Concentrate supernatant sample
Gradient length: 20 CV
Flow rate: 5mL/min
Fractionation: 5mL to unbound and 3 mL to the rest of the method
We obtained the following result (Figure 7).

Ok, great. Thanks a lot Jeremy.
Dr. Keenan:
Yeah, good luck with your test, I hope it works out. Good luck for the competition. And if you guys get it somewhere where you think it would be interesting to test out, let us know. It won’t be a big deal for us to take a few of them and compare it against the PCR test we are doing in the field anyway.
Daniel C.:
Yes, that would be great. Thanks! Have a nice day.

Emeritus Prof. Dr. Konrad Sachse is a renowned researcher at the University Jena who played an essential part in characterizing veterinary infections, such as Chlamydia psittaci, as well as developing and refining chlamydial diagnostic methods.
Finding Chlamydory:
Introduction and description of our project.
Prof. Sachse:
Just to handle the debate over the safety of GMOs, [if] they are released into the environment: Will they be able to replicate?
Daniel C.:
Yes they would, but even if we would get a working prototype [the project] would not be finished. We would still have to incorporate kill-switches before the deadline.
Prof. Sachse:
Well that is probably too much. It´s just that you need to find an answer. To show a way how to solve this problem if somebody puts up some regulatory issues, although they never will be pathogenic. I understand they are not pathogenic at all?
Daniel C.:
No, they are not. But officially they have the capacity to undergo mutation and they are E. coli so they can accept pathogenic plasmids. We are just trying to get the prototype working and we can add kill-switches later.

Collaborations
The University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team has aided the High School iGEM team in troubleshooting wet lab experiments, specifically with the assembly of our three constructs Nuclease (BBa_K1792004), Dextranase (BBa_K1792002), and Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000). Advice was given with experiments such as transformations, restriction digests, ligations, minipreps, and construct design.
In addition to our collaboration with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team, we organized and hosted an Alberta wide wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams, Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, and Lethbridge were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of Ligations, Making Competent Cells, Transformations, Minipreps, and Gel Electrophoresis were taught, to name a few.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,". The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.

2. If you were to design a DNA computer (A biological type of computer that encodes DNA sequences as objects and solves complex mathematical problems through molecular computation. It can be seen as a very fast computing machine), what kind of problem would you like to solve?
A Related to life
B Related to commerce
C Related to academic
D Others
 
Conclusion:
For high school students, business and academic may be a little strange, and most of them prefer to use biological knowledge to solve the problems at the aspect of life, just like what we saw in an middle school classroom, the students have a lot of for the small invention creation to solve the daily problem There are also a handful of other alternatives - political or military. Of course, the students are not very clear about the concept of the DNA computer, so in the process of preaching, we gave them a detailed introduction about the DNA computer and the actual function. We believe that they would have a better understanding of the use of DNA computers.

I’m the senior one student from Guangzhou Experimental High School. I'm fond of biology and I have a inquiring mind . I enjoy the combination of science, art and technology when participate in the IGEM team this year and I learn a lot from the process. It’s truly an meaningful experience for me.
Hongxu Lin
I am from the Guangdong Experimental High School, due to the enthusiasm for the cutting-edge scientific researches,I am currently taking part in the igem 2015.
The advanced science thories like relativity and quantum mechanics  attracts me, despite this, after years of brain storming, I have got the idea that the basis of the human research is that we want to have a better life, and therefore, a better world. Nowadays, the earth is facing the great problem of global warming and many other problems. In order to make the world be better, we must secure the bottom line of our survival-----food and inhabitable environment, which has a lot to do with the synthetic biology.
These days, our natural environment is exacerbating, and the development in the space exploration is not enough ------as said in Interstellar, the nearest star is 1000 years away, it is going to take us forever to get there. So it will be a good idea making our planet better instead of  finding another better planet.
After a few times of learning, I get to know that the brand new branch of the biology-------synthetic biology is the key to make our Earth better. The development of synthetic biology is swift once it was founded, the era which artificial biological system research dominates is coming. The revolution is coming, a better world is coming.

Why M&M?
If we want to capture gene expression dynamics and distributions reported by fluorescence, we need to create a chemostat that provide a near-constant environment for the growth of bacteria. The near-constant environment mainly includes two aspects: continuous fresh media to ensure the optimum growth state and constant small populations of bacteria to ensure single-cell resolution in observation. Steady growth state is needed because the oscillation curve is expected to be a near simple harmonic one. Besides, bacteria tend to form biofilm which will lead to the overlapping of cells and create a false impression that the fluorescence increases, and that's why we have to prevent this to maintain a constant bacteria population with single-cell resolution.
What we mentioned above might have covered all aspects we need to consider for communication in a single colony, but if we still want to observe the coupling between colonies we have to create an array that contains many colonies and allows H2O2 to pass through freely.
Among many different techniques, microfluidic array seems to be our best choice with following advantages: 1) Precisely control of flowing rate and cell populations when equipped with syringe pumps;
2) Cells behavior including fluorescence strength can be captured by high resolution microscopy;
3) Trap numbers and dimensions can be adapted to different experimental need;
4) Productive: fewer resources and less time are required when compared with macroscopic cultures.
Design of Microfluidic Array
1.Pretests in ""Swimming Pool""
Before our experiments on the microfluidic array we described before, a series of pretests were done on a chip whose structure looks like many swimming pool on the ground (Fig. 3-1).
Fig. 3-1 A ""Swimming pool"" chip in black field; those white squares (100μm×100μm×100μm) are chambers for bacteria
From the sketch (Fig. 3-2) we can see that the chamber is like a swimming pool where bacteria swim happily in the fresh LB that running from up above, and newly generated cells would be washed away.
Fig. 3-2 Diagram for swimming pool model's working mechanism
A ""swimming pool"" chamber model would have a lager AHL concentration when compared with a ""passage"" chamber because the former one has a minor dilution. According to a published research that the oscillation period will be shorter as the AHL concentration increases. So we assume that it will be more time-consuming to use this ""swimming pool"" model in pretests.
However, this chamber is about 100 μm deep and could grow E. coli far more than"

Legal regulations in the European Union
Figure 1: European risk assessment for a GM plant [1]
The European Union is said to have the strictest regulations concerning GMO´s worldwide. The exact regulations for GM plants can be found in the EU regulatory framework on GMOs . Authorization of any genetically modified plant in the EU can only occur after an extensive and detailed safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority. The findings of the EFSA are then passed on to the European Commission and the member states, to be considered as scientific advice in their decision of authorization.
The safety assessments of GM foods are conducted by the GMO panel, a board of independent scientific experts supported by more than 40 external experts in fields like molecular genetics, microbiology and plant physiology. Each application is considered regarding the following aspects:
Molecular characterization of the product, taking into account the characteristics of the donor and recipient organism
Compositional, nutritional, and agronomic characteristics of the GM product
Potential toxicity and allergenicity of the GM product
Potential environmental impact in case of a release of the GM product
Situation World Wide
Figure 2: Global area of biotech crops in 2009 [2]
To grasp the global situation in food production one has to understand the developments in agriculture in the last centuries. At the beginning of the 19th century the global population ranged at around 1 billion people. The increase in population of around 0.6 billion in the subsequent 100 years could be easily met by expanding the sheer extent of farmland. However this approach became futile very quickly, given the drastically accelerating population increase till an estimated 6.1 billion people in the year 2000. This enormous demand of food, feed and fiber could only be met by increasing the yield of already existing areas under cultivation and facing an estimated world population of around 9.2 billion people in the year 2050 we have to look for"

ZAP: Drs. R.J. van Linschoten (4th September 2018)
One of the first steps when considering upscaling of a process is finding a suitable location for a pilot plant. The province of Groningen is a strong agricultural and industrial area. Therefore, the province can support the conversion of waste streams from biomass into high-end products. ZAP , the Zernike Advanced Processing innovation cluster, is located on the Zernike campus, along with the University of Groningen, the Hanze University of Applied Sciences and a number of companies. This unique location offers a great opportunity to share and increase knowledge. ZAP offers a test environment for bio-based experiments in the northern region of the Netherlands, where they provide the facilities to set up a pilot plant. ZAP is interested in acting upon the need to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. We met with drs. R.J. van Linschoten, director of the Zernike Advanced Processing and discussed the prerequisites for setting up a pilot plant.
The province of Groningen supports the conversion of waste streams into high-end products
NIOZ: Prof. Dr. Klaas Timmermans (27th August 2018)
At present, extensive research is carried out on the culturing of green algae. If green algae can be successfully cultured on the open sea, this provides a virtually unlimited source of cellulose. We arranged a skype meeting with Prof. dr. Klaas Timmermans, Senior scientist ecophysiology of seaweeds, head of Department Estuarine and Delta Systems (EDS) at NIOZ and Honorary Professor at the University of Groningen. NIOZ is the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research, and is involved in research in the Netherlands as well as far beyond the Dutch border on topics such as biology, physics, chemistry and geography. We spoke with Prof. dr. Timmermans about our design and the potential usage of cellulose from green algae for our iGEM project. Currently, green algae are mainly cultured for their proteins and partly for their carbohydrate content. However, cellulose is a residual product at the moment, for which no suitable purpose has been found at NIOZ. In case we can show a proof-of-concept in our iGEM project, we could close the loop in green algae"

Introduction
Feeding all population and doing it sustainably, is a                         major global issue. Biotechnology provides us with                         promising strategies to solve those challenges.                         However, agricultural necessities to efficiently manage                         crops industry, change under different geographical,                         social and other context-depending conditions. From a                         social perspective, living in a globalised world                         implies that one way or another, we are all connected.                         It is our responsibility to positively use those                         connexions.
In HYPE-it, we think that having solutions to problems                         affecting worldwide makes it mandatory to let these                         solutions arrive wherever they are asked. This is the                         reason why our aim is to improve accessibility to                         CRISPR/Cas9, delegating the improvement of crops to                         local institutions which are aware of their                         context-dependent circumstances and necessities.
Why do we study the impact assessments of our                         project on society?
Impact assessment is a process and analysis that makes                         possible to know the positive and negative consequences                         of a proposed project on society, economy and                         environment. The aim is to predict the impacts at an                         early stage in project design, allowing to reduce the                         found adverse impacts, shape the project to suit local                         environment, society and economy and take into account                         the opinions and preferences of relevant                         stakeholders.
HYPE-IT was created in order to overcome some problems                         that significantly make difficult the local                         accessibility of precision genetic engineering                         techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. For us, there is                         a direct connection between society problems and                         project goals. We not only decided to choose this                         project to solve a real problem in society but we also                         made an impact assessment to fully understand the                         problems. This allows us to follow a strategy that will                         make our project to benefit society, economy and                         environment to the greatest extent.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Team#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," is for example a primer designer. The primers are designed by choosing the melting temperature and the binding site of the template sequence. The robot finally creates the sequence of the forward primer (Primer 1) and the reverse Primer (Primer 2). Furthermore, the Software Team supported us in the design and coding of our homepage. In return, our team helped with information about biological interests and cloning procedures and organized the t-shirts and the trip to Boston.
Example for the functioning of the primer designer robot:
 
 
Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team Stockholm
The iGEM Team Stockholm 2010 was interested in using the Freiburg standard 25 and contacted us in order to get information about cloning vectors from our stocks concerning the three pSB1X3-derived BBa_J18901-3 plasmids, as well as the pMA (-BBRF) vector (BBa_K157000) available in the Registry. We made the advice that the Freiburg iGEM 2009 team last year used the pMA vector for almost all cloning steps. The plasmid is small and delivers high yields of plasmid DNA. In comparison to that the larger BBa_J18901-3 plasmids carry two antibiotic resistances making the part assembly more restricted.
Community outreach in collaboration with BIOSS and Europa Park
The sience days at Europa Park take place every year making sciences attractive for young people. Pupils of different ages take a look in sciences by doing practical experiments and playing games. In association with BIOSS we prepared a game for the younger kids, in which they could actively join in. The game gives the kids an imagination about a cells inner life by playing the role of kinases, phosphatases and signalling proteins. In addition, we made questionnaires and tested the knowledge of the pupils in biology.

SCUT-ChinaA,2018,Team:SCUT-ChinaA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in emerging bio-industries (such as organisms) Fuel, bio-based chemicals, bio-materials have a certain foundation, but the production technology of new products is relatively scarce; China mainly produces high value-added chemicals (such as fine chemicals, pharmaceutical chemicals and intermediates) by chemical methods. The pollution is serious; foreign companies monopolize most of the domestic market in the field of enzyme preparation, while domestic enterprises not only produce more limited enzymes, but also have low production levels; high-pollution industries represented by textile, paper, metallurgy and mining are wide coverage, consume energies heavily, and of serious pollution."
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"lysis. cGMP's balance equation is:
d[cGMP]/dt = VsGC,maxD2- VPDE,max[cGMP]/(Km,PDE+[cGMP])
Inside,VsGC,max represents cGMP's maximum production rate when D2=1, which means all avaliable enzyme molecules participated in catalysis.VPDE,max is cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation rate.VsGC,maxis directly proportional to sGC's total concentration[D0], and D0 is constant in our model. Consequently, cGMP's production rate and degradation rate are:
Vp=VsGC,maxD2
and
Michaelis constant Km,PDE is measured in experiment by Turko et al. Recent studies show, during the process of hydrolyzation the basic level of PDE5A's bioactivation is relatively low. However, after cGMP combining NH2-end structure regulation by itself, this bioactivation is greatly improved(up to 9-11 times). Through cGMP, PDE5A's activated process can be discribed as PDEinact + cGMP↔ PDEact. Therefore, active PDE5A's concentration depends on the level of cGMP which because VPDE,max is directly proportional to active PDE5A's total concentration in Michaelis kinetics. Meanwhile, we suggest that active PDE5A's concentration is nearly proportional to cGMP's concentration. It's a reasonable approximation, if active PDE5A's level is relatively high, cGMP's level is relatively high accordingly. Thus, we consider cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation VPDE,max is directly proportional to [cGMP]:

Ethics and SynBio
Synthetic Biology is a novel area of biology that builds upon the field of biotechnology. However, that does not answer the question what is synthetic biology? A definition upon which everyone can agree has yet to be found but some popular ones include:
A new area of biological research that combines science and engineering in order to design and build (""synthesize"") novel biological functions and systems or;
The design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.
Along with the biological and technological problems of synthetic biology, there are also issues of ethics, the environment, legalities, education, and biosafety. The Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team project focuses around microcompartments, nanoparticles and the biobattery and we have though long and hard about the E3LS issues that could arise from a project such as ours. Our long-term goal is to create an efficient and cost effective biological battery. This self-sustaining battery will fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when supplied with water and sunlight, thus acting as a carbon negative source to make our biobattery environmentally beneficial. However, first our photosynthetic bacteria must be optimized with microcompartments, which could also be beneficial as a drug delivery system in the future.  The third component of our project is the production of nanoparticles of uniform size and shape that can also be used by medical and diagnostic sciences. However, methods to produce such nanoparticles are cost intensive and require extreme conditions to make. However, there is a protein, mms6, from Magnetopirillium magneticum, which is important in controlling the morphology of such particles. Our team will be introducing a novel method for the mass production of uniform nanoparticles that will be environmentally friendly, and much more cost efficient. As you can see the Lethbridge 2009 iGEM team project will be environmentally and"

Message sequence in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930001 )
The iGEM team Groningen 2016 worked on bioencryption in order to safely store data in DNA. In our project we were mainly working with two sequences of DNA which were the encrypted message sequence and the encryption key sequence. The message sequence was created by our software. It is therefore artificial DNA. We ordered the encryption message sequence as gBlock from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies). To submit our message sequence as BioBrick ( BBa_K1930001 ) we cloned it in the pSB1C3 standard iGEM backbone.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: The message sequence was amplified from pDR111+message plasmid.    Primers used for the amplification were message prefix and message    suffix (primer sequences can be found here ).

Conclusion:
Amplification of the message sequence and addition of the prefix and    suffix to this sequence was successful. It was verified by DNA    electrophoresis. Correct size of a band could be seen and    that was 599 bp.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit – (Jena Bioscience) .

If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by"

Overview
Escherichia coli is the organism of choice for synthetic biology. It is thoroughly characterised, easy to engineer and has numerous parts, control circuits and complex constructs tested in this host.
Some E. coli strains have evolved to produce low amounts of cellulose but the machinery under specific regulatory control (its secretion is generally linked to biofilm formation and stress situations). In order to expand the use of bacterial cellulose as a functional biomaterial that is cost effective to produce, it is desirable for its production machinery to be implemented in an organisms that is easy to engineer and has proven success in large scale bioreactors.
Here, we confirm that the high output cellulose production machinery of Gluconacetobacter Xylinus can be transferred into other organisms. We have proven function of the Acs cellulose producing operon in Escherichia coli using Congo Red binding assays.
Key Achievements

From inception, our project aimed to produce a cheap, portable and effective screening tool for diseases. A large barrier to this is the quantification of fluorescence from our genetic circuit. We therefore set out to build a cheap and portable fluorometer.
Our combined fluorometer and densitometer allows our paper based test to be used in the field, in remote areas or less developed countries. It also provides a way for high schools and community labs that cannot afford a plate reader to quantify fluorescence and optical density.

Previous designs
Initially, we built a fluorometer using the previous design by the Aachen 2014 and Denver Biolabs 2016 teams. Their fluorometer uses an Arduino board, 2 LEDs, 2 light sensors, 2 breadboards and an LCD screen.
The light sensors output a square wave with frequency proportional to light intensity. The Arduino uses this to calculate either optical density or fluorescence. These readings are displayed on the LCD screen.
Alleyn’s School kindly allowed us use of their laser cutter to produce the casing and their 3D printer to produce the cuvette holder (as mentioned on our attributions page ). Denver Biolabs' box design was fiddly to put together and was overcomplicated, so in the end we opted to not use it as we didn’t think the extra time, money and resources spent to make it were worth it.
The circuits in the previous designs were unnecessarily complicated. We simplified the circuit by removing excess wiring and components. This made the fluorometer far easier to build, troubleshoot and modify further.

We initially used the TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) from the parts registry and added a lacI promoter and RBS ( BBa_J04500 ) upstream of it. However, since these TALEs were initially used in eukaryotic cells, they have a Kozak sequence at the start of the TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ), which prevents the expression of these proteins. To improve the part and make it useful to everyone using E. coli as a chassis, we removed the Kozak sequence from the TALEs. All the parts that we submitted to the registry have the Kozak sequence removed"
Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed about twice the amount of fumaric acid (20 g/kg DMI) to cattle as that used in the more recent study (12 g/kg DMI) and, surprisingly, methane production decreased by 23%. However, in that study, only two animals per treatment were used, and methane measurements were made using ventilated hoods, which are known to be problematic. Also note there were differences between basal diets in the studies. This influences the microbiomes and may affect the outcome of the study. The figure below shows the theoretical framework made by iGEM UNL, that demonstrates the diversion of hydrogen away from the methanogens and to the process of fumarate production which in turn produces succinate and propionate. It is known that the higher the propionate to acetate ratio, the less methane the cow produces (Mcginn et al. , 2004).
Figure 3. The theoretical framework of  the effect of fumarate on methane synthesis in the ruminants. The synthesis of succinate out of fumarate competes for H 2 with the synthesis of methane. With a reduced concentration of substrate H 2 for methane synthesis reaction, less methane will be formed. (Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010))
Strategies to overcome the problem of anaerobic production
Another way to get fumarate into in the microbiome of cattle would be to have bacteria produce fumarate in a bioreactor, and then dry and directly mix them with cattle feed. This way, there is no need to extract fumarate from the cell mixture and we also overcome the problem of anaerobic production. We could try to test different types of microorganisms and see which would be the most efficient and cost-effective at producing fumarate. Once the cells have produced enough fumarate, we, dry them and feed them to the cattle. We could compare the proposed E. Coli mutants, that produce fumaric acid and cyanobacterial cells from iGEM team Amsterdam that produce fumarate and see which one is more efficient at producing and delivering fumarate. As we aim to reduce greenhouse gasses in both our projects, we think it would be sensible to define the most efficient producer as the one that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2"

Though the         changes are more significant in high capillary numbers, where droplet formation is driven by viscosity. In our         case, the capillary number was relatively small (Ca ≈ 0.034), so the flow was more surface tension-dominated.         The simulation was run with a set of different OA phase dynamic viscosity values (Tab. 3) and results are         presented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

Fig. 7 Sphere radius dependency on viscosity ratio λ. Graph shows the simulated results of liposome     radius for every given viscosity parameter, which here are depicted as ratio between viscosities of IA and OA     phases. In our simulated range of parameters the radius varies from 5.08 µm to 6.75 µm.
Fig. 8 Sphere diameter dependence on viscosity ratio λ. Simplified graph shows that sphere size     increases linearly up until λ = 1 and viscosity regulation above this value results in less changes.
As we see, droplet size increases almost linearly up to λ = 0.996, meaning that increasing viscosity of OA phase         leads to formation of smaller liposomes. However, it should be noted that by increasing viscosity in real life,         we may encounter other problems, such as impeded droplet formation or liposomes bursting due to differences in         osmotic pressure between inside and outside environments. Given these limitations, we can still effectively         control our liposome size in about 1µm range. Thus, we can conclude that viscosity ratio, while having a             moderate effect, is still not a decisive parameter in vesicle size determination.
Liposome size dependency on velocity ratio V
Flow rates of our fluids were easiest and fastest to control as a parameter, so they certainly needed to be         studied more deeply. The flow of the continuous phase here was fixed, so the"

Wiki session with Team Hannover
fig. 1: Team photo with three members of Team Hannover
An essential role for the final evaluation of the iGEM projects is given through the team wiki. Because of the first participation of Team Hannover we decided to make a wiki meeting. Therefore three team members of Team Hannover visited us at the CeBiTec.
We prepared the meeting by creating a small leaflet which we distributed at the beginning. We decided to show them some basics in HTML because we think this is the easiest way to learn how to alter the wiki. One of us demonstrated HTML code examples using the notepad program of Windows. Our whole team and the delegation of Hannover tried to reproduce it. By doing this step by step all of us learned basic strategies in HTML like altering text, creating images or tables and using styles.
In between we had a lunch break and were supplied with delicious cake. With new strength we started to modify the wiki itself.
fig. 2: Everyone is working on a task
We began to structure the existing code by creating style files (.css) and code templates (.tmpl) which were slowly changed step by step. We took care one by one so that the members of Team Hannover could try out their ideas while asking us for help. After this successful session the wiki of Team Hannover got a new appearance and they were pretty happy about the assistance we gave them.

Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

Of these parameters, 6/8 are transcription or translation terms which have been characterized in the sections above. This leaves us with two parameters: The EtnR1 Phosphorylation rate constant and the Hill coefficient for the DNA binding activity of EtnR1. These two values have the a) largest impact on the overall results and b) are uncharacterized, and thus should be the target of any future optimization of our biosensor.
The full sensitivity analysis output for all parameters is summarized in the matrix below. The sensitivities are represented by a colour scale in arbitrary units.
Conclusions
How do these findings affect our biosensor?
Due to the ambiguous nature of the ethylene receptor system and lack of existing literature on the topic, it was not possible to completely characterize the signalling cascade within the constraints of the iGEM project.
However, our model provides a hypothesis with which we can compare future results to. If graphs of experimental concentration vs time course match the shape of our model, it provides stronger evidence that the signalling cascade behaves as we have predicted. If it does not, the differences in the graphs may give us direction in making constructive changes to our mathematical model.
The sensitivity analysis showed us that among all the unknown parameters, only two important processes have a significant impact on the biosensor output: EtnR1 phosphorylation and its corresponding DNA binding activity. In future characterization, these two parameters should be specifically targeted to save time and resources.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," information and pictures were from iGEM wiki. We made this exhibition following the lecture to improve our HP effects.
Campus fair game was the most important part in order to enhance the interest and improve the popularization of knowledge of biosafety via playing. It was just like a lively and learning garden party which was composed with three parts—Riddles written on lanterns，Foldit computer games and finding the differences between DNA molecules.
In the first game, we find some riddles about gene and biology and wrote them on lanterns. Most riddles were related to basic knowledge of biosafety and lab skills. If the participant could find the answer then he would win a prize. Foldit, a computer game loved by the high school students since they can learn from entertainment, folds proteins and tests their stabilities with four people competing in it. Finding the differences between DNA molecules, is to find two or three differences between two analogous DNA pictures. From this game participants could be aware of DNA structure more deeply and practice their precision. We accumulated every students’ points and the final top 10 won the prize.
Our special prize is the cards——Bio Bang, which was inspired by War Within Three Kingdoms, which are very popular in China. And only those who were top 10 on the scoring list could get one deck. Some high school students even play the cards with our plain guidance, making us think it’s an interesting and enjoyable game. Participants hoped that we could send  them more cards and give them designing pictures. From this game we had a better interaction. More details are in the next section.
Finally, our team organized a special interaction for these high school students. We show them our culture strains so that they can get close to real germiculture out of lab. Of course we’ve paid much attention on biosafety and no potential damage to the environment or public occurred.
After the campus fair games as well as the exhibition, these senior high school students signed on our whiteboard and had a group photo taken with us at our request. We made informal interviews with some of them and get a satisfactory feedback. They wished we could hold the activities next year and they would try their best to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM. A student, from Shaowu No.1 Middle School of Fujian, expressed his hope that we could come to their hometown to help people in the countryside to get a correct understanding of genetic engineering. As I know, some people even regard transgenosis as poisons. This is also our hope that more and more people can learn something about transgenic products via this competition and have a"

1. Introduction
To realize our farming project, we improved a phosphate sensor part since the existing phosphate sensor part does not have sufficient data (OUC-China 2012, BBa_K737024 ). Our part ( BBa_K1139201 , Fig. 3-5-1) includes the inducible promoter of the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA) derived from E.coli (Dollard et al., 2003). The phoA promoter is repressed by high phosphate concentrations. Fig. 3-5-2 shows the regulation of the phoA promoter in brief.  The phoA promoter is regulated by phoB and phoR, which belong to the pho regulon (Shinagawa et al., 1983). Phosphorylated PhoB directly activates the expression of phoA. Under conditions of phosphate limitation, PhoR phosphorylates PhoB. On the other hand, under conditions of high phosphate concentrations, PhoR dephosphorylate phospho-PhoB (Hsieh et al., 2010). We amplified the phoA promoter from E. coli (MG1655). We ligated this promoter upstream"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," in the computer programming language MATLAB, utilising an implementation made by MATLAB user Nezar.
For the runs simulating dormancy, deterministic initial values were used and the system was run for 30 minutes without activation of the inserted toxin promoter. This resulted in a stochastic distribution of initial values mimicking variations between cells. Analysis showed, that 30 minutes was enough for the model to find a stable distribution, which is realistic considering the growth cycle of an E. coli cell.
For the runs simulating activation, the data generated at the end of a dormancy run was used as initial value and deactivated expression of RelE. When the concentration of free RelE decreases to below 15 copies, a cell is considered active. This value was probably set too low, but tests displayed marginal difference between 15 and 45 copies, where the lower limit was chosen to decrease uncertainty of the cell state.
All runs simulated 1000 cells, which should be sufficient to get stable averages and the model assumed well-mixed conditions in every cell and considered each cell independently. Furthermore, the model has no cut-off for maximum values of RelE, as the exact relation between RelE concentration and dormancy state is unknown, yet a functional cut-off was found through activation times.

Dr. Eric Denes, as well as Dr. Evelyn Poli and Dr. Christelle, were very interested in our project. They are currently designing new materials in ceramic, titanium, and stainless-steel to test the bacterial adhesion on their prostheses. They warned us about the use of metals for the prostheses since S. aureus and P. aeruginosa tend to form biofilms easily on metals rather than on ceramic. They are also using Gentamicin and Vancomycin charged implants to cure infections. Their system does have a long half-life time (4 days) whereas our biofilm could be a longer-term solution.
IRAMIS
IRAMIS is at the Saclay Institute of Matter and Radiation and is the second institute in size of the CEA Fundamental Research Division. Inside IRAMIS there are projects directly linked to nanoscience for the technology of information and health, the interaction between matter, radiation and low-carbon energy applications.
Interview with Dr. Bernard Geffroy
We contacted Dr. Bernard Geffroy to learn more about OLED and to see if we could integrate the technology he is currently working on inside the prosthesis. It could be a way to let the patient know if S. aureus is present at the junction site of its osseointegrated prosthesis. Dr. Bernard Geffroy did go along the sayings of Mr. Jean-Pascal Hons Olivier on our project, mentioning it as being a bit innovative for now on. At first, we wanted to know if he thought the integration of a flexible screen inside the prosthesis, letting the patient know at every moment his/her health data, was possible. Dr. Bernard Geffroy did applaud for our ideas but doesn’t think this technology would be on the market for at least 10 or 20 years. He did redirect our ideas towards the use of OLEDs and color codes and was really interested in the following of our project.
Dr. Bernard Geffroy is currently working at the IRAMIS on OLED and flexible panels technology. OLED stands for Organic Light-Emitting Diode, in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent#MBPconstruction_-_-_TEXT.html," Structure based sequence similarity of various metal responsive regulators of MerR family. CadR: cadmium, CueR: copper, ZntR: zinc, MerR: mercury, PbrR:lead. Those amino acids showed in bold are metal binding sites according to solved crystal structures [5] or mutagenesis analysis [8]. The metal binding site of CadR or PbrR can be speculated based on the high similarity of MerR family and the geometry of ligand field of metal ions.
METAL BINDING PEPTIDE (MBP) CONSTRUCTION
To achieve the goal of making a high performance MBP, we constructed a single polypeptide consisting of two dimerization helixes and metal binding loops of MerR, to form an antiparallel coiled coil MBP mimicking the dimerized metal binding domains of the wild-type as described in Fig 2. We amplified the N-terminal and C-terminal of MBP directly from full length MerR by PCR, and then cloned them into the backbone together in one step (Fig. 4).

Figure 3. MBP Construction procedure. A: Standard part. B. Expression detection part.
To be specific, the entire coding region of the MBP for standard part was amplified by PCR from full length MerR with two pairs of primers. Two of these primers encoded a three-residue bridge, SSG, which does not occur in MerR and was added to afford some flexibility in the loop connecting the two dimerization helix (fig. 1). The two PCR products were digested with EcoR I / BamH I, or BamH I / Pst I and cloned into EcoR I / Pst I -digested pSB1K3 in one step (fig. 3A), which was verified by DNA sequencing.
Based on the same strategy, MBP-His6 was constructed by using two different pairs of primers, which is used for MBP expression test by western blot. The two PCR products were digested with Nde I / BamH I, or BamH I / Xho I and cloned into Nde I / Xho I -digested pET 21a, which contains a region encoding six histines, in one step to construct pET 21a – MBP (fig. 3B), which was verified by DNA sequencing.

Collaborations with other teams
Nowadays, collaboration is a very important part for any successful project and iGEM is no exception. This summer, four iGEM team were working in the Zhejiang University Zijinguang Camps, including ZJU-China, ASTWS-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited and us. This advantage let us communicate and cooperate easily. Furthermore, for education and public engagement events,  we have cooperated with more teams, such as Worldshaper-Wuhan, ZJUT-China and Jiangnan, some of which were even based in other province.
Collaboration on Interlab study
As high school teams, ASTWS-China, HFLS_ZhejiangUnited and us were all lack of using experiences of plate reader, moreover, neither of our labs had this equipment. Therefore, after discussion, we decided to borrow the plate reader as well as the take interlab measurement together, Dr. Huang Fangliang, the instructor of ASTWS-China team agreed to supervise the experiments.
During the interlab measurement experments, we provided the ASTWS-China team with E. coli DH5a and 100μl silicon beads of better quality as well as gave HFLS team the transcriptional shaking table bacteria solution and some experimental equipment (chloramphenicol resistance, micro pipette tips, etc.). When our measurement data submission was refused by the Measurement Committee, both of these two teams helped us analysis the potential problems, and offered us the glycerin bacteria that we needed.
Collaboration on project research
During the experiments on project, despite visiting laboratory and discussion question, which happened quite often, we have many collaborations with other three teams in Zhejiang University, both on experimental materials and techniques. For example, because of unsuccessful transformation DNA parts  from official distribution kits, we lent our Kit1 and Kit 2 to team ASTWS-China, and borrowed Kit3 and Kit5 from all other three teams and bacteria with pSB1C3-GFP from AST"

Several other SDS PAGE gels were ran (not shown) with different conditions. To account for the possibility that the TLP is insoluble, cell extract was boiled in SDS and loaded onto a gel. No significant difference in protein expression was found between the control and TLP culture.
A bacterial secretion system was created (BBa_K2477009) to attempt to secrete TLP. The culture supernatant was concentrated and loaded onto a gel along with boiled cell extract. Again, no significant banding difference could be visualized with SDS-PAGE.
From these results, we considered that the TLP expression could have been too low to be visualized on a gel. We then pursued two options--creating a new part with TLP under the control of a T7 promoter, and running a Western Blot. Due to time constraints, we were unable to assemble the T7 controlled TLP part in time for testing.
Western Blot
Using anti-His tag antibodies, we performed a Western Blot to see if our TLP was being expressed. We used a positive control of GFP with a histidine tag and a negative control of a construct without a histidine tag. We did not see any expression of TLP.
Efficacy of TLP as an antifungal
We planned to test the ability of TLP and the TLP-producing E. coli to inhibit fungal growth or cause fungal death. To do this, we initially planned to perform a disc-diffusion assay with our purified protein product and F. oxysporum and qualitatively measure difference in fungal growth between that and a control. We planned to plate the fungus and add a drop of either a purified protein product or control (positive and negative) onto filter paper around the edge of the fungal growth (for growth inhibition) and in the fungal culture (for death).
Our next step would have been to repeat this procedure, but use a cell lysate instead of protein product. This test would be to determine if our bacteria could produce enough TLP to have an effect on F. oxysporum.
Following that, our final test would be to grow E. coli with the F. oxysporum on plates and observe any fungal growth inhibition or death beyond that observed in a negative control. This test would be to determine if our bacteria had antifungal properties.

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," biomarkers, since cancer cells have a more rapid turnover and tend to shed such vesicles (e.g. due to necrosis). However, this is currently at the research stage.
Technological choices
Biomarkers detection is a field largely explored both by iGEM teams and industrials. Mostly used techniques rely on antibodies. Developing antibodies-based tests has some drawbacks: lengthy and pricey process of identification and production, short shelf-life… innovations are needed to develop more frugal tests.
Our main innovation relies on the use of aptamers technology. Aptamers are short single stranded nucleic acids. They basically act as antibodies. They have numerous advantages. Compared to antibodies, the processes of selection and production of aptamers are quicker, easier, and cheaper. Aptamers can be synthesized by pure chemistry, whereas antibodies need complex eukaryotic chassis to be produced. Aptamers are an user-friendly technology! They also have the advantage to be easily chemically modifiable. Three kinds of BioBricks were constructed and sent to the registry to build our detection device:
target generators (protein subunits of the HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase and HBsAg, biomarker of Hepatitis B, deposited parts BBa_K1934060 and BBa_K1934061)
anchor allowing the fixation of the aptamer to the paper: our biological detection system needs to be anchored on paper. An existing fusion protein (part BBa_K1499004) could do that, but it was not characterised, so we improved it and tested it fully.
Learn more about aptamers
How did we do it?
Two approaches were developed during this project. First, a detection system based on fluorescence. It worked well, but we realized it could not be used at home. The second approach was a detection system based on latex beads.
A first aptamer is covalently linked to the latex beads. After adding the sample onto the beads, they migrate on a paper strip. On this paper strip there are also complementary aptamers which recognize a different epitope of the biomarker. If the target is present in the sample, it will be taken in sandwich between the aptamers on the beads and the fixed aptamers. A visible black band will progressively appear, due to the beads’ coloration. If the target is not present, beads will be unable to form this sandwich and won't be stopped.
A control is also needed. So after the detection band there is also a control band made with complementary strands of the DNA on the beads. Just by base-pairing the beads will be"

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.
We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

We run the electrophoresis gel to check if this time we have done it correctly.
Everything was OK except the AtrΔ11 (3), which had some partial digestion. It was the reason we sent AtrΔ11 (6) to sequence.

3.6 Magnetic modelling
To test the supermagnetic behavior of our E.coli containing iron-loaded ferritin, we placed strong permanent neodym-magnets N45 (1.32-1.37 T) under the petri dish and observed under light microscope the movement of the cells towards the magnets. After excluding contamination of magnetized particles outside the cell, we could conclude that our E.Coli. were successfully magnetized.  In order to achieve the maneuverability of the cells, by controlling the magnetic fields, different geometries of electromagnets were tried.  These consisted in the iron core of a microwave, metal rods and nails with different permeability with a corresponding coil. Pure iron is difficult to find.  The magnetic force acting on the cells is proportional to its magnetic moment μ and the gradient of the magnetic field ∇B:
Already with a magnetic field of 0.5T, the native ferritin is saturated (Gossuin et., 2009) and its magnetic moment is reported to be between 250 and 400 μ_B (Brem et al., 2006).  Doing a Finite Element Analysis with the software Ansoft Maxwell for the gradient of the magnetic field of a simple electromagnet, rectangle with coil, we made the qualitative and already intuitive observation that the gradient was stronger at the edges. This was confirmed by the paper (Hoke, C. Dahmani et al., 2008) in which multiple possible magnet forms were simulated in order to maximize a high field Gradient. The simulation was performed with COMSOL. It was found that the best configuration for a higher gradient was a loop with a tip at one end and a flat surface at the other end.  So the best and easiest option for our application should be a curved nail.  The relevant equations for the simulation were ∇xH = J and ∇B = 0 with the relation B = μ_0 μ_r H.  The magnetic vector potential A produces the governing equation of the magnetostatics mode:
It follows that the basic input parameters are the relative permeability of the magnet and the external current density. For the Comsol simulation in this paper an external current density of 1.9e6 A/m^2 and a relative permeability of 4*10^3 (iron) were chosen. As a result, a B-field of 1"

Fig1. shows no growth :( One of the many lessons we have learned this year is that science doesn’t always go as intended.
Information on our experiments
Each plasmid was provided to our team in distribution kit plate 2 (wells 1O and 17D), as an insert in pSB1C3.
The first round of testing we transformed DH5𝛼 by heat shock using 2 µL of resuspended plasmid (200-300 pg/µL) as recommended on the iGEM website.
Bacteria were plated on chloramphenicol plates (30 µg/mL) that had been previously prepared.
These were incubated overnight at 37°C.
When no growth was observed, a second transformation was attempted.
This was done using the remaining 8µL of DNA and plated on freshly made 25 µg/mL CAM plates on the suspicion that the previous plates contained a concentration of antibiotic that was too high for the expression of resistance conferred by the pSB1C3 backbone.
Once again, no growth was observed.
Hypotheses as to why these experiments did not produce the results required
The CAM resistance provided by the pSB1C3 plasmid was either not expressed, or was too weak for the concentration of antibiotic that we used.
Our kit plate samples may have been left at room temperature or dry for too long and thus the DNA did not suspend/transform appropriately.
Particularly for sample BBa_K880002, other factors may have been needed and the particular method that we used to test the activity was inappropriate as we did not understand the functionality of the part.
We hope to learn from the experiments conducted this year so that future New Zealand teams make a positive impact on the registry."

BioBrick Conjugation into Shewanella oneidensis
In order to assess whether our BioBricks would function in our chassis organism Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 we attempted to transform and express two BioBricks into S. oneidensis MR-1; J04450 containing a gene for the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and K584001 which contains a gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These BioBricks were chosen as they contain reporter genes and successfully transformed colonies could be easily identified under UV light.

Now we can clearly see the difference of the intensity by eye but have't figure a way to precisely quantivate it.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," quite surprising because obviously one’s research cannot be patented if based on protected materials. This statistic is very interesting as it shows how much most of the iGEM community’s actors do not know their legal rights concerning the IP.
Opinions on the patentability of BioBricks
Two questions were asked to the participants :
Do you think BioBricks CAN be patented in your country ?
And do you think they SHOULD be patentable ?
To the first question both opinions were equally represented. Nevertheless, it would have been interesting to know the country for each answer, even if the IP legislation is quite similar in most of the represented countries.
However, to the question “Should BioBricks be patentable ?”, more than a half (56%) answered “no”. This is probably linked to the fact that most iGEM competitors already use them without paying a license, so that they completely oppose such an idea. It also points out that most iGEM team members support the iGEM knowledge policy, which makes us believe that they would be inclined to acknowledge iGEM as a commons and would favorably respond to the changes resulting from the common reflexion we proposed at the end of the first part of this human practice study.
Different ways to get to know the IP protection procedures
The iGEM competitors who planned to get their work protected used different ways to approach applying for IP protections. Three tendencies come forth : they did so by talking inside their team (to the graduate student advisor, to another team member or / and to a faculty advisor), but also outside of it (to an industry expert, to a member of the university’s commercialization office or to a legal professional). The last tendency was to search on the Internet.
These inclinations are more or less equally represented in this poll, so that it does not reveal many things. The only really interesting point which has to be put forward is that most iGEM competitors who want to apply for IP protections do make some research on it, which emphasizes the complexity of such procedures and the lack of knowledge they probably had.
Conclusion
Our work with the University of British Colombia made us realize how often the intellectual property rights interfered with the different iGEM teams’ project. Nonetheless, we were disconcerted when we found out the patents were not the main problem. Indeed, their source was copyrights and trademarks .
Besides, this survey deepened our main reflexion (q.v. part I) as it emphasized the problems due to the superimposition of the commons and the patent models. It also highlighted the global lack of knowledge of the iGEMers upon"

GES_NCSU_Raleigh_NC,2014,Team:GES NCSU Raleigh NC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," with responsible innovation, we hope to facilitate this type of responsiveness. Much like deliberative mapping (Burgess, Stirling, Clark, Davies, Eames, Staley & Williamson, 2007), collaborative modeling helps to open up space for dialogue that incorporates diverse values, promotes understanding, and enables broader agreement on the causes of problems (Cockerill, Daniel, Malczynski & Tidwell, 2009). By prompting people to reflect on their core values, our tool may help users develop reflective equilibrium by harmonizing their belief systems and actions (Deplazes, Ganguli-Mitra & Biller-Andorno, 2009, p. 72).
At the iGEM competition, we will present the first version of our tool, which includes two parts: a concept map and a digital app . The concept map outlines principles that can guide responsible innovation, such as meeting regulatory requirements , preserving human health and safety, advancing innovation, and promoting social equity. The app helps users identify which of these principles they value most by asking them to weigh the importance of a series of statements that speak to each principle. This first version of the tool prompts users to articulate values related to advancing entrepreneurship and innovation , securing public legitimacy and trust , and promoting biodiversity . Over time, we will also add additional measures. After completing the weighing process, users can return to the concept map to learn more about various principles. In future versions, we plan to integrate the concept map and the app into a single interactive online tool.
Throughout the competition, we will be inviting fellow competitors and judges to test drive the current version of our tool by exploring the concept map and weighing the values statements that are included in our app . The data that we collect through this research will help us improve the tool, while also contributing to ongoing discussions about the governance of emerging technologies, and specifically, the governance of synthetic biology.
Methods and Assumptions
Drawing on the diversity of our team (which includes PhD students in Genetics; Public Administration; Public Policy; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology; Entomology; Communication; and Computer Science), we used a concept-mapping approach to develop a research question and identify an initial list of criteria needed to answer our question (Novak & Cañas, 2008), then conducted a series of literature reviews to refine and build upon this list. We used Cmap concept mapping software to incorporate the revised set of criteria into an interactive online concept map and developed an app that enables users to weigh our principles according to their own value systems. Finally, the developers of The Glowing Plant tested the tool and"

Our vision
After finishing our two main projects, we envision several ways to continue what we have started.
For our first project “metabolic channeling using dCas9” we could:
1. Optimize
Optimization is of course an important next step and stands at the center of our overall project. Metabolic channeling is supposed to increase the effectiveness of enzymes and an even greater performance by optimization is a natural next step. This could be achieved by trying different spacer lengths to find the optimal distance between channeled enzymes. Also, an easy, fast and cheap way to assemble the low and high copy machinery for metabolic channeling is desirable.
2. Varying the pathways
An increased Auxin output is a good and easy way to show a proof of concept but that’s not what our project is aimed at. Trying different enzyme pathways with different numbers of enzymes will also help optimize the overall process. Also, the final goal is to improve overall output of enzymatic products in real world fields like medicine, food industry and production.
3. Streamlining
The end goal of metabolic channeling via dCas9 would be applications in industry. For that we would need to streamline the process of adding desired enzymes and corresponding target sequences to the low and high copy plasmids. A creation kit with pre-assembled scaffolds and only the specific enzymes to be added would greatly improve the distribution process in research institutions and industry.
Our second project “metabolic channeling using LLPS in yeast” could be continued in:
1. E.coli
We used yeast to demonstrate LLPS because of the size of the droplets to be formed. Although the formation was successful we got a first-hand experience why yeast is not easy to work with"

For that reason this device has to be as user friendly as possible, the application should only differ in a very small way from today’s application and the price should be in the same range like before. If they take care of these purposes and still maintain the ecological part, the products can have a chance on the global market
Special Events
NRW Day
Figure 1: Presenting our project in Düsseldorf
This year the state North-Rhine Westphalia celebrated its 70th birthday, with event days for the public, in its capital Düsseldorf. Because of that, the iGEM Team Düsseldorf invited members of our team and other iGEM teams from North Rhine Westphalia to come to Düsseldorf. Here we were given the possibility to present our project idea to the public and to talk about the advantages of synthetic biology. This gave us the chance to review our project and integrate the opinions, fears and ideas from other people. We want to thank the iGEM team Düsseldorf for organizing this.
Future Lab Gala
Future lab is a gala organized by different institutes and organizations in Aachen to present Aachen as the perfect place for research, science and industry. During this gala, the participants presented themselves with the help of scientific experiments, art, and speeches. It was a great opportunity for us to get in touch with politicians, people from the industry, and different universities and to tell them about iGEM and our project.

Annual meeting of DECHEMA
Figure 3: Presenting our project at DECHEMA convention
In September, the team from Göttingen and us, the iGEM Team Aachen, were invited to the “DECHEMA Jahrestagung”. The “Society for Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology” gave us a slot to present our project in front of a scientific audience. Our presentations were included in the “Zukunftsforum”, a subitem of the conference with focus on the future perspective and strategies for the biotechnological industry in Germany.  We are thankful for the opportunity to establish a dialogue with the scientific community and practice our presentational skills for the Giant Jamboree.

Secondly, in order to make our lemon ripe like a real lemon, we decided to take advantage of the designing of the fusion protein by using a translational suppression system. Indeed, we plan to add amber codons within the linker separating the yellow and the blue chromoproteins. Therefore, the expression of a suppressor t-RNA will suppress amber codons allowing the translation of the green fusion chromoprotein. Conversely, the down regulation of the suppressor t-RNA through time will allow bacteria switch from green to yellow, thus simulating the ripening of a real lemon. This system will be referred to as the color switch system.
The green fusion chromoprotein design
Promoter & RBS
Because the ripening of the lemon will be achieved by the regulation of the expression of the suppressor t-RNA, the fusion chromoprotein has been placed under control of a constitutive promoter. To ensure that E. coli produces a robust color, we chose the RBS BBa_B0034 (strength = 1) and the “consensus” promoter BBa_J23119.
Chromoproteins
Uppsala iGEM team 2013 already designed several chromoproteins such as the FwYellow (BBa_K1033910) and the AeBlue chromoproteins (BBa_K1033902) [1]. We chose to fuse these chromoproteins so it should produce a green color.
Linker
Linkers are short sequences usually containing flexible amino-acid such as glycine and serine to ensure that two proteins domain are correctly folded and avoid steric issues. Thus, a linker of 12 amino acids that repeat a motif of glycine-glycine-serine-glycine (BBa_K243006) has been used to separate both FwYellow and AeBlue chromoproteins. Furthermore, to permit the color switch by the translational suppression system, we plan to replace two serine codons from the linker by amber codons (TAG). Choosing to add two amber codons would ensure a low stop codon readthrough in absence of the t-RNA.
Terminator
To end the transcription of the fusion chromoprotein, a commonly used terminator BBa_B0010 is added.
