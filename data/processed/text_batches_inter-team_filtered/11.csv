Duke,2009,Team:Duke_-_-_TEXT.html,"g/ml) plates. Successful insertion of phaCAB was shown by Nile Red fluorescence in colonies (Figure 4).
4HB genetic pathway
The cat2 gene was inserted into the pSOS vector to obtain the pSOS-cat2 construct. To obtain 4HB production, though, the phaC gene must also be expressed. The 4HB precursor γ-butyrolactone (GBL) is required for 4HB production in this pathway, as the 4HB precursor does not naturally exist in E. coli.
pASK vector constructs
The PCR-Blunt II-phaCAB and pSOS-cat2 plasmids described above were then used as templates to create seven different vector constructs in pASK (Tables 1 and 2). The first six vector constructs were created by PCR amplification of the insert, restriction digestion of the vector and insert, ligation of the fragments, and finally transformation into E. coli. The seventh vector (pASKphaAB-term-pLZCat2phaC) was created using CPEC cloning and transformation into E. coli (Figure 5). All the constructs were sequenced to ensure that the constructs were correct. Aslo genotyping was done for the final construct 7 (Figure 6).

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," interesting to note that bacteria with BBa_K2764001, which has the highest promoter strength, could be able to have the highest growth rate compared with the other parts, and can even surpass the growth of the control in the second half of the experiment. Supposedly, the more AlkL is expressed, the more toxic the overall effect to the host is. That said, bacteria with BBa_K2764001 should have the weakest growth and BBa_K2764003 the strongest. Contrary to expectations, that is not what we observed.
We hypothesize that bacteria with BBa_K2764001 instead has the highest growth rate because AlkL also imports long chain fatty acids from the LB medium it was seeded in. LB itself contains yeast extract, which is obtained from the cell content of yeast, will contain long chain fatty acids. Similar to how FadL, a native E. coli fatty acid transporter, can sometimes mistakenly import medium chain alkanes into the cell, perhaps the AlkL in our transformed bacteria can also mistakenly import long chains of fatty acids, which can be β-oxidized in the cell’s native system as a nutrient. This will aid in the growth of the bacteria instead. As such, it may be that while certain amounts of AlkL produced by the cell inhibits cell growth, larger amounts of fatty acids are still imported into the cell because of it, which will boost cell growth. It is possible that in this push-and-pull scenario, the effect of boosting cell growth is more favored than the inhibition when more fatty acids are imported and this enables net cell growth to be slowly achieved over time. This is supported by the fact that the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 is initially lower than the growth of control before rising slowly to overtake it, showing that the cell growth is slowly favored over time.
For the growth rate of BBa_K2764003 bacteria, there is relatively less AlkL but it seems it is already enough to inhibit growth to a large extent. While there is less AlkL, there is also less fatty acid transported, so perhaps in this push-and-pull scenario, inhibition of cell growth is favored over boosting of cell growth as not enough fatty acids are imported into the cell to offset the toxic effect of AlkL. It may be that from T=0 to T=1, the AlkL had not been expressed enough to reach toxic levels, so the growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764003 is similar to the rest. Then, after T=2, the amount of Al"
US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2017,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,": The day started at UES and the students began to look up literature that would help them with the sensing part of the project goal. They were able to find lots of useful information referring to the two ETEC toxins, a heat labile and heat stabile. Over the course of a couple hours, the students were able to find and compose a list of the possible ways to detect ETEC. In the afternoon, the students shared the ideas with their mentor, Mike. After lunch, the students discussed what they had gathered from the past 3 days of researching literature. After exchanging ideas and articles, the students and Dr. Goodson realized that being able to sense a quorum sensing molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) might be the way to go. They discussed at length the necessary components needed to be able to put the promoter into the existing plasmid so that it could detect AI-2. After a bit of research, they decided to go with E. coli DH5a which fit perfectly as it does not create AI-2 on its own. The students were relieved that they had taken a massive step forward in their “sensing” component and hope to achieve the end goal soon.
Packaging: A gel was run on the digested pJAAM1 and the results were again unexpected. To try a different approach, the RXers chose colonies from the diluted cultures of NEB 5-alpha/pJAAM1 and performed a PCR. The gel of the PCR products appeared correct, so the remainder of the chosen colonies were streaked onto plates and inoculated in culture tubes to grow overnight.
Friday (07/21/17)
Sense/Respond: The students finally began the lab work today for ""sensing"". The students worked on resuspending part K18 in Well 3 and followed the protocol to grow them up on plates. They also transformed the GFPa1 plasmid into DH5a E. coli cells. The plates were then left outside overnight to grow. Meanwhile, the young researchers were able to analyze the plasmid and look at all the restriction sites to find the ideal sites to cut the plasmid. Under the guidance of Dr. Goodson, the students picked three restriction sites and an order was put in to order the primers. Afterwards, the RH lab held their weekly lab meeting with the RX lab and shared the exciting news of their new discovery.
Packaging: The week ended with the RX team miniprepping three milliliters of the cultures from the previous day and digesting the results. However, when a gel"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," had been done in E.coli, getting the entire EnvZ-OmpR pathway to work in another host could well be a project of its own. We also had to consider that the EBP30 strain we wanted to use for testing  is gram negative. An option we were left with was then to create spheroplasts by removing the outer membrane of the E.coli before adding the HER2 biomarker to the sample. We decided to go with the option of creating spheroplasts over changing to gram positive since this introduced fewer unknown variables when expressing the receptor in the membrane.
If spheroplasts are used to prove our concept, they must be able to express proteins to produce a read-out signal. Investigating this thus became a part of our project.

Experimental plan
The experimental plan for the BAR was divided over the different hypotheses we aimed to prove for each of the constructs. The first hypothesis handles the successful expression of a  BAR construct in E. coli. For this western blots were deemed the most suitable as we could measure low concentration of our constructs with great accuracy. To confirm the correct location of the protein in the inner membrane we did flow-cytometric measurements. For this we had to construct spheroplasts (gram positive cells were the outer membrane and cell wall has been removed) to gain access to the periplasm and tag our constructs. For testing the affinity of our construct towards HER2, three different experiments were formulated. In the first one an IMAC column would be used to bind in recombinant HER2 through a polyhistidine tag added to the protein. The HER2-inbound column would then act as a affinity column binding the constructs. In the second experiment an"

A circular economy approach is to use resources more efficiently, keep resources in use for as long a time as possible and to minimise waste. Identifying opportunities to improve circular approaches, for example keeping by-product materials within Scotland for further processing. There are many potential products that could feasibly be made from by-products, adding further value to a business.

Collaborations
This year we have participated in 3 collaborations. All three of these were focused on seeing what other teams thought about our project, soliciting advice about the best usage for our construct and getting insights into ethical concerns regarding implementation.
Two collaborations were with the two universities that have worked on this project in the past. The University of Chicago 2013 iGEM team worked on a project aimed at breaking down feathers with the goal of turning the products produced by the keratin waste into useful products.  The University of Sheffield 2014 iGEM team worked on a construct that will break down hair as a side project to their main “fatburger” project. Our collaborations with these teams was centered around the sharing of information regarding their past constructs, as our project is based on troubleshooting and debugging those issues. Further, we hoped to characterize these parts, get input on ethical and safety concerns, and plan the future tests and implementation of our project.
Our third collaboration was with a high school iGEM team based out of Consort, Alberta. Their project they've been working on for the past three seasons has been working to detect oil spills in soil by first detecting xylene, as xylene is a good early biological indicator.  We collaborated with them in order to receive feedback on what they thought about our project as well as to give them feedback on their project. As geographically close high school teams, it was nice to have some face time at the mini Alberta jamboree we hosted in May 2015 at our school.  We shared a lot of initial feedback about the pros and cons of our presentations, and continued to be in close contact with the Consort team as we prepared for the Giant Jamboree!

This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the sfGFP output part of the Sensynova platform design with three different output chromoprotein variants; BBa_K1033929 (aeBlue), BBa_K1033925 (spisPink) and BBa_K1033915 (amajLime).
Background Information
All three selected chromoproteins were made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Uppsala 2013 team. They were chosen as variants to the sfGFP present in the Sensynova platform as they exhibit of strong colour readily observed in both LB cultures and in agar plates when expressed. All three proteins have significant sequence homologies with proteins in the GFP family.
BBa_K1033915 – amajLime
The amajLime protein is a yellow-green chromoprotein extracted from the coral Anemonia majano. It was first extracted and characterized by Matz et al. under the name amFP486 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q9U6Y6.1 GI: 56749103 GenBank: AF168421.1) and codon optimized for E coli by Genscript. The protein has an absorption maximum at 458 nm giving it a yellow-green colour visible to the naked eye.
BBa_K1033925 – spisPink
The spisPink protein is a pink chromoprotein extracted from the coral Stylophora pistillata. It was first extracted and characterized by Alieva et al. under the name spisCP (GenBank: ABB17971.1) and codon optimized for E. coli by Genscript. The protein has an absorption maximum at 560 nm giving it a pink colour visible to the naked eye. The strong colour is readily observed in both LB or on agar plates after less than 24 hours of incubation.
BBa_K1033929 – aeBlue
The aeBlue protein is a blue chromoprotein extracted from the basal disk of a beadlet anemone Actinia equine. It was first extracted and characterized by Shkrob et al. 2005 under the name aeCP597 and codon optimised for E. coli by Bioneer Corp.

Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#Safety#engineering life_-_-_TEXT.html," so called biohackers was initiated. Thus, the defintions of biosafety and biosecurity were elaborated referring to Kelle:
""While biosafety measures aim to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, biosecurity measures focus on the prevention of theft, misuse, or intentional release of pathogens and toxins [4] .""
The participants of the seminar submitted that biohackers as amateur biologists wouldn't represent any prior hazard to biosecurity since the access to laboratory devices is still expensive and difficult and the know-how not assesable enough. Further, it was considered that biohackers would risk their own health while working in inappropriate locations as private appartments and with low-budget or self-made devices [compare to 5] . Thus, biohackers were categorized to biosafety affairs.  However, bioweapons, bioterrorism and other criminal organizations came in the focus of the talks.
iGEM was also mentioned several times during the whole seminar. It was described as a competition for young scientists where they can make their first experiences with the synthesis of systems and tools that shall facilitate the daily lab routine of synthetic biologists [compare to 6] . As our team participated on this seminar, we took the chance and presented our project in a poster session. Philosophers, theologists, bioethicists and scientists were interested in our presentation and asked completely different questions to our project. Interestingly, most of them knew CRISPR/Cas and other systems for gene regulation. Their questions were e.g.
if we were able to regulate endogenous genes ,
if we had implemented our uniCas-toolkit into a stable cell line or into a model organism as mus musculus,
if we had any idea to increase biosafety or biosecurity concerning our project?
Here, we could indicate on our safety forms and explain our thoughts about risks and chances of a standardized uniCAS toolkit.
The seminar has clarified that synthetic biology as a young science causes lots of discussion and connects great hopes but still some fear in regard to biohackers and bioweapons.  On one side the attitude of society to preserve the natural and on the other hand societal expectations to create something synthetic to protect the natural are forming a tension. This causes us to rethink. Thus, the mutual exchange expanded the horizons of the participants.
In the end of the seminar, we saw iGEM and our human practice efforts from a different angle. We were aware of the duty as synthetic biologists to demystify our science and laboratory work and to explain it to the society.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," maybe the reference centers of chlamydia that from time to time should culture the bacteria in order to test antibiotic resistance. This is a bit more problematic for other bacteria because you have to use eukaryotic cell culture and itˋs not just putting the antibiotic in the agar medium and culture the bacterium and see if they grow or not, itˋs a bit more complicated but it can be done in special laboratories.
Daniel C.:
Could you tell us more about the life cycle of chlamydia?
Dr. Meyer:
This is a special form in chlamydia because we have at least two structures: they have infectious structures, so called elementary bodies, that bind to certain receptors on the target cell. They are incorporated, form an inclusion, and in this inclusion they are transformed into reticulate bodies and reticulate bodies are metabolically active and they propagate and divide in the inclusion body and when the inclusion body reaches a certain size they dedifferentiate into elementary bodies and these elementary bodies can be liberated by different mechanisms and they can infect other cell and individuals. So this is what you can see in cell culture under normal conditions. But there are probably other states. There is good evidence for a persisting state and this will happen when the immune system is targeted and the chlamydia infected cells, or if you use certain antibiotic you can induce these long time persistent structures. And this is likely to be an important mechanism to close these persistent infections.
Daniel C.:
Persistent infections are inclusion bodies that are metabolically less active?
Dr. Meyer:
Probably there are different forms together, even in a persistent infection there will be a low-grade production of infectious elementary bodies.
Daniel C.:
Is is known what metabolic reactions are going on with the inclusion bodies? How are they interacting with the cell?
Dr. Meyer:
There are some mechanisms that have been described. There is a lot of interaction between the chlamydia and the target cell. I don't know all these different mechanisms but there have been some experiments where you can find some ideas how the chlamydia is interacting with the eukaryotic cell, so itˋs chlamydia interfering with some mechanisms that allow persistence. They have to inhibit the apoptosis so that the cells are not eliminated. They also have to interfere with the immune system in order that those cells are not eliminated by cellular mechanisms. And they also have to interfere with some other physiological factors, so that some essential factors, like amino acids, are present and the chlamydia can use them for their own life cycle.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#EAS1_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch
For our switch, we desired a simple circuit with a stable on state. The parts we used are ptrpL, cI434, pRM, trpR, and cI. As in the Peking switch, cI activates pRM and cI434 represses pRM. We cloned two additional parts for our switch: ptrpL and trpR. ptrpL is the well-known trp promoter and operator sequence. trpR is the corresponding repressor which is induced by tryptophan. In our system, we will assume there are constantly high levels of tryptophan so that trpR will always act as a repressor.
Deactivated State
Figure 8.
 
A new LovTAP part was synthesized by the UNAM 2010 team via the alteration of EPF-Lausanne’s LovTAP. Primary changes include the removal of two 2 PstI restriction sites from the coding region of LovTAP and the addition of one of the point mutations that was proposed by the EPF-Lausanne team.
 
Activated State
Figure 9.
 
In the active state, cI434 levels are low, trpR levels are high, and cI levels are high. This results in low transcription from ptrpL, high transcription from pRM, and thus high output signal. Since trpR is a strong repressor for ptrpL, we expect state 2 to be stable.
 
 
 
mRFP1
Color production
For our output signal, we decided to use mRFP1. mRFP1 is a red fluorescent protein based on DsRed. Natural DsRed requires tetramerization in order to fluoresce. mRFP1 contains 33 mutations that, one, allow it to function as a monomer and, two, allow it to fold more quickly.
It has many attractive qualities: the color is visible in normal lighting; no special supplements are necessary for the color to develop; the coding sequence for the protein is short (as compared to other pigment generating proteins); finally, the protein itself generates the color, which hopefully will result in faster image development than a protein which catalyzes a reaction that generates color.

Riboregulator Feature Page
In this feature page, several teams that have worked with riboregulators are highlighted. More outstanding riboregulators are also identified according to the these criteria: availability from Part Registry, usage frequency, and availability of characterization information of the riboregulator system. Finally, abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that used or planned to use riboregulators are included; links are provided to each team’s riboregulator page for more information. This feature page can help users to quickly scan through the available riboregulators, and determine whether the riboregulator system is feasible for the project in mind by comparing previous projects that have used the riboregulator system.
Introduction to riboregulators
Figure 1.
Artificial riboregulator system used to control post-transcriptional regulation
Regulatory RNAs are small RNA that regulates biological processes such as transcription or translation. The use of regulatory RNAs has been a great interest in the field of synthetic biology because it provides an additional level of regulation for biological circuits and systems. Regulatory RNAs have also used by many iGEM teams. We have identified 7 teams that have used cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) riboregulator system and more teams that have used riboswitches. For example, UC Berkeley 2005, UC Berkeley 2006 and Caltech 2007 contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry.
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by the UC Berkeley iGEM 2005 team. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system ,crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence 5’ of the"

Characterisation
The expression of deGFP was first tested in E. coli cells using an experimental procedure similar to that used in the Interlab study. Cells transformed with pSB1C3-J23100-deGFP were grown in 10 mL LB broth overnight and OD600 nm was measured. Culture was added to 3 separate falcon tubes and made up to 12 mL with LB with chloramphenicol such that the starting OD600 of the culture was approximately 0.02. This set-up was repeated with cells containing an identical plasmid and construct, except sfGFP was in place of deGFP. As a control, untransformed cells were also prepared identically except the LB did not contain chloramphenicol. Tubes with only LB and LB+chloramphenicol were also prepared as blanks. The cultures were shake-incubated at 37oC. 300 μL samples from each tube were taken at time points of 15 mins, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours and stored at 4oC until the end of the experiment. 100 μL of each sample were then added to a 96-well plate. Fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm) and absorbance (OD600 nm) were measured using a BMG-Labtech fluostar optima plate reader. Fluorescence intensity and grow rates for all three cell types were calculated over time (Figure 3). It was found that while cells expressing sfGFP had a much higher fluorescence intensity than cells expressing deGFP, the growth rate for cells with deGFP was closer to that of untransformed cells. This suggests that in vivo, either deGFP has lower expression than sfGFP, or each molecule of deGFP emits less fluorescence.

Fluorescence intensity was negative corrected to LB media. b) growth rate of E. coli cells over time. Each bar represents an average of three repeats, and error bars represent +/- standard error. OD¬600 was negative corrected to LB media.

We then obtained colonies which we believed to contain EutSMNLK, however we were unable to obtain pure plasmid from this construct containing all microcompartment subunits as the transformed colonies became too sickly. We hypothesize that this was due to the expression of EutMN and EutLK being highly toxic to cell and reducing growth rate.
We induced our constructs with their respective reagents for 4 hours and 20 hours before collecting soluble and insoluble proteins, see our induction protocol here . These samples were then run on a 12% Tris-Glycine SDS-Page gel. Unfortunately, we were unable to see any bands of increased intensity. See figure 2. and the corresponding table 1. for the bands we were expecting:

We have already contacted some high schools in Shanghai. They will add this course as an elective. Tieling High School will be the first experimental unit. We were happy to hear that schoolmasters have great interest in our course and will do our best to spread it.
This course focuses on the basic knowledge of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Microbiology. We also introduce Synthetic Biology to all the students and let them design their own engineered bacteria. We use a variety of methods to make esoteric theories much easier for them to understand:
We use building blocks to explain Synthetic Biology.
We use similar music to show what the variation is and how BLAST works.
And Fablab Shanghai will give them a mechanical course to lead them make simple pipettes.
We think firsthand experience plays the most important role in studying so we included biosafety and basic experiments for them.
Before the work mentioned above, we used a questionnaire survey to understand what the children and parents want in the class and what they can get from the toolbox. We collected and analyzed the data to consider the cost and improve our toolbox. We hoped our toolbox could influence more people. The supporting courses and the contents of the toolbox have changed thanks to the data to make it attractive to more people who might be interested in our toolbox and Synthetic Biology.
Following is part of the questionnaire, the sample size is 417:

Day 1 22/06/15 - It All Begins!
On our first day in the lab, we began by autoclaving equipment ready for use throughout our project. Specifically, we made LB plates, LB broth and autoclaved pipette tips
Day 2 23/06/15
We set up overnight cultures of Top10, VS45 and MS348 cells. We then met with our supervisors to discuss our progress.
Day 3 24/06/15
First, we made and filter sterilised MES buffer. Then we added our Top10 cells to 250ml of LB broth containing no antibiotics. The culture was then incubated until the OD600 was 0.6. Finally, we miniprepped pSB1C3 out of MS348.
Day 4 25/06/15
We set up an overnight digest of pSB1C3 ready to be run on an agarose gel in order to check that we had obtained the correct plasmid from the cells. We then transformed pSB1C3 into our competent Top10 cells. Next, we plated the transformations out onto Chloramphenicol plates and incubated them at 37ºC overnight.
Day 5 26/06/15 - The First of Many Gels
We checked the plates that had been inoculated overnight and calculated the competent cell efficiency. We then ran an agarose gel of the overnight digest. We decided on the layout for the wiki.
Day 6 29/06/15
On this day, we transformed linear pSB1C3 into our Top10 cells. We also set up overnight liquid cultures of MS349 cells containing pSB1A3. We set up a large quantity digest of pSB1C3, ready for gel extraction the following day.
Day 7 30/06/15

Wisconsin-Madison,2009,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#Significane_-_-_TEXT.html," W. Bush set a production goal of 20 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year by 2017.
Biofuels through Microbial Processes
Many biofuels are produced by converting monosaccharides into short chain alcohols, including ethanol. Polysaccharides, such as cellulose, can be broken down into monosaccharides for this process by either cellular (e.g. fermentation) or external catalytic means (18). Microbes are currently used to produce many alcohol biofuels, including ethanol or butanol (19). Using the techniques of molecular biology to engineer microbial genomes makes it possible to increase the efficiency of fermentation routes to biofuels.
Problem with the Biofuel Solution
The production of biofuels whether through particular microbial or cellulosic means consumes vast amounts of fresh water.  This intense process requires at least five times more water than currently used to produce an equivalent amount of fuel from crude oil.  Ultimately, more environmentally and water friendly methods must be employed for sustainable biofuel production.  Ideally salt water or even untreated fresh water could be ideal sources of water for fuel synthesis, especially since salt water constitutes 97.5% of all water on the planet.  Therefore, a prospective improvement to the biofuel synthesis process would be to engineer a microorganism capable of biofuel production in less than ideal water environments such as those of high ionic strength.

Model I
Selection system
Model I describes the in vivo bacterial two hybrid selection system :
Figure 1: Selection pathway.
Plasmid 1 and plasmid 2 each produce one protein of the bacterial two hybrid system, respectively. When both proteins come together and bind on the DNA the reporter gene is transcribed, here beta-lactamase. The beta-lactamase then diffuses from the cytoplasm into the periplasm, where it encounters the antibiotic ampicillin and deactivates it. For detailed description see bacterial two hybrid system .
The selection pathway can be illustrated by the following reaction sequence:
Figure 2: Reaction pathway of the selection system.
The 0 stands for degeneration of proteins or complexes and the + for the interaction of two proteins or complexes.
The reaction sequence starts with the expression of the Evobody-RpoZ translational fusion construct [(a)] on the one hand and the target protein-DNA binding domain translational fusion construct [(b)] on the other hand.   Both resulting fusion proteins are degraded over time [(c)].   In the figure the degeneration is marked with a 0.   Furthermore, together with the DNA binding site for the DNA binding domain"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," 100 µl medium per well. The outermost wells of the microtitre plate should contain 150 µl of distilled water to avoid that medium containing cells evaporate. Incubate the plate for a maximum of 48 h at the intermediate shaking mode. The OD600 can be detected every 10 to 15 min. It is recommended to do at least three technical replicates per strain and condition on the same plate. Sometimes the detection of the OD can be disturbed by condensing water under the lid and your growth curve will look really strange.
Genetic modification of bacteria
Preparation of competent E. coli cells
Method 1 (low amount of competent cells, RbCl)
The Material
LB liquid medium
RF1 and RF2 buffer
Liquid nitrogen
The Procedure
Inoculate a 4 ml culture either with a single colony or with a cryo culture of the desired E. coli strain and incubate the culture with agitation over night at 37°C.
Inoculate a 300 ml shake flask containing 100 ml LB medium with the overnight culture to an OD600 of 0.05 and grow the culture at 37°C until the OD600 is about 0.3.
Transfer the cells into two 50 ml Falcon tubes, incubate the cultures for 15 min on ice and harvest the cells by centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 rpm and 4°C. Discard the supernatants.
Re-suspend the cells in 1/3 of the original volume (~16 ml/50 ml) of buffer RF1, incubate the cells again on ice and harvest the cells by centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 rpm and 4°C. Discard the supernatants.
Put 0.4 ml of the cell suspension into the Eppendorf reaction tubes and freeze the cells by transferring them immediately to the liquid nitrogen. Store the competent cells at -80°C.
Method 2 (fast method, cells cannot be stored, CaCl2)
The Material
LB liquid medium 50 mM CaCl2 solution
The Procedure
Inoculate a 4 ml culture either with a single colony or with a cryo culture of the desired E. coli strain and incubate the culture with agitation over night at 37°C.
Inoculate a 100 ml shake flask containing 10 ml LB medium with the overnight culture to an OD600 of 0.05 - 0.1 and grow the culture at 37°C until the OD600 is about 0.3.

Today the core algorithm of reverse engineering is proposed. We discussed possible approaches to realize these system identification requirements.
The very first thing emerge in my mind is Metropolis method and Monte Carol sampling. If we define an error function which serves as 'judging criteria', and a random number generator used for 'correction' or 'exploration', then we can basically get it running from pure theoretical view.

After hearing about our project, Dr. Cui was surprised by our goal of dealing with the global warming. However, he illuminated us that, even though the genetic engineering is an advanced technology that would largely benefit our society, we had to pay attention to the ethic issue by having a comprehensive understanding of relevant laws to avoid some ethic problems. In addition, Dr. Cui told us that we had to make sure that the transgenic organism we created was safe to the environment. In other words, the newly created organism should not destroy the environmental stability and the biological diversity. Even though the biological safety is a relatively complex and strict issue for young researchers, Dr. Cui still emphasized the importance of it as all scientific researchers had to take the social responsibility. Through the conversation with Dr. Cui, we had a deeper understanding of our project and felt the sense of mission as researchers.

Wet Work
Amplification
Last nights plate reader results were very interesting and beg further analysis.  However, it was discovered that the plate reader was at room temperature rather than 37 degrees.  We'll wait to analyze the data until we have data from tonight's plate reader run.
All of last nights transformations worked except I746324- Psid promoter followed by GFP (high copy plasmid) - will try transforming it again tonight.
Cultured single colonies overnight of the following in preparation for the plate reader on Thursday night (may not actually stick to our original plan of plate reader assays, so we may not need these):
I746313 - pBad with activator P2 ogr and mRFP (kan resistance, low copy plasmid)
I746314- pBad with activator PSP3 pag and mRFP (kan resistance, low copy plasmid)
I746315- pBad with activator phiR73 delta and mRFP (kan resistance, low copy plasmid)
Overnight, ran the plate reader to take fluorescence readings for GFP and RFP as well as OD readings of the following cultures induced with arabinose at 500 uM, 100 uM, 50 uM, 10 uM, 1 uM, 0.5 uM, 0,1 uM, and no arabinose
I13540 (pBad and GFP)
I13520 (pBad and RFP)
I746391 (phiR73 with PO promoter) (repeated in order to assess the validity of last night's plate reader run)
MelA BioBrick
Made up the primers in preparation for tomorrows PCRs (shown in the plan below). Primers were made up to 100uM and then aliquoted into working stocks of 10uM. Primers were resuspended into sterile single distilled water and then stored at -20 degrees.
Pigment Characterisation
Attempts to trigger MelA and Violacein pigment production in culture proved unsuccessful; cell extracts were analyzed with the plate reader, but showed that no pigment was extracted.  We will investigate other ways to characterize both pigments, and are considering plate-culture extraction for the melanin pigment.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala_-_-_TEXT.html,"16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second Worm Buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Figure 7. Team member Ricardo Danza with our unofficial mascot Gromit.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19]. A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.
Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM
In iGEM Uppsala we are worried about the future of iGEM members wellbeing and have seen multiple cases of burnouts. This is something that has to be changed to make iGEM sustainable for the future. To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which"

We mutated the CYP79A2 to remove a restrictionsite. Afterwards we inserted the CYP in the shipping plasmid. We confirmed both the mutation and the insertion by sequencing. We tried to insert the CYP79A2 in the ekspressionvector BBa_J04500 and although it looked like the gene was inserted when we got it sequenced it wasn't a perfect fit. We picked the best fitting and expressed them in BL21 cells. A SDS gel didn't show any increase in protein amount for the band-size corresponding to the CYP. A membrane preperation induced with CYPs substrate phenylalanine showed no production of oxime.  Our original A2 template have been reported to work (1) and we therefore suspect the mutations and/or the prefix suffix to have influenced the activity. To explore this, we plan to analyse the device BBa_ K527001 - the CYPA2 inserted in an expressionvector by the DTU_Denmark2 user assembly method which doesn't contain prefix/suffix but does contain the mutation

We mutated the CYPB1 to remove an illigal restrictionsite and confirmed this by sequencing. We tried to insert the CYP in the expression vector as well as the shipping plasmid. But we was unable to get good results of a colony PCR reaction because our primers didn't bind. (An ekstra set of primers didn't either). Due to time pressure we turned to another assembly methods. Our good friends at DTU (The powerpuff team) have designed an assembly method using the User enzyme and they got our mutated CYPB1 and made user-friendly assembly tales on"

The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system ,crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence 5’ of the RBS, RBS, and gene of interest. The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS , blocking the ribosome entry to RBS. crRNA is also commonly described as a “lock” because it “locks” the RBS and prevent translation. The “key” to this system is the taRNA. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore to activate translation (Figure 1.). The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.’s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent regulation of multiple genes etc1.

Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," destroyed by autoclaving.
None of our designs or parts are highly hazardous to the environment since they mainly involve environment-sensing genes and fluorescent proteins. In a hypothetical environmental release, they would have a disadvantage for overproducing useless metabolites such as GFP, so their competitiveness would decrease and they would not be able to survive for a long time. We have tested, with some values, how this metabolic charge affects their growing rate. Our results indicate that our genetically modifications decrease –rather than increase- biological fitness. We have not missed the possibility of horizontal gene transfer risks so we asked for non-conjugative plasmids which also required external inducers.
In conclusion, when we work, we are very concerned about the risk in public and environmental safety, and take the necessary measures needed to prevent damage.
Researcher safety
People who work in a laboratory should be taught properly about the risks. We had to verify the safety of our biological material, techniques and chemicals that we intended to use.
We have avoided using the most common hazardous chemicals and techniques in a laboratory. For example, we have used RedSafe® instead of ethidium bromide in our agarose gel. Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent that distorts the structure of the DNA helix, it is both mutagen and carcinogen. In addition, we have followed the following points faithfully in order to develop our project with care and caution:
-Wear labcoats, as it prevents possible projections of chemicals from reaching the skin. Of course, it also avoids possible damage to your clothing.
-If you have long hair, it is advisable to put it into a pony tail.
-Use rubber gloves every time you can. However, it may be unsuitable to wear them when working close to a fire.
-Rinse your hands regularly when working with media and microorganisms.
-And last, but not least, remember that in the laboratory is strictly forbidden to smoke, eat or drink beverages.
In particular our project has a special consideration with UV-radiation in one of our constructions. In order to activate that construction it is necessary to irradiate with UV-light (254 nm), so we built a special machine to irradiate bacteria in a controlled and safe environment. This machine totally blocks UV irradiation towards researchers. The machine was called Tordeitor 3000. Here you can see a self-made video about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=448MrmbAzdo .

Project Description
Context
For our projet, we tried to focus on air pollution monitoring. We investigate the existing measurement techniques and found out that, among all the existing devices, none of them enable precise and versatile air pollution monitoring. Most of those measurement devices are placed on fixed measurement station and consequently they are unable to give precise results at a smaller scale. Atmospheric pollution quantification at small scale are more and more important due to the ever-increasing health concerns. Learn all the details of why we believe our project can be a real breakthrough in terms of air pollution measurement.
Here
Our Core Project
We worked on a biosensor, a modified cell able to integrate a given signal and respond to it. Our goal was to create E.coli cells able to detect a specific pollutant and respond to it by emitting bioluminescence. We used the XylR protein, known to bind to certain aromatic compounds such as the toluene and benzene (two important pollutants). Once bound to those molecules, the XylR protein will form a tetramer and bind the Pu promoter. Pu promoter activation would then trigger luciferase synthesis and therefore bioluminescence production.
The Biology behind Quantifly
Measurement
As we wanted to precisely quantify air pollution, we started working with CelloCad, a software used for plasmid optimization. We tried to improve the characterization of the two promoters of our biosensor, in order to build an optimized version"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to Berlin to work within the Budisa Lab to learn more about distinct methodological approaches needed for the project, mainly to practice the handling of the selection of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, at the invitation of Professor Nediljiko “Ned” Budisa during our Workshop “Expanding the Genetic Code”.
Figure 3: From left to right: Huan Sun, Professor Nediljko Budisa, Olga Schmidt and Fabian Schildhauer.
On the first day, the theoretical background of evolution and selection of the amino acyl-tRNA synthetases was discussed. This step was necessary because many labs evolve the synthetases according to the non-canonical amino acids they want to utilize, and various selection plasmids and protocols are used for selection processes.
Based on the first positive selection round, problems that may occur in handling the selection process as a whole were explained. The problems compromise for example low transformation rates or low incorporation efficiency of the non-canonical amino acid provided. These particular problems are tried to be eradicated by preparing a fresh batch of competent cells for each selection step and by lowering the concentration of the antibiotic which corresponds to the resistance gene with the blank codon while prolonging the incubation time, respectively.
We decided to study the selection process using two non-canonical amino acids we also use in our toolbox, namely 2-Nitro-L-phenylalanine (2-NPA) and Nε-L-cysteinyl-L-lysin (CL). We were lucky to use existing tyrosyl and pyrrolysyl synthetase libraries provided by the lab, respectively. We were made aware that the selection may not be as efficient as it could be utilizing those libraries, because the synthetases were evolved to bind the distinct non-canonical amino acids we are working with.

During the handling of each first positive selection step, Olga was supervised by Huan Sun (pylRS) and Fabian Schildhauer (tyrRS).

However, these colonies only showed that the pSB1C3 backbone had been take up by the cells due to the observed chloramphenicol resistance. In order to test for the correct naringenin operon assembly, colony PCR was undertaken. This utilised primers 4CLF and CHSR to amplify from the start and end of the operon with 66 °C annealing temperature. This reaction should amplify the full operon if it has been inserted into the backbone correctly, this would result in a PCR product of ~5 kb. A 3 minute extension time was required for amplification the large fragment. Following analysis of PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, no 5 kb band could be seen on the gel. It was considered that no band was observed due to inherent difficulties with amplifying large PCR products. As an alternative means of analysis, overnight cultures of selected colonies were prepared to undergo plasmid extraction by miniprep. Plasmids were extracted from overnight cultures of two colonies using Qiagen QIAprep Plasmid Miniprep Kit. Extracted plasmids were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis where a band of ~7 kb was expected if the Gibson assembly had been successful.
Week commencing- 10/09/18
Following agarose gel electrophoresis, the only bands present for multiple samples of the two colonies were at 2 kb showing only the uptake of the plasmid from which the pSB1C3 had been amplified. Next, Gibson assembly was conducted again, however, instead of having an 18 µl reaction, the mixture was spun down in a SpeedVac 120 for 5 minutes to increase the DNA concentration. This was performed so that the Gibson assembly reaction volume could be reduced to the recommended 20 µl. 5 µl of the Gibson assembly was used to transform DH5α cells, this was increased from the 2 µl used previously. However, following overnight incubation, there was no colony growth on any of the plates. Primers were designed for the amplification of the gBlocks and ordered from IDT so that the parts could be amplified for use in additional Gibson assemblies.
Week commencing- 17/09/18
The new primers for gBlock amplification arrived and were used to amplify the gBlocks by PCR. A gradient PCR was attempted to try a range of annealing temperatures and"

Reading the LUDOX-S30 absorbance value from our spectrophotometer, we subtract the dH2O absorbance to get a corrected absorbance value. Then, the LUDOX-S30 OD600 from iGEM’s reference spectrophotometer is divided by our corrected absorbance value to give a standardized conversion factor.

2. Particle Standard Curve
Our silica microspheres have similar size and optical characteristics as cells but can be mass produced and distributed globally so that all labs will have the same size and concentration of microspheres. Measuring the absorbance of these beads allowed our lab to construct a standard curve of particle concentration (seen below), “which can be used to convert Abs 600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.”
Figure 2: Microsphere Solution Serial Dilution Protocol
Per the protocol given by iGEM, we prepared out microsphere stock solution and serially diluted this solution over 11 wells each with a total of 100ul. Throughout this process we mixed by pipetvting up and down 3 times before each transfer of solution, as well as one final remixing before measurement by the plate reader.
3. Particle Standard Curve
In order to standardize our fluorescence data, we used iGEM-provided fluorescein (a small, inexpensive molecule with similar excitation properties to GFP), to “generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration.” We followed the iGEM protocol and prepared the fluorescein stock solution via serial dilution, similar to the procedure for creating the microsphere absorbance standard curve.
The resulting fluorescence curve could be used to back-calculate cell-concentration and GFP expression in an unknown plate or liquid culture.

Analysis
In order to contribute to the public perception of Synthetic Biology, the scientist who are working in this field should communicate to the general public, who is largely not familiar with Synthetic Biology. As young scientists who are contributing to development of Synthetic Biology, we find it important to also contribute to the public perception of this emerging field. We want to inform the public about Synthetic Biology in general, our participation as TU Delft iGEM 2009 team in the iGEM competition, and our project 'Bacterial Relay Race'.
The public is a very broad audience which we can't address directly, therefore we divined the audiences who we can address and we can communicate with, which are mentioned in this communication plan.
We find it very important to inform our audiences objectively and inform them about what is and isn't possible with Synthetic Biology.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Motivation
Every product (including a software) is designed for users' needs. We hope to learn about what problems other iGEM teams meet and to analyze what they need to solve their problems. What’s more, the intention of ordinary amateurs is also supposed to be taken into account.
Practices
This summer, we cooperated with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team in many activities in our campus. (See  collaboration page ) We also exchanged our ideas on Synthetic Biology and iGEM frequently.
One day, we conducted a discussion among members from us, SYSU-CHINA and SCAU-China, with the topic of data collection and integration. All participants agreed that data and information online is so scattered that we have to spend much time on collecting it and reusing it.
SYSU-CHINA hoped to solve this problem and put the hope on us software team. We regarded the fragmented data as a problem, too. So we started to conduct further investigations and interviews on it. More details can be found on our Integrated Human Practices page.
Figure 1. The discussion among SYSU-CHINA, SCAU-China and SYSU-Software.
At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us, “We’ll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.”
Inspirations on our project
From our investigations and interviews, we found that an integrated database is very important for an iGEM team, also for a research group. Our software is supposed to establish such a database in a standard and easy-to-understand format. It will save one's time, which enables one to focus on his project ideas.
Studying the needs of biology labs
Motivation
Apart from iGEM teams, biology labs and other biotechnology institutes have more rights to speak from a genetic circuit design in papers to a practical experiment protocol in labs. It is also very interesting and exciting to meet them who will be most likely to be affected by our project imagine.
Practices
During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun’s help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory.
Figure2: Our team member Wang Ziwei is introducing our project idea to researchers of LU laboratory.
By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the growth potential of our RB medium.
We can conclude from this experiment that a suitable substitute for LB media can be prepared through the use of canis feces. Theoretically, feces are made up of roughly 75% water and 25% dry mass, where 30% of the dry mass is dead bacteria; 30% is indigestible matter; 10-20% contains cholesterol and other fats; 10-20% inorganic substances; and 2-3% contains protein1.  Although this composition likely varies from organism to organism, it is clear that it contains most of the components necessary to sustain bacterial life. While it is doubtful that Riley Broth will replace LB on planet Earth, we believe that it provides a viable alternative for growing microorganisms in extraterrestrial environments.

Our first attempt at Oxygen generation
Experimental Design:
To generate oxygen in our system, from plasmid-borne Clds in E. coli, first requires the addition of three components as discussed under Project Description. IPTG is required to induce Cld gene expression. Fe2+ and levulinic acid are required as precursors for heme synthesis which functions as a catalytic co-factor in the Cld enzyme. Since heme is synthesized in the cytoplasm we expected to see O2 produced in both Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-) strains. We hoped that this experiment would shed light on relatively efficiency and capacity of O2 in the periplasm Cld(SP+) relative to the cytosol. Following gene expression, chlorite would be added to a final concentration of 0.1M where we expected to see the generation of bubbles.
Method:
Six 5 mL LB overnight cultures were set up using single colonies that were picked from the first 3 of each of the Cld-containing candidates  previously described in Fig.8 [Cld (SP+) 1,2 and 3; Cld(SP-) 1,2 and 3]. To each of the six cultures was added IPTG (1.0mM), levulinic acid (2.0mM) FeSO4 (2.0mM). These concentrations approximate the concentrations reported by Thorell et al. (2003). Cells were"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#Week1#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids will be inserted as uncut objects because no restriction enzymes have been added yet (the analysis of cut plasmids comes at a later stage). Thus we won't be proving that it is the BioBrick which is causing the bacteria to display the properties seen so far. We will be proving that the bacteria have taken up plasmids.
This procedure will see the team:
Prepare the DNA electrophoresis equipment by preparing the gel, administering buffer and ethidium bromide, etc
Prepare the plasmid DNA for gel electrophoresis.
Apply the DNA to the gel and conduct electrophoresis
Capture an image of the gel using UV-scanner.
Experiment procedures
Melting of the 0.8% agarose gel
Pouring of TAE buffer + ethidium bromide
The protocol we used for this practical can be found ' here .'
Preparing the gel
A premade stock solution of agarose gel (0.8% agarose) was taken and heated in microwave for 3 minutes under medium/high power initially. Short 30 second bursts were required to completely liquify the solution
Gel was then removed from microwave and left on bench to cool
Preparing the buffer
Premade solution of 1x TAE was used - took volume of this and added to flask
Added 8 microlitres to the TAE buffer
Preparing the gel electrophoresis equipment
Trays and comb were cleaned and provided for the team, thanks to the lab staff!
Inserted comb into groove nearest the edge of the tray and placed in proximity of the electrodes.
Pouring Buffer and Gel
Placed the 1x TAE buffer (plus ethidium bromide) into the tray (with gel comb inserted in groove nearest negative electrode)

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html," with a promoter and RBS, we transformed our three synthesized genes (PAL, FDC, UbiX) into T7 expressing NEB E. coli separately and then initiated T7 polymerase gene expression by adding IPTG to our cultures.  Because all of our synthesized genes had a FLAG tag at the end of their sequence, we were able to purify our proteins from the cell lysate. Finally we ran all three of our purified enzymes on SDS PAGE to verify that our proteins were the correct molecular weight, which they were.  See below for all of the specific protocols used in this section of our project.
Testing functionality in-vitro of enzymes and modeling pathway
Step one:  Testing PAL
Once we were confident that we had successfully purified our enzymes from the T7 expressing E. coli, the next logical step was to test the in vivo functionality of our proteins.  In order to test PAL’s functionality, we made use of the fact that PAL’s reactant and product, namely phenylalanine and trans-cinnamic acid (tCA), have different characteristic absorbance spectra in the ultraviolet region [4,7]. Notably, tCA has a large and easily distinguishable peak at 268 nm, whereas phenylalanine displays a much less noticeable peak just below 260 nm.  In an initial assay, we took absorbance spectra from a reaction mixture of PAL with phenylalanine and noticed a large peak at 268 nm, suggesting the presence of tCA.
This initial experiment provided good evidence that our PAL was in fact functioning. Our next step was to perform a kinetic time course experiment in order to obtain new data on our enzymes kinetic parameters.  Using the Beer-Lambert relation, which states that, all other factors held constant, concentration is directly proportional to absorbance, we could spectrophotometrically track the increase in absorbance at 268 nm in real time.
We created reaction mixtures of PAL along with 8 different concentrations of its substrate, phenylalanine, and tracked the reaction in real time over the course of about 4 hours using a spectrophotometer. We had to purchase special UV-transparent plates to run this experiment, because plastic well plates absorb in the UV range.  Not only did this experiment further demonstrate that our PAL was working, it also provided us with the necessary kinetic data to estimate PAL’s biochemical parameters.
Step two:  Testing FDC/UbiX
Given the success of the spectrophotometric approach in our PAL assays, we attempted to proceed in a similar manner with FDC and Ubi"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," translation of gene to continue from one biobrick to another. However, by joining biobricks scar DNA sequences, containing STOP codon TAG are incorporated. To overcome this problem, additional T nucleotide was added at the 3’ end toehold sequence. This additional nucleotide, together with a longer version of biobrick prefix sequence (gaattcgcggccgcttctagag) on the downstream gene block part are combined to allow the translation to continue from the toehold riboregulatory part to the controlled biobrick part as depicted in, for example BBa_K2621035 .
We have then tested our re-designed Toehold Switch and its RNA trigger by ligating them next to a CAT-Seq Esterase gene. We have also used the same Toehold switch with different RNA trigger as a control of part orthogonality. After the constructs were built, we have spectrophotometrically assessed the production of Esterase. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance at 310 nm due to the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides
Using cell-free protein expression assay, the construct housing our Toehold switch and the correct Trigger RNA successfully synthesized the Esterase enzyme, as the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides was catalyzed. The orthogonality control did not produce any changes in absorbance, and in turn we could conclude that our toehold switch is controlling the translation effectively.
Figure 1. The catalytic activity of each Toehold:Trigger RNA construct matrix
CAT-Seq Esterase mutant sequences were placed downstream the riboregulatory sequences with corresponding trigger part and they catalytic activity was measured. The decrease of absorbance corresponds to catalytically active enzyme. The graph shown as a matrix concludes that only Toehold sequences expressed with their corresponding Trigger RNA produce an active enzyme molecule.
Experimental validation of the CAT-Seq Esterase Mutants
After carefully selecting the mutations in-silico, we have synthesized and measured the Activity of those Esterase mutants in the laboratory. The mutations have successfully altered the activity of the original Esterase. Also, there were no cases of complete inactivation of enzyme catalytic activity.

Conclusions
We have improved an existing toehold switch in the biobrick registry BBa_K2486176 that was actually a composite part consisting of toehold regulated RBS sequence and a Green Fluorescence Protein ("

Cost analysis
Our test is much cheaper than existing solutions, especially when you consider the final product will be a multiplexing assay which will test for many diseases simultaneously.
Qiagen PAXgene blood RNA tube: 1 @ £752 / 100 kits [11]
£7.52

£0.85
Other lab equipment e.g. sterilisation: tubes: gloves (approx) [13]
£0.30
Total
£18.66
We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

Overview
We devote to dividing the polyketide synthases (PKSs) and catalyze according to specific mechanism. Therefore, as if we standardize the genes which encode independent domains of PKSs, we can synthesize new kinds of polyketides by means of permutation and combination of domains.
In the process of analyzing the DEBS1 which catalyze and synthesize 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB)，the precursor of erythromycin, we know that each domain has independent and specific chemical reaction and function.
Name of domain
Function
Acyltransfer-ase, AT
Activating the extended unit------- propionyl group
Acyl carrier protein, ACP
Anchor the polyketide chain needed to extend
Ketocaylsynthase, KS
Combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond
Keto-reductase, KR
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond
Dehydratase, DH
Dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond
Enoylreductase, ER
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene
Thioesterase, TE
Removing the polyketide chain from PKS
By preliminary analysis of chemical reaction and function of each domain, we can conclude that it is available to analyze their own kinetic mechanism, and it's significant. If we simulate the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, we can finally establish kinetic model of PKSs related to all kinds of polyketides.
Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, including AT, ACP, KS, KR, ER, DH, and TE"

Monday
Our team was finally back together, as a majority of people were absent for the latter part of last week. A few of us went over what was done last week, and how there was an error in running the gel extractions, so we made a decision to re-attach the promoters to the B0034 RBS. Some of us began by running digestions of J23100, K206000, J23101, and R0010 at the E and S sites. B0034+C0012 was digested at X and P, J23101 was digested at S and P, and B0034 was digested at E and X. We also wanted to carry on some of the themes from last years project, and began trying to mutate K206000, or the pBAD promoter, to improve its function through random mutanogenesis. Some of our team members also began preparing the E. Coli strain, numbered MG1655, by streaking the organisms on plates from the glycerol stock. After, we rehydrated MG1655 strain. We also liquid cultured and plated DH5alpha cells and tried to make compotent cells for MG1655 strain, but put them in the 37 degree room. Some of our team members began to run error prone PCR (PROTOCOL) on the K206000 part as well, to make a part family as well. In our discussion of how we were going to assay our samples, we also ordered pNPB, another sample used to determine degredation in comparison to PET.
Tuesday
When the team came into lab today, we used the spectrophotometer and the OD600 readings were over 1, which signifies we overgrew them. The error came from placing the cells in the 37 degree room instead of at room tempurature. Oops. So we then remade the component cells for the MG1655 strain and extracted genomic DNA from the MG1655 and DH5alpha E. Coli strain. Luria Broth was made, and we incubated the starter culture and made inouetransformation buffer. We miniprepped the parts that were transformed yesterday, and sequentially digested B0034 and B0034+E0240 at the E site with plans for the X site to be digested on Wednesday. The PCR products from yesterday were ran on a gel to confirm the products, and"

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," the real world setting, future screening of alternate substrates would require us to look for substrates that are non hazardous to use outside of the laboratory setting. The handling of known concentrations of triclosan must be handled with proper PPE outside of the lab. See above for triclosan disposal.

Preparation of DNA for Cloning
Originally, our cloning method was to be Gibson assembly. We ordered our 8 genes with 5’ and 3’ gibson overhangs from IDT. Once received, we rehydrated the genes:
1. Centrifuge for 3-5 seconds at >3000 x g to pellet at the bottom
2. Add 20 uL TE buffer or Milli-Q water for a final concentration of 10ng/uL
3. Briefly vortex and centrifuge
4. Store at -20 degrees for up to 24 months with TE buffer or 1 month with dH2O
We made four 50 mL and four 2 mL overnight cultures of DH10B containing pET29b+ vector for insertion with kanamycin resistance selection. The grown 50 mL cultures were then transferred to 50 mL falcon tubes and spun down to pellet at 4000 x g for 10 minutes. We then followed the protocol included in the Invitrogen MaxiPrep kit used. The results gave an average of 1.93 ng/uL, which is below the threshold for accurate concentration measurement for the Biotek Epoch spectrophotometer with the Take3 Microvolume plate. This also showed that the results yielded next to no DNA for the MaxiPrep and decided to go forth with a MiniPrep on the four 2 mL cultures using the Invitrogen MiniPrep protocol provided with the kit. The results yielded an average of 90 ng/uL which is above the 60-80 ng/uL concentration needed for the restriction digestion.
Double digestion:
We used the NEB double digest finder to select which buffer and protocol to use for our reaction. Since we used NdeI and EcoRI as our restriction sites, the highest activity without having star activity was NEBuffer 3.1 with 100% activity in NdeI and 50% activity in EcoRI. 50 uL double digest reactions were made of the miniprep, containing 1 uL of each restriction enzyme, 5 uL of the 10x 3.1 NEBuffer, and the remaining 43 uL of our miniprepped plasmid"

Float team member Taylor introduces the radiation resistance subproject
The Problem
The high energy content of ionizing radiation in space poses a severe threat to life, technology, and synthetic materials alike in an extraterrestrial context. Energized subatomic particles generated from nuclear events carry over large distances in space, and are capable of tearing through organic materials and altering molecular bonds. On Earth, the vast majority of space radiation is deflected by the magnetosphere. Much of the radiation that passes through Earth’s magnetic field is then filtered out by the atmosphere, allowing only UV, visible light, and some infrared wavelengths to reach the surface. Extended UV exposure can disrupt the molecular interactions within thin membranes, creating micropores that decrease the material’s structural integrity and impermeability.
Figure 1: Radiation Damage Degrades DNA.

Balloons flown in Earth’s stratosphere are offered limited UV protection due to thinning of the atmosphere with increasing altitude. Chief Scientist of World View Enterprises Alan Stern stated in a meeting with our team that the materials used in his near-space exploration vessels cannot be reused due to the radiation damage they sustain during flight. The Stanford Space Initiative’s Balloon team expressed to members of our team that radiation exposure was the most significant factor in limiting the lifespans of their balloons. The unmet need for reusability of balloon materials flown in high altitude conditions generates a lack of sustainability that our team aimed to tackle through UV resistance.
On Earth, the main source of concern for radiation damage is ultraviolet  radiation (UVR). These wavelengths are between 290 and 400"

#FollowMeToiGEM
OUR COLLABORATION
We, The EureCAS, have a very sacred ritual - we take pictures wherever we go (yes, even at Starbucks *not  spon*) and we really seemed to like the trend #FollowMeTo. As a collaboration idea, this came to mind a few days after we got back from Greece. We had so many cool pictures to share with the world and wanted to include more people in on our little tradition. Not only is it a way to share your team’s feats around the world, but also feel more connected with other iGEMers, as we all go down the same road.

Here are the results of the survivability of Pseudovibrio in media with molecules which are going to be sensed:
Pseudovibrio seems to survive in presence of all concentrations of nitrite, it's affect cells' growth but don't kill Pseudovibrio.
In Lead, big concentrations lead to cells' death, but Pseudovibrio survive very well until a concentration of 5µL.
Cadmium does'nt seem to block cells' growth in concentrations which we want to use.

Aug 12
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
10mg of 2 hydroxy,3'-4'dichlorobiphenyl have been received. The compound was lyophilized so it's has been dissolved in 17mL of DMSO in order to have a final concentration of 10(-2)M
The compound was stored at -20°C, in the dark because the DMSO is sensitive to the light.
Aug 13
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
This test allowed to know if E.coli can survive at different concentrations of 2 hydroxy-3',4'dichlorobiphenyl
For that, BL21 culture was removed from the -80°C and culturing in 4 mL of LB
E.coli was incubated overnight at 37°C, 200rpm
Aug 14
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
Serial dilution of compound was made from 10(-2) mol/L to 10(-8) mol/L
300µL of E.coli BL21 were added in each eppendorf tube.
We had 2 control tubes:
A negative control which contains 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of compound
A positive control which contains 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of E.coli BL21
Tubes were incubated at 37°C overnight, 200rpm

Overview of the answers on a global scale
You may click on the questions to get a better look at the maps
Do you believe you are exposed to air pollution at home?
Do you use any protection against air pollution at home?
How do you feel with the use of synthetic biology to adress a pollution issue?
Would you be interested in an affordable, biodegradable filter to eliminate particulate matters?
As we can see, most of the people are aware to be exposed to air pollution in their home. But only about 14% of them are actually protect themselves against this plague (excepted in Asia where most of the people use protections, either it being masks or air purifiers). In this global study, we realized that there was a real need for our device and that people all over the world (especially in Asia and Africa), were interested in a solution using synthetic biology. However, 57% of respondents who were interested in a solution based on synthetic biology thought it is not a safe science. We wanted to better understand the point of view of these people, so we asked a series of more in-depth questions on the subject, which we analyzed at the European level.
Collaborative Design of a representative sample in partnership with UChile iGEM Team
After numerous discussions with our partners from the UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team, we concluded that our results had a problem of representativeness, particularly concerning the age range. But our survey had the advantage of having many participants. So, we decided to extract a subsample of our survey, that would be representative of the European population.
According to Eurostat, whose main responsibilities are to provide statistical information to the institutions of the European Union (EU) and to promote the harmonization of statistical methods across its member states, we had the following distribution of the European population in 2016.

By writing a Resource from the year 2030 , when BeeT will be available on the market, we aimed to bring up ethical issues around synthetic biology in a way that is fun and accessible to the public. Some of these issues are highlighted in the interviews with the general public we included in the magazine. At the same time, the magazine served to spread the word in Wageningen about our iGEM project. Additionally, we wrote an application scenario . This scenario explores how European legislation could affect future BeeT usage.

RIVM
In the Netherlands, the RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu) is a  governmental institute that is concerned with public health and a safe living environment. They investigate the impact of synthetic biology on these aspects of our society, and aim to bring existing knowledge on the topic together. Part of their work is encouraging discussions about the development of synthetic biology from a policymaker’s perspective, which includes a collaboration with all Dutch iGEM teams since 2014.
In short, we learned a lot from collaborating both with the RIVM and the Rathenau institute/Synenergene. The RIVM and Synenergene assignments helped us to think more in depth about different safety aspects, how safety by design can be achieved and our own opinions about it. We gained a new perspective on how biocontainment is perceived.
Events
Throughout the year we have visited a lot of conferences with several goals: to inform different stakeholders about our project, to collect input on the BeeT system through different stages of the project, to network with companies and explore sponsor possibilities, and to have fun and learn some things ourselves.
March: multi-stakeholder dialogue
""The role of synthetic biology in energy transition""
Discussion about the current Dutch energy supply and the potential role of synthetic biology. We created “the green human” futuristic scenario where humans would evolve together with plants to be able to rely on photosynthesis for energy. In our opinion it exposes a very important aspect of both energy transition and synthetic biology: that the public should be involved, to be more conscious about energy use and more engaged with technological advances in the field of synthetic biology.

Background
Fluorescent Proteins are often derivates of the first described FP, GFP, which was isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. This protein is of typical barrel-shape, built from 11 ß-sheets and a chromophore in the middle of the barrel. This barrel structure is typical for fluorescent proteins, whether they derive from GFP or not. Other colors than green were developed by changing single amino acids in the chromophore of GFP (e.g.: Yellow: YFP and Cyan: CFP) or by analyzing fluorescent proteins from other organisms, like Discosoma striata, a coral, from which some of our red FPs, like dsRed derive. FPs are an important tool in today’s research, for example in order to study gene expression or the location of specific proteins in a cell or a whole organism. This is the reason, why we tried to establish some different colors of FPs for the usilization in B. subtilis by evaluating them for the Bacillus BioBrick Box.
Design
Seven different FPs (Table 1) where chosen and either obtained from the registry or from the lab group Mascher.  The BioBrick <partinfo>BBa_E1010</partinfo>was mutated via site directed mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR in order to delete two AgeI-Restriction sites and make the BioBrick compatible for the Freiburg standard RFC25. This improved BioBrick is called BBa_K1351021 The BioBricks and BBa_K592100 (mTagBFP) where both provided with the necessary overhangs for the Freiburg standard, the other FPs where already provided with the proper restriction overhangs. These seven FPs where combined C- and N-terminally with a His-Tag ( BBa_K823037 ) and cloned into the vector pBS0K-Pspac ( BBa_K1351040 ) and transformed into B. subtilis.
