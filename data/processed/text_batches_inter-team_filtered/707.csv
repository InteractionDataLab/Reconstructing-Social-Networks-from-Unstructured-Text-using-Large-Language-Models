Point mutations in this gene lead to a nonfunctional protein. By this, non methylated  DNA is no longer degraded. This is important for strains that are designed to carry foreign DNA like plasmids e.g. cloning strains like VIBRICLONE. For VibriInteract this would be a useful alteration compared to the wildtype since our strain has to carry not only one but two plasmids at the same time. When searching for Type I restriction enzyme EcoKI R proteins we find several in V. natriegens. One of them, BA894_04835 shows a high degree of similarity when doing protein alignments using ClustalX 2.0.10. This could be used for later modifications in our strain but we did not choose it as our highest priority since it is not necessarily needed for functioning protein interaction studies based on B2H.

Both strains recommended for a Bacterial Two-Hybrid assay in E. coli are deficient of this protein. We decided that this genetic modification our highest priority for the VibriInteract strain since we wanted to use complementation of CyaA as proof of protein interaction.  We identified  a homologous protein by doing a BLASTP search of CyaA from E. coli in V. natriegens, BA894_1512. By protein alignment using ClustalX 2.0.10 we see that the two proteins showed a high degree of  similarity. Therefore. we hypothesized that it serves the same or a similar function as the E. coli protein thus we decided to delete this gene using natural transformation for insertion of our deletion cassettes and the Flp recombinase to get rid of the antibiotic resistance cassette used for selection of insertion clones.  This deletion is the start of the development of a strain which can be used to check for the interaction of proteins.

The amount of cells should be small, just a touch will do, the small amount required to fill the end of the opening is sufficient. Sufficient mixing will result in complete cell lysis and high yields.

Inoculation of E. coli
A starter culture tube was obtained, and 5mL of LB + 5uL of ampicillin was added.
To inoculate:  Unscrew the LB bottle and flame the lid.  Flame the lid of the culture tube and add the LB using a serological pipette.  Cover everything when not in use, work quickly and near the flame.
Vinson helped with the streaking of the bacterial colony.  The pipette was sprayed with ethanol, and the tip used was sterile.  A colony was gently swept with the tip, and ejected into the culture tube.  The tube began shaking at 3:30PM at 37 degrees.
Conclusions:  Colony PCR was not done as primers were not ready for them.  Tyler will take care of making the glycerol stocks tomorrow morning.
Today Phil looked over a lot of protocols for stuff we need to do over the next week or so. We innoculated a starter broth after picking a colony from our plate. Tomorrow I will create glycerol stocks to use early next week.

As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.

LegoRoboBricks for Automated Biobrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot Model C is the prototype of an extensible Genomic Lab Liquid Handling System. We build it using Lego bricks, and it can be easily replicated by other iGEM teams and by researchers in Molecular Biology who cannot afford a typical, $10,000, commercial system. The design is modular plug-and-play, so that we can easily collaborate with future iGEM teams to modify or improve on its design and to add new functionalities.
BioBrick-A-Bot comprised of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules (ALPHA and PHI), mounted on a frame (BETA). Here’s what the acronyms means:
ALPHA – Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly
PHI – Pneumatic Handling Interface
BETA – BioBrick Environment Testing Apparatus
This project needs great precision to position the pipette head accurately in 3-D space, and to transfer a few microliter of fluids. In order to achieve the much needed precision, we have replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware which provide floating point representations.  RobotC also gives us the flexibility to develop sophisticated C programs needed to drive this project. The computations to reverse-triangulate any point in 3-D space is also non-trivial. We use 3x3 rotational matrix to simplify our mathematical modeling .
Due to a hardware limitation of Lego Minsdstorm, each NXT brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. We need 6 motors for this project, and use 2 NXT bricks. We designed and implemented a Master Slave Synchronization System using blue-tooth wireless technology.  ALPHA is the master and when it is properly positioned at the right location, it will transmit wireless messages to PHI to request the type of pipette operations that it needs (either aspirate, dispense or clean).

Injecting fluids: compressed air and tubing, pressure regulators
Close-up of the flow-layer tube: connected to a manifold, and plugged into the chip using a tubular pin
A microfluidic chip is a network of small channels for fluids. To inject fluid in, a small (.02"" inner diameter) tube is filled, then plugged into the chip through one of the punched holes (connecting them with a tubular metal pin).  On the other end, the tubes are plugged into a manifold, in turn supplied with air at about 0.2 bar (3 psi), as set by a pressure regulator. The fluid is thus forced into the channels by the compressed air. A syringe can also be used to fill the chip, but it is hard to keep an even pressure (plus you quickly run out of hands).
Controlling flow: on-chip valves and 3-way valves.
Our chips have a second control layer above or below the main flow layer. The layers are separated by a thin membrane of PDMS, and their channels overlap in specific locations. When channels of the control layer are pressurized, the membrane bends into the flow layer and blocks it. This creates a microfluidic 'on-chip' valve.
Our array of solenoid valves, on a manifold. These allow individual pressurisation of on-chip valves of the control layer.
The channels of the control layer are filled in the same way as the flow layer, but require much higher pressure to bend the membrane. We typically used about 2 bar or 30 psi. Each independant valve in the control layer is pressurised by a different tube, regulated by a three-way valve. These switch between high pressure (from mains pressure, and the pressure regulator) to low pressure (atmospheric pressure), and hence allow quick toggling of the microfluidic valve between the open (unpressurised) and closed (pressurised) state. Three way valves come in manually- or electrically-controlled flavours. The manual kind is simpler and more reliable; we use them for the MITOMI chips. The electric kind (more specifically solenoid valves) we use for the web-controlled setup.

First, we integrate a gRNA responsive promoter (pGRR) which controls GFP production. Then, we insert a 9Cas9-Mxi1 plasmid in W303 yeast strain. Finally, we integrate two gRNA sequences complementary to pGRR. The production of each gRNA is controlled by synthetic inducible promoters, GAL4 and Tet-O. dCas9-Mxi1 complexes with either gRNAs and hybridizes to pGRR which suppresses the production of GFP. Overall, the project poses no health and environmental risks, given that the synthetic genetic network has no phenotypic effects on other organisms. Furthermore, no project-related material will leave the laboratory for reasons other than sterilization for discarding.
Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory
As per iGEM's Safety Committee regulations, our laboratory and team strictly adhere to the recommendations proposed by Akbari et al in “Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory”.
According to Akbari et al., our experimental design, as explained above, “[does] not risk creating a gene drive system because cassettes encoding [dCas9] and sgRNA are not inserted into the cut site or located adjacent to one another in the genome and can thus be safely used by researchers without additional precautions.” [dCas9 will be maintained as a plasmid. There is no cut site due to the lack of endonuclease activity in dCas9.] Furthermore, our transformations are conducted on a haploid strain of yeast. The yeast will not be crossed. There will be thus no risk of conversion of heterozygotes into homozygotes within the population. Finally, the study involves the introduction of genetic parts with synthetic sequences in laboratory mutant strain of yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.
Regardless, we follow the following stringent confinement strategies:

AHUT_China,2016,Team:AHUT China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the project of AHUT_China in 2014, we built the shortest path calculation model based on DNA calculation, and illustrated the principle of calculation through a planning case of navigation pathway. But, this year, We have furthered study based on the path planning problem to be solved in 2014. BBa_K1341020-Solution24578, is the shortest pathway in the project of 2014 of AHUT-China, which Node NO.5 is a necessary node to be passed in order to get to Node NO.8. However, in our project of this year, we don’t have to pass Site NO.5 while taking Site NO.2 as the start point and Site NO.8 as the terminal, which provides us with more diverse pathway choices and more conforms to the real situation. In our project of 2016, the DNA single strands of the sites and lines are connected by bridging-PCR. 12 information bits are added to the DNA single strand of the lines, which the pre-4bp sequences contain the information of identification point, the mid-4bp sequences contain the information of the specified line, and the post-4bp contain the information of the path length. In order to obtain Solution24578, it needs to construct recombinant plasmid in every possible pathway. And then the recombinant plasmid was inserted in E.coli, where the fluorescent protein gene in Node NO.5 get expressed. Thus, all the pathways passing Node NO.5 screened out. By contrast, we don’t have to go through a series of complex process like what have been depicted above in order to obtain the shortest pathway <2-6-8> in this year.
3.Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
We made some contacts with some navigation companies in order to put our project into practice and bring the function of finding the shortest pathway through bio-computing into full play. Auto Navi map received our phone call and we introduced our project to them. The way we validated the two Bio-brick, BBa_K2044000 and BBa_K204401 corresponds to the way the map advises people to take the shortest pathway plan, which the company showed great interests in our project and encouraged us to further develop our project so that the general public can afford to use it in the real life.

Why did you take part in iGEM?
I joined the iGEM team to discover more about synthetic biology. I really knew nothing about the field before participating! I also think that it’s an amazing opportunity to develop my inter-disciplinary training.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was in charge of developing the wiki, which is the website on which all our final data are stored and presented. It regroups details from all the different sections of the project, so clarity and consistency are key to its success.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned a lot about web design, and in particular about how to adapt a website so that it is accessible to everybody and across all platforms. I also participated in the modelling part of the project, where I discovered how to launch software on supercomputer clusters.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
Both my parents are researchers, and I have already done internships as research assistant, so I don’t think that my vision of the job or my path were changed much.  I did however discover a lot more about the fields  in which I could apply my training!
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
Personally, I think that the possibilities that biotechnologies allow nowadays are simply awesome. We can do so many things with bacteria already, so imagine what we could achieve in the future on plants and animals! Of course, all work carried out should be surveilled so as to avoid any major disasters!

Why did you take part in iGEM?
I decided to join the team after realizing that a multi-disciplinary project could be what I just needed to help me decide what I want to do after my studies.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was in charge of the communication and organization, as well as of the collaborations. I am the one making sure our team is well visible on social medias or in the newspapers. I have also planned our upcoming trip to Boston.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned a lot in many different fields and most important, I learned how to use what I already knew to build this project. Working with so many people with different strengths and weaknesses was also very interesting and helpful.

The Tri-Research Team Strategy
In pursuit of effective inter-subteam communication, mGEM implemented weekly meetings where the three research subteams – Wet Lab, Dry Lab, and Human Practices – could present their progress and receive feedback from one-another. These “Tri-Research Team” meetings facilitated invaluable dialogue within mGEM’s open learning environment, with particular benefit to Human Practices and Wet Lab integration. The lab-based teams could teach those without lab skills their procedures and results, and the Human Practices team could challenge them to discuss how their results may shape the potential for their work as a future, theoretical product.
An example of this collaboration came with a report one week that the Wet Lab’s Typhoon, the machine which measured the fluorescence of our assays, had broken. There were no alternatives to provide imaging of the same caliber, and machines are uncommon even in university laboratories. From an article we wrote about the incident:
“Though it sent our imaging plans to a grinding halt, this incident also gave us food for thought. We ruminated over the implications of not being able to access costly scanners in order to detect and research bacteria and microbes. Being at a foremost university in Canada, we were fortunate to have access to Typhoons – but what of places elsewhere? What would our project look like with less equipment, less funding, less everything?”
Thus, the research subteams began a dialogue on the accessibility of duplicating our work. We realized that, if our theoretical end goal was to create a widely-used rapid diagnostic tool, then we should strive to use accessible machinery in our process. From this discussion, the Wet Lab team investigated the possibility of using a UV light box instead of the Typhoon to image their experiments' fluorescence. The Dry Lab team also explored a method of measuring fluorescence by combining Adobe Photoshop overlays on the image. We concluded during the next few Tri-Research meetings that the Typhoon would give us the best results in our proof-of-concept experiments, but that it was"

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

It is important to understand as much as we can about the environment we are going to work on to synergise with it           and maximise product efficiency.
The phyllosphere can be a harsh environment, particularly with respect to temperature and solar radiation. Such a           microclimate is highly heterogeneous and makes our product difficult to engineer and model without field study2
Figure 2: Many variables from both internal and external climates of the leaf influence the phyllosphere microbial community and potentially Softer Shock
We have also analysed the microbial phylums of the phyllosphere (bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea), showing a               great variety of adaptative properties like methanol metabolism and UV stress resistance. Surviving in the environment               of the leaf is difficult and requires some unique strategies, hence the microbial population is not homogeneously               located on the leaves but rather on nutrient oases1,3.               Most available nutrients of the phyllosphere are leached by-products of plant metabolism such as carbohydrates and               methanol, so the Phyllosphere Microbial Community (PMC) could almost be compared to scavengers that live with the               strict minimum1.               The phyllosphere organisms can provide stimulation through hormone secretion (like auxin), and protect the host               from pathogens by forming a physical barrier, just like our gut microbiota3.
The population dynamics of phyllosphere organisms, as well as how they interact with their host, is important to assess.               These microbial populations are influenced by many parameters and interact with each other in the classical schemes               of predation, commensalism, parasitism, mutualism and ammensalism. We also examined the routes of colonisation of the               aerial parts of the plant by its microbiota at the origin (rainfall, soil…)3.
For Softer Shock we need a host organism, or chassis for our plasmid. Our strategy is to select as a chassis an organism that               lives in the target’s phyllosphere.               The characteristics of the phyllosphere are very important because they could enhance the properties and effects of our               product on the targeted plant if we choose a chassis that comes from the target’s microbiota.

Restore gulf stream pump once it breaks down We could try to construct a bacterial pump. This is how it looks in my head: bacteria or something the like which float (sinking could also be possible) change the density of the surrounding media by metabolism of oily substances to sugar or something the now denser media would then sink, sucking fresh media as it goes. Maybe this wont safe the gulf stream but in a bioreactor it might work
plastic degrading bacteria(micro plastic degrading bacteria) Several bacteria and fungi are involved in degrading natural and synthetic plastics. First, polymers are broken down to monomers, these monomers are mineralized further (to CO2, H2O and CH4). This review shows a table with all known micro-organisms and the plastics that they can degrade with references. Biological degradation of plastics: A comprehensive review - Aamer Ali Shah, et al., Biotechnology Advances 26 (2008) 246–265.

Biofilm insulating bacteria Having bacteria grown in a biofilm on a building producing a some sort of porous vacuoles or gas vesicles which will give air insulation to the building thereby lowering heating and cooling costs.
Timer bacteria A simple protein clock (can be done using positive (auto-receptive) feedback loops). Can be useful for a lot of things. Like self-destruction or the smell of coffee in the morning. (If one would repress the expression of a gene essential for cell growth with a substance that is degraded by the cell itself, you could tell your cells when to start growing. This would prevent me from coming to the lab tonight for example. If a second similar clock existed to start the expression of another gene after the cells grew for some"

BBa_S05058 is an RBS with the gene that codes for our cyan pigment). The cyan pigment has been placed before the red light sensor so that if there is accidental read-through, we're not getting unwanted transcription of the cyan pigment.
The Blue Light Module is being synthesised for us by DNA2.0. It includes YFI (our blue light sensor), FixJ (the intermediate protein) and amilGFP (our yellow pigment). The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. The central section, coding for FixJ, has been flipped backwards and upside-down. This ensures that, if we get accidental read-through from the RNA polymerase from YF1, the sequence for FixJ will code for nonsense. Nothing will be made which will interfere with our system. Again, the black brackets indicate individual BioBricks. The ""TACTAG"" indicates a sequence of TACTAG ""scars"" to space out the promoter for FixJ and the promoter for the yellow pigment. This is more of a precaution than anything else. The list of ""STOP"" codons acts a terminator.
The Green Light Module is being synthesised using IDT gBlocks. cR indicates the promoter where the cI inverter protein binds. Again, we have some TACTAG spacers between the promoters, and some sections have been flipped backwards and upside-down. The directions of transcription are shown with pink arrows. The transcripts; CcaS, CcaR, cI inverter and the magenta pigment have all been synthesised with an attached his-tag. We thought this would be useful in case we wanted to isolate and purifying any of these transcripts via a nickel column.
The Future
Our project aims to provide a foundation for the fine control of organisms using multiple wavelengths of light. The potential use of lasers to control bacteria could provide high spatial control, while a well characterised system could provide good temporal control. Importantly, response is not limited to a molecular output. Possibilities include taxis, luminescence, electricity, magnetic fields and sound.
As has been proven in past research, systems expressed in E.coli can be modified and expressed in a eukaryotic model. In consideration, such a system could enable finely controlled mixed volume outputs of medically relevant molecules (e.g. patient specific antibody treatment). From an economic angle, a quantitative light input will correlate to a desired complex output from a single customizable organism strain, vastly increasing production times from"

Wednesday 9th
We finally got some plasmids designed for the population control circuits – all being well we will inactivate certain host genes using antisense RNA genes, to halt growth on demand. All being well.
Hopefully we’ll be meeting with our artist tomorrow to see what’s been happening in his world.
Thursday 10th
Today was that most magnificent of days – Master Plan creation day. With seven weeks to go we decided to formally set out what remains to be done in each aspect of the project, and a rough outline of what will happen when.
The meeting with Fraizer went well – he seems to have lots of good (and usable) ideas, and we’re hoping to meet with him again next week, hopefully at his studio.
Friday 11th
A very important day today, as we had the big meeting with the supervisors to assess how we were getting along with the gold criteria. It also served as the halfway point meeting to see how far along we are in general. It seemed to be quite productive. The bronze criteria are more or less in the bag, the silver criteria look equally sorted providing we can get the human practices stuff off the ground, and in terms of gold – we just need one of three done. We’ve sort of made progress on all three, though we decided we would make a much bigger effort to reach out to other teams for collaboration purposes.
Weekend 12th-13th
Cesar did some prep work for the modelling, and started the first BSim implementation. Otherwise it was a week of relaxation.
Week 8 (14th July – 20th July)
Monday 14th
Another day of slow but steady lab progress – primers were ordered (a batch of 80), kanamycin plasmids were transformed, and asRNA genes were dsigned – sort of.
Tuesday 15th
Primers are flooding in now, those genomes won’t know what hit them when we start PCR-ing out genes left right and centre.
In the evening we attended a discussion at the ongoing Edinburgh Biotech conference on the coming antibiotic apocalypse, in a bid to cheer ourselves up. It was very interesting.
Wednesday 16th
New targets for the population control system were sought out today, as an antisense system began to take shape. We will create a complimentary RNA gene with flanking inverted repeats to stabilise the gene, as the literature suggests.
Thursday 17th
AntisenseBot 5000 was made to automatically generate antisense genes from coding sequences, in Python. Meanwhile, paperclip half clips were made for the PCR"

Further Applications
Ultimately, the ability to express virtually any protein of interest shows great potential for laboratory work. Our Sporobeads could for example express TAL effectors for the binding of sequence-specific DNA stretches. This could allow simple GMO detection of food crops. Besides expressing proteins capable of binding compounds or ions of interest, our Sporobeads could also display proteins which have enzymatic activity. The 2011 University of Washington iGEM team developed an enzyme, Kumamolisin, which cleaves peptides. The substrate of this enzyme is a specific amino acid sequence which causes reactions in individuals with Celiac disease. Such a cleaving enzyme could be used to eliminate irritants from gluten-containing food products.
Sporovector
There are many possible applications for our Sporobeads, as it is possible to display all kinds of different proteins on their surface. To easily create them, we designed a Sporovector in which you just have to insert the gene encoding your fusion protein of choice.

Interviews
1. Dr. Zankow, Beverage Oriented Biotechnology
Security issues
In general, brewing beer with genetically modified yeast should not be a problem as far as security is concerned. If we manage to brew a beer with our yeast it should be safe for us to drink it because the filtration process is very efficient. However, we should not let other people who are not part of the team drink the beer.
Dr. Zankow remarked that the filtration process might filter out resveratrol and that we should check how much resveratrol is still in the beer after filtration and whether it is functioning.
Alternative Project ideas suggested by Dr. Zankow:
Removal of mycotoxins that are found in the grain
Beer for a special group of patients (e.g. Celiac disease, Gout)
nonalcoholic beer: since nonalcoholic beer does not taste as “satisfying” as normal beer, breweries are searching for something that adds taste to nonalcoholic beer. Dr. Zankow suggested Lactic acid
We are allowed to use the equipment of the chair to brew the beer.
2. Prof. Schwab, Biotechnology of Natural Products
He also made several suggestions for possible syntheses
Eugenol (clove-like aroma)
Limonene
According to him, strawberry aroma is very difficult to make
Prof. Schwab can give use information on several pathways, e.g. for limonene
3. Prof. Hofmann
He was quite critical about resveratrol since only 1 % of the substance is actually functional in the body. Therefore a large amount of resveratrol is necessary to produce a positive effect.
He has mass spectrometers that we are allowed to use, protocols for analyzing beer are available and we can do as many analyses as we want to. Only 5 µl are needed for one analysis.
More detailed information on the interviews are to be posted soon by the interviewers.
Fundraising
Lara talked to Prof. Herrmann and he is willing to give us money. We should send a specification of costs to his secretary.
Another possible source could be the excellence cluster.
Human Practice
We should use the contacts from the team from last year (e.g. Spiegel). We briefly talked about other institutions that could help us to get some publicity:
Carl von Linde Akademie

We use cmake to manage the build progress, cmake can generate cross-platform Makefile, we intend to make our project could be built in different operating system. Until now, only Linux operating system is tested. Windows and Mac should be supported soon. Download all source code, run cmake-gui to configure the project. Pay attention to the configure information.There should be ""missing ***"" messages when Cmake fail to find the dependent libraries. To fix those messages, one need to assign the path of related libraries by Cmake GUI. When Makefiles are successfully generated, execute the Make command to build.

After 3 h of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

Talk With Mr. Mahendra Sahare
Mr. Mahendra Sahare, is a PhD scholar at the Department of Humanities doing a project under a Supreme Court lawyer, Dr. Naveen Thayyil. He has been in collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi for the past two years. Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. Also, on his recent visit to IISER Mohali, he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali and help in the establishment of an iGEM team there. On our return from the Giant Jamboree 2016, our team members gave a presentation there, and thereafter our team mentored the iGEM Mohali team.
We also talked to many researchers pursuing their Ph.D here at IIT Delhi, to get to know about various possible uses of Biological Oscillators, before we started our project. Here are their views on how Biological Oscillators can be used in various applications.
Talk With Mr. B Venkat
Mr. Venkat is a researcher in the field of Systems Biology. In our discussion with him, he told us that Biological Oscillators can be used as a clock reference analogous to those in electrical engineering used for signal processing, particularly as a bridge between networks for synchronisation and as a ""modem"" carrying information.
Talk with Mr. Sanjeev Kumar
A researcher by profession, he works in the field of synchronisation of non-linear and linear oscillators. His guidance over the subject of Biological Oscillators allowed us to use gene regulatory networks in circuits similar to the repressilator.
Talk With Mr. Madanmohan
He is a researcher in the field of convergent systems. He told us about how Biological oscillators can have several applications in his field of research. According to him, if the oscillator is tuned to be convergent, then many interesting phenomena like time-scales and synchronisation can be analysed better.

  The Main work to deal with first is the database . We get nothing but a file with the format of ‘xml’. It may be a very easy work for someone who is professional . But for a beginner like our SQLite programmer, maybe the only thing he can do is to Google , Google and Google... Fortunately, eventually he finished it.
  
  Core Data is a very useful part of iOS developing. The built-in Sqlite function is the one with which our SQLite programmer can set up a built-in database.
  
  The next thing we should overcome is transfering XML to Sqlite. Thankfully there is NSXmlParser Method with which we can finish this work.
  
  Then why do we choose SQLite?

Blog #8 - iGEM team members back 2 school
By NBailly 16:00, May 22 2014 (CDT)
Hello iGEM enthusiasts, Since our last visit, the student of the biology-chemistry course at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium in Aachen have been busy studying the basics of protein biosynthesis and the ""lock and key"" model. Now the 9th graders are prepared to have a closer look at synthetic biology and our project.
Each year, many people die of nosocominal infections - infections that the patients acquired in a hospital. However, these infections would be preventable in large part through better hygiene programs. Diseases caused by multi-resistant pathogens are especially critical because therapy options are very limited in these cases.
But actually, what are pathogens exactly and where do they come from? In order to answer these questions, we start the teaching module with the topic ""Microorganisms in our Environment"". In this part, we explain which germs we encounter every day, and how be can best protect ourselves from them.
In order to demonstrate how many and which microorganisms are our steady companions, we conduct an experiment with the students. A pair of students received 3 agar plates: one with regular LB agar, one plate with agar supplemented by an antibiotic, and one selective agar plate for yeasts and fungi. Equipped with the plates, the students wander through their school and take contact samples from places they think many microorganisms grow there. We will incubate the plates over the weekend so that we can show the students in the next lesson what has grown on their samples.

E-oscillators
Two genetic oscillators, dual-feedback oscillator and quorum-sensing oscillator, are built in our wetlab, so we first analyze the important biological processes and construct ODE sets to simulate these two oscillators separately. However, due to the time interval between the expression of regulating protein and their binding to promoters, we improve our models more precise by DDEs. Once the better genetic oscillator is selected through experiments, we will adopt the corresponding one as the virtual part.
Quorum-sensing oscillator
ODEs
As for quorum-sensing oscillator, luxI proteins could generate AHL from some substrates consisting of acyl-ACPs and Sadenosylmethionine (SAM). We assume that the amount of substrates is sufficient.
AHL(Acyl homoserine lactones) is a kind of auto-inducer, which could combine with luxR protein and activate the promoter. In addition, the lactonic ring of the AHL will be hydrolyzed once in presence of AiiA protein.
For transcription activation, we use Hill function to describe the rate of production.

In addition, many genes have a non-zero minimal expression level, namely basal expression level. It can be described by adding a term

Collaborations
Collaborations with institutions or other iGEM Teams promote exchange of experiences and know-how and lead to a benefit for both sites. Therefore, we got in contact with two local research institutions. They supported us with advice, materials and helpful methods for our experiments. One of the supporters was the Thünen Institute in Braunschweig with a research focus on the economy, ecology and technologies of rural regions, seas and forests. Dr. Ulf Prüße, an expert for renewables conversion technology, gave us professional advice for our experiments with beads and biofiltration. Furthermore, we received lots of material from the institute and had the possibility to measure the methane degradation at their gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector.
An important part of the iGEM competition is the cooperation between the teams. In order to get in contact with other iGEM Teams from Germany, we joined the iGEM Meet Ups in Munich and Aachen. We numerously represented the iGEM Team Braunschweig at both events and drew attention to this year’s project. We used these opportunities to give presentations and obtained encouraging feedback and helpful ideas during the follow-up discussions. At the Munich meet-up we made contact with the iGEM teams from Aachen and Hanover, followed by some nice barbecue evenings with the team from Hanover. We also met a few iGEMers from Aachen at the “Maker Faire” in Hanover and spent the day together. Team Aachen provided us with a self-engineered methane sensor which we would later put to good use in our experiments. Such collaborations were strengthened at the second meet-up which was held in Aachen in September. However, we did not only get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM Team Waterloo and discussed our projects"

Interview Video 2 with Dr. Sanjib Bhakta
Click here to hear Dr. Sanjib Bhakta, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London and UCL, discuss what the current time frame is for TB diagnosis.
Diagnosis of many infectious diseases relies on expensive medical or laboratory technology, which additionally requires trained personnel to operate. In remote areas of the developing world these facilities may be out of reach for the most vulnerable people. This can be due to a lack of effective infrastructure to enable people to travel the often long distances to hospitals that are usually based in urban areas, and also because of the relatively high cost of accessing healthcare. As a result traditional medicine is still heavily relied upon. Not only do these issues prevent people from accessing quick and effective treatment, they also create “blind spots” in the global surveillance of disease transmission.
Interview Video 3 with Dr. Sanjib Bhakta
Click here to hear Dr. Sanjib Bhakta, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London and UCL, discuss what the average concentration of TB bacteria is in a sputum sample, and whether there is a relationship between concentrations and the severity of symptoms.
How can we apply virus-based diagnostics in the real world?
The major health challenges faced by the developing world differ considerably from those encountered in developed countries, caused by a combination of factors including lack of funding, poor access to medical care and different environmental conditions. These issues are contributing to the ongoing spread of bacterial diseases including tuberculosis (TB), leprosy, syphilis and yaws. Different problems have emerged in the fight against these diseases: in the cases of leprosy (caused by Mycobacterium leprae or M. lepromatosis), syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum) and yaws (T. pallidum pervenue) conclusive diagnosis remains difficult, as these bacteria have not been successfully cultured under lab conditions. TB, caused by the bacterium M. tuberculosis, now displays widespread drug resistance, with some areas even facing multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (Fig. 1), meaning the bacteria are immune to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Additionally, extensively-drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), in which the bacteria are resistant to all first and second-line drugs, making the disease incredibly difficult to treat, is"

The SDS PAGE gel in a single electrophoresis run can be divided into stacking gel and separating gel.. Stacking gel is poured on top   of the separating gel (after solidification) and a gel comb is inserted in the stacking gel.   The acrylamide percentage in SDS PAGE gel depends on the size of the target protein in the   sample (details shown below).
Acrylamide  M.W. Range
7%  50 kDa - 500 kDa

SDS Protocol: [6]
Use one thin glass plate in front of a thicker one.
Put these two glass plates on a rubber sealing in the casting frame (make sure that you close the casting frame).
Proof the closeness with water.
Pour out the water and clean the device by using a papel towel.
After water proofing of the casting frame, the separation gel (12%) could be prepared in a separate small beaker according to the protocol above.
Note: Ammonium Persulfate and TEMED should be added at last, because TEMED will solidify the solution very fast. And be noticed that TEMED smells very bad, so use it fast and close the bottle rapidly.
After making the separation gel solution should be filled between the two glass plates until it reaches the mark of the casting frame.
You can straighten the surface by adding a thin layer of isopropanol to your separation gel.
Keep the rest of your solution in the small beaker for cheaking the solidification of your separation"

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a"

If these pages are then piled up to form a tower                                         (considering the height of a single paper is 0.1mm), it would be 218.61 meters                                         tall (717.2 ft)! Just between the Agbar Tower (the taller building in our city,                                         Barcelona; 142m) and the Eiffel Tower (324m). Scientists have estimated that the human body contains                                         nearly 37.2 trillions of human cells (note that this does not include the                                         microbiota). So...to write all the information condensed in the DNA of one                                         human body it would take a large amount of DINA-4 papers. This amount is so                                         huge that if the papers were arranged in a straight line, the light would spend 2553 years traveling from one end to the other. This is 2553 light-years long!                                         Keep in mind that the distance from the sun to the earth is just 8.3 light-minutes, so                                         imagine the amount of data stored in such a low volume like your body.
Using these examples, the general population can easily                                         understand the information storage capability of DNA. Nearly everyone                                         (including ourselves) was pretty amazed to realize how much information human                                         bodies contain stored in DNA. After this examples, we explained that our sensor                                         was based on a piece of information stored in two genes of the DNA. So this                                         comparisons helped the general population to understand that DNA contains much                                         useful information, which is different between us and that we can extract this                                         information to create a personalized product. This helped us to explain the DNA                                         extraction and PCR process of our project to the general population. This way, they                                         are much better informed about the project and can have an opinion about it.                                         Then, we integrated that informed opinion from the general population in the                                         design of our project. Dedicating effort in explaining the projects in a simple                                         but rigorous way can help teams to receive feedback from the target population.                                         This feedback can be incorporated into the design of the project and hence make                                         it more suitable for the real world.

8) PoBoL
PoBoL  stands for ""Provisional Biobrick Language"", and represents a way to  translate different databases into one common language.  The binding file is a way of specifying  which tables and entries from the database correspond to which PoBoL data  types.  Ideally, you would be able to  download a binding file for any given database, saving you the trouble - for  our tutorial database, such a file can be found **HERE** - just copy and paste  the contents of the text file into the 'Binding Configuration' window.  If no such file existed though, you would  have to create it manually: first you would select a Table and then a Field  from the 'Database Information' box, and then a corresponding Object and Field  from the 'PoBoL fields' box, and click ""Bind"".  This would have to be done for all the  tables and fields you wish to use from the database.  Fortunately, you only have to create the mySQL connection and its  corresponding PoBoL binding file once.   Now click ""Save/Connect"", and select 'Yes' when the message  box appears.  Now Clotho is  connected!  (Note: In future uses, you  will only have to enter the user name and password and click ""Connect"".)
More  information on PoBoL can be found **HERE**.

The average numbers of colonies per agar chip show that keyboards are among the most contaminated surfaces in the lab. Smartphone touchscreens are equally contaminated as the cover of a paper lab notebook. But while it is easy to disinfect a touchscreen, you wouldn't spray disinfectant on your paper notebook. Taking this into consideration with the increased productivity, reproducability and safety, we think that paper-based documentation systems should be replaced by digital documentation methods.
Community labs and containment strategies
Community labs do not undergo stricter monitoring than commercial (industrial, analysis) or institutional laboratories. Although people have a higher suspicion towards community labs.
We invited people from the Technik Garage [3] , a community lab close to Hannover (Beckedorf), to Aachen and discussed via Skype call with the team Paris Saclay [4] about biosafety in general and about strategies against accidentially introduction of GMOs into the environment, which is by far the greatest concern of the public. To address that concern team Paris Saclay developed two containment strategies for GMOs, which could be used by community labs as well. For more information about our discussions with community labs visit our Community Labs page.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Introduction1Fr_-_-_TEXT.html,"ématique étrange, censé être un avantage technologique apporté par la vectorisation, le ciblage est loin d’être optimal. Ce dernier s’effectue par reconnaissance d’un marqueur membranaire exprimé à la surface des cellules cibles.  Le problème est justement  là, une quantité très faible de marqueurs membranaires sont spécifiques à un type cellulaire dans tout l’organisme. Donc, même si la dose d’agent thérapeutique est plus forte au niveau des cellules cibles, d’autre cellules dans le corps vont subir les effets de l’agent thérapeutique.
Le passage de la membrane est un événement clé pour un médicament, l’efficacité de se dernier est lié à sa capacité à franchir cette barrière. L’agent thérapeutique, dont l’action est subcellulaire, doit pénétrer la cellule pour pouvoir agir. Les vecteurs de type procaryote ainsi que les nanoparticules polymériques sont très handicapés par cette étape cruciale dans le devenir d’un médicament.
Le système immunitaire est certainement la problématique insurmontable. Le système immunitaire est à la fois non spécifique et spécifique. De ce fait, il se fixe sur tout ce qui fait plus de 60nm et qui se trouve dans le torrent circulatoire. Il s’adapte et réagit plus vite au fur et à mesure des rencontres avec les vecteurs. On sait depuis bien longtemps que les virus, les phages et les bactéries sont détectés par le système immunitaire et éliminés. La première détection est toujours tardive par rapport à l’injection du vecteur, laissant ainsi une certaine efficacité à la première dose. Mais lors de la seconde injection, la clairance est tellement rapide que l’efficacité du vecteur est quasi nulle.
Certains s’accordent à dire que ce problème n’est pas transposable aux nanoparticules, qui bénéficient de molécules de furtivité. Ces molécules, comme par exemple le Polyéthylène Glycol (PEG) empêcheraient la reconnaissance par le système immunitaire par répulsion stérique. Mais ceci n’est pas vrai, ou du moins uniquement en mono-in"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Editing Trial3_-_-_TEXT.html," food and shelter are also linked to sustainable development. However, the pollution from plastic has become a main block of sustainable development nowadays. So we held an event called 'Plastic for Plants', aiming to recycle massive plastic from college students. And we sent out plants in return.
Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. To protect our planet, the waste of plastic, or 'White Pollution' for more exact, must be settled down.             As a synthetic biology lab, we first studied a lot about 'plastic's biology decomposition'. Though we didn't choose it as our project at last, we found synthetic biology a useful tool to deal with white pollution in the future. Then we held about 3 conferences to discuss what and how we can do to deal with plastic waste with synthetic biology. During the discussion, we came out with some practicable solution. A bright future with no more white pollution is showed in front of us.             After that, we held a environmental friendly event called 'Plastic for Plants' combined with some popularization of science. We asked college students to collect their used plastic things for about 3 months and bring them to us then. We would send these bottles to the plastic recycling center and we would give students some plants as a reward.             Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. From the recycling center, we were told that the percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste can be increased when manufacture technique improves. On the other hand, the use of biodegradable plastics is increasing. As future synthetic biologic scientists, we are determined to green the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development in the future.
Lecture for High School Students
We invited a group of high school students to see our laboratory and tell them something about synthetic biology and our project. In this way we hope to share some knowledge of science and attract them to devote to themselves to the process of discovering mysteries of nature in the future.
A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in July. We introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.
In the beginning we introduced iGEM to students using 3 interesting iGEM projects as examples. Then we held a small class for the students: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for students"

現在、理科離れは世界的に顕著な問題となっています。この傾向は、今後科学の発展に伴い、技術の高度化・複雑化が進めば進むほど強くなると予想されています。そこで、私たちはこのような問題を解決するために、普段、科学と接点のない人に科学に触れてもらう機会を提供しようと考えました。プロジェクトを進める上で、私たちが最も大切したのは、誰もが手軽に科学技術を楽しめるということです。さらに、本学（京都工芸繊維大学）の教育理念として「科学と芸術の出会い」すなわち、「科学」と「芸術」の2分野の融合というものが掲げられています。これらをヒントに私たちはバイオテクノロジーを用いて芸術作品を生み出す「バイオアート」に着目することにしました。

Groningen,2010,Team:Groningen#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," prevent me from coming to the lab tonight for example. If a second similar clock existed to start the expression of another gene after the cells grew for some time (or before they start, or switches off after some time or whatever you want), you could set up whole protein expression experiments and the like at once.
Molecular fishing rod Using the Biotin – Avidin connection bacteria could maybe be bound to a surface or the like. The bacteria could express biotin or avidin to the surface (the bricks exist) at a certain metabolic state, on command, as long as they are alive, when you flash them with light… and then be fished out of the solution with a device coated with Biotin or avidin.
Radio wave bacteria Using magnetized components, like Neodynium an earth indigenous magnetic substance, and some sort of rotary mechanism attached (possibly like the bacterial flagellum) it can be possible to rotate a magnet around another magnetized pole. By modulating the frequency(by controlling the rotation speed) this effectively creates an FM signal.
Bacterial camera If bacteria with photosensitive receptors are properly laid out in a grid it can be possible to create a rudimentary camera. If the photoreceptors trigger a signal which sets in motion a cascade to a measurable effect. Measurable effects can be increased expression of a specific gene (slow), the opening of certain membrane channels (through second messenger systems) or the activation of certain proteins.
Biological Computer The area of research in biological computing is increasing and opens waves of new possibilities into the miniaturization of computers. All research in the area shares the same basic idea: DNA is a perfect carrier of data and the expression of genes into proteins provides enormous possibilities for calculation (as life itself demonstrates). Two kinds of research can be discriminated (superficially): The utilization of bacterial colonies which perform calculations by setting in motion signaling processes(Conway's Game of Life being an example of the more general principle of Cellular Automata) and the utilization of signals cells as computers by designing mechanisms to store and retrieve data in the form of proteins or other molecules. While not a 'readymade' project, with sufficient interest in the subject this can be a very exciting summer! (Conway's Game of Life seems like a interesting thing to do, even though we probably won't be able to raise the dead, systems that simulate this behaviour might be possible, does anyone know if there is cells that organize in a strict pattern that can be grown in a dish?

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", we introduced a pseudo-metabolism whose concentration was linked to fluxes that involve G6P. The pseudo-metabolisms serve as counters. A technical detail is that each reversible reaction had to be substituted by two irreversible ones. Doing so prevents a counter from decreasing, and thus underestimating G6P metabolism, if an associated flux is reversed. For the pseudo-metabolites, two outbound fluxes were added as new objective functions.
Given these objectives, we conducted an FBA and tested knock-outs combinations of up to three reactions with the COBRApy package (Ebrahim, Lerman, Palsson, & Hyduke, 2013) in an iPython notebook (Perez & Granger, 2007) under usage of IBM's cplex optimizer. For computation time reasons, the knock-out candidates were limited to those \(36%\) reactions that were more active in the FBA which minimizes G6P usage compared to a maximization.
Unfortunately, the results were in the noisy range of numerical zero (\(10^{-11}\)), and therefore inconclusive.
A well annotated, non-curated model
After the inference of a model for Lactobacillus johnsonii (ATCC 33200) failed, we used more comprehensive models of more distant related organisms. In the following we concentrate on a model for Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 from the BioModels database with the ID MODEL1507180045 . The model was manually generated by Teusink et al., 2006. However, the database considers it a non-curated model, because the semantics has not been fully checked yet.
Similar to the last analysis, pseudo-metabolites were used for creating an objective functions for the G6P metabolism. This time flux variability analysis (FVA) was used instead of FBA. FBA only finds a single solution (rate values for all fluxes) that optimize the objective functions under consideration of the specified constraints of the model. In contrast, FVA determines the range of rates a flux can have without jeopardizing the objective functions or constraints. Furthermore, we allowed the ranges of the FVA to deviate from the optimal solution by \(10%\) in order to account for some biological variability.
Using FVA we identified \(40\) knock-out candidates, for which combinations of up to three reactions were tested. These candidates were chosen by the following criteria:
It is possible for the reaction to be both active and inactive in a living cell.
It is possible for the reaction to be inactive if no G6P"

Social Media
When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu, Sina and so on.
Our holistic propaganda was promoted by professional media, mass media and social media. Via professional media, led by Biodiscover, Antpedia and Biosns, our promotion has reached a great number of professional groups of over 5 million people. Meanwhile, we also required our sponsors that the propaganda would be promoted to all of their customers, ensuring professional groups are included. Moreover, we promoted our project to ordinary people by mass media led by Tencent, which is the biggest news portal of Chinese internet. As statistics from Iresearch shows, up to October 2013, Chinese user coverage of Tencent had reached 89.73%. As for social media, people get access to our holistic by Wechat（with over 650 million users）and Sina microblog（with about 143.8 million monthly active users）. Our news about exhibition was delivered by many 公众号 and retweeted by official Micro-blogs of many enterprise, including a listed company named Guangdong Teamtop Information Technology Co., Ltd.
Here are screenshots and links of the news as follows.
The following media all have completely reported this activity. Only with their help can iGEM, synthetic biology and how we respond to bacterial drug resistance with synthetic biology be showed to public. We express our sincere thanks tothese media for their contribution to popularize synthetic biology.

Due to the multiplicity of kill switches designed in the past years of iGEM, we also created a simple and                 easy overseeable database of all kill switches either described or implemented. It contains all relevant                 information for the selection of a suitable kill switch, for example a classification regarding the redundancy of crucial compounds, such as inducer and toxin or a topology map.
Dependency. Keeps the system together.
In order to guarantee the fitness of  the host organism as well as the invading cell,                 we established different exchange-based dependencies - a malonate based dependency with                 the invading E. coli cell as the malonate source and a protein based dependency                 complementing essential gene knockout.

The most genuine person award goes to Tapasya. She is always there when you need her, and she always brings a bundle of joy with her! Tapasya also has the best fashion sense ever, and her outfit and makeup are always on point. Although this is Tapasya’s first year on the iGEM team, she is a born leader and is already making a difference! When she is not in the lab she is an avid reader and writer, girl scout, loves to watch tv, and is a math whiz. She also loves both coffee and tea, enjoys making hand turkeys year long, is fond of modern minimalistic designs, and has claimed that she has hacked the FBI.
ELLIE KIM
Ellie is truly an 80 year old trapped inside of a 17 year old body; she is incredibly wise for her age. She possesses a rare characteristic that others spend years trying to emulate; she is capable of overcoming the most daunting obstacles. If you tell her something is impossible, she will most definitely prove you wrong. Her selfless characteristic is evident in all her actions. Ellie’s devotion to iGEM parallels to her unquenchable love for Cheeky’s queso, her pink hair tie, and Matt Bomer.

Colony Morphology
Reasoning:
The dyes in the agar plates will differentially stain cells based on whether or not they produce  curli and cellulose (Nakhamchik 2008). Bacteria that exclusively express curli will bind to the  congo red and will form red colonies, whereas bacteria that express only cellulose will form blue colonies. If both are expressed, purple colonies will be formed. Rough colonies are indicative of  curli formation. In the below photograph, there is more variation in colour at 23°C (picture on the left) than at 37°C, reflecting the protein expression phenotypes that are accessible  at the lower temperature. This is the reason the former temperature was chosen to incubate  colony morphology plates.

Results
Before presenting the final results obtained from the interviews, it is important to highlight that some of the numbers might not add up correctly to a constant total. This because the children that were interviewed might have an age as young as six years old, so maybe they just forgot to answer one or two questions. Nevertheless, the results still show us a very notable tendency.
For the final results, every team sent their data to one member of TecCEM, Valeria Rico. She gathered all the information so that everybody could make their interpretations of the results. As showed on the table below, most of the answers were positive. Children did like the activities from the handbook and could relate them to the topics that they saw in class. Also, it is important to highlight that, according to the data, almost 50% did know from about the main topics of the experiments that were introduced. From this two last statements, we can conclude that children did need practical reinforcement of the theory they are learning in class, and our Experimental Handbook could be the way to accomplish this.
Finally, with the table shown below, you can see that most of the children that were interviewed nationally responded that they wanted to have a science-related profession. We believe that this result might be slanted because children had just done the experiments.
Nevertheless, we can interpret this fact as a good thing and, therefore, think about a strategy. Children, after having a practical and funny science-activity, starts liking and leaning towards science. Therefore, more activities like ours are needed in Mexico and probably the world.

This last possibility was thought as the evolution of Urban Orchards in the way that it is not necessary to have a ground to cultivate, if you have a ChatterBox you can cultivate everywhere.
To obtain more ideas, we went to ‘International Seminar on Urban Form’ (ISUF), a widely-known congress about urbanism in where we contacted with architects that gave us more ideas about sustainability. We were very interested in the speech of June Komisar and Joe Nasr from Ryerson University (Canada), which told us about introducing ChatterPlant in rooftops.
Gathering the ideas together, we realize that it cannot be predicted all the possible ChatterPlant future applications.  Nonetheless, we hope to help in the development of future self-sufficient cities by bringing closer the agriculture to everyone with ChatterPlant.
APPLIED DESIGN CONCLUSION
In order to study the potential applications of ChatterPlant, first we explained why ChatterBox is essential in ChatterPlant project. Secondly, a study of close relationed areas was done. Finally, the innovative SynBio concepts that ChatterPlant could contribute to society were evaluated. Gathering all the information, the possible current and future applications were considered.
Bearing all this in mind, these are the obtained conclusions:
ChatterBox is necessary in ChatterPlant project because of the accessibility and control it brings.
ChatterPlant SynBio circuits improve the control over the plant development and behavior, in a more sustainable manner than other solutions.
Future ChatterPlant applications will be based on making houses, communities and neighborhoods  self-sufficient.
We aspire to fully apply ChatterPlant in urban environment, obtaining an innovative sustainable approach in agriculture, and bringing it closer to the population.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

European iGEM Meetup iGEM TUDelft organized an European iGEM Meetup. On the 7th of July, various teams from all over Europe gathered in Delft for a symposium. This included three speakers that talked about implementation of synthetic biology and poster presentations of the iGEM teams.
Central Veterinary Institute The Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) is the bioveterinary research institute of Wageningen University & Research. Located in Lelystad, it is commissioned by the Dutch authorities and carries out research related to vaccine development, diagnostics and animal health in general. On the 10th of July, we gave an elaborate presentation on our project, during which we discussed the setup and story with the people at CVI.
Go/No-Go presentation In order to involve our colleagues at the university in our project, we gave a Go/No-Go presentation, where all researchers and students in the relevant chair groups were invited to attend. Here, we gave a comprehensive 20-minute presentation on our project, how far we had come, and how much we were still planning to do in the last few months before the Jamboree. Afterwards, the audience was able to ask questions and vote if we made enough progress to proceed and participate at the Giant Jamboree. We got some valuable input and tips on the science part of our project, as well as the way we tell our story. Luckily, more than 90 percent of the public voted for a 'go'!
Master students Biotechnology During the introduction week of the new academic year of Wageningen University & Research, we presented our project to the new batch of master students in Biotechnology. This way, we already taught them something about synthetic biology, and hopefully got them hooked on participating in iGEM next year! After the presentation, we got some great comments and several curious and interested students who wanted to know more.
Topsector Chemie One of our team members pitched our project at the annual Topsector Chemie closing ceremony in Wageningen, at the 30th of August. This short pitch focussed on the challenges we face in using synthetic biology. Topsector Chemie is an organization with the goal to find solutions to big social challenges. These are the so-called Grand Societal Challenges by the Horizon 2020 program of the European Commission. Topsector Chemie approaches these challenges from a chemical point of view, collaborating with other top sectors wherever possible.

Meetup at MIT
 
On the 29th of October, our team is going to host a meetup at MIT. This will be our first time hosting a meetup, and we are excited to share and learn with other iGEM teams. Since this Giant Jamboree may be the first time for most of the iGEMers to present in front of so many audiences, we want to practice more and provide other teams an opportunity to practice together. Participating teams will have the opportunity to present their projects, and exchange their ideas with other iGEM teams and faculty advisors right before the Jamboree.

We decided to codon optimize and synthesize these genes to clone into a common E. coli expression vector pET29b+. A nucleotide alignment showing the codon optimizations to Bba_K771303 is shown below.
We screened each enzyme with the following criteria:
The enzymes had to over-express well in E. coli,
They had to have activity at the nanomolar level,
And they had to be inhibited by nanomolar levels of triclosan, the concentration leaving wastewater plants [18]
1. Overexpression
Protein purity assessed through SDS-PAGE gels shown below:
Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically from absorbance at 280 nm (A280). A280 readings converted enzyme concentration to mg/ml. The molarity of each enzyme was determined by dividing mg/ml by the enzyme’s extinction coefficient, theoretically derived from each enzyme’s amino acid sequence from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/  Extinction Coefficients used:
influenzae 17,420
falciparum 46,885
protothecoides 34,380
tricornutum 37,360
coli 15,930
B. pseudomallei and T. pseudonana did not express under our conditions, so they were eliminated from our FabI team.
2. Enzyme Activity Screening
Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically through the decrease in NADH absorbance over time on the native substrate analog crotonyl CoA. Activity is defined as the change in optical density (absorbance) per minute. Activity is normalized by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay. Each enzyme was assayed with 100 uM NADH and 100 uM crotonyl-CoA. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, no enzyme. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale. Two biological replicates of each enzyme was used.
S. aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12]. We later found out we didn’t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent! Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NAD"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

Our human practice project includes two themes addressing many very different questions. The first ones are about various intellectual property issues. The other theme relates to the popularization of sciences and more specifically to our contribution to the researchers’ night.
We have chosen to divide the theme ""intellectual property"" into two parts because this theme is the main part of our reflexion and it required a longer development, but also because we collaborated with the University of British Columbia on this theme and an entire part seemed necessary to explain our work. As a summary : the first part deals with the intellectual property rights inference towards the iGEM contest and is made up by a reflexion on the economic challenges the synthetic biology industry faces. The second one sums up our collaborative work on the intellectual property with the UBC iGEM team. And the third one quickly presents our scientific popularization involvement.
Part I: Intellectual property issues
Introduction
Free knowledge sharing is part of the foundational principles of the iGEM contest. Consequently, protecting the possible commercial uses of the iGEM team members’ projects seems difficultly feasible by common ways (especially patents and copyrights). However, the intellectual property rights in general and patents in particular are commonly known to be the only way to promote innovation in a profit-making logic: if companies cannot secure the economic outcome of their investments in R&D, they will not invest in it. A simple conclusion could then easily be drawn from these very statements:iGEM projects would be unlikely to be industrially and commercially developed, to the extent that it would be difficult for companies to capture the economic returns of their investments.
Nonetheless, the decision of opening an iGEM entrepreneurship division, whose objectives are clearly to optimize the economic opportunities given by the performing iGEM innovation system, vigorously shook that very last conclusion.
The aim of this human practice project is to show that patents are not the only way, not even always the best mean to promote innovation. Viable alternative models do exist, such as the ""Common's system"", which will be discussed further on. We will assume the iGEM team members form a commons similar to the Open Source community of the IT sector to strike up a reflexion on the development of alternate economic solutions to patents.
We will most notably refer to both Joseph Stig"

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ptic technique in the laboratory, plating cells onto an agar plate,  and preparing and running an agarose gel for gel electrophoresis. The SHADs then joined in a discussion about potential applications of synthetic biology and how these applications could be achieved through molecular biology techniques and principles. After the introductory discussion and a safety briefing, students performed basic tasks and aseptic techniques. They SHAD students learned how to properly operate a micropipette and how to streak an agar plate using E.coli with reporter proteins, all while maintaining an uncontaminated workspace using aseptic technique. They each created a design and the next day (after overnight incubation) the SHADs got to see their ideas come to life. Following the interactive laboratory section, students were guided through one of the labs of our iGEM team to observe different workspaces and tools that they might be able to use one day, should they continue to pursue the path of a synthetic biologist.
Day 2: Miniprep and GMOs
The students began with a quick discussion on mobile genetic elements as an introduction to the day’s experiment. Working with members of Waterloo iGEM, the students were guided through the steps of mini-prepping E.coli :pelleting of cells from a culture, lysing the cells to make the DNA accessible, then isolating the DNA from other cellular debris. For our experimental protocols see our [Experiments Page] ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Experiments ). After the miniprep, we proceeded with a discussion on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We began with watching a video by “Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell” ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmcXYp8xu4 ) to give a brief background on GMOs and as a talking point for discussion. Students then provide their own thoughts and asked questions about the uses GMOs in general and shared their personal choices as consumers with regards to GMOs.
Day 3: Gel Electrophoresis, Ethics, and Science Communication
We began the final day of our workshop by going over the process of gel electrophoresis and the significance of the results. Students then practiced loading the samples into the gel before fully running the gels; they were imaged and showed to the students. The workshop then shifted the focus from the lab to exploring what makes good science, the impact of good communication in science, and the ethics regarding synthetic biology. It was emphasized that good science extends beyond producing results in the lab – it stems from thorough"

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html,"ins first Science Café event for synthetic biology organized and hosted by the iGEM Berlin Team. During this event, we had speakers from different backgrounds and we discussed chosen aspects of synthetic biology with participants openly over drinks and food. The artist Ping Lui from Cologne presented his speculative design of an oracle based on magnetotactic bacteria. Rüdiger Trojok, an infamous German biohacker presented his current project, Howard Boland shared his bioart projects and former iGEM involvement with us and Johann from our team gave a short presentation about iGEM and our project. These events were designed to have a high impact on the German understanding of synthetic biology and were a major success in Berlin.
One of the current major issues in synthetic biology is the laws and regulations concerning patents. iGEM generally refuses patents and promotes the idea of open source biology. However, as the success and applicability of synthetic biology depend on industry investments, there has to be a compromise in policy regulations. To discuss this topic in detail we teamed up with patent lawyers from the Adares Patentanwältekanzlei as well as Biocommons (Creative Commons license model for Synbio) activist Rüdiger Trojok to discuss patenting and fundamental principles of intellectual property. In summary, we used art events and practical workshops to confront the German public with issues of synthetic biology. Furthermore, our project of creating a remote control for E. coli bears various practical applications as well as expands the possibilities of future functional biological systems.

Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system
We have collaborated with several other registered iGEM teams, providing and receiving assistance in various aspects of our projects. Such collaborations include:
WPI iGEM Team - We performed confocal microscopy data collection for the WPI iGEM team, to aid with the characterization of their parts
Tufts iGEM Team - Both the MIT and Tufts iGEM teams administered surveys in order to obtain public opinion on certain aspects of our projects. We handed out a proportion of the Tufts iGEM’s surveys, and they in turn distributed several copies of our survey. This aided both teams by increasing the number and diversity of respondents and making the data collected more representative of the general population.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions.
