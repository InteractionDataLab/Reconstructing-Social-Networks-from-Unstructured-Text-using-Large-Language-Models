Figure 12. Colony PCR of transformed pSB1C3-T7-Lys-LT (1) Ladder (2)-(5) Amplified Lys samples.
The plasmid from the culture was also subjected to sequencing. Unexpectedly, the sequencing result indicated that the linker-tags had not been successfully incorporated into the construct. A second attempt was performed with same procedure to obtain pSB1C3-T7-Lys-LT. One colony arose from the procedure, but sequencing results showed that the construct had not been successfully assembled.
To troubleshoot, a second strategy to try and add the linker-tag sequence was to perform a PCR on the whole pSB1C3-T7-Lys construct while adding a BamHI sequence on the 3’ of the lysostaphin sequence.
Overhang PCR of Lys Strategy 2: First to ninth Attempt [❌]
In this second strategy to perform the overhang PCR, we had tried several attempts of optimizing the PCR conditions to amplify pSB1C3-T7-Lys-BamHI. The PCR was performed using a Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase. We had tried different buffers, to different annealing temperatures, to different extension times, to different template concentrations and even using DMSO in the reaction. However, we were not able to obtain the right sized amplicon in sufficient amounts. The size of the amplicon should be 2852 bp in size, however we either resulted in no bands or unspecific bands. A more detailed description of the experiments can be found in the lysostaphin Lab Book Week 14-15. Below are some images of the PCR result during optimization.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints we could not continue those experiments and therefore were also unable to purify lysostaphin or attach the enzyme to spider silk.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.
Project Details
The Sensor
The design of our sensor was based on the lambda phage lysogenic vs lytic switch.  Optimally, the system would be activated in the presence of DNA damage due to radiation.  For that reason, we utilized the lambda phage switch, which transitions from the lysogenic cycle to the lytic cycle when DNA damage is detected. The genetic circuit we designed focuses on the DNA damage-sensitive lambda phage lytic-lysogenic cycle switch followed by a rapid response reporter similar to the immobilized fusion enzyme system pioneered by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. An initial design of our sensor circuit is illustrated below.
Under normal conditions, PRM is active, which transcribes the lambda repressor, cI + RBS.  The lambda repressor binds to OR1 and OR2, repressing PR, which in turn inhibits the transcribtion of Cro and TEV.
Once DNA damaged occurs, the ssDNA binds to RecA.  RecA becomes activated and cleaves the cI repressor, allowing for PR to turn on.  Cro then binds to OR3, which represses PRM and inhibits the transcription of the cI repressor.  Now that PR is active, the transcription of the TEV protease occurs, which is used in the reporter structure of the circuit.
The Reporter
Our reporter system will use a modified version of Imperial College London iGEM 2010 fast reporter system. Imperial’s quick acting response module used the transcription of TEV protease to cleave the bond between the GFP, C23O fusion protein. This unbound form of C230 could then form a tetramer and convert the colorless substrate catechol into a yellow product.
Using the Freiburg BioBricking Assembly technique, we plan to produce a miniature catalog of fast acting reporters while reducing the leakiness of Imperial’s construct. To achieve the latter, we plan to link a second GFP to the C-terminus of C230; this new linkage would be cleavable by RecA.
RecA Co-Protease
The normal laboratory strain of E. coli, DH10B, contains an inactivated form of RecA known as RecA1. Therefore, a"

We performed PCR overlap of parts 1-2 with 1-3 and 1-4 with 1-5. We ran the PCR products on a 1% gel and extracted the correct bands. We then followed the NEBuilder Kit protocol to create one plasmid with all of our parts using pSB1C3 as the backbone. This should be our first plasmid containing the PETase and MHETase enzymes. We plated 5 plates of our E. coli with the plasmid.

Notes from meeting with Karyl
Karyl suggests using quikchange to add his tag and suffix (no linker necessary)
Need unmethylated and maybe use DpnI to eliminate template plasmid DNA
Depending where active site is in KerA, quikchange may not work (ie if the active site is near the ends, there might be mutagenesis of the active end)
If we have time, there are other peptides to consider besides the His-tag
Perhaps try 3% gels for promoters

While writing codes, we didn’t forget to do our human practice. We put on many posters about synthetic biology in our campus. We delivered a presentation to explain synthetic biology, iGEM game and our project to the new students this semester. And many of the new students were really interested in iGEM. Further more, we went to the local high school to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM.
Rejection & Resubmission of the BioSearch
Our first app was rejected! This bad news shocked everyone. The reason was that we just used a private(illegal) API! We felt upset and disappointed. Only less than a month time was left, we had to work day and night. Half of our team members continued to write the second app, the other half started to rewrite the first one. After 10 days of torturous rewriting, we submitted our first software to AppStore again.
Preparation of Asian Jamboree
Xiao Tong, Xin Yang and Mubing Zhou prepared for an attractive presentation. Jingyao Guo and Yiqi Jiang designed the poster, prepared the poster presentation. There was a great news that our app could be download in iTunes just several days before we participate in the Asain Jamboree. We had such a good time in HKUST! Please click here for details.

We participated to the translation of several projects from other teams in French (KU Leuven, Moscow_RF, Tec Chihuahua, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB and XMU-CHINA).                     The goal was to help the team Leuven to inform everyone about what is iGEM and what the students achieve during this competition in different languages and be accessible to everyone. It is also a great way for them to get in touch with synthetic biology and genetic manipulations, something that is currently held back and limited due to negative perceptions by the masses.

Microscopy
Dilutions of overnight cultures in 1:5 and preparing slides for microscopy.
Overnights for Interlab cultures were done in LB Chl, and upon 1:5 dilution in M9 stationary phase was achieved within 1.5 hours (validation via OD 0.7-0.9 and microscopy).

Set Up
Set up conical flask cultures of interlabs for microscopy and flow cytometry.
1:10 dilution in M9 media for 45 minutes gave OD values ranging from 0.27 to 0.35. Only MG1655 cultures were grown and analyzed due to limited number of flasks.

Tasks
Tasks (no specific order; grab Leon for 4. and 5. at an appropriate time):
Make new bottle of M9 Modified Media without thiamine inside.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

We decided to use this software to design our thylakoid aptamer as it would allow us to not only choose a specific protein in the PSII protein complex but also to choose which area of our target protein to use in the analyses and design an aptamer for. We attempted to use the MAWS software but ran into some difficulties, afterwhich we contacted the Heidelberg team and decided on a mutually beneficial collaboration. As team Heidelberg is still developing and improving the software they agreed to run the analysis for us on their systems, and give us an output file. In exchange we would provide them with numerous candidate PDB files for them to test their system on, which would allow them to determine possible shortcomings, e.g. one of which was that there is a limit to the size of the PDB input file for the system to work.  We were also able to provide valuable feedback about how well their aptamer performed in our thylakoid binding experiments.

Elementary School Promotion
After S&T Month, we decided to extend our educate range to elementary school students. To let more people know the spirit of iGEM, we went to an elementary school, Chiao-Jen, to teach students there some basic concept of synthetic biology and introduce iGEM to them.
   We prepared a game for them and a bag of candy as reward, making it easier to understand what we want to express. Every team had one million dollars to invest in the genetically modified product. In the meanwhile, we mixed some fundamental idea of the synthetic biology into the game. Then, we explained the relationship between DNA and gene briefly. To our surprise, there was even a little boy asking us our opinion on GMO foods!

We made the statistic this way: We offered both sugar-free and sugary beverages. There were buckets placed beside each beverage pail. First, the participants were given two cups of drinks from each pail. They were asked to decide which one they like, and toss both of their cups into the correspondent bucket. At last, we sum up the cups in each bucket to find out the result.

Accomplishments
1. Digital Display
We  have constructed and characterized a fluorescent digital display device with synthetic  gene circuits,which  is able to respond to signals by displaying and switching number 0 and 1.
We  have designed and constructed a fluorescent digital display device with  synthetic logic gates.
We  have designed and made the physical device for the digital display.
Three-dimensional  graph and visual display of digital animation of the device is also performed  for a perfect device.
2. Cell Immobilization
We  have selected three methods to immobilize our engineering bacteria:
1)  Entrapping cells in calcium alginate beads;
2)  Entrapping cells in intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules;
3)  Embedding cells in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
We  found that Ca-alginate capsules are perfect fit for our physical device through  which was experimentally validated.We also find that 100rpm, 37℃ is  the suitable cultivation condition for the our engineering cells in the  capsules.
We have  embedded our engineering cells into the intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsule and  characterized them with fluorescent test.
3. Time Delay
We have  constructed and characterized a series of cells with different strength of  RBSes which cause the time delay phenomenon.
We optimized  the concentration of the arabinose for following fluorescent tests. And we finally  chose the 0.1 mM arabinose as the induced concentration.
We  completed the fluorescent test for the series of E.coli. We found that we are able to accomplish the aim of time  delay, suggesting that we can construct a unique display device which can let  each unit light up"
UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," There may be some impact to materials industries if the generation of genetically altered recombinant silk became commercially viable. For example, the natural silk industry may suffer if recombinant silk with altered properties became cheap.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks?
We did not utilize any design features to mitigate risks. Expressing our protein causes the chassis bacteria to be metabolically disadvantaged, and so it would likely not survive in the wild.
Standard Operating Procedures
While the biological materials that we were working with did not present any hazards, a few of our solvents and chemicals did. Lithium bromide and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) are used to solubilize natural and lyophilized silk, respectively. They were critical to our project, but due to their hazardous nature, we had to familiarize ourselves with how to safely and properly use them. We drafted the following Safe Operating Procedures for training and for reference:

Syringe Pumps
Four syringe pumps operating independently of one another are controlled by electrical outputs from the Pi to modulate inducer addition to cultures.
Additive manufacturing, or printing, allows us to rapidly manufacture components for syringe pumps at low cost while supporting a variety of materials. For prototyping, the main syringe pump housing is printed using polylactic acid (PLA) filament. As needed, this housing may also be printed from other autoclavable plastics, such as polypropylene for which filament is already commercially available.
Figure 3. Each of the four syringe pumps used consists of a stepper motor assembly, a sterile replaceable syringe, metal rails, and a printed housing fixed with bolts.
At the top of the housing, two separately printed parts fixed together by bolts allow easy syringe replacement while allowing secure fixture of the syringe flange. The housing fixes two vertical metal rails, facilitating consistent linear movement of the syringe plunger. Like the flange, the plunger is also fixed between two separate components fixed together by bolts. A threaded nut embedded between these two components allows their vertical movement when a precision threaded rod threaded in the nut and coupled to the shaft of a stepper motor is rotated by the stepper motor controlled by the Pi.
In design, considerations were made to ensure  sterility of the syringe pump. The dispensing end of the syringe intentionally protrudes as the topmost part of the syringe pump to prevent contamination of the syringe tip through contact with non-sterile components. Conveniently, this protrusion also allows visibility of the syringe shaft and thus easy monitoring of inducer levels.
Peristaltic Pumps
Peristaltic pumps are ideal for delivering fluids to cultures. By design, the pump makes no direct contact with transport fluids, and their replaceable tubing helps ensure sterility. Moreover, individual peristaltic pumps can be obtained at low prices and are compact enough to include in a variety of setups.
Figure 4. By design, peristaltic pumps are ideal for delivering fluids.
Our setup requires only two peristaltic pumps: one for fresh media delivery and another for air delivery. The air delivery pump, used for aerating the culture, utilizes a 45 micron filter for added sterility. When operated together, the two pumps maintain a controlled volume culture, described in the next section.

The relationship between residual antigen concentration and                     time
In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, the relationship between the remaining antigen                         concentration and the fixed time was made.
From this, the reaction formula \(\mathrm{α}\) can be obtained and the pattern diagram                         ω1 is given, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the concentration of the                         reaction site on the slide. Since the addition liquid fixing and treatment methods are                         unchanged, \(M_0\) does not change.
$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$
Fig.ω1 Fixed antigen pattern
If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen                         accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics                         relationship, the following relationships can be listed:
$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$
If \(θ\) is determined, that is, the proportion of the number of fixed positions of the                         slide, it is usually the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid                         crystal. Experimental data gives that \(θ\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let                         \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), the relationship can be got:
$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$
In this way, the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen and the                         reaction time can be obtained (4):
$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$
Therefore, based on this relationship, the relationship between the residual antigen                         concentration and time can be predicted, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).
(a) One Concentration
(b) The relationships of multiple concentration
Fig.2 Relationship between residual antigen concentration and time                                     when immobilized antigen
Combining the formula (2) in the content of the gray scale model, the relationship between the                         fixed time and the gray value of the relationship (5) can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 3.

In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,":  in the first, we asked scientific questions on the area of biotechnology, in the second part we asked whether the participants are in favour or against certain future applications of our technology.
During data analysis, the participants were divided into knowledgeable/unknowledgeable and Favourable/Unfavorable towards GMOs. A chi-square test was performed that showed no statistically significant correlation between background knowledge on GMOs and acceptance of biotechnology.
This result showed that our upstream engagement should focus directly on the ethical concerns around our project rather than purely educating around the science behind GMOs.  This defined our entire human practices and outreach strategy. Our findings led us to host a socio-ethics discussion on these issues.  The insight gained during the survey also fed into the creation of our science communication guide - focusing on the ethical concerns of the audience rather than solely on explaining the science behind the technology. Our art exhibition is also aimed at changing the perception around our technology rather than focusing on the science alone.
Next, we analysed how the general public perceived the use of electrical control in our project. This was important to us as electronic control of biology has negative connotations throughout science fiction -with Frankenstein's monster in Shelleys' goth novel the archetype. Data analysis showed that mentioning electronic control in discussion of potential applications had no statistically significant effect on support for our work.
The next step was to analyse whether acceptance varied between potential applications of our technology. Data analysis showed that the type of application does have a statistically significant influence on acceptance.
Art Exhibition
Following the conclusions that members of the general public are more interested in the potential of our project than its inner workings, we decided to showcase the potential of our project visually through an art exhibition. We commissioned several artists to create art pieces for us. We will be displaying some of these pieces at the Giant Jamboree and brought several of them to the New Scientist Live Fair. Images of the Art Exhibition can be seen here.
New Scientist Live!
We exhibited at the New Scientist Live! Fair in collaboration with the team at Oxford. At the event, we performed outreach for synthetic biology in general, as well as discussing our specific project with the public. This outreach event was done in collaboration with the Oxford iGEM team. Images of outreach at New Scientist Live! are included below.

THE HOW-TOS OF CONSTRUCT DESIGN
One of the main aims of genetic engineering is to get bacteria to make proteins that they cannot normally synthesise. For bacteria to be able to do this, we must take the DNA that codes for these new proteins and transfer it into bacteria, so that they can understand it and make proteins from it. One of the ways that DNA can be moved into bacteria is by using a plasmid.
A plasmid is a circular piece of DNA. The DNA that codes for the new proteins can be added into a plasmid, which can then be put into bacteria (through a process called transfection) and, providing the plasmid contains all the necessary extra features for gene expression, the bacteria will be able to make the brand new proteins. For example, human insulin is made using bacteria that have been genetically-engineered in this way. It used to be that the only way to obtain insulin was purifying it from the pancreas of cows and pigs that had been slaughtered for food. These days, we can put the gene for human insulin into a plasmid, put this plasmid into bacteria and have the bacteria make insulin for us.
The DNA sequences that you want to add to a plasmid can come from a variety of sources. In the simplest case, the sequence you are looking for is already a biobrick, such as the protein DNase. For this component of our project, we used the iGEM parts registry to loacte the DNA sequence. Many of the parts we need to use for our project are already biobricks. This includes the promoter regions, which are regions of DNA that initiate the expression of a particular gene (in effect an on/off switch), and the ribosome binding sites that facilitate the initiation of protein synthesis. If the sequence you need is not a biobrick, you can find it on online databases such as GeneBank.
In other cases, you may have the amino acid sequence of a protein you want to express, but not the DNA sequence that you need to insert into the plasmid. For us, this was the case with the protein Art175. The paper from which we sourced the sequence of Art175 only gave the amino acid sequence. We used the IDT codon optimisation to get the DNA sequence. This software gives the DNA sequence when you enter the amino acids. This programme also optimises"

Human Practice
We have organized many different forms of human practice surrounding our project’s main goal: create genetically modified (GM) probiotics. From our visitation to Yili (the largest Diary enterprise in China) and our questionnaire posted, we learned general public’s attitudes toward GM food and the necessity of promoting biotechnology to them. So we reached out in many different ways. We held a street science exhibition, established a synthetic biology club, and collaborated with school medias including Student Television Station and our school magazine, which made abstract biology concepts more relatable. The responses we got from Yili also reminded us about the issues involving antibiotic marks we used in colony selection in lab, helping us to see the future of our project: add our target genes into the chromosome. Without having an integrated human practice, we would not be able to make our project accepted by the general public nor the government.
Poll: people’s attitude on Genetically Modified (GM) food
We posted a questionnaire on social media to investigate people’s attitudes toward GM food and how they get the information about GM products.
Fig. 1 People’s attitude towards GM food
Fig. 2 Source Reliability
The results indicate only 8.2% of people acquire their knowledge of GMO from very credible sources, suggesting to us that it is necessary to further promote the concept of synthetic biology and GM products.
Yili, Diary Enterprise
We visited Yili dairy enterprise, one of the biggest diary companies in China, to learn about the openness of the government’s attitude towards GM food, especially GM probiotics. The Yili representative, however, suggests the government currently has an unfriendly policy towards GM probiotics. This response demonstrates the importance of further promoting GM probiotics.
Media
School Student Television Station
In order to introduce iGEM and GM food to more students in our school, we collaborated with Student Television Station (STS), the most influential and dependable news media of our high school. We incorporated interviews on the subject of GM food with teachers and students, the general public’s attitude toward GM food, a brief introduction of iGEM and our team by Zhongxiu Hu, and a short segment about biology experiments in the video.

In this experiment, wells 1,2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with pGL3+pF4/80 and Renilla plasmids. According to the literature, we expect to see insignificant levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase, if any This result would indicate that the F4/80 promoter is not expressed in reactive astrocytes (C8D30 cell line)1.

Outreach Activities
The divisions of our outreach events are regularly divided into seasonal timings, from Fall, Winter to Spring. This year these were the events that we had initially planned on implementing:
BioTalks Open Panel Discussion and Lecture Series Community Brick (Communications Plan Plus Example)
Purpose: Develop an exciting discussion forum between science undergraduates and industry specialists within biotechnology to encourage science entrepreneurship, innovation and industrial advice.
How: Organize a large-scale open panel discussion involving brief 20 minute talks from key industry leaders followed by a question and answer period that can supplement what has been demonstrated within the short lectures.
Type: Education/Awareness
Engineering Science Quest (ESQ) View Community Brick
Purpose: A tradition for the UW iGEM Outreach team to carry out, this workshop is held by ESQ to develop hands-on learning activities and workshops for students from Grade 3-12 to promote science/engineering education and outreach.
How: Development of a do-it-yourself workshop for Grade 12 students that incorporates science into their everyday lives. Also created a Community Brick.
Type: Education
Hot Chocolate Event Purpose: To spread the word on campus of UWaterloo iGEM, gain presence amongst students of who we are and promote our social media accounts on Twitter and FaceBook.
How: Selling hot chocolate for 50 cents along with a small paper tag of our FaceBook and Twitter page.
Type: Marketing/Promotion
Movie Night Purpose: In a social setting, show what types of content regarding biotechnology and social media are presented to the public. Demonstrate how that affects the overall perspective that they have towards the topic and how it shapes their future opinions.
How: Show a very popular movie that has recently played or a well-known classic to the students at the University.
Type: Awareness
Basic Lab Training
Community Brick
Purpose: Since we are a co-operative education school (meaning many students within our University do 5 or more 4 month internships with employers) it helps to have a kick-start on basic lab skills and techniques to add onto their resumes when they may not have that experience yet. This will help to make them more competitive when applying for positions.
How: Hold a one day training session where University students are taught basic skills used everyday in our wet lab.

The key role of Integrated Human Practices in our project
Because our project was focused on tackling a problem extremely relevant to our society, it was essential that we looked at the impact our project would have and how we could adapt our design according to the acquired information from stakeholder dialogues. Only then would our project have the desired value to be able to contribute to the issue of antibiotic resistance. Developing a detection method in the lab is one challenge, but developing a detection method that could be used in the real world is another, more complex, challenge. The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate our detection method. By meeting with experts and stakeholders, we were able to shape our design to fit everyone's wishes as best possible, and make our design relevant and responsible. The timeline of our integrated human practices process is illustrated to give an impression on how our project evolved over time due to interviews with stakeholders, and those we collaborated with.
For example, we collaborated with farmer Paul Oosthoek and did experiments on his cow’s milk samples. Additionally, we performed experiments with the isolates gained from the experts Dik Mevius and Fimme van der Wal. Also, veterinarians gave us insights in their documents to gain more knowledge about the treatment procedures. Futhermore, multiple stakeholders participated in our project How can iGEM teams best include Relevance and Responsibility in their Design?
In the last section, we summarise the most crucial insights and how stakeholders interactions lead to impressive changes in our experiments and design.

Tsinghua,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," more vulnerable to esophageal cancer?
Nearly 90% of esophageal cancer patient are found in china. There’s also a featured geographical distribution of this disease. Most cases aggregate in area along the Taihang mountain, which covers provinces like Heibei, Heinan. There’re also some villages in Xinjiang and Sichuan where esophageal cancer is frequent. Through clinical observation, many esophageal cancer patients often drink really hot water or soup, and eat stimulating food. Drinking alcohol and smoking also contribute to high risk of esophageal cancer.
What are the current therapeutic tools of esophageal cancer?
Like most cancer, treatment of esophageal cancer mainly involves 3 methods, which are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. According to the patients’ situation, doctor will take one or a combination of these 3 methods. And the curative effect also varies with different patient.
How about chances that esophageal cancer can be completely cured?
That depends. We usually divide cancer into 4 stages according to the extent of cancer cell proliferation. In Stage I, during which cancer cells haven’t transferred, the 5-year survival rate can reach 70%. When it comes to Stage II, this number dramatically drops under 50%. And for Stage III and IV, it is 20% and 10% respectively.
Can esophageal cancer be easily diagnosed in early stage?
Currently there are two major approaches to test esophageal cancer. First one is CT (computed tomography), which can show the thicken area in the esophageal wall. Another one is doing gastroscope, which allows doctor to directly see the abnormity in esophageal and take sample for further examination. Though these two approaches have high accuracy, each of them has their own drawbacks. CT may bring radiation hazard. Doing gastroscope is a rather painful process, and it’s hard and expensive to book a painless gastroscopy. These drawbacks deter people from these checks when they don’t have any symptom. However, it’s usually too late when one can feel the lesion.
According to your observation during work, which stage does most patients in when they realize the disease?
It varies with individual, but according to my observation, most patients are sent here in Stage III or IV. Because the standard test approaches, as I’ve said before, are expensive, time-consuming and painful, most people won’t do these tests unless they feel really uncomfortable.
Are there any biomarkers for esophageal cancer that are currently in clinical application?
No. There are currently many researches focus on miRNA working as potential biomarkers for"

Promoter library
Our project aims to supress toxin production in C. difficile and we chose two different strategies to pursue this aim. Briefly, these strategies involve either dead-Cas9 (dCas9) or antisense RNA (asRNA) to inhibit toxin production. Both strategies will require a careful consideration of the genetic parts involved in the device. Of particular importance is the choice of promoter employed to control expression of the dCas9, guide RNA or antisense RNA. Tailoring expression to an appropriate level is often an important design consideration in genetic engineering. In our case it was thought that the use of a strong promoter would be of greatest benefit for both strategies we pursued in order to maximise either the amount of guide RNA and dCas9 or the amount asRNA. Concentration of these components within the cell was expected to correlate with the degree of toxin suppression and since the objective was to supress toxin to the greatest extent possible, we aimed to find and characterise strong promoters within C. difficile.
The promoters we chose to characterise were as follows:
BBa_J23106 (from iGEM registry)
BBa_J23114 (from iGEM registry)
BBa_J23119 (from iGEM registry)
PCsp_fdx (from Clostridium sporogenes)
PCac_thl (from Clostridium acetobutylicum)
PCdi_TcdA (from C. difficile)
PCdi¬_TcdB (from C. difficile)
All seven promoters were intended to be assessed in both E. coli and C. difficile. PCsp_fdx and PCac_thl were chosen since they have been used extensively in studies on C. difficile as well as related organisms and both are considered to be strong promoters (Heap, 2018, Heap et al., 2009). A comparison of the two suspected strong promoters was made with the native promoters controlling toxin expression in C. difficile PCdi_TcdA and PCdi¬_TcdB. It was thought to be interesting and potentially useful to discover the strength of the toxin promoters and potentially their variance in their expression in different conditions. Three existing iGEM registry promoters were also chosen to be assessed in C. difficile. This served two functions, firstly it improved the registry in terms of part characterisation as there is currently no data on their use in Gram-positive organisms. Secondly, since these promoters have been well documented in E. coli they could give a good indication of the strength of"
Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," ‘FAS Module’, generously donated to us for use by Prof. Koffas (of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA), for overexpression of specific genes resulting in increased stearic (and palmitic) acid output. Initially our modelling team were struggling to obtain kinetic data for FabA, and as this was unfortunately not an existing BioBrick component we decided we would create the FabA BioBrick in conjunction with our other submitted BioBricks. We then hoped to be able to use the data we would gather from FabA expression to help our modelling team by providing the kinetic parameters of this enzyme. The FabA BioBrick we submitted included His tags in the N-Terminus of the protein product to help with purification of this protein. FabA was also the only gene in the ‘FAS Module’ not present in the BioBrick library, we therefore felt this should be submitted as a useful tool for future iGEM Teams.
Why did we choose to knock out FadD?
Preliminary research showed that FadD was involved in the start of the beta-oxidation pathway, which breaks down fatty acids for energy. From this, we decided to attempt to knock-out the FadD gene in E. coli, replacing it with a marker for chloramphenicol resistance. Our modelling team also explored the impact of removing enzymes that could potentially be involved in the breakdown of our products. They saw that the protein product of FadD has a negative impact on the accumulation of the longer chain fatty acids that we aim to produce, therefore supporting the experimental work.
One batch to rule them all?
Initial ideas surrounding our project led to us wanting to attempt to produce all 4 of our chosen fatty acids within the same cell. We believed that this would be advantageous for a number of reasons. Firstly, having all components produced within the same batch of bacteria would potentially reduce the running costs of the project on an industrial scale, as all vats within the setting would contain the exact same bacteria. This would also decrease the likelihood of any cross-contamination occurring. Another reason for the proposed one cell approach was that the products of the naturally-occurring mechanism for fatty acid biosynthesis (palmitic and stearic acid) could be overexpressed and then used to feed the following reactions; that of delta 9 desaturase (oleic acid) and delta 12 desaturase (linoleic acid). This would lead to all four components being dependent upon the production of the others, and we hypothesised that this pathway could be tuned"

Conclusion
The huge energetic and environmental challenges every country will have to face in the following years call for institutional and organisational innovations capable of promoting the development of relevant technological innovations. The success of the open source movement in the software industry tends to support the idea that patents are not the sole way to support knowledge spreading and technological innovations in an economic sector. Building commons can be considered, to some extent, as a fruitful alternative to the patent inflation and its pernicious effects.
The iGEM community, as a group sharing knowledge on synthetic biology, can be regarded as a case of commons. But, as Elinor Ostrom's work highlights, it is the responsibility of every commons to define its own founding principles, namely a governance framework and an appropriate distribution of “bundles of rights” associated with different roles in the organization of the commons. Even if some milestones have been set, much remains to be done in this respect.
Consequently, we propose the iGEM community to develop a genuine reflexion on this important matter in order to form a strong “synthetic biology commons” whose technological and economic success could be compared to the open source movement.
The results of the UBC team’s survey, to the analysis of which we have collaborated, confirm that most of the iGEM community members oppose the patentability of the BioBricks designed in the frame of iGEM. Promoting the intellectual as well as economic values of iGEM outcomes, without resorting to the traditional intellectual property regime, should thus interest most actors in the iGEM commons.

.: GFP fluorescence of light and dark sample after 4 hours of incubation in different blue light intensities. Control samples were measured only in darkness. Positive control value (101,5) was excluded from the picture to preserve resolution.
.: GFP fluorescence of light and dark sample after 23 hours of incubation in different blue light intensities. Control samples were measured only in darkness. Positive control value (176,9) was excluded from the picture to preserve resolution.
From both figures we can make speculation that bacteria grown in the darkness are more fluorescent compared to the light cultures. This may be because of many different reasons. One possible explanation is that the bacteria have simply accumulated GFP during the preceding overnight incubation. Therefore, all measurement points for dark cultures would be shifted to higher level of fluorescence. However, we also know that the GFP-LVA fusion half-life, around 40 minutes (Andersen et al., 1998), is rather short compared to the time period. Thus, such higher GFP concentrations should fade over time and settle close to the actual production rate. These figures suggest that long term elevation of GFP production might take place in our system. We would need further experiments to verify this.
When we observe the , we see a clear descending trend in the fluorescence towards the higher intensities of light. This suggests that the bacteria indeed alter the rate of GFP production in response to the light even in very high cell density. The brighter the light, the lower the GFP production and hence, the lower the fluorescence. The difference between bright light and darkness seems to be 1.5-2 fold. However, this effect could also be a result of the LED lights heating up the bacterial cultures and inhibiting proliferation and thus, leading to lower total GFP amount even if the per cell concentration would be constant. We also observe leaky production of GFP even in the bright light when we compare the fluorescence to the negative control strain without a GFP gene.
When compared to the 4 hour measurements, the does not have such a clear trend as in the . However, we also notice that the fluorescence values vary greatly and they are clearly lower compared to the values after 4 hours of incubation. This suggests that the response to the light stimuli is not as strong after long incubation and that the linear dependency on the light intensity seems to disappear. We must also take into account the length of the incubation and its effects on the cell culture. After such a long time in high cell density without adding fresh media will inherently lead to low welfare, low transcription and protein synthesis rate and poor response to the light stimuli"

2. Identification of glyphosate-regulated promoters
2.1. Effect of glyphosate on the Bacillus subtilis transcriptome
The identification of genes that are up- or down-regulated in a glyphosate-dependent manner requires the application of ""omics"" techniques such as proteomics or transcriptomics. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis is a valid methodology to identify genes that are either induced or repressed by chemical substances such as nutrients and herbicides.   To assess the effect of glyphosate on the B. subtilis transcriptome, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis with the help of the Göttingen Genomics Laboratory . The effect of glyphosate on the Escherichia coli transcriptome has been analyzed in the past years (59). By contrast, the effect of the weedkiller on gene expression in B. subtilis has remained elusive. To obtain bacterial cell pellets for RNA isolation and subsequent RNA-Seq analysis, we cultivated the B. subtilis wild type strain SP1 in CS-Glc minimal medium without glyphosate and supplemented with 0.75 mM glyphosate. We selected a concentration of 0.75 mM because it was previously shown that at a glyphosate concentration of about 1 mM the growth rate of the strain SP1 was reduced by 50% (see Figure 2). By choosing a lower concentration, we wanted to ensure that the bacteria were under stress without affecting growth too severe.
Figure 13. Effect of glyphosate on the B. subtilis transcriptome. (A) The diagram shows the fold change of the B. subtilis RNAs during cultivation in presence of glyphosate. The strongest regulated operon is marked with yellow circles. (B) A list of genes whose expression was severely affected by glyphosate. The four most down- and up-regulated genes (marked in (A)).
The RNA-Seq analysis allowed us to identify genes whose expression is altered in a glyphosate-dependent manner. As illustrated in Figure 13A, the expression of only a few genes was affected by glyphosate. A 5-fold increase in gene expression was the highest increase we could observe. By contrast, we observed that the expression of some genes was 11-fold reduced. Nearly all up-regulated genes are involved in sporulation and the yciA-yciB-yczL-yciC operon whose expression is affected by glyphosate is related to zinc deprivation responses (60). Unexpectedly, we could not detect any effect of glyphosate on the"

Construction of DDE equations
The ara operon is regulated by the AraC protein. If arabinose is absent, the dimer AraC protein represses the structural gene by binding to araI 1 and araO 2 and the DNA forms a loop. The loop prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter of the ara operon, thereby blocking transcription .When arabinose is present, arabinose binds AraC and prevents AraC from interacting. This breaks the DNA loop. The two AraC-arabinose complexes bind to the araI site which promotes transcription. When arabinose is present, AraC acts as an activator and promotes the translation of Cre. Then we use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells. The description of the system contains the above mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. Thus we came up a set of DDEs with 12 equations:
Parameters
The parameters are inherent factors determining the behaviors, properties of a system. Some of our parameters are derived from original ones, some of them are created to describe the new equations, and others are set for further testing.
Result
We coded the system in MATLAB. The result following shows that the concentration of Cre and the concentration of Cre-Loxp which we use all the paper to denote the Cre protein which binds to Loxp sites grow to a peak and then decline to zero. So we can expect that the inversion of the DNA which is proportional to the concentration of Cre-Loxp happens only in a period when Cre-Loxp exists.
The concentration of Cre：

Which cancer cell-lines should we use?
Which is the optimal number of cells to seed in our experiments?
How can we assess the viability of the mammalian cells?
How much of azurin-free bacterial lysate can our cells tolerate?
After defining the experimental parameters we tested the cytotoxic potential of our azurin-rich bacterial lysate against different cancer cell lines. Simultaneously, our Freiburg collaborators provided us with a killing curve of purified azurin against HEK-239 cells, enabling the comparison between the efficacy of purified azurin and azurin - rich bacterial lysate.

Co-Expression of Azurin and sfGFP by E. coli TOP10
OBJECTIVE
In this experiment we attempted to co-express azurin and sfGFP in the same operon in a controllable manner, emulating the co-expression of azurin and bacterioferitin in our final genetic circuit. The expression of sfGFP was used as an indirect readout of the operon gene expression. Additionally we tried to express a small azurin-derived peptide, namely p28, which is responsible for azurin's cytotoxic effect on cancer cells [1] .
PROCEDURE
E. coli TOP10 were transformed with two plasmids, one responsible for constitutive expression of LuxR transcription factor and one containing the azurin and sfGFP gene in the same operon under an AHL inducible promoter regulated by the activating complex of LuxR::AHL. A second transformant strain was created carrying the gene encoding for p28 instead of the complete azurin protein. Biological triplicates of the engineered bacteria were cultured in shaking flasks at small scale (5 mL), and different AHL induction conditions were applied to them once they reached in the exponential phase (OD600nm = 0.4), specifically:
Induction with 10-4M of AHL
Mock induction with DMSO
Additionally, bacteria transformed with the same plasmids lacking the Plux_azurin/gfp construct were also cultivated serving as negative control of azurin expression. The cultivation stopped 200 min after induction, a time point where gene expression seemed to have stopped according to separate characterization experiments (see here link to bfr).

Q1: Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1: Currently, we are working on it. The basic drag-drop function has been accomplished in our software of current version. In the near future, we will complete this function.
Q2: Can you export the robustness analysis along with the SBML model in one sheet?
A2: It is not easy to implement such information in a single SBML file. In current version, we can realize a robustness analysis by importing a SBML file which two sheets will be generated. In next version, we will try to incorporate such information to a general form. With such change, there is also a need to modify libSBML as a result.
Database
Q1: Does the database contain too little biobricks?
A1: Since the concept of standard components that contain enough information is relatively new in synthetic biology. The acquisition to the information is rather difficult for us because we have to learn each bricks in detail. In the current version, we construct one that is suitable for our illustrative examples as well as our USTC wet team’s new submitted biobricks. A relatively “full” database needs collaborations of different teams who should submit information of the same format.
Q2: Is the search algorithm fast enough for the database?
A2: For lager database, searching algorithm is quite important. It is also an open problem in computer science. To our extent, we seek collaborations inside or outside our campus.
Q3: How do you manage these data efficiently?
A3: To manage a large database, manage software is needed. Luckily, Berkeley tools team are focusing on this problem. We may talk some with them during the competition.
Q4: Is it too difficult to obtain the kinetic parameters and reaction type?
A4: Firstly, in the next version, we will make a web server that makes our database open access. Then users can freely update the database by submitting the data in a general form. Secondly, we can also apply a text mining technique to get detailed information for published papers.
Link to SBW
Q1: Why not incorporate SBW in this software to make it more powerful？
A1: As SBML has become a standard description format for modeling a biological system. Considering the output of our design obeys this standard, a combination with SBW tools such as cell designer should be incorporated in our software for analysis and simulation purpose. We have left a button “SBW” and have written the interface template in our software.

Entire Anderson library of constitutive promoters (J23100-J23119)
Our team achieved the 19 constructions of the Anderson library. Constructions were first designed in a software(Geneious v. 6.1.6)and then relized on web lab using iGEM 2014 Distribution kit. Verifications were made by eletrophoresis gel analytic PCR amplification and sequencing. Glycerol stock of 3 colonies per constructions were conserved and used for the measurments of GFP expression.
Unfortunatly, we did not collect satisfying data for the 19 constructions,although assays were repeated several times. The data profile was repeatable under people, apparatus and strain. Strain carrying promotorless vector seemed to had higher fluorescence intensity than strain containing constructions from the Anderson library, that explains negative curve on Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm graph. However exploitable data were collected for 5 constructions (100, 104, 105, 107 and 118) for which  the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm was linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter (See graph Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm). Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.45 of these 5 constructions were presented on bar chart above and compared with registry data on table below.
Ratio were calculated dividing constructions corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm by construction 100 corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm.
Results were similar to registry results for the 100, 105 and 107 constructions contrary to constructions 104 and 118 for which data were significantly divergent.
Possible approach to overcome data acquisition problems:
Using M9 medium instead of LB medium to minimize the basal medium fluorescence
Using another E. coli strain that has a smaller natural fluorescence
Changing of dilution and gain to find the optimal one
Choosing a TECAN with a lower detection limits to collect data for weak promoters

Summary and Conclusion
We were able to rationally design, produce, prototype, and extensively characterize our vision for a mycelial water filtration and biomining system that is fueled by synthetic biology and protein engineering. We created tangible filter strips to demonstrate how our methodology could feasibly be applied in actuality, going beyond just a proof-of-concept phase. These prototypes were able to bind >92% of copper in solution (at >300 μM Cu concentration) within 30 minutes. They are relatively inexpensive, completely biodegradable with ease of metal extraction, and require low, less complex upmass in comparison to bacterial or cellulose-based filters (which require complex sugars for sustenance). A patent disclosure was submitted to NASA on 10/16/18. Our results demonstrate the utility of our end-to-end filtration system in solving water and biomining-related challenges both on earth and in space.

Given the empirically established rate, it will take ~92 hours (4 days) to achieve 20% oxygen, mimicking Earth's atmosphere.

Approach
Engineering E. coli to Perform the Calvin Cycle
In order to engineer E. coli in the outer chamber to turn atmospheric CO2 into cellulose, the carbon first needs to be fixated by the bacteria. This requires the heterologous expression of the genes encoding the three enzymes RuBisCo, SBPase, and PRK. In correspondence with the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team , who worked with a similar subpart of their project, we discussed the cloning of these genes and received two crucial parts. The first of this was BBa_K1465214 , containing RubisCO from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and PRK from Synechococcus elongatus under the control of a composite promoter controllable by IPTG. The second was BBa_K1465228 , which contained SBPase from Bacillus methanolicus. Through the concurrent expression of these parts in E. coli, all enzymes required to fixate CO2 through the Calvin cycle were present in the cells.
The first approach was to assemble both parts on one plasmid by molecular cloning, as shown on Figure 1. In doing this, it was discovered that the BBa_K1465214 part was missing roughly 1 kbp when digested with standard restriction enzymes with recognition sites within the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Sequencing of the part revealed that the part was missing the entire promoter sequence of 1239 bp. Consequently, the assembly of the parts additionally required the cloning of a promoter. For this purpose, the Tac-promoter (Ptac) from the part BBa_K864400 was chosen, as this is commonly used to overexpress genes in E. coli. With the objective to place the two Calvin cycle parts on different vectors, it was attempted to clone Ptac in front of both parts. However, this did not succeed and it was decided to prioritise other aspects of the project and therefore keep this part theoretical henceforth.
Implementing the Carboxysome in E. coli to Increase Carbon Fixation Efficiency
The implementation of the microcompartment carboxysome in the test organism can increase the efficiency of the carbon fixation process substantially. As for the Calvin cycle parts, we corresponded with the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team on their experience of the implementation of the carboxysome, and received the two parts that together contained the cso operon from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. These parts were BBa_K1465204 , containing csoS2, and"

Fig.4 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance device led by NhaA.  NhaA will be induced at pH 7.0 ~ 8.2, while NhaB will function when NhaA cannot function normally. Here we assumed that initial pH was 8.0 and NhaA had already been activated.
○ Regulation Model
As for regulation subsystem model, pH-responsive promoters are combined with functional genes.      The acid regulation device consists of acid-responsive promoter P-asr and alkali-synthesis gene gadA (Fig.5). gadA catalyzes the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and GABA can be excreted outside and neutralize the micro-environment.
The alkali regulation device is made up of alkali-responsive promoter P-atp2 and functional gene ldhA (Fig.6). ldhA encodes a lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactate. Lactate will be secreted outside the cell and neutralize the OH-.
We assumed that the H+ or OH- was straightly contacted with the promoters and induced the transcription process. For functional genes, their translation, degradation and catalysis processes are mainly analyzed in this model because the products of these two genes are both enzymes.
The final simulation results are shown below (Fig.7). In acidic condition, the regulation subsystem will produce GABA and reduce the extracellular pH. When environmental pH becomes alkaline, regulation subsystem will make lactate to neutralize the outside pH. Eventually the environmental pH will be constrained between the pH range where two promoters are both repressed (but with fluctuation).
Fig.7 Extracellular pH regulated by basic regulation subsystem. In normal fermentation environment, pH will tend to decrease and enter acidic level. Basing on this phenomenon, we assumed that the initial pH was 4.0, and our device was functioning.
Fine-regulation circuits models
Overview of Fine-regulation Circuits Model
Three fine regulation circuits are designed so that we can apply different regulation circuits according to different fermentation situations. The external environment can be sensed by the pH-responsive promoters. We ligated different kinds of recombinase down pH-responsive promoters. The recombinase can invert downstream constitutive promoter. This function is applied for conversion between acid and alk"

After the immobilization, the beads show a high fluorescence indicating the binding of the SbpA | mCitrine fusion protein.
Optimal bead to protein ratio for immobilization
To determine the optimal ratio of silica beads to protein for immobilization, the degree of clearance ϕC in the supernatant is calculated and plotted against the concentration of silica beads used in the accordant immobilization experiment (compare Fig. 8):
(1)
The data was collected in three independent experiments. The fluorescence of the samples was measured in the supernatant of the immobilization experiment after centrifuging the silica beads. The fluorescence of the control was measured in a sample which was treated exactly like the others but no silica beads were added. 100 µg protein were used for one immobilization experiment. The data was fitted with a sigmoidal dose-response function of the form
(2)
with the Hill coefficient p, the bottom asymptote A1, the top asymptote A2 and the switch point log(x0) (R² = 0.997).
The fit indicates that a good silica concentration for 100 µg of protein is 200 - 250 mg mL-1. This set-up leads to saturated beads with low waste of protein. So a good protein / bead ratio to work with is 7 - 9 * 10-4.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," viral particles packing viral genomes which could be produce by recombination of the different plasmids or with genes already present in the genome host.
Self-inactivating (SIN) Lentivirus is the name of the approach use for the Transfer plasmid which gives more security and a better transfection. The 5’ LTR is partially deleted and fused to a heterologous promoter such as CMV or RSV. SIN plasmids also harbour a large deletion in the U3 region of the 3’LTR which results in the virus being unable to reconstitute its promoter. The deletion is duplicated into the 5’LTR during the reverse transcription process, leaving the 5’LTR incapable of promoting transcription process, leaving the 5’LTR incapable of promoting transcription of full-length viral genomic RNA-making the virus replicant incompetent.
This therapy will use an inhaler to introduce SOD enzyme in the organism since SOD enzyme cannot be administrated efficiently as an oral supplement or intravenously due to reported problems with immune response, proteases, etc. Besides, an advantage of this approach is the application of the therapy directly in the lung cells which are very exposed to oxidizing agents.

This year, we decided early on to try and reach out to other iGEM teams who we might be able to help, or could help us. Of particular interest to us was a BioBrick and iGEM-internal system for non-canonical amino acid incorporation, because even until now our pEVOL AzoPhe incorporation plasmid remains something of a black box to us.
We ended up reaching out to and collaborating with Bielefeld-CiBiTec, whose project focused on the development of new non-canonical base pairs to try and expand the genetic code. While we were not ultimately able to test out their new system, we did provide them with some of our ncAA (AzoPhe) and the incorporation plasmid so that they could test it against their own system for ncAA incorporation. We also sent them a number of plasmids from our own project, which they graciously validated in their own lab as working as intended, and also provided us with some beautiful imaging data you can see below.

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," increasingly alarming problems posed by oil extraction tailings ponds in our province.
“You would really have to have a purpose for doing it [implementing our system in the wastewater treatment process]… whereas with tailings ponds, they need to be dealt with.” --Dorothy Lok
With her advice, we delved deeper into the impacts and characteristics of these ponds, and our findings convinced us that we had finally found our emphasis!
OUR PROJECT
Our project, “Cu Later”, aims at using a system of biological components to sequester and remove metal ions from oil and mining tailings ponds. These ponds contain high amounts of toxic metals (such as copper, nickel and lead) that create significant environmental concerns. When mixed with other chemicals, these metals can form acidic compounds that lower the pH of surrounding waters. They can also pose direct threats to aquatic organisms, causing irreversible damages to their nervous, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. In one instance, the continuous discharge of 450 kilograms of copper every day into the Britannia Creek (near a former copper mine in British Columbia) exterminated every aquatic species in the creek. In another instance, over 1,600 ducks died in a Syncrude Canada tailings pond in Northern Alberta when they mistook the pond for a freshwater lake.   Upon speaking with a representative from Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), we learned that although there have been regulations in place to limit the production of tailings on the part of energy companies, there is currently no efficient method to treat or extract metals from tailings ponds. Traditional water purification methods, such as distillation, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are theoretically possible but practically inefficient and extremely expensive. Additionally, we learned that the amount of tailings in Alberta has increased drastically over the past decades, from just below 10 gigalitres in 1970 to over 1,400 gigalitres in 2018.
Today, the amount of tailings in Alberta alone is enough to fill 560,000 Olympic-sized pools. With an average depth of five meters, these tailings cover a land area of 280 square kilometers, over one-third the size of the city of Calgary. These statistics are predicted to continue growing in the future, as millions of cubic meters of new tailings are produced every day.
“The big problem in oil sands tailings is the sheer volume, the magnitude of production you’re talking about, it’s millions of cubic meters per day.” --AER Representative
Although the accumulation of toxic tailings is a prevalent challenge in our oil-dependent provincial economy, the environmental concerns they present is"

Who are we?
Istanbul Technical University iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition) Team is a volunteer competition group formed by mostly second and third year Molecular Biology and Genetics students in Istanbul Technical University. Our goal is to represent our university and country in a best way by attending to most prestigious “synthetic biology” competition called iGEM. This attempt will not be limited with only attending this year; it will be a start for showing our ambition and passion to be able to attend to next competitions. Synthetic Biology is a sub-branch of biology that aims to modify available organisms or create new complex biological structures for the benefit of humanity and approaches to biology with an engineering perspective; it is a branch of science that use the techniques from molecular biology and genetics. By this way, iGEM helps both students to be informed about this area and to contribute to science by prepared projects. This students-based competition has a long and devoted process that includes helps and probations of advisors who are instructors in the institute. In our university, Molecular Biology and Genetics department has three student laboratories and also there is a Molecular Biology-Biotechnology & Genetics Research Center (MOBGAM) founded by contributions of Dr. Orhan Öcalgiray and state. There are quite good equipped laboratories belonging to department instructors; likewise, various researches are carried out in different branches in this research center. By adapting molecular biology and genetics techniques into functional engineering area, biotechnological and nanobiotechnological researches are carried out in this center. This research center founded in 2004 provides unique opportunity for researching on both interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary areas by also effort of researchers in the center. As a candidate for future scientists, we would like to take first step to on this competition way by using these quite equipped laboratories and other opportunities provided by university. We would like to complete our deficiencies by your support and represent our university and country in a best way in this competition.
What is IGEM?
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is the competition that has been organized in MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) by IGEM foundation since 2004 and welcomed predominantly undergraduate students.

Protocols
Making Luria Broth Plates
This is the protocol for making LB gels. The measurements given can make approximately 24 plates. If fewer plates are wanted, the measurements can be halved to make approximately 10-12 gels.
Materials
Large bottle with a screw-on lid
Stir bar & Stir plate
DI H2O
Tryptone
Yeast Extract
Agarose
NaCl
pH meter, neutral (pH 7) standard
2M NaOH
Dropper/ Pipette
Antibiotic (Ampicillin/ Cloramphenicol)
Sterile plates
Procedure
Fill a large bottle with lid with 570 mL of DI H2O. Insert a stir bar and place the bottle on the stir plate. Mix in 6 g Tryptone, 3 g yeast extract, 9 g agar, and 6 g NaCl. Ensure the solution has been mixed thoroughly and standardize the pH meter with the neutral standard solution. Add 2M NaOH to the solution dropwise until the pH reaches 7.
Check the water level in the autoclave and put autoclave tape on the bottle. Ensure the lid is on but not tightened. Put the bottle in the autoclave and tighten the door. Set it for the liquid cycle and wait until the cycle is over and the pressure reaches 0 to open the door.
Put the bottle back on the stir plate and turn it to a low setting to prevent bubbles forming. Let the mixture cool until you can touch the bottle for several seconds comfortably. Add 600 µL of the chosen antibiotic (at 50 mg/mL) to the bottle. Label all plates before you begin to pour. Wearing a glove, use the aseptic technique to pour the media into the plates and leave them to solidify.
To make liquid media stock, the same procedure can be followed without adding agar or antibiotic and then storing in a 4°C fridge.

We have worked towards developing a method to measure promoter activity in PoPS. Achieving this goal will enable researchers to better characterise promoters, by measuring the activity in different strains and at different growth conditions.
Advancing Synthetic Biology
The importance of developing new measurement methods has been acknowledged by iGEM with the addition of the Measurement Track this year. We seek to advance synthetic biology by developing a solution by which absolute promoter activities can be reliably measured and it is our vision that this method can be standardised and added to the growing toolbox of synthetic biology. This will enable more effective and precise design of new bio-molecular systems resulting in more reliable and controllable  constructs.
Implementation of biological constructs developed by synthetic biology in a public context is in most countries subject to both national and international regulations. Concerns about possible severe consequences for the environment or human health as well as about the ethics of the field have given rise to public discussion for years. We acknowledge that the ethical issues regarding synthetic biology is important to consider. Therefore we have made a thorough analysis of some of the ethical aspects of synthetic biology based on our project. The analysis discusses several important issues to bear in mind and consider when deciding whether a project should be realised. Arguments have been evaluated using the ethical theory of utilitarianism to enable quantification of the arguments.
However, being able to participate in the discussion about the implementation of the constructed systems requires information about the possibilities and power of synthetic biology. We have dedicated a large part of our time to informing Danish high school students about synthetic biology, so that these students hopefully will be able to participate in discussions about synthetic biology in a qualified manner.

Once having established E. coli as our ""tracking dog"", the possible applications in medicine but also to environmental issues are virtually countless.
#1 - Selection / Swimming
Fine tuning of the experimental setup
During the course of the experimental work it has been the task of group one to design and test the parameters for the optimal swimming and chemotaxis assays. Eventually, it was the goal to be able to select for fast E.coli cells that show a chemotactic behavior. Firstly, swimming is only possible in media with a low concentration of agar. After testing agar concentrations in a range between 0.2% - 1%, it turned out that 0.3% is the best concentration for fast E. coli cells. Lower concentrations were not appropriate due to a lack of solidity of the swimming-agar. Secondly, different nutrient compositions were tested. On the one hand, it was necessary to identify a convenient nutrient composition to trigger bacterial swimming. On the other hand, the nutrients in the media should enable E. coli cells to follow a chemoattractant.
Fig. 1:Chemotaxis and swimming of different E. coli-strains on tryptone- and M9 agar. Chemotaxis strain MG1655 (left), laboratory strain BL21 (top), laboratory strain DH10B (right) and laboratory strain XL1 blue (bottom) were tested for swimming and chemotaxis properties on two different media. (A) MG1655 and BL21 both showed extensive swimming on 0.3% tryptone swimming agar after incubation at 33°C for one day. In contrast, the laboratory strains DH10B and XL1 blue did not swim at all.  Swimming towards the attractant L-aspartate in the central Whatman paper was not observed. (B) On 0.3% M9 minimal agar the E. coli strains MG1655 and BL21 displayed swimming, but had to be incubated at 33°C for 2 days. Strikingly, chemotaxis was clearly observed for both strains, MG1655 and BL21, towards the attractant L-aspartate.
Here, we focused on two different media: Tryptone-swimming agar for the induction of E. coli swimming after one day of incubation and M9-minimal agar for the observation of chemotaxis (Burkart et al. 1998; Farrel et al. 2005).  M9-minimal agar did"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," we were both working with the same operon, we decided that Calgary would take DszA and DszB while we would take DszC and DszD. We also set up meetings to see what else we could do in collaboration. We initially wanted to see if we could do anything regarding modeling together, given that we were working with similar systems. However, Calgary was more interested in bioremediation, rather than fuel processing. We then struck on the idea of collaborating on kill switches. Calgary wanted to characterize a few new induction systems, including a rhamnose promoter and two new riboswitches for their kill switches. They have yet to have success with their rhamnose promoter. They sent us the sequence before they attempted anything with it, and we used that sequence to design primers to get the rhamnose promoter out of the genome. Noticing the paucity of standardization of kill switches on the registry, we took it upon ourselves to develop a plan to test the efficacy of any new toxic protein that might be wanted to be tested for kill switch capabilities. There was a fair amount of talk about how best to do a death assay. We suggested using Dendra2, a fluorescent protein that could be 'broken' at a specific non-cytotoxic wavelength of light, allowing us to quantify metabolic activity after supposed death after toxic protein induction by looking for further expression of the fluorescent protein. They argued that a dormant cell may not express this protein, and we wouldn't really be looking at death. We then decided that we ought to instead focus on plating assays, for this better tests the viability of cells. We both tried testing existing kill switches on the registry, but were unable to get any of them to work. Calgary postulated that this was due to the arabinose promoter, which they could never get it to work. In the mean time, we both sequenced some of the toxic genes used as kill switches in the registry, and found that everything we sequenced was indeed what it claimed to be. Calgary also sent us the gene for HPAC, an alternative NADH-FMN oxidoreductase, to be used in place of DszD. It is a native E coli enzyme, and apparently works better, though over-expression causes hydrogen peroxide formation. We had plans to see if we could get it expressed in a pET vector to look for peroxide generation, but we have not done this yet. Lastly, they sent us the yddg- strain from David's old lab at U of A, which could be used in complement"

It was also suggested for our team to focus on the successful production of just one pigment instead of all four, as this is an example of minimum viable product. This means that the minimum is achieved to push customers to purchase our product. As well, the showcasing of our product would be simple. For example, as a pen, or even a finger dipped into the ink. The only purpose is to show that successfulness of our product.
Overall, the interview with Dr. Vilk, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Aiken was successful. Most members of our team do not have a business background, and this discussion opened our eyes into the business realm.

UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"And we got several hits! Our next task was to test for expression from our colony PCR hits. To do so, we first grew up our cells with TolA inserted into the Duet vector, and induced at OD 0.4 with 0.5mM IPTG. After two hours, we extracted both soluble and membrane protein fractions. The next day we ran two SDS-PAGEs with these samples, plus some samples received on USYD as part of our collaboration. One SDS-PAGE was stained with Coomasie, while the other was run through a Western Blot assaying for the His-tag. Both of USYD's proteins were found to be expressing, while none of ours were. We then realised that we used the cloning strain for our expression test, which lacks the ability to be induced by IPTG...
We thus miniprepped the plasmids out of these, and transformed them into the expression strain the next day. Rather than test for expression via SDS-PAGEs, we began to look for GFP expression under UV lamps, but couldn't see anything
We also began the arduous task of harvesting OMVs from our KO strains. To do so, we set up 500mL cultures of delta-tolA, delta-degP, and a negative control. After a night of growth, we spun down briefly to pellet the cells, and ran the supernatant through a 0.22 micron filter. This clarified supernatant was then spun through a 3kDA filter, at 3400g for 20 minutes, 20mL at a time. As you can imagine, this took an age, and was spaced over several days.

As this week rolled in, we finished colony PCRs for all our remaining transformants with Gibson plasmids (and there were well over 100). Disappointingly, we received no hits for anything cloned into Duet's second multiple cloning site. As such, we redid the Gibson ligation reaction for these plus (g3p, and periplasm-localised RFP), this time doing an overnight DpnI digest to lower the background, and balancing the stoichiometries as best we could. We then transformed our expression strain with these.
The following day we began screening these via colony PCR. In what might be the first stroke of luck, our first gel screening 10 g3p-in-Duet colonies got 10 hits! We miniprepped two of these, performed a"

Bio-security (Consequences of synthetic biology, e.g. bio-terrorism)
Intellectual property rights (conflict of interest, fair distribution of benefits and who owns what?)
Transparency (open source, availability)
Communication (towards public and media)
Naturalness (or artificialness)
Attitude (towards life)
Reductionism (consequences and implications when reducing biological systems)
Since the introduction of synthetic biology, ethical issues have been addressed and different opinions, frameworks and solutions have been proposed. To get an overview of opinions and responsibilities relevant to different topics, we propose a framework that describes the main ethical considerations from a personal perspective, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Framework describing ethical considerations from personal perspective, to project personal views and external responsibilities.
The personal view describes features on how we perceive synthetic biology, what is our attitude towards life, and why do we participate in such research. The believes, perceptions and reasons for people to understand and work in the field of biology will vary between individuals. When involved in synthetic biology research, it is worthy to study these different subjects, both to improve evaluation of the research and to self-reflect on a scientific and personal level. Moreover, when working together in a team it is important to know  that team members can have different opinions. A healthy discussion can help the research because you can respect each others differences and learn of other viewpoints. Furthermore, it shows peoples personal qualities.
Externally, researchers are responsible on a social level for communication and security of the public. On a scientific level they should concern the safety of themselves and co-workers. In synthetic biology specifically they have to think about the consequences of making biological components freely available, how to deal with intellectual property rights and to what extend the research should be transparent to the community.

Responsibility
The proposed framework can function as a guideline for what is important and what are our responsibilities when working on synthetic biology. Although most of the topics are addressed in literature, policymakers are lagging behind in making regulations concerning these topics. Specifically a lot of questions are raised concerning bio-safety and bio-security. For example, what are the possibilities or chances of bio terrorist using synthetic biology for harmful purposes or what are the consequences of do-it-yourself synthetic biology, when people can engineer organisms in their own backyard. Regulations and policies should clarify these uncertainties. But"

Utah_State,2013,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in health settings in modern society. The use of antibiotics to treat bacterial diseases has led to the emergence of “superbugs”, drug resistant bacteria that infect humans. These superbugs are often untreatable with current antibiotics and are the cause of an increasing number of deaths each year. However, it appears as if resistance is harder to come by for bacteria against AMPs. This is likely due to the mechanism of most AMPs acting on bacterial cell membranes instead of its cell walls (Peters et al., 2010). AMP resistance would require a complete re-design of the bacterial membrane to prevent action of the AMP. While still possible, the likelihood of resistance being developed is much smaller, making AMPs a potential source of much more effective bacterial killers (Zasloff, 2002) (Epand et al., 1999).
An extremely important trait of an antimicrobial agent is that it has selective mechanisms against harmful bacteria. For use in the human healthcare system, AMPs must not target mammalian cells or demonstrate hemolytic activity. Due to the mechanism of most AMPs acting on bacterial membranes, it has been proposed that AMPs could work in tandem with current antimicrobials. By letting AMPs degrade the microbe’s membrane, an antimicrobial could easily gain access to the inside of the cell, making it much more effective (Peters et al., 2010). In vitro, it has been observed that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of AMPs against bacteria are much higher than it appears to be in vivo. It is thought that AMPs work in conjunction with other AMPs to act as more effective inhibitors of bacteria. LL37, a model peptide used in our study, has been shown to work in tandem with other peptides as well as lysozyme to increase toxicity to bacteria (Lai & Gallo, 2009).  It has even been observed that AMPs may possess the potential to increase overall immune response, neutralize endotoxins, and aid in wound healing (Peters et al., 2010). The Figure below outlines many of the processes that AMPs accomplish in vivo.
                  Functions of AMPs in vivo ( modified from Lai & Gallo, 2009)

Since there is such a wide diversity of AMPs in nature, we decided to select our peptides from eight different species. The map below shows all of the organisms that we decided to draw from.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," thuringiensis) (Losey et al, 1999) (Flachowsky et al, 2005) has no doubt also played a role in any potential mistrust of synthetic biology.
Some of those specific areas of concern regarding synthetic biology are;
Bioterrorism
A popular concept is the fear of “Bioterrorism” that has stoked much concern, for example, a short white paper released by the U.S. C.I.A. in November, 2003 concluded ‘Growing understanding of the complex biochemical pathways that underlie life processes has the potential to enable a class of new, more virulent biological agents engineered to attack distinct biochemical pathways and elicit specific effects’ (Tucker, 2006).  The report also mentioned that some ‘engineered biological agents could be worse than any disease known to man’ (Balmer, 2008).  The report went on to recommend a closer working relationship between intelligence services and the biological sciences community.
Although the more in depth look at the threat of bioterrorism by Tucker and Zilinskas stated ‘At present, the primary threat of misuse appears to come from state-level biological warfare programs’ (Tucker, 2006), they went on to outline the two most likely forms of misuse as coming from a ‘lone operator’, compared to Theodore Kaczynski.  They outline the lone operator as one of ‘a few individuals with access to laboratory equipment and supplies who are highly intelligent and well-trained but also deeply disgruntled, have sociopathic tendencies, or wish to prove something to the world’.  Though the potential is limited at the moment, in part because of the new nature of the field but also that biological weapons are not that easy to manufacture and distribute.  Not only has the infectious agent to be created but ‘a complex system consisting of (1) a supply of pathogen, either powdered in the form of a wet slurry or dried and milled into a dry powder; (2) a complex “formulation of chemical additives that is mixed with the agent to stabilize it and  preserve its infectivity and virulence during storage; (3) a container to store and transport the formulated agent; and (4) an efficient dispersal mechanism to disseminate the formulated agent as a fine-particle aerosol that can infect the targeted personnel through the lungs.  Finally the aerosol cloud must be released under optimal atmospheric and meteorological conditions if it is to inflict casualties over a large are’ (Tucker, 2006).  These factors would prove difficult for even the"

In the beaker, 300 g of inoculum and 100 g of deionized water are weighted for each bioreactor. 12 reactors are prepared simultaneously. Then, pH of the solution in each bioreactor is set on 5.7 with 2 molar hydrogen chloride. When setting the appropriate pH, the solution is mixed with the mixer in order to give a homogenous solution. 400g"

It took some time reformatting my input files to only include these carbon­containing metabolites, and I encountered several programming issues along the way. For example, I originally only updated the input file that regulates my substrates, and this resulted in flux outputs that were significantly larger than expected. I’m still in the process of readjusting the parameters in the code to account for the addition of these exchange reactions.

Carbon Overview
J_exp19
Last week, I started looking at the effects of adding supplemental metabolites to the WM1788 N2 fixing model. After creating a set of exchange reactions, and regulating the amount of substrate being imported by each reaction, I was able to generate max biomass, max ATP, and max flavodoxin outputs. We normalized our data by the number of carbons in each supplemented metabolite. This allowed the code to constrain our substrate by the number of additional carbon atoms supplied to the model. In my 7/10 journal, I mentioned that we used glucose as a template for regulating our substrate. I failed to mention why we used only 50%. I want to point out that we felt it was a good level to supplement growth. I was having some coding errors last Friday, and I realized that it was a formatting issue in one of my input files. I was still working through some technical issues by the end of the day. I also started working with Laura on our slides for the Monsanto powerpoint. Her and I wrote up a brief overview of FBA and FVA (refer to term sheet if unfamiliar with abbreviations), our general findings thus far, and current projects we are working on.

In our meeting with iGem, Laura and I gave a brief summary on each of our projects, specifically what we’re doing and what our objectives are. After the meeting, we updated our Monsanto slides from Tom’s recommendations (mostly visual layout edits). I continued editing my GAMS code from the updates I made in my input files (only include carbon-containing metabolites).

After double checking my GAMS parameters, variables, and input files, I was finally able to run my code and generate flux outputs.

darwin
Program Description
Version control systems sych as git and svn focus on differences between lines. Since most DNA file formats split DNA to fixed-length lines, many lines are changed at once, for example, when inserting a single new line. darwin does away with that by producing a formatted file representing each ORF on its own line of text, making each edit only modify a single line of the output text.
Genes can be very long. To combat this, darwin will sample a section of every newly inserted ORF and compare it to nearby ORFs; if the new ORF is similar to another ORF, it is counted as “edited,” and darwin only records the character-by-character changes required to transform the old ORF into the new ORF.
Finally, darwin uses concurrency to help speed up the process. File I/O is typically extremely slow, much slower than processing a file data already in memory. Splitting the processing concurrently helps to open up that speed bottleneck.

Thrombin aptamers 1 and 2 can detect α-Human Thrombin in a sandwich        assay in buffer
Thrombin aptamers 1 and 3 can detect α-Human Thrombin in a sandwich        assay in buffer
Thrombin can be detected in Human serum using both thrombin aptamers        1 and 3
PDGF aptamers 1 and 2 can detect PDGF in a sandwich assay in buffer
Thrombin aptamer binding test
We tested the affinity of our Thrombin aptamer 1 (Cy5) and our Thrombin     aptamer 2 (Cy3) with biotinylated human thrombin. This experiment was done     on a MITOMI 768 chip flowing biotinylated human thrombin and then the two     aptamers in different parts of the chip in order to see whether they bind     with thrombin. The affinity is measured by the relative fluorescence in the     different channels (Cy3 and Cy5). As a negative control, both Cy3 and Cy5 labeled DNA oligos with a random sequence were flown instead of the aptamer in half of the chip to make sure thrombin does not have non-specific binding.
A fluorescent scan of the microfluidic chip after wash resulted in a      fluorescent signal in both Cy5 and Cy3 channels (Fig. 1a and 1b) in the      button area for the aptamers and no signal for the control"

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," disadvantages of E.coli as host are the necessary knock-out of the ClpX gene for the control and the risk of interference of host-proteins with the synthetic system. This would have been an advantage for the use of B. subtilis but here the impact of a synthetic protease system is far less characterized than in E.coli.
Thus, the final choice of the host organism was E.coli as this organism is best characterized for the work in molecular genetics and also tested for synthetic engineering of ClpX andthe presence of the ClpP-subunit that assembles auto-catalitically with ClpX.
The Linker
The linker has been designed for the use in different construction to avoid steric hindrance. The sequence is composed of the twenty amino-acids ASGAGGSEGGGSEGGTSGAT.
Final construction
 
 
 
Even if we had a clear idea of our system, we needed more information about the constructional design. During our investigations, we found an extremely helpful article for this issue: ""Engineering synthetic adaptors and substrates for controlled ClpXP degradation"" from Tania Baker and collegues (2009).
 
 
In this work Baker et al. probed minimal biochemical functions necessary for efficient degradation by designing and characterizing variant substrates, adaptors and ClpX-enzymes. They implemented a rapamycin-dependent tethering system and demonstrated that artificial tethering can support substrate delivery.Therefore they constructed a ClpX variant lacking the N-domain that contained the human FKBP12 protein. The FKBP12 was fused to the N terminus of a trimeric form of ClpX-N in which the subunits were connected with a flexible linker to stabilize the enzyme. The reason for this particular design is that N-domain dimerization is needed to stabilize the active hexameric form of ClpX [14] so that replacing this domain would probably result in weaker hexamerization. Upon these findings we decided to construct the PhyB-ClpX fusion protein in the same manner.
For the adaptor-mediated delivery they fused an altered SspB variant to the FRB domain from rat m. In the presence of the small molecule rapamycin the FKBP12 protein and the FRB domain bind to each other with high affinity, consequently the adaptor-mediated delivery of their system depends on rapamycin-induction. The experiments resulted in efficient adaptor-dependent degradation.
In our system the adaptor-role is assumed by PIF, which will bind to PhyB following light-induction. Target proteins are fused to PIF and tagged"
IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html," we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the increase in Heme production and hence the activity of the Heme proteins.  We did manage to extensively characterize the NrfA cloned gene, which served as the nitrate reductase. We found out that even without using any extracellular or intracellular Heme over production, our clones were highly efficient in reducing the nitrite and subsequently converting it into ammonia. Finally, we came to the conclusion that while expressing NrfA in a constitutive fashion, there was increased conversion of NOx to ammonia.
In the mechanical half of the project, we designed a prototype which in effect served as the perfect “Pollution Crusader”.  We tested the model against the exhaust emitted by a diesel engine. Although the efficiency wasn’t that high, it did show positive results. We observed considerable reduction in the amount of NOx and SOx reduced. In a nutshell, our prototype model is capable of removing the harmful soot particles, gases like NOx and SOx and also the particulate matter present in the exhaust gases of the various engines being used. The prototype model designed will not only serve as an alternative for the existing technology, but has the potential to bring revolutionary changes in the upcoming days."

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Engagement.html_-_-_TEXT.html," In the international finals, this year in the United Kingdom, 4 students per country compete in this science olympiad. They are tested on their abilities to tackle biological problems and doing biological experiments. The aim is to promote science to talented young students and to stress the importance of biology in society. In the national finals at the 9th of June in Wageningen, twenty top-students of the Netherlands gathered for a week of science. We contributed to the NBO by educating the students in the field of DNA techniques and synthetic biology. A summary video of the whole NBO can be found here .
Before the lecture, they knew about Golden Rice and insulin production by microorganisms as the only examples in biotechnology. During the practicals on plant genetics, we gave a one-and-half hour lecture about current DNA techiniques and synthetic biology, followed by an exam of 10 closed and 2 open questions. This covered the basics of gene expression and plasmid assembly, as well as more complicated assembly methods and modification techniques. We introduced them into the field of synthetic biology, a subject that was new for most students. They learned about it, and had the opportunity to think about the rational and ethical issues. In this way, we involved these students into synthetic biology and our iGEM project, and we got input from the students into these fields.
The main findings can be found below. To summarize: after the lecture, the students saw the potential in synthetic biology to combat infectious diseases. However, it also raises some safety, ethical and biocontainment-related concerns. Following these findings, we worked on these issues. The outcome of this can be read on the
Biosafety
page.

Full findings NBO
The greatest advantage of Synthetic Biology they discussed can be summarised into three main categories:
The opportunity to improve food production. E.g. increasing yield by resistance introduction, drought resistant crops, and more sustainable production.
Production and development of medicines. Both development of novel, better and cheaper medicines were mentioned, as well as better diagnostics.
General, non-specific improvements in current and new industrial processes; faster, easier, more efficient, and economically favourable.
Reduced impact on climate, by using synthetic biology for protection of the environment, protect threatened animal species, and improvement of sustainability.
However, there were also some concerns. They thought about their own concerns, as well as how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. The concern regarding Synthetic Biology can be summarized into three categories:
