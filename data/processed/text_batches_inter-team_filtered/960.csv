Position Scan Profiling
Similar to the position scanning of monomeric GRFT, the residues of dimeric GRFT were checked to see if their ΔΔG were negative and could contribute to a more stable protein. Unlike Monomeric GRFT, we needed to take greater account of electrostatic interactions and disulfide bridges connecting the two GRFT subunits. Trends: Aspartate and Serine in loops were very unstable and the protein's stability was significantly increased after these residues were changed to asparagine and phenylalanine respectively.This suggests the protein's stability could be greatly improved with the addition of hydrophobic residues and removal of negatively charged residues.
Mutate Multiple Residues
Similar to the previous construct, the data used from position scan and B factor calculations were used to run trials on the thermostability of the dimeric GRFT. However, in these trials, we had to make the same changes on both subunits to retain the homodimeric nature of the protein, match the binding topology between subunits,  and reduce confounding variables when analyzing the thermostability and biological activity of the protein.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,". It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

Email: jkdirac@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I am Kun Jiang, the cheif software developer in iGem 2010 USTC_Software team, responsible for designing the global architecture of our software and  developing the ODE Solver module, Berkley database interface module and several simple tools for teammates.
It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions, it is a important project but not the last project of my engineering life, I wish I would develop more and more softwares in future. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact me please!

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2016,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Human Practices#Medical Service_-_-_TEXT.html," even become a serious problem to prevent the number of them from declining. Most of these hospitals in cities own the same features: small-scaled rooms, lack of funds, poor sanitation conditions and fewer doctors of high academic levels [1].
Even though hospitals at grass-roots level have many problems, we must admit that these hospitals are the major ones in China and many areas can only relies on them. Actually, many villages only have the ability to establish grass-rooted hospitals, and there are still 10.6% of all don’t even have countryside doctors. [3].
Current Situation of hospitals at Grass-root Level in Chongqing
To give a vivid look at these grass-rooted ones, we focused on one city, Chongqing, which is one of the four municipality directly under the Central Government. (The other three is Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjing.)
Let us see the enormous gaps of doctor’s education level between large public hospitals in cities and grass-rooted ones.
Figure 1. Doctor's Degree of Community Medical Service Center in Cities [4]
Figure 2. Doctor's Degree of Community Medical Service Center in Towns [4]
Figure 3. Doctor's Degree of Community Medical Service Center in Villages [4]
From these graphs above we can see that community medical service center get the best medical education level, whereas doctors working in villages get the lowest level. So we can draw the conclusion that government hasn’t attached enough importance to education of medical workers at grass-root level as it ought to do.
Current Situation of Non-public hospitals in China
Non-public hospitals are even worse comparing to public hospitals. The speed of non-public medical industry agglomeration is slow and the scale of that is small (Wei F. et al., 2015). The agglomeration degree of economy has greater impact than that of non-public hospitals, that is, in most developed areas, non-public hospitals are often at larger scales. However, except for a few provinces, there are most other regions that the agglomeration degree and scale of non-public hospitals is far lower than that of public hospitals. There are more comprehensive hospitals in non-public hospitals in China, and specialized hospitals gather greater in developed areas [2].
These two pictures below show the strong linkages between economy and number of non-public hospitals. Nevertheless, we must admit that these highly developed areas only consist of a small part in China, and it certainly cannot cover most people.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," threat of gene doping in this world.
“Argentinian scientists have started performing gene editing on horses, and it is speculated that the first super-horse is likely to be produced by them as early as 2019.”
Dr. Teruaki Tozaki, technical advisor for the Laboratory of Racing Chemistry in Japan ( Bloodhorse, 17 May 2018 )
This year the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine even received $300.000 dollar towards the development of a gene doping detection system according to Kim Yuhl in the Online Pennsylvania Play Magazine ( Yuhl et al. June 22, 2018 ). The Dutch Horse Racing Association has shown great interest in our product as we discuss on our Entrepreneurship page.
Apart from direct gene doping applications, the Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin is working on methods for prenatal screening of diseases for which they have shown great interest in our method. On top of this, the RIKILT, the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research, world’s number 1 university for food technology, has shown interest in our method for safe food applications. These are only a few of the variety of extended applications of our targeted sequencing method.  The Stan Brouns Lab at Delft University of Technology is so enthusiastic about our project that they want to develop our method of targeted sequencing for broader applications. Nevertheless, the fight against gene doping might be continued as well depending on a big grant application we started. Read more on the steps we have been taking towards the future applications on our Entrepreneurship page .

Celiac and Food Businesses
The attitude of the food business such as restaurants, cafes, pubs, etc. to the celiac disease is not anchored in the law in many countries such as the State of Israel. A person who enters a restaurant may accidently eat food containing gluten in this case, sometimes, the end result could be critical. Currently there is no law that requires businesses in most countries to sell gluten-free food. 
On the other hand, many food products are labeled as ""MAY"" contain gluten, which requires the patient to buy the same product, gluten-free. The financial implication is significant. 
Education and Celiac
From 2009 through 2013, the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (NFCA) proudly educated a variety of healthcare professionals on celiac disease via the accredited Gluten-Free Resource Education and Awareness Training (GREAT) Healthcare programs. Through healthcare professional education, NFCA sought to advance its dual mission to increase diagnosis and improve the quality of life for those on a lifelong gluten-free diet.
In 2014, NFCA shifted its focus to maintain a patient-centered approach to achieve its mission of increasing diagnoses.  NFCA has vastly increased its gluten-free community through a variety of methods which have allowed the organization to expand its reach and messaging.  By educating people diagnosed with celiac disease on the genetic nature of the condition, NFCA is able to reach one of the most at-risk populations - family members. 
While the following healthcare professional programs are no longer a focus for the organization, NFCA continues to offer its online gluten-free training program for foodservice professionals, GREAT Kitchens. Unfortunately, in schools in Israel, there is no such awareness for food allergies, also any reference to celiac. In fact awareness has grown thanks to the alertness of doctors and public small talk, the information is passed on by word of mouth. The Israeli Association for Celiac is based entirely on volunteers and is mainly engaged in the monitoring and treatment of patients. The association has no prevention activities or public explanation to the general population.
Celiac in the Educational System
The educational is not progressing at the rate of the development of medical information. As far as we know there is no law in the field of food allergies, no obligation for school to offer non-allergy foods.
In Israel the food offered to students in the educational system is standard, and definitely contains allergy food"

A course in synthetic biology
The department of physics, chemistry and biology (IFM) at Linköping University teach a course in synthetic biology. By having the iGEM project partly as a course, the participating students can apply for financial support in order to manage to work with the project during the summer. Students that only participate in the project are welcome as well.
During the course, the iGEM team had access to the equipment and chemicals that were needed during the project. We were given a quick guide with equipment that we had not used before as well. We also had a run through of safety protocols as well as a walkthrough on a risk analysis system called KLARA.
Even though it is a course, the students have planned and organized the project and laboratory work all by themselves, which is some of the criteria for the course. The course is divided into two examination parts. The first part refers primarily to laboratory work and modeling, the second part relates mainly to the presentation and documentation.
The course and the brainstorming started in March 2016. We started to work on the  project at the same time. The laboratory part started in June 2016 It ended October 19th 2016.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Collaboration#TeamUiOslo_-_-_TEXT.html,"ested with XbaI and SpeI anymore. That opened up an easy way to check for the correct insertion. This cloning was done and 16 colonies were picked. However none was tested positive using SpeI-digestion, which is to say, none was linearized after incubation with SpeI in correct buffer. As a last resort attempt, we tried TA-cloning. The DNA was amplified with a Taq-polymerase, which adds one more A at the 3’ end of the amplified DNA-fragment. Thus, using a linearized backbone with a T-overhang (pGEM), cloning should have been possible. From that plasmid subcloning into pSB1C3 could occur. Unfortunately this attempt did not produce any colonies after transformation. Sadly at this point it was too late for any other attempts and all we could do was to report our efforts and the encountered problems back to team Oslo.

Today we made an actual list of effectors and promoters that we want to use in our biobricks. It was brainstorming mayhem, but we cut down our list to about ten candidates from each category for which we are going to collect more information for tomorrow.
Thursday 25th
Hackathon part 2
We finished our list today and had a lengthy vote on the g Blocks to order for our biobricks. Our main criterium for now is the likeliness for the gene products to yield useful data. Here is our list for the genes and promoters that we are starting to work on next week:
Effectors
TPH1 gene with an adrenaline-sensitive promoter, BBa_K554001 . TPH1 converts tryptophan to a precursor of serotonin.
TPH1 gene with nitric oxide sensitive promoter, BBa_K381001
naked sequence for GAD, which codes for the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase which produces GABA.
naked sequence for KAT (kynurenine aminotransferase), an important enzyme in serotonin metabolism
naked sequence for Cholin Acetyltransferase, which makes Acetylcholin, an important neurotransmiter
Promoters
biobrick of the adrenaline sensitive promoter BBa_K554001
biobrick of an osmotic stress sensitive promoter BBa_R0082
biobrick of the nitric oxide sensitive promoter BBa_K381001
biobrick of a pH sensitive promoter BBa_K318512
Constructs
An estrogen induced construct that is not yet fully characterized. We are going to transfect HeLa cells to model a pathway in mammalian cells which is central to our project as it involves bacteria interfering with humans
An anti-sense Tryptophanase construct. We want to use this to control the tryptophanase expression which would allow us (or a cell) to regulate serotonin expression.

I’ve been learning a lot from iGEM; how to work aseptically, how to keep a lab book, and generally how to be more confident in the lab. A lot of the biological concepts which seemed daunting at first now make perfect sense, and I’m sure they will come in handy later in my degree. When not in the lab I can generally be found doing LARP (Live Action Role Play), a hobby in which I and other LARPers dress up in armour and hit each other with foam weapons. It is at least as cool as it sounds. My email address is rcpm501@york.ac.uk

Fantastic location, medieval city walls and town itself, lots of birds (maybe too many), friendly people, real Hogwarts express – could you ask for anything more awesome?
York is a city with a rich heritage, having been founded over two millennia ago. It was in turn a Roman, Viking and Norman city. The buildings in the city centre still preserve the beautiful Victorian style, particularly on Shambles, which has been chosen the most beautiful street in the world. York also holds the record for the most haunted place on Earth! The National Railway Museum contains a wide collection of trains, including the locomotive of Harry Potter"

Chifley High School Event
We transformed our lab into an engaging workshop for up to 40 high school students in years 9 and 10 with interactive activities designed to promote an understanding and appreciation of various aspects of synthetic biology and our iGEM project. Students were invited to learn about various good and bad microbes and created their own out of play-doh, explored the microbial word through learning how to use a microscope, and the importance of safety and hygiene with an activity showing how easily bacteria can be transferred. They also had a lot of fun playing an original synthetic biology themed snakes and ladders game created by one of our team members, and they learnt all about fluorescent bacteria where they had the opportunity to use these bacteria to paint beautiful artwork. The workshop concluded with a game show style quiz, where the students competed against each other and showcased their new knowledge.
Both students and team members thoroughly enjoyed the day, and evaluations were conducted to measure the educational and engagement affect our event had on the students.
Presentations
Open Day
Team members co-presented lectures at Macquarie University’s Open Day for prospective new Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Medical Science students. The lectures introduced the basic concepts behind synthetic biology, what to study to enter a career in this field, and introduced the iGEM competition and our project to the audiences.

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ol. The                         antioxidants that are commonly found in cosmetics and health products on the market today are                         vitamin C, vitamin E, tea polyphenols, etc.
The prospect in the field of antioxidants and detection
In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards and the aging of the                         population, health, anti-oxidant and anti-aging have attracted people's attention more and                         become hotspots. According to statistics, the scale of China's medical and health industry has                         increased from 1.6 trillion yuan in 2009 to 5.6 trillion yuan in 2016. And it is estimated that                         by 2020, the total size of China's medical and health industry will exceed 8 trillion yuan. [5]
Because of the functions of anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, vascular activation and the capacity of scavenging the excess ROS in the organisms, antioxidants have a                         remarkable prospect in the fields of pharmaceuticals, health products and cosmetics. [6]
Through literature review and data collection, we learned that the current antioxidant testing                         methods on the market are not good enough, which means, there is no standard method for us to                         judge the effects of antioxidants. So we want to establish a convenient and efficient standard                         and detection method for evaluate antioxidants. Additionally, how to accurately evaluate the                         activity of antioxidants is also a hot topic in the field of antioxidants research. [7] Besides, the public resist synthetic antioxidants and inclined to choose natural antioxidants. Check                             here to know what people want for antioxidants detection. [8] The most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in nature.                         We just need a key of antioxidants detection method to open the huge treasure house of nature.
Here showed the current detecting methods that we collected in the market:
The existing methods of detecting antioxidants:

In these existing assays for detection of antioxidants, human studies and animal models could                         give us the most truthful and reliable measurement results could. However, these are expensive                         and time-consuming and not available for initial screening antioxidants. [9]

POST 1 | A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 1
Overview
If you’re here on this blog, you are either 1) very lost or 2) looking for some information on intellectual property in synthetic biology.  If you are here for the second reason, then welcome!  You have come to the right place!  Now begins a pseudo-entertaining journey into the realm of synthetic biology property rights.
Unfortunately, the best way to facilitate a discussion on intellectual property rights in synthetic biology is to first acquire an understanding of some key definitions (boo definitions!). Otherwise, we’ll end up halfway through a discussion on the ownership battle of the gene-editing system CRISPR without fully understanding something key like “property rights.”
Thus, before we begin diving into the more interesting discussions on patent law in the context of synthetic biology (which is way more interesting than it sounds, we promise) we need to establish a strong foundation in some definitions.  If you’re a whiz kid and you’re looking at this thinking “I already have my J.D. in Intellectual Property Law with a concentration in Biological Science, why am I reading this?” you can skip to the next post in our blog and ignore this introduction. If you’re reading this and are completely lost in what synthetic biology is and are wondering how you got here when you were googling a YouTube video of cats, please watch “Synthetic Biology Explained” (the link is here) and read the ‘About’ page on this blog. If you don’t currently know a lot about intellectual property and want to learn about it in a pseudo-entertaining way, read on to the next section!
The Definition of Intellectual Property (and Copyright and Trademark and Patent)
Before we jump into intellectual property, we should define the idea of property rights. Property rights grant a property owner exclusive authority to determine how a resource is"

JUDGING FORM ⇗
Designing the space mission is an extremely important, yet complicated part of a NASA proposal. The term ""Mission Architecture"" refers to the overall structure of the mission - beginning with on-Earth preparations, and concluding after setup of our habitats at the destination planet. In this section, we'll go over these considerations chronologically, and emphasize how the different subprojects (glues, filters, etc.) fit into the overall mission plan.
I. Habitat Design
Beginning on Earth, the first task involves manufacturing the plastic shell for our habitats. Our habitat is designed as a three-layered plastic dome.
/>The outer layer is designed to hold H2O, which can provide some measure of temperature insulation (high specific heat) and radiation protection (due to the high hydrogen-composition, which interacts with harmful primary radiation, while producing less secondary radiation than compounds composed of heavier elements)1,2,3. The supply for the H2O layer will be drawn via melted subsurface ice water at the landing site.
The middle layer is designed to hold cyanobacteria, which can fix compressed carbon dioxide and molecular nitrogen to produce oxygen for our main biomass (the mycelia), as well as for our astronauts to breathe. In addition, these diazotrophic cyanobacteria can produce organic carbon and fixed (biologically usable) nitrogen. In some of our experiments, we show that additional nutrients for cyanobacteria growth can be provided by Martian regolith and small quantities of fertilizer brought from Earth. The light for photosynthesis passes through the topmost layer to reach the cyanobacterial layer.
The final layer is designed to hold the mycelia, which provide the structural integrity and additional radiation protection for the habitat. This mycelia can also be functionalized for several other purposes, which you will see in other sections: primarily MycoGlue (to assemble smaller objects), and Filtration (to provide clean water for astronauts).
Note that, between each layer are one-way valves allowing water to flow into the cyanobacteria layer, and cyanobacteria to flow into the mycelial layer"

We carefully tested every combination (the strength of constitutive promoter controlling MerR expression and the backbone copy number) under induction with a Hg (II) concentration gradient ranging from 10^-9M to 10^-5M. The concentration gradient of Hg (II) is: 0, 1E-9, 3E-9, 5E-9, 8E-9, 1E-8, 3E-8, 5E-8, 8E-8, 1E-7, 3E-7, 5E-7, 8E-7, 1E-6, 3E-6, 5E-6, 8E-6, 1E-5, 3E-5, and 5E-5. Cell culture was cultivated for 8 hours and then dilute with fresh LB in a ratio of 1:100 and continue to incubate until the OD600 reached 0.4~0.6.
Fig 4. Dose response behavior of each constitutive-promoter-controlling MerR. A: Pc-MerR was cloned into pSB1A2 backbone and PmerT-BBa_E0840 into pSB3K3 backbone. It can be observed that GFP expression level drop dramatically at high Hg (II) concentration levels. From the top to the bottom, they are J23101, J23103, J23108, J23109, J23112, J23114, J23116, and J23117. B: Pc-MerR was cloned into pSB3K3 backbone and PmerT-GFP into pSB1A2 backbone. Data were processed as the same with Fig.4-A.
As was mentioned above, MerR dimers act as a repressor of PmerT or an activator in the presence of Hg (II). A weaker constitutive promoter leads to the less production of MerR, raising the proportion of Hg-bound MerR dimer, resulting in a higher threshold (Fig 4, Fig 5). On the other side, data of characterization demonstrated that GFP intensity, which is measured by microplate-reader, needed higher Hg (II) concentration to rise to a considerable level when the constitutive promoter is strong (Fig 4, Fig 5).
When the Hg (II) concentration became as high as 10^-5M, cells can not tolerate the toxicity (Fig.4)."

The following constructs were designed by uOttawa iGEM for Waterloo iGEM
Inducible Integrase-Expressing constructs
The inducible expression of the PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase genes was designed by incorporating riboregulators that allow post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Riboregulators include two RNA elements; a cis repressor molecule (also known as the Ribo “lock”) and a trans-activating RNA molecule (also known as the Ribo “Key”). The cis-repressor element is a sequence complementary to the RBS associated with the gene whose expression needs to be silenced (that would be the integrase gene in this case). To control expression of the integrase gene, a Ribo lock was designed to be cloned directly upstream of the integrase gene and its associated RBS (5’ UTR). The sequence encoding the Ribo lock, integrase and its associated RBS as well as a lacI cassette (BBa_Q04121) were to be placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter (J23119). The trans-activating Ribo key (BBa_I714036) on the other hand, was cloned in the 3’ UTR of the construct and was placed under the control of the PLlac 0-1 promoter (BBa_R0011), which is both LacI-repressible and IPTG-inducible. Simultaneous expression of the LacI cassette and the integrase from a single promoter would ensure repression"

Modeling
Models are vital components to any engineering project because they simplify complex systems through a set of specified parameters. Mathematical models are especially useful because they can be used to predict a system’s behavior given certain inputs. For TERRA we have used several models to simulate the droplet formation at the end of an output tube and characterize our XY-translational plane.
Droplet Analysis
XY Translational Stage
Droplet Characterization
Due to the relatively low flow rate that fluid moves at in microfluidic chips, outputs dispensed from microfluidic chips are typically droplets rather than a continuous stream. Therefore, in order to accurately dispense these droplets into wells, we created a model to predict their volume so that users can have greater control of the end sample volume in the well of interest. To develop the model we used a free-body diagram to identify the forces present right before a droplet falls off the nozzle. Using the sum of the forces acting on the droplet we were able to model the its theoretical volume. The derivation of the static model is shown below.
To test the model we ran preliminary experiments to calculate volumes at flow rates of 1 mL/hr, 2.5 mL/hr, 5 mL/hr, 7.5 mL/hr and compared them against the theoretical value. To calculate droplet volumes we followed the following method:
Set up a single syringe pump with a 12 mL syringe filled with red colored water. The tubing is then passed through the nozzle of TERRA to stabilize the tubing. A well plate is then placed under the tubing to catch droplets.
Start the syringe pump at the flow rate of interest.
Place a smartphone on a flat surface that captures the droplet falling off the tubing and hitting the well plate.
Start recording the droplets dispensing, ensuring that it left at a duration long enough to capture at least 35 droplets.
Analyze the video by measuring the time interval between droplets.
Because we can’t directly measuring the volume of the droplet, we used the time interval between droplets and the given flow rate to calculate what the experimental volume is.
After comparing the experimental droplet volume to the theoretical droplet"

ppGpp's effect on rrnB P1
Figure 1: Plasmid map of the rrnB P1 test-construct. Note the PstI site in RelA.
To test the down-regulating effect of ppGpp on rrnB P1, which is the basis of our project, we decided to make a construct containing ppGpp Synthase (RelA) inducible by the pBAD/AraC promoter. The construct would also contain beta-galactosidase (lacZ) which would be expressed by the rrnB P1 promoter. Thus, induction of the pBAD/AraC promoter with arabinose should give lower lacZ production, as relA is overproduced giving high ppGpp concentration.  We were not able to show this effect in our experiment due to an error in the cloning procedure.
Results

Unfortunately, the data from the assay indicates no significant regulation of the rrnB P1 promoter, as there is no difference between the induced and the uninduced cultures. This might be due to problems during"

To improve on existing methods, BeeT should affect Varroa mites only. This means it should be harmless to bees, humans and other organisms. In our search for a suitable toxin we looked into Cry toxins, also named Bt toxins, which are produced by Bacillus thuringiensis. Due to interaction with receptors in the gut membrane, these toxins are known to be very species-specific. To find a suitable Cry toxin we tried isolating B. thuringiensis from dead mites, as well as mutating an existing Cry toxin. For testing the potential toxins that were obtained, we employed an"

Welcome to the world of creation and imagination!
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction
Left:
When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is also available in our interface , you can decide  their amount per second . They can be static or changing all the time . It's up to you !
Right:
You can choose E.Coli and set their parameters one by one . Plasmid must be set up"

Meet up in SYSU
On July 19th, 2015, we spent a meaningful afternoon at the Sun Yat-sen University with other four IGEM teams. They were SKLBC-China, SKLBC-GDSYZX,SYSU-software and SCUT-China . We had fully exchanged the designs and thoughts of projects, which has greatly promoted the mutual understanding and let us know more about ourselves in the same time.
 
The meet up was divided into three parts. Part one was ICE BREAKER. Everyone present was supposed to use three key words or phrases to introduce yourself in one minute. Part two was time for PROJECT PRESENTATION .Each team has ten minutes to demonstrate and explain its projects，while members of other teams could write down their own questions and comments in a piece of paper which lastly would be hanged over to the corresponding teams. The last part was called WORLD CAFÉ.All people were divided into three groups.All groups will discuss a same topic—What is the relationship between experimental teams and software teams，in the way you like (eg：pictures, thumbnails, branching tree, etc.) and furtherly,leading to the contact between wetlab and drylab.
 
Here, wehighly appreciate it that Team SKLBC organized this meet up forwardly to provide an opportunity for communication and learning，and wefeel really honored to be invited. Through communications with other teams, we recognized our own problems and got a great help in their suggestions.Such an activity is really meaningful to exchange experimental experience and toImprove overall experimental operation ability.
About Us
In 2015, we SCUT teams won top ten innovative and entrepreneurial team set up by SCUT.Because of the strong support of the college, our team is being on the right track, and increasing understanding of the subject and experience.

Introduction
So, we set up this page specially describe the improved Part, BBa_K2765043 , which can produce redox-sensitive                         green fluorescent protein roGFP2-Orp1 and display intracellular ROS content by its fluorescence                         ratio.
Source
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part: BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence of orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR, which enhanced the specificity and                         sensitivity of roGFP2 to H2O2.
Codon Optimization
As shown, we mutated the cysteine at position 82 of the Orp1 protein to serine, which made our signal output                         more responsive and increased the protein expression of roGFP2-Orp1.
Promoter Optimization
According to this measurement principle, the concentration of roGFP2-Orp1 protein can influence                         the final signal output strength. So, 4 promoters, FBA1p, TEF2p, TEF1p, ENO2p, with different                         expression intensity were screened, because we wish this BioBrick Part can output signal with                         suitable intensity in different situation.
Modeling Optimization
Beyond these, we also did some dry-lab for this Part. Considering that fluorescence intensity                         of roGFP2-Orp1 can only characterize the relative level of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but                         can’t give the absolute content of intracellular ROS quantitatively, we established the model                         based on Michaelis equation and some assumptions, which can convert fluorescence intensity of                         roGFP2-Orp1 into the intracellular H2O2"

So we used the sequences of the laccase genes we tried to isolate from the Streptomycetes strains and blasted them against an intern database from our university. The results showed that we could use genomic DNA from Streptomyces sp. tuebingen, S.roseochromogenes and Streptomyces sp. goettingen, from which we can get already isolated genomic DNA. Therefore we designed primers for the isolation of the predicted laccase genes from these three strains.
Team Shuttle Vector:
Phusion PCR was done with the following primers to see if the genomic DNA can used as template for the part 3OAX1. For creating the mating factor alpha 1 K863206 the plasmid pPICzA was used, because we did not have the wildtype strain of Saccharomyces cereviceae. For protein secretion we used the mating factor alpha 1 from Sacharomyces sereviceae because it secrete protein in the outer media better than the secretion factor from P. pastoris (LITERATURANGABE)

Limits
Knowing the limit of a technique is required to interpret the raw data properly, this also applies to electron microscopy. One of the most troublesome limitations is that the preparation of the sample is laborious and can lead to potential debris, which can ruin the sample. Another limitation is that the preparation of the sample, operation of the EM and the analysis of the data requires special training. We were lucky enough to receive a course on how to use the EM. Also samples that are put into the EM must be resilient against the vacuum in the microscope [2].
Dynamic Light Scattering
Figure 2: DLS overview, laser is shooting light in the sample, scattered light is detected by a photon-detector and the data is processed by the computer
Another method to detect VLPs is dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic light scattering. This technique is used to measure the size of particles [3]. We applied this technique as a complimentary method to electron microscopy. To use this technique, first we must purify the sample  by FPLC to get good measurements. The standard setup of the DLS is seen in figure 2.
When light travels through the sample and hits a particle, it gets scattered in all directions. This scattered light is detected by the DLS. Due to Brownian motion, the particles move randomly in the solution. These movements of the particles changes the distance of the particles with respect to the detector. This change of distance to the detector results in constructive or deconstructive interference of the scattered light. The change of intensity of the scattered light by the interference is related to the radius of the particle and can be calculated by the Stokes-Einstein equation [3].
Figure 3: A) Explanation on how the DLS works by Remco Fokkink, B) output screen of the DLS, C) Stokes-Einstein equation on white-board, D) DLS setup in real life
We investigated various samples with the help of DLS. The main issue was that the sample was not pure or not concentrated enough. After optimization of the production and purification protocol we succeeded to detect VLPs. The main improvement was the implementation of FPLC, which filters out all aggregates and subunits, yielding pure VLP solutions.
Limits
The same as electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering has its limitations. To detect particles with the DLS, the particle has to have a different refractive index than the solvent. If not, the particle doesn't scatter light."

Standard BioBrick Assembly
modified from Silver lab :
This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

Tried PCR using new forward primer #2, reverse primer #1, and cage with his-tag template. Saw no product whatsoever, just like last time using forward primer #2. Thus, we should probably scrap this primer and not use it for further experiments.
Meeting Notes: Sri suggested that for all PCRs with extensions, we should first use a low melting temp (55-60C) for the first 5 cycles. Then alternate between 72 and 98C for about 20 cycles. The 72C time will function as both the annealing and extension time. He also recommended that we dilute the template DNA, as a concentration that is too high can affect annealing temperature. He said the dNTP and primer concentrations should be kept the same as the normal Q5 protocol. He said we should start with 1 ng per reaction and do 10-fold dilutions to optimize the template concentration.
We will try another gradient PCR for the first 5 rounds, followed by a two-step reaction. According to NEB, the annealing/extension time may be kept the same as the usual 20-30 seconds per kb. The reaction will be started today and ran on a gel tomorrow.

At first, the overnight culture’s OD600 and red fluorescence intensity are measured. And then we measure the OD600 and red fluorescence intensity every 1-2 hours.
And then we draw the diagram about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 the diagram of the about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose
From this diagram, we can clearly know more arabinose added, less RFP expressed. When the arabinose concentration is 0.003％, the RFP intensity have been very low. So we think when the arabinose concentration is above 0.003％, the in-promoter will be fully repressed that means the killer will not express to kill the bacteria.
Then we collect the data after passing 17.5 hours from Fig. 3 to draw the diagram about the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4 the diagram of the about RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration
From this curve, we can directly to see the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose’s concentration: The arabinose’s concentration have a negative correlation with RFP intensity/OD600. We regard that the in-promoter have been repressed fully when the concentration of arabinose between 0.003％ and 0.004％. So we think when the concentration of arabinose is 0.003％, the in-promoter’s activity is very low, and the killer gene wouldn’t kill the bacteria. So we regard that 0.003％ is threshold of arabinose concentration which also is fit in with our modeling part.
After we use the PBAD promoter to construct the environment with different concentrations of inhibitor, we have successfully proved that the in-promoter will respond to the different concentrations of inhibitor differently and found the threshold of inhibitor’s concentration that the PBAD promoter expressed under the 0.003％ arabinose concentration.
2. Found out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.

Eq. 2. Differential equations of the mazEF system
Equations (2-1) and (2-8) describe the concentration of mRNAs under AHL-inducible promoters. Thus, they comprise terms of production by leaky expression of promoters, terms of production by Hill function dependent on the concentration of C4HSL (C4) and 3OC12HSL (C12), terms of original degradation and terms of degradation from cleavage at ACA sequences by MazF dimers.
Since equations (2-2), (2-3), (2-5), (2-6), (2-7), (2-9), (2-10), (2-12), (2-13) and (2-14) describe the concentrations of complexes, mainly they comprise terms of production and terms of binding and dissociation.

FimE has different binding affinities for IRL and IRR depending on the orientation of FimS, and as a result FimE is able to efficiently cause recombination only when the promoter faces IRR. Therefore, switch inversion is permanent and heritable. Based on E.coli Fimbriae control system (E.coli Fimbriae(Fim) phase variation system), we have finished the switch design, to whose both ends GFP and RFP have been linked. This modified switch has been transformed into BL21 and proved to be feasible. A microplate reader measured OD, red fluorescence values and green fluorescence values. After we induce the production of FimE, the red fluorescence values rise and the green fluorescence values decrease. Fluorescence conversion was observed under a fluorescence microscope.

The NOS terminators were amplified in preparation for assembly of PhaC and Castor.
June 23-29
The DNA arrived, was hydrated, and a preliminary CBAR reaction was completed to assemble the two constructs. The desired product was then PCR amplified from the CBAR reaction.
June 30-July 6
A gel of the PCR amplified CBAR did not yield either of the constructs.
July 7-13
The PCR amplification of both CBAR were again run on a gel, but again yielded nothing. The CBAR were run again, but were heat killed this time. This did not solve the problem and the CBAR were still unsuccessful. Two new vector plasmids were also cultured. A gradient PCR was also tried for PhaC.
July 14-20
Pollux was optimized for synthesis. This required breaking it into two major segments that would later need to be assembled. It was also suggested that PhaC and Castor be assembled with intermediates instead of all at once. New primers were designed to implement this idea.
July 21-27
Intermediate components of PhaC and Castor were prepared via PCR. These were then run through a CBAR to assemble them into their final constructs.
July 28-August 3
PhaC was digested and ligated into its final construct, minus the NOS terminator.
August 4-10
The PhaC construct was transformed and colonies were picked for a screen.
August 11-17
The screen of PhaC looked promising. Castor was digested and ligated into its final vector plasmid. Colonies were picked and cultured for a screen.
August 18-24
PhaC was sequenced and found to be correct.
August 25-31
The PhaC construct was digested and the NOS terminator prepared previously was ligated. The screen colonies for Castor were digested and run on a gel. The results looked promising for Castor being in the desired construct.
September 1-7
Castor was submitted to sequencing and found to be correct. However one of the sequencing reactions went poorly and will need to be re-run. Primers were also designed for amplifying parts to be submitted to the registry.

Strepavidin Binding Peptide
With the display of numerous of on the surface of a cell, there is a need determine the viability of the proteins. One such method is to tag the displayed proteins. By displaying a strepavidin binding protein, we can effectively tag displayers as well as other proteins of interest. The strepavidin binding protein is a short peptide sequence (SAECHPQGPPCIEGRK) that binds onto strepavidin. Using a streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE), we can fluorescently tag proteins and displayers for high through-put, automated analysis.
Functional Assay: Fluorescent Plate Reader
This assay tests for the presence of a functional strep binding peptide on the E. coli cell surface via its ability to bind to streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE)

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," sequences and splices a certain number of     A-bases in the middle of each. The number of A-bases is determined     by the longest sequence of A-bases that occurs in the full sequence     already. This number is also put in the header, using 4 base-pairs,     meaning it can have a maximum value of \(2^8 - 1 = 255\). The     decoder reads this number and then removes all sequences of that    many A-bases long before decoding and verifying the message. The    encoder also puts 4 A-bases between the start sequence and the     substitution length, in case their combination would form a    restriction site.
In our example the longest sequence of A-bases in the message     sequence is 4, so the substitution sequence     needs to be 1 base longer, which is encoded as CCAA. The restriction-substitution code is     implemented in restrict.js and the rest of the message-formatting code is in message.js .
Conclusion
The encoder follows these steps to create a complete message    sequence:
Encrypt the message with the key.
Convert the message to DNA.
Compute the length and the checksum of the message sequence.
Convert the length and checksum to DNA.
Put the length, checksum, message and footer together as the tail sequence.
Find the longest sequence of A-bases.
Find sequences of restriction enzymes in the tail sequence.
Splice sequences of A-bases, 1 longer than the longest found into the restriction sequences.
Convert the substitution length to DNA.
Put the start sequence, padding and substitution length together in front of the tail.
Putting it all together, the full message format looks as follows:
The start sequence: GACCAAGCCTGC.
Padding of 4 base-pairs.
Substitition length: 4 base-pairs.
Length of the message sequence: 8 base-pairs.
Message checksum: 8 base-pairs.
The message sequence itself: length times 4 base-pairs.
The footer: GCACCCACCGAC.

We were very happy to be invited to participate in this forum. Thanks for organizers. We learnt a lot from the forum.

Today we went to the laboratory. We succeeded in reverse transcription of RNA and kept the cDNA in refrigerator. And our cell’s growth situation was favorable.
Sunday 2/8
Today we reported our progress to our tutor in the meeting. After the meeting, we entered the cells room to continue our experiment. Cells were successfully subcultured by us.
Monday 3/8
Today, in preparation, we prepared the solution before the experiment. We used cells which were available. First of all, we extracted the RNA from cells. After running the gel electrophoresis, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. And then, we synthesized cDNA by reverse transcription. Afterwards, we detected cDNA’s concentration, and we processed the data. And then we calculated the consumption of the reagents such as water, primers and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix. We expanded the cDNA with PCR. We used the cDNA which had been expanded to run the gel electrophoresis. After all the work had been done, we cleaned up the laboratory furniture.
On the other side, the work of culturing cells was well. There were more and more cells in our cells room.
Tuesday 4/8
The result of experiment we had done yesterday was less than satisfactory. So we analyzed the reason why we failed. First of all, we found the mistake maybe caused from gene expression. Review of the literature revealed that PDE5A, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3 were expressed in kidney. The cells we used in experiment were HEK293. But we don’t know whether the genes we needed would express in HEK293 or not. So we had to consult with our tutor.

Mycelium Glue & Mycelium Based Bio-Filtration
In addition to developing mycelium as a material for habitat construction in space, we were also able to functionalize the material by synthesizing fusion proteins that linked a chitin binding domain (CBD) to various different functional proteins. The CBD binds chitin, which makes up the outer cell wall of fungus and our mycelium material, thus allowing CBD fusion proteins to bind to our mycelium. Among our most successful fusion proteins were the CBD fused to three copper binding domains and the CBD fused to the bacterial biofilm adhesion protein csgA.
When the CBD-copper binding fusion protein was applied to our mycelium, it allowed it to act as a scalable, completely biodegradable filtration system for waste metal recovery from aqueous solution. Copper was used as a proof of concept for metal binding, as it is a metal of significant biological and economic importance, as well as a part of many circuit boards and a known contaminant in water. We demonstrated the copper-binding capacity of our mycelium filter system using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a Phen Green copper concentration assay (Figures 5 and 6). These quantitative tests demonstrated our mycelium filter’s ability to bind 92% of the available copper in 30 minutes.
Another successful CBD fusion protein we synthesized the was CBD-csgA protein, which yielded an effective and mycelium-specific bioadhesive. We demonstrated this by conducting lap shear adhesive strength tests and comparing the relative strength of the adhesive on different materials like mycelium and cardboard (Figure 7).
Figure 5: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1.

Recombinase
Owing to its specific DNA cutting and splicing features, recombinase have been very widely used in synthetic biology. Compared with the traditional protein regulatory pathway, recombinase can ""write or erase"" stable ""permanent memory"" in the cell, which can be passed on to future generations.
In our task, the imaging process after sensitization relies on three different protein pathways. In theory, the colors°Ø duration time depends on the illumination time and the life duration of the chromoproteins. So in order to realize the film-like ""photographic memory ""feature, we introduced the idea of recombinase.
In general, our thinking is like this:
The expression levels of recombinase are under the control of the upstream sensitizing system .And the recombinase will cause the inversion of certain DNA fragments, which will finally result in permanent color display. Expression of the recombinase under the control of upstream sensitizing system is easy to implement via the previous pathway design. As for the recombinase-controlled color display circuits, its design and verification have been completed in 2012 by team KAIST, which changed the expression levels of different recombinase and achieved various color expression.
Fig.17 The schematic of our idea.
Fig.18 The experimental verification done by team KAIST. Specific colors were expressed under the control of different expression levels of recombinase.
In fact, this design makes it possible to adjust the color a single cell in. Given that the light-sensing system were replaced by another set of sensing system, the sensing signal would be converted to chromatographic output, which, compared to the traditional intensity-output system, not only make the results more intuitive, but also reduces the interference of the intensity due to environmental fluctuations.
Fig.19 With the improved in-output system, the traditional output signal intensity was transformed into chromatography, which relies on the input signal and shows better anti-disturbance features.The top output bar represents the traditional output pattern, which can only presents a ""deep-light"" output and gets interference easily. The middle shows with three different kinds of matches of two chromoproteins, ""red-green"", ""red-blue""& ""green-blue"", signals are output in chromatographies. The bottom provides expected effects of output with further improvement.
To realize the above vision completely, not only the precise modeling and analysis is needed, but also a lot of debugging work is inevitable and crucial (such as the expression level-upstream control curve, the effect of concentration on the activity"

The synthetic transcriptional control system that we have added to the registry is a powerful tool, as its elements could be put together in an enormous variety of ways.  These are some possibilities that we have drawn up:
up-limiter - upregulates a gene when the expression falls below a certain level
middle-manager- a combination limiter and up-limiter, it keeps a gene's expression between two threshold levels
dual limiter - regulates two genes simultaneously based on the induction of one.
limiter device as a regulatory bridge between two pathways- the induction of one gene causes threshold regulation of another
directed evolution for transcriptional phenotypes - express a cell-death gene if the level of induction a given gene is above or below a threshold level

Spring Summer Fall
February 2013
Recruitment begins for the uOttawa 2013 iGEM team.
March 2013
March 3rd-10th
The uOttawa iGEM team is formed. Leaders were appointed for each division of the team; wet lab, dry lab, human practices, and design team.
March 17th -24th
Each division of the team brainstorms project ideas. Human practices decide on writing a children’s book in hopes of educating children about synthetic biology. We will administer a test before and after the children read the book, in hopes of collecting significant data. The wet lab decides on building a type-I incoherent feedforward loop; a gene network in which protein X activates a gene Z while simultaneously activating the production of a repressor of gene Z. The use of S. Cerevisae as an organism to work with is confirmed.
April 2013
March 31st-April 7th
Project logistics are discussed. Sponsorship, the website, team logo, and potential use of the type-I IFFL as a toxic molecule detector are examined. The project mock-up is drawn.
April 21st-28th
Human practices brainstorm the cost, design, and plot of the children’s book. Everything is looking great! The design team begins to redesign uOttawa’s logo for this season. Dry lab decides on making a web-app to facilitate the assembly of BioBricks.
May 2013
April 28th-May 5th
Wet lab members begin training. The first PCRs are performed! The team begins looking for inducible promoters. Possible applications of the project include medical diagnostic tool and environmental solution analyzer. Human Practices decide on using a survey to collect data that they’ll receive from the elementary school students.
May 5th-12th
Human practices finalize their survey and decide on the protagonist’s name, Mr. Cool! Students obtaining higher test results after reading the book would represent significant data. Wet lab continues to train and search for inducible promoters. The design team begins to work on T-shirt ideas. The dry lab team learns all about standard assembly methods. The team gathers sponsorship information.
May 12th-19th
Wet lab members are given tasks to complete over the course"

Vector-borne (re) emerging diseases are responsible for severe epidemics worldwide. In most cases, vaccines or treatments are not available, and insecticides are the primary source for vector control.
Consequently, over spraying of insecticides impacts the environment and leads to the selection of insecticide resistant mosquitoes.
Therefore, we developed a novel diagnostic device, Mos(kit)o that includes a fixed or mobile mosquito trap and a biosilica cellulose composite patch from genetically modified Escherichia coli.
The design of the patch creates a multilayered matrix coated with antibodies capable of detecting a wide panel of vector-borne pathogens and insecticide resistant proteins from captured mosquitoes.
Additionally, the patch will have 2D barcoded readouts, generating an environmental surveillance database. A precise map of vector hot spots will provide a better assessment and response to vector-borne diseases, assisting local health authorities with anticipating and preparing for an epidemic. Our tool will be user-friendly, safe, and applicable.

Time Control Module
Overview / Rationale
The purpose of the Time Control module is to introduce a significant delay between the induction of the Sensing module         and the activation of the Recombination module, which allows time for AHL to sufficiently amplify and diffuse to         other cells by quorum sensing, as well as allocates time for gene-of-interest expression. The control of the delay         is executed by employing transcriptional and translational delay of cI and phlF repressors.
Time module has significant application in genetic containment strategy. The amount of protein-of-interest can be controlled         by the delay in Cre recombinase expression, which will knock out the construct and terminate the protein-of-interest         production process. This provides a secure and safe method for researchers to control the expression within genetic         modified organism (GMO).
Diagram 1. Expression in time module construct in the absence of induction by AHL molecules
Diagram 2. Expression in time module construct with induction by AHL molecules
Our Design
Our concept comes from a two-step cascade study which used IPTG as an inducer that regulates the system involving LacI         repressor and Tet repressor with their corresponding repressible promoters. The experiment shows a delay of about         one cell-cycle per step (ref 1). Our simulated graph shown in modelling (4.2 : Adding Time Control) is also based on the concept of two-step cascade study. In our design, we control Cre recombinase to express upon         AHL induction.
The construct starts with pLuxR which is inducible when AHL-LuxR dimer binds. The major CDS in the Time Module         construct just downstream pLuxR (BBa_R0062) are lambda cI repressor (BBa_C0051) and PhlF repressor (BBa_K1725040).         Both are able to repress their downstream constitutive promoters separated by double terminators. These promoters         are pcI (BBa_R0051) and"

FAQ
What is a virulence factor?
Virulence factors refer to the properties that enable an organism to live on or within a host of a particular species and increase its potential to cause disease. Virulence factors include bacterial toxins, cell surface proteins that mediate bacterial attachment, cell surface carbohydrates and proteins that protect a bacterium, and hydrolytic enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium.14Reference:
Jian Yang VFDB: Virulence Factors of Bacterial Pathogens. This definition was taken from the Virulence Factor Database, a good resource for information about virulence factors of bacterial pathogens.
How do I know if my cell line is pathogen-free? What pathogens should I be concerned about?
If you bought cells from a vendor or culture collection, consult the catalog. If you cannot find safety and pathogen information in the catalog, contact the vendor. If you received cells from another lab, find out where they originally came from. The viral genome could be integrated into the cell’s genome. Most viruses have a limited host range, meaning they can only infect closely related species. Viruses have Risk Group numbers, so if your cell line contains any viruses, you must handle it at the appropriate laboratory Safety Level. Some dangerous viruses that infect human cell lines: HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) 1 and 2, HTLV (human T-lymphotropic virus) 1 and 2, CMV (cytomegalovirus).4Reference:
Department of Health and Human Services (2016). NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (National Institute of Health).
LAB SETUP
Access to safety showers, eyewash stations and exit pathways should be unimpeded.
An open window may substitute for ventilation of work with non-hazardous chemicals.
As an alternative to expensive autoclave gloves, a community lab can use tightly-weaved cotton heat-resistant oven mitts.
CLEANING
Spills
Major Spills
Call 911 if:
The spill is likely to result in uncontrolled release of hazardous substances into drains, the air, etc.
Response to a release poses a safety or health hazard to the responder.
The researcher is uncomfortable.

Warren et al. (2004). Detection of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Directly from Nasal Swab Specimens by a Real-Time PCR Assay. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 42 (12). 5578-5581.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Since the Staphiscope project aims to detect S. aureus at low concentrations, it's important to determine how sensitive the system will be so that it can be adjusted to detect S. aureus at clinically-relevant concentrations. A detector that triggers at too low a concentration may display false positives, while one that triggers at too high a concentration may not give a positive when it should. To achieve the best sensitivity, numerical characterization for the Cambridge's 2009 sensitivity tuners needs to be obtained independent of the promoter used, in order to be combined with models for the AIP detection system and yield a predictive numerical model for Staphiscope. Work toward these ends is ongoing.
2.0 BACKGROUND
The sensitivity of Staphiscope may depend on various factors. For now, analysis has been restricted to just one factor: the choice of part used for the amplifier component of the system. The amplifier will be chosen from one of the 15 amplifiers submitted to the parts registry by Cambridge in 2009. Each amplifier responds uniquely to a given input signal, differing from the others with respect to its activation threshold (amoung a few other parameters less crucial to our analysis). Our goal is to determine which amplifier has an activation threshold in the correct range for the detection of S. aureus in relevant concentrations.
Empirical characterization of the response curves of each amplifier was carried out by Cambridge. However, in Cambridge's system the amplifiers were under control of the the pBAD promoter, which is not the case in Staphiscope. Therefore, the data gathered by Cambridge is not directly applicable to our system, since in general the response curve of each amplifier will be different under different promoters.
To obtain a numerical characterization of each amplifier, independent of promoter choice, we are undertaking the task of ""reverse engineering"" Cambridge's data to extract the parameters describing the amplifiers. A more detailed explanation of our approach first requires a description of the mathematical models relevant to this system.
3.0 SYSTEM MODEL
The parts characterized by Cambridge consist of a detector (the pBAD/AraC promoter) and one of the fifteen amplifiers. To obtain a mathematical description of the entire system, Cambridge used the"
EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#Results#Aptamers_-_-_TEXT.html," aptamer. Washing steps were done   with PBS and Aptamer Binding buffer (ABB, cf. protocols).
A fluorescent scan of the microfluidic chip resulted in a fluorescent signal   in the upper part of the chip where Thrombin was flown (Fig. 3).
Figure 3: Sandwich assay with Thrombin aptamers 1 and 2 in buffer
Sandwich assay with our Thrombin aptamers   1 and 3 in buffer
The Thrombin aptamer 3 is a modified version of the Thrombin aptamer 2 containing   the short trigger sequence for the toehold. We tested if this aptamer could still   form a sandwich complex with human thrombin and the biotinylated Thrombin aptamer 1.   Briefly, the biotinylated Thrombin aptamer 1 was first flown, then human thrombin in   the top half of the chip and finally the Cy3-labeled Thrombin aptamer 3 in the whole   chip.
As expected, no conformational change is impacting the modified aptamer to bind   to human thrombin (Fig. 4).
Figure 4: Sandwich assay with Thrombin aptamers 1 and 3 in buffer
Sandwich assay with our Thrombin aptamers   1 and 3 in human serum
We tested whether our aptamer pair could form a sandwich with thrombin in human   serum. The thrombin aptamer 1 which is biotinylated is flown first and thereby fixed to the surface.   Human serum was then flown in half of the chip and finally the   whole chip was covered with the Cy3-labeled thrombin aptamer 2.   Washing steps were performed with a buffer (PBS + 2% BSA + 0.01% Tween 20).   As expected, a signal in the button area was observed in the region containing   human serum.

How we got to our idea...
From the very beginning of our adventure, our project was focused on two main topics: the devastating African epidemics and the Antibiotic Resistance!           Two different problems, but one common enemy: bacteria!           And our project aimed at finding a flexible and dynamic tool that could help fight both of them!
African epidemics are a major problems of nowadays world: lack of resources and poor hygienic conditions cause humanitarian disasters! In most of cases the problem would be easy to solve, but poverty and bad organization empeach to improve           the           situation. We want to find an affordable and effective solution to fight those humanitarian crises!
On the other side we have antibiotic resistance, a so-called ""western problem""!           Antibiotics are drugs which serve to fight against the infections due to bacteria: urinary infections, blood-poisoning, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. It is one of the most important discoveries of the medicine which saved and which           still           saves millions of lives every year, but their efficiency is threatened because bacteria can adapt themselves and resist the treatment. Antibiotics kill bacteria, or block their proliferation. The resistant bacteria became insensible in           this           drug. We speak then about resistance to antibiotics.
The remarkable efficiency of antibiotics motivated their use massive and repeated in human and animal health. It created a pressure of selection on the bacterial populations, by a similar phenomenon in the ""natural selection of the           species""           described by Darwin, modifying the bacterial ecology.
The emergence of multiresistant bacteria in the middle of care is particularly worrisome as this new Australian study published in Nature Microbiology.
If the emergence of these resistances was countered at first by the development of new antibiotics, the breathlessness of the search and the decrease of the number of new available molecules threaten our armament in the face of these           bacteria           today. Before 2050, the resistant infections in drugs will kill more people than the cancer unless measures are taken to fight against the problem.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the rapid construction of many biosensor circuit, which can be fine-tuned using only cell-mixing. The splitting of biosensor components between different cells enables the top-down design of biosensing systems. In the top-down approach, systems are designed at a whole system level without consideration of the smaller subsystems required to generate a behaviour, as opposed to a bottom-up approach, where design begins with the smallest parts required to make a system and behaviour is built-up using the knowledge of these smaller parts. Using our platform with sub-systems of a known function already pieced together within cell, it is possible to simply add a cell to generate desired behaviour instead of having to consider the underlying biological parts. Top-down design will enable a more interdisciplinary approach to biosensor development, as knowledge of underlying biological behaviour is no longer required, and will generate biosensors better suited to their intended functions, as the design process will begin with consideration of end-user specifications, as opposed to discrete biological parts.
The next step. Another advantage to the bypassing of gene assembly enabled by our platform is the increased ability to automate system construction. Microfludic systems are those which control the movement of small volumes of liquids (10–9 to 10–18 litres) using a variety of methods, which may be used to perform biological experiments. These devices have a number of advantages over traditional, manual, lab methods. They only use a small amount of liquid, which means less reagents are consumed and the time taken to perform experiments is reduced. These small amounts of liquids are easier to manipulate than larger volumes, meaning there is greater control over reactions resulting in a high degree of sensitivity (Whitesides, 2006). However, many devices do not have the ability to control temperature, which is important for many methods of gene assembly. Cell mixing, as opposed to gene fragment assembly, is more suited to automation on these platforms, as there is no requirement for precise temperature control. Also, the increased control over small volumes of reagents allows the screening of precise cell ratios. Additionally, programs are in development for the automation of protocols on microfluidic, which will allow the rapid combination of a number of variant biosensor components. To utilise this advantage, we developed software for the simulation of microfludics experiments

Took transformations of ligation between J63001 and J63002 out of incubator roughly 14hr and 15 min after it had been put in.   No colonies visible.  It is more than likely that the UV light from the two transilluminators used with the gel mutated the DNA such as to inhibit ligation.  This UV light was UV-B.  One should note that of the two positive controls, the one incorporating cells that had been thawed for about one hour still had colonies, although at a significantly lower density (about a dozen colonies as compared to more than one hundred in the other positive control).  Should take this into consideration when transforming the remaining parts tonight, which means being frugal with the plasmid DNA (using 1.5 uL, for example).  This might also simply mean sticking to newer competent cells.
Took transformations of Z0842 and Z0279 out of incubator after 14 hr and 10 min.  Found that there were colonies on these plates.  Also note a significant amount of colonies on the plate containing the 3x flag that was microwaved.  However, there were no colonies on the positive control that did not go through the microwave, indicating that something went wrong (e.g. perhaps the two were switched).  Further investigation seems to indicate that both positive controls were accidentally spread onto the same plate.  Evidence for this is that there are two distinct circules on the agar that indicate where the transformation liquid was applied onto the plate before it was spread.   In any case, will inoculate cultures with the colonies on the plates containing the LexA parts later tonight.  Caution concerning this mistake:  DON'T WORK LATE AT NIGHT.

Building the PAI-1 sensor
All the parts we used to construct our PAI-1 sensor were obtained from the iGEM parts registry (detailed below in Fig 2), and sequentially cloned into pSB1C3 plasmid. The gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to our sensing device.

The plasmids were verified by sequencing.
The completed construct was transformed into E. coli strain MC1061 as a chassis for our two PAI biosensors.
Characterisation
With all of the components of the system in place, we could begin to test for a response to PAI-1. To this end, cells containing the construct were cultured in LB medium, cultures were spiked with 500μM synthetic PAI-1 in DMSO and samples were withdrawn at time periods of up to one hour following PAI-1 addition. A western blot with anti-GFP antibodies was performed on the treated cells alongside an un-spiked, PAI-1 negative control, and MC1061 cells harbouring the empty pSB1C3 vector. The results are shown in Fig 3.
As shown in Fig 3A, GFP production is activated by PAI-1 following a 60 minute induction period. Thus the PlasBLasR circuit has responded as expected to the presence of PAI-1. Fig 3B, shows a high basal GFP production driven by PluxR in the absence of the autoinducer molecule (PAI-1), however there is increased GFP production over time in the presence of PAI-1. The basal GFP production seen from PluxR in the absence of PAI-1 may reflect the fact that this is a ‘foreign’ promoter from V. fischeri and is not naturally regulated by LasR. Therefore regulation from this hybrid system might expected to be non-optimal. None-the-less these data show that both of our engineered systems respond to PAI-1.

Using Smartphone Microscopes to take ‘cell-fies’!
Click here to learn more about a device, which may complement our phage-based diagnostic test, that was viewed positively as a device on its own by four vets from The Brooke we outreached to.
After interviewing and surveying vets from developing countries we learnt that clinical practitioners in these countries did not have ready access to microscopes in rural areas but would find them useful in diagnosis. We also believed that access to a microscope could make using a phage-based diagnostic test easier and more accurate as the signal produced could be more easily detected.
We decided to make a device to convert a smartphone to a microscope. We ordered 3D printed plastic clips using files published by Pacific Northwest National Laboratories and glass beads kindly donated by Thistle Scientific and Biospec Products. We used the device to examine pre-prepared slides of housefly mouthparts and the cross section of a tilia stem.
The pictures we took were magnified around 100x but more adjustments would be needed to improve the focus at this magnification and to increase the magnification. We found we could take better 100x magnification pictures by using a 3.5mm glass bead attached to the lens on the screen side of"

ETH Zürich
OUR TEAM
ETH Zürich is taking part to iGEM since it was opened to the     European universities (for the second edition).
The team has known several successes in the Information     Processing track of the competition. This year, we are seven highly     motivated students from different backgrounds, aiming to rock the     Information Processing track once again. The interaction between     wet lab and dry lab is crucial for our team.
OUR PROJECT Make a Sierpinski triangle pattern     appear in a grid     Conjugate quorum sensing and     logic gates in bacterial colonies     Implement an XOR gate in an E.     coli     Characterize integrases (retrieve     missing parameters)     Study quorum sensing mechanism     aiming to lower the leakiness     Be able to predict accurately the     system’s behavior.
Questions it raises : How can a complex pattern emerge from a     simple logic rule?
What is to be considered as simple or     complex?
How can leakiness, noise and lack of     robustness in biological systems be     handled?
Emergence of complex patterns in nature is a fascinating     phenomenon, which is not fully understood yet. Some sea snail     shells indeed present natural mosaics, made out of only two     colors seemingly following a simple rule to form a pattern.
Our project Mosaicoli aims to implement a similar complex     behavior. It challenges the high noise and the low robustness     shown by biological systems. This cellular automaton consists of     a regular grid of E. coli colonies. Either in an ON or OFF state,     each colony interacts with its neighbours according to a fixed logic     rule. Mosaicoli exploits quorum sensing, integrase logic gates     and microfluidics to generate the Sierpinski triangle pattern.     Communication between colonies is achieved by AHL molecules     and subsequent updates in a cell state are determined by a discrete     XOR integrase gate. The final state is read out via fluorescence,     which collectively depicts a complex pattern. Mosaicoli deals with     the leakiness of biological subunits to create a reliable complex     entity, which can be considered as a first step towards the biological     computer.

Inoculating Chinese Cabbage with L-forms
Aims:
To plant Chinese Cabbage seeds on petri dishes so it can germinate and can be inoculated with L-forms.
Methods:
We washed and planted chinese cabbage seeds in preparation for the introduction of L-forms into seedlings following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol up to and including step four. The seeds were planted in Murishage and Skoog containing petri dishes and placed in a dark cupboard to germinate.
The protocol was continued on August 8th
Results:
Please refer to August 9th
BioGame
Upon adding buttons into the Install BioBrick sub-menu, it was noted that any button placed over the top of the clicked button on the parent menu is started off in the ""over"" position and as such is automatically registering a hit. To solve this the hit test code as been completely refactored for a more accurate hit test. To aid this, ActionListeners have been added into the Button class so as to handle the desire events upon click. This will enable coders to write anonymous classes for attaching to individual buttons.

Add 1 ul DMSO to PCR.
Plate 15 ul, otherwise, should probably get a lawn.
Competent cells—make sure we wash enough. Final vol. should be around 1 mL.
Chemically competent cells may be easier.
There are some specialized enzymes that may be good for amplifying large fragments (ie: GesABC). Can also add DMSO to reduce melting.
We can be in lab as long as other people are working in the lab as well, ie: grad students. We can try calling Dr.  Jin’s grad students to see if they’ll be in lab when we’d like to be in lab.
GolT try 50 ul PCR, Look at touchdown PCR, get high specificity. Maybe increase the number of cycles. Maybe a standard kit as well will help. Test it out with taq supermix where you just add primers and template.
Possible genomic DNA contamination in pSB1A2 for Tom and Amanda’s gel. Be crazy careful with PCR and contamination.
Change tips whenever you think you may have touched it to something, don’t breathe on it etc.
Send out small RNA biobricks for sequencing.
We can move our stuff into Dr. Jin’s -80 while Courtney looks for a -80 for us.

We’ll be able to use the plate reader by the end of the week, we’ll be able to do assays and have pictures for lab meeting by the end of the week.
Amanda/tom—have golT golB and golS. Need to start getting terminators and RBS on plasmids
Everyone should try to make a schedule of what needs to be done to complete the project.
For Friday’s lab meeting—overall schematic with our design, in combination with the decoder.
New competent cells from NEB work really well. Buy some more.

Meeting with Courtney
We can detect stuff but it’ll be hard to quantify.
We should go to the analytical lab and ask if they can help us out
Gold: fluorescent assay maybe? Do some reading.  Lots of info on fluorescent bound gold in the literature.
Spin down cells, test supernatant, lyse cells, test, what’s in the cell.
Courtney has some papers—will email or print off.
Arsenic—chemical detection is pretty much either flaming or ash--which would tell us how much is in the cell)
Look up mass spec. see if we can look up how to prepare the cells for that, Courtney has mass spec.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#August2011_-_-_TEXT.html," to finish off the remaining stubborn T7-Lysis variants, Vincent used the gene-specific T4-Lysis product from Friday to start an Extension Touchdown PCR with a Final PCR -- all of which were successful!
Vincent also made liquid cultures of BL21 K1-T7-Lysis (non-variant) for const, lac, and lac2 for a Berkeley-style experiment. The platereader showed a behavior that is atypical of BL21 cells.
Vincent also made a miniprep of Nadine's 3 colonies (J6 1, 4; pSB3K1 9) for sequencing on Monday.

Some brainstorming with Henrike on the topic of the failed IPTG platereader experiment made it clear to Vincent that he had been using the wrong colony plate to make his T7-lysis liquid cultures. Having cast light on a potentially crucial mistake, we then thought it would be a good idea to do another platereader experiment, this time with the BL21 cells and not DH5 alpha.
Before getting to work on those new liquid cultures, Vincent made the premixed tubes for Microsynth sequencing of Nadine's colonies. Results should be coming in on Tuesday by email. Lilia and Vincent then had an interview with Stéphane of the BioSafety committee at the EPFL. His comments and insights will soon be finding their way to the wiki safety page.
Henrike, Clara, and Matt helped Vincent mini-prep the 16 T7-RFP and T7-Lysis variants and measure the DNA concentration. They transformed and plated these and the T7-const-LYS, T7-lac-LYS, and T7-lac2-LYS into BL21 cells and also transformed and plated the pSB3K1 plasmid from Gibson assembly (negative control) into DH5 alpha. Vincent had not realized that the plasmid he Gibson-assembled did not have extensions and that there was no need to put this into DH5 alpha. Since Vincent made pSB3K1 extended for the next day's Gibson assemblies (of the remaining RFP and Lysis variants), this only put us behind by one day.

Though they are exactly one week late, here are the fluorescence and optical density results for the RFP IPTG induction platereader experiment we ran last Monday.
Vincent purified his PCR products ahead of the Wednesday Gibson assembly. He also made liquid cultures of the 1-5, 7, 9, 10, 11"
