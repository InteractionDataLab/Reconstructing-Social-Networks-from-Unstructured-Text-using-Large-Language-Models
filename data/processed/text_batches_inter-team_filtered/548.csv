Exposition: For Kids & Parents
Background & Instructions
Though there are many Chinese scientists devoting themselves to science, the public is still suffering from the lack of knowledge. For most people in China, science is difficult, mysterious and far from daily life. What's worse, there are many rumors making people panic, most of which are obviously wrong. People are credulous for lack of basic knowledge.
This might influence the kids and prevent them from entering the field of science. However, their curiosity can be lit up easily with proper methods.  We want lead them to learn the charm of science by introducing the new ideas of iGEMers and introduce them to the new subject, synthetic biology.
Luckily, Tianjin is a prosperous city with rich cultural ethos - that is, citizens are receptive to knowledge. Families love to go to museums, libraries, theaters and so on.
Science Museum is definitely the best place to hold an exhibition to introduce the public to synthetic biology and its special way to analyze and solve problems. We tried to cooperate with Tianjin Museum of Science and Technology and hold the exhibition. The SynFuture Exhibition received general approbation and the museum is ready to start more profound and long-term cooperation. (The staff also promised to provide more equipment such as 3D printers for future iGEM activities!)
If you want to do such work, you have to aim at special population and choose the proper place and time. We want to engage kids and parents so we cooperated with local museum. On a weekend in summer holiday, many people in Tianjin will take their children here and spend a whole day with knowledge. Then you have to consider the characteristics of your target population. In this case, most parents are new to science (they"

Project Overview
Numerous disease states in multicellular organisms involve anomalous expression patterns of endogenous genes.  Tumor growth, associated with the overexpression of oncogenes, is one vexing example in which this occurs.  While extremes of gene expression can damage living systems, normal expression is necessary for healthy function.  We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.  Along with its potential therapeutic utility, we offer our device as a foundational tool for researching gene expression in a eukaryotic model.

Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"orescence microscopy to observe surface expression of INPNC-HA tag fusion protein. The functionality of their parts are well described in their respective pages.
We started our projects by modifying these existing parts to enhance their functions. As shown in Fig7, our plasmids encode 6xhistidine tag (His tag) directly downstream of the INPNC and the BclA domain. The His tag polypeptide can be detected in Western blotting in similar manner as HA tag in the INPNC-HA system. In addition, His tag has a unique property of enabling fusion protein purification under denaturing conditions. The fusion proteins used for surface display will be expressed in the insoluble membrane fraction of E. coli. Therefore, this His tag was expected to enable additional options in the characterization of the fusion proteins [*3].
2) Construction of scFv plasmids and CBD plasmids
The scFv we used binds specifically to NoV GII.4 strain [8]. We have kindly been given the scFv-encoding plasmid (NoV GII.4 strain-specific antibody 12A2 (vector: pSCCA5-E8d)) from Dr. Kyoko Moriguchi (Fujita Health University). We used the scFv coding region of this plasmid.
For the CBD, we chose a BioBrick part K1321342 from iGEM Imperial 2014 for the construction of CBDcex [*4]. We placed the passenger protein (scFv or CBDcex) encoding region downstream of the INPNC-His and BclA-His surface expression modules. His tag was placed in between the two domains. The resulting constructs were sequenced and verified (Fig7).

The passenger protein (scFv or CBDcex) encoding region were placed downstream of the INPNC-His and BclA-His surface expression modules. His tag was placed in between the two domains.
3) INPNC-His and BclA-His can be detected in Western blotting with a single anti-His tag antibody regardless of the passenger protein placed downstream.
Among the parts submitted in the past, Penn 2012 used HA tag to detect INPNC-(passenger protein)-HA tag fusion protein. We anticipated our His tag plasmids can be used for protein detection in the similar manner. However, we noticed on their wiki page that they did not test whether their INPNC-HA parts can be detected through HA tag if passenger proteins are placed downstream. We"

Today we made digestion of the biobricks K346004 and E0840 extracted from JM110  with endonucleases XbaI and PstI,using the following digestion system:
Digestion System for K346004 and E0840 - 2 hours at 37°C:
Today, by prof. Spartaco Astolfi’s advice, instead of using NEB 3 buffer, recommended for double digestion with XbaI and PstI, we mixed buffers 2 and 3, to enhance digestion’s performance. We also added BSA!
1. E0840 not digested
2. E0840 digested with XbaI and PstI
3. K346004 not digested
4. K346004 digested with XbaI and PstI
It worked!!!
We know that digestion worked, because of the fragment's size after cutting with XbaI and  PstI. It was compatible with the biobrick. The size of the biobrick E0840 is 902 base pairs and K346004 is 502  base pairs.

UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"fq protein. Hfq protein, one of the RNA chaperones, facilitates the hybridization of sRNAs to mRNA by their complementary sequences and with RNase E. RNase E causes the degradation of the sRNAs by the target mRNAs. So the mechanism of gene repression by Hfq-dependent sRNAs is composed of the translational repression by their complementary sequences and Hfq proteins and the degradation of the target mRNAs by RNase E [3].
We tried to apply the Hfq protein-dependent RNA silencing for several objectives by establishing the design principle of sRNAs.
Fig.1 Mechanism of expression inhibition by Hfq protein-dependent sRNAs Design and use of synthetic regulatory small RNAs
In order to design Hfq protein-dependent sRNAs simply, we used the following design principle. Our sRNAs are composed of two regions: a target-binding sequence and a scaffold sequence. We made the sRNA generator by combining these with a promoter and a terminator. (Fig.2)
We chose a region of the target sequence that spans from the AUG to nucleotide +21 of the mRNA as the binding site. This was because a previous study suggested that it is effective especially to select the region overlapping the TIR (Translation Initiation Region) of the mRNA [2]. The scaffold sequence recruits the Hfq protein, which facilitates the hybridization of sRNA and target mRNA as well as translational inhibition. Among the scaffold sequences of E. coli, we selected MicC because of the superior repression capability and made the scaffold BioBrick part (BBa_K1124005). In this design, there is an unnecessary sequence, which is caused by using as BioBrick parts, between the promoter and the target-binding sequence.
We proved that the MicC scaffold and our sRNA design with pConst-sRNA(anti-tyrR) functions by qRT-PCR.

Georgia_State,2015,Team:Georgia State#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Tyson himself at the Fox Theater.  This year, GSU-iGEM participated in two events to help educate the public about synthetic biology.   The first event, Discovery Day, was held at Georgia State University.  The team met hundreds of guests and unveiled our fun and educational game we called “BioBricks.”  We also answered questions about bioethics and concerns people have regarding synthetic biology.  Both the parents and their children learned a lot with us that day!
Exploration Expo
Day 7: Atlanta Science Festival
For the second event, we collaborated with GTech’s iGEM team to greet thousands of people in Centennial Park for the Exploration Expo.  Once again, we hosted the BioBricks game and connected with people from all over the city.  We answered questions and raised awareness for science literacy.  We explained what iGEM is and how the program is beneficial to not only undergrads, but to everyone on the planet!
Careers/Ethics
The overall effort of this outreach was to address the general public’s concerns about the risk and benefits of synthetic biology. As a team we wanted to reach out and show that synthetic biology is a science that is helping to improve global quality of life not endanger it.
Assemble your Biobrick!
In an effort to bring synthetic biology/iGEM awareness to the public, the GSU-iGEM team, along with the GSU Synthetic Biology Club, developed a game that we could play with children and adults alike using Legos to demonstrate a standard, working iGEM construct.  This involved lots of hours developing a game that was simple yet informative.  We also spent a good chunk of time sorting upwards of 12000 Lego Bricks!
Legos were the obvious choice because, well, who doesn’t love Legos?  It also mimics the iGEM standardized cloning sites in physical form.  We created a key to help our new friends build their own BioBrick construct for a yeast or a bacterial cell.  We had a lot of fun.  It generated lots of questions from the kids and their parents.  I think we really helped them understand how we work in the lab better with this demonstration.  The hands-on aspect of it really aided in cementing the process into their heads (and ours too)."

DIY Classroom
a) Making a leaf vein bookmark
Based on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first course called “Making a leaf vein bookmark”. Through the process of making vein bookmarks, the children can easily learn about cellulose which leads to the toughness of leaf veins.
b) Making cell model with plasticine
The second course we set up is called “Making cell model with plasticine”. We introduced the cell model to children simply and took them to make cell models with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy to learn the structure of cell today.
Exploring the micro world
After finishing the course of “Making cell model with plasticine”, we led the children to observe the real cells with microscopes. We also offered different types of slices, inviting them to operate the microscope and introduced related knowledge to them.
“Cellulose Go” Stage Play
We have adapted our project “Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli” into a stage play called “Cellulose Go” to explain our project. In the play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warriors from UESTC take their plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
It was a play that combined knowledge and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out laughing. We also set some questions after our play to see whether children have learned something from it. We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the right answer of “Why butanol is harmful to bacterial” but also explained her choice perfectly with the plot in our play.
We also collected their opinions to our project this year in the form of questionnaire and talks. Most of them express their expectation of our project.
“It is a very good work. I believe it will make some changes.”
“It brings me about a completely new understanding of synthetic biology. We have never thought that we can realize such a thing through it.”
Gene Card
We invited children to play Gene Card. Children had fun and learned synthetic biology’s basic process and tools in the game. Gene card successfully provoked their interest to synthetic biology.
Learning about iGEM
We have designed several posters about iGEM and Synthetic Biology for exhibition, introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing"
Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," patient.
Just in early October, we received an official phone call from National Health Commission , answering our concerns in the e-mail. Its official firmly declared, till now, no institute or enterprise is permitted to apply a clinical treatment with cellular immunotherapy, while several clinical trials have been approved.    Through our research on policies in the field of cellular immunotherapy in China, we discovered that the attitude of government is quite vague. For years, regulations concerned have swung chaotically from encouraging drug-innovation to strengthening supervision. Yao, an expert in law of health, showed his worries towards the lack of a special committee responsible for cellular immunotherapy. He analyzed the deriving history of regulations concerned, optimistic about its application prospects in China. It would be a good idea to have an outline of the current ethical and political situation in China, he suggested.
Begin Reading
In this paper, we discussed current ethical and political problems in the field of cellular immunotherapy, comparing regulations concerned in China with the ones in other developed countries. It is important for people in the field to be aware that only with refined legal system and ethical instructions can this advanced therapy truly work. This kind of insight into thinking about national conditions and the function of interdisciplinary communication was essential to our project design and execution.
Integrated Human Practice
Introduction
Through our Bench-to-Bed approach, we take every effort to make our STEP system perfect and responsible for the world, involving experts in different field into our project. Initially, it was created for cellular immunotherapy. After contacting pathologists and experts from pharmaceutical industry, we paid close attention to cancer treatment. Under the conduction from Prof. Huang and other computational biology experts, we intensify our modeling and develop a distinct and persuasive model on molecular interaction and system output. What’s more, response from ethicists, jurists, hospital administrators and National Health Commission helped us add ethical and juristic considerations to our STEP system, leading to a paper investigating the major interest of cellular immunotherapy in China. An Oncologist responsible for clinical trials of immunotherapy also provided a precious view on our target identification in anti-tumor molecule work. Professionals from Shanghai iDrug Center and pharmaceutical industry proved the application prospects of STEP.    To clarify the integration of our Human Pracitces through every step of our project, an outline flowchart was made. Check it below~

Bringing synthetic biology to the people.
Purpose.
One of the major concerns we want to address with our project is that a number of schools and organizations lack access to tools that are crucial to conducting synthetic biology experiments. The main reason we chose to build a fluorimeter is that we felt there was no affordable way of effectively read common biological reporters. This severely limits the parts and circuits that underfunded teams can build and characterize, ultimately stunting the growth of iGEM and in turn synthetic biology. We were strongly influenced by the maker movement, which attempts to bring large manufacturing to the small scale.
Outreach.
As a part of our outreach, we were able to work with Dr. Andre Samuel of the Citizen Science Lab and learn how he is bringing scientific research to a broader demographic within Pittsburgh. We contributed to his efforts by donating sample of our luciferases so that he and his students could use it in their lessons and labwork. In addition, we presented our project to Allderdice High School's pre-Engineering classes in order to facilitate an understanding and interest in the possibilities of synthetic biology.
Protocol Cards.
We also created instructional protocol cards detailing our protein purification protocol in a simple and concise way."

The Faculty Mentors
Dr. Danny Ducat's lab focuses upon the cell physiology and metabolism of cyanobacteria, with the goal of eventually harnessing the photosynthetic capabilities of these microbes towards sustainable biotechnologies. In his free time, you can find him chucking dice over his latest board game acquisition, digging up his garden, or spending time with his miniature schnauzer.
Dr. Bjoern Hamberger's lab focuses on Plant Synthetic Biology, understanding how plants produce their complex array of specialized metabolites. For the plants, these compounds are important for interaction with the environment and communication, but for humans, they are valuable for a broad range of applications, such as flavors, fragrances and medical activities. His team transfers the plant pathways into biotechnological hosts and engineers those for biosustainable production.
Dr. Michaela TerAvest's lab works on understanding electron flows in bacterial metabolism with the ultimate goal of engineering bacteria to produce fuels directly from electricity and carbon dioxide. She's been involved with iGEM teams since 2012 when she advised the Cornell University team on creating a bioelectrochemical arsenic sensor using electricity-generating bacteria.

Human Applications
A problem that the iGEM team had from the inception of our project was deciding how we could practically apply our system in a real-world setting. Logically, we looked for positions in the body where bacteria already live cooperatively with the body. Our research took us to the microbiome of the human digestive tract, where bacteria located in the gut facilitate digestion. This region appeared to present a strong possibility for the in vivo application of our system, as we could manipulate the gut microbiome to create an environment where our system could live symbiotically with other microorganisms in the human digestive tract.
Our manipulation of the microbiome would work in a manner similar to fecal transplants performed in patients suffering from infections of Clostridium difficile1. C. difficile often presents in patients who have previously been treated with an antibiotic regime that imbalances the gut microbiome and causes a condition of severe diarrhea and colon inflammation. C. difficile is difficult to treat with antibiotics, but fecal transplants help to restore a healthy gut microbiome in patients by exposing it to the healthy microbiome of a donor2. We imagined that our project could be implemented in a similar manner. Placing our therapeutic system in the gut would subject it to conditions where it can optimally function. In order for the system to work, the therapeutic E. coli must be placed in an area where it can sense changes in glucose. Additionally, placement in the gut would allow the therapeutic bacteria to be in close proximity to SGLT1 and SGLT2 channels found in the intestines. From here, the tripeptide drug, QSP, will inhibit the ability of SGLT1 and SGLT2 to absorb some portion of glucose into the bloodstream after meal times.
After talking about our project with the public, and learning their reactions, we realized that procedures seem more acceptable in the laboratory than when proposed as a future treatment method to potential patients. Specifically, in a series of debates we held at our local Maker Faire and the New York Hall of Science, we were confronted with some in the public who felt that synthetic biology isn’t natural based on claims that it goes against everything from natural selection to religion. These discussion made us realize that it is important to take patient’s wishes and expectations into account when developing a treatment idea. To learn more about patient expectations and"

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Introduction to GA
What's GA
Genetic algorithms are powerful methods for complex optimization problems. They are essentially evolution in a computer. A population of GA population random candidate solutions is generated and scored. These solutions are allowed to mate with each other, generating offspring that are hybrids of both parental solutions. The mating frequencies are related to a boltzmann-like probability term; akin to simulated annealing, the simulation temperature required for calculating these is high early in the run, and cools down. Since the mating probability for a given candidate solution is related to its score, better solutions mate more frequently, making their components more numerous in the offspring. This new population of candidate solutions is scored, ranked, and allowed to mate.
Why GA?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to identify the topology of the network. A rate term can be described as two parts: signal and function type. The former usually indicates the positive and negative interaction from reactants to products which strongly correlate with the SBGN entity relationship diagram. The later reflects the biochemical reaction type. GA searches an optimized solution by mimicking the process of evolution. Members of an initial population compete for the privilege to mate and produce offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by"

Policy and Practices
Without effective communication and collaboration between scientists and the general public, all of the efforts we make in the laboratory are potentially useless.  In an age where there is so much distrust and misinformation about scientific research, we must double our efforts to educate, collaborate and listen to what the general public has to say about the state of scientific research.
Throughout the policy and practices portion of the iGEM project, we have gained a tremendous about of insight into the public's knowledge and concerns about synthetic biology.  We have sought to educate as many people as possible about our project, synthetic biology in general and the amazing potential of re-engineered genetic engineering.
Our policy and practices project is divided into four sections: ""Research"", ""Change"", ""Outreach"", and ""Entertainment"". In the ""Research"" and ""Change"" sections we gathered information and data from the public and from experts in science, medicine and policy analysis so that we could inform ourselves about ALL aspects of our project not just experiments in the lab.  Since our project is a health and medicine project,"

Building Block Synthesis
Our general method of building block synthesis based on overlap extension PCR is an efficient and inexpensive way to construct Building Blocks. Building Blocks are assembled by overlap assembly PCR from standard 5’-OH, 3’-OH 60-80 base pair oligonucleotides purchased from a DNA synthesis company. The overlap extension assembly process is broken into two polymerase chain reactions:
""Templateless"" PCR- Oligos are mixed and standard overlap extension assembly PCR program is utilized. Mixed length products are formed.
""Finish"" PCR - Outer two primers are mixed with the Templateless PCR product, such that a higher concentration of outer primer is present in the mixture, and a second round of PCR is completed to enrich for full length products
Cloning - Finish PCR product is cloned using PGEM-T easy vector, taking advantage of Taq polymerase single 3’ adenylation.
Sequence verification - Sequencing is completed by outside sources and sequence alignment using programs such as “CloneQC” aids with correct clone verification
Templateless/Finish PCR assembly trouble-shooting
PCR program conditions can be altered to optimize construction of Building Blocks. Varying the anneal and extension temperature MAY assist in the production f the Building Block
The Ligation Chain Reaction (LCR)
an alternative procedure that produces a more specific overlap between two strands which eliminates the gaps between DNA strands altogether. In other words, most overlapping oligonucleotides will now have a region of around 35bp in which they complement each other. By using ungapped strands of DNA, the Taq DNA Ligase enzyme will be used to string the DNA backbone together.
Like a normal PCR, the cycling process produces large quantities of feasible DNA Building Block. One important theoretical advantage is the extensive overlapping of complementary DNA that occurs during the annealing process. With the LCR, it is more likely for oligonucleotides to anneal correctly and result in a final product of the correct sequence. The LCR would also reduce the likelihood of problems involved with loxP sites and other anomalies found in the normal TPCR and FPCR protocols. However, the LCR should be emphasized as an alternative to the current methods due to the expensive enzymes"

During our telephone conversation, he briefly introduced the work done by him and his company – scaling carbon emission for private sectors, planning low emission strategies for them, verifying new technologies fighting global warming. And their ultimate goal was the same as ours – stopping global warming. To help us gain insight into China’s policies, regulations, and technologies about climate changes, Zhao introduced ideas of carbon emission quota implemented in different provinces and carbon trading among governments and private sectors. From our conversation, we learnt that our nation has been carefully handling the issue yet stayed mainly on the level of reducing emission. Stating that commercially viable gadgets haven’t yet emerged in the market, Zhao sincerely hoped our project could come together in the end and join the force fight global warming.
Distinguished Scholars & researchers
Dr. Jindong Zhao, Academician of Chinese Academy of Science and professor of Peking University, as well as his assistant, Dr. Tao Lee, associate professor of Peking University We were extremely lucky to get in contact, through emails, with our nation’s leading phycology specialist, who discussed the prospects of our projects with us. He wrote that our work was tremendously meaningful yet challenging in many aspects. Also, he shared with us some parts of his ongoing researches to give enlightenment. Besides giving us his encouraging words and sharing knowledge about algae, he also shared his own thoughts about experiments and researches – to take a little detour when facing seemingly insurmountable difficulties. It was this very idea that helped us to test our metal-binding plasmids in E. coli when we were having trouble to transfer them into algae, which later produced promising results.
Dr. Xiaoling Miao, professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University
We were also very fortunate to contact Xiaoling Miao, a professor whose academic interest focuses on using algae to fix CO2. She was surprised on hearing that we were genetically modify algae to enhance photosynthesis efficiency. Her sharing on characteristics of algae greatly helped us narrow the search for our algae candidates. Also, she was so warmhearted that she instructed one of her students, Yi Gong (Ph.D candidate), to help us in laboratory when we reached out to her.
Dr. Chang Cui, advanced researcher at Jiangsu Clinical Medicine Research Institution In the process of our project, we were lucky to have a conversation with an advanced researcher, Chang Cui, from Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, who does similar work in manipulation at cell level.

JT: There are two main anti-fouling methods currently in use. One is application of a particularly slippery paint, to make the surface mirror-like, so that organisms can't attach to the hull in the first place. However, this paint is very expensive, and application must be done in very specific conditions, like a specific temperature of water, and so on. However, if ships remain immobile, the slipperiness of the paint is not enough to prevent biofouling. And it would be nearly impossible for us to run a shipping company if the ships never docked for unloading. Ships will have to stop eventually, so this method is not completely effective. Also, any damages to the surface, for example from bumping into something while docking the ship, will render the slippery properties useless.
Furthermore, this mirror-like surface, while it can prevent barnacles from attaching, cannot escape things like slime.
Another anti-fouling mechanism is through the use of biocides, which kill organisms like barnacles, but these will also kill other marine organisms so they are not environmentally-friendly. Tin was once the standard biocide, but the industry has since moved to copper, which is supposed to be less harmful to the environment somehow.
These biocides are incorporated into a type of paint that will fall off the ship when the ship moves at a certain speed, so any barnacles that have somehow adhered will fall off. One problem is that even if the organisms are killed by the biocides, a process that requires a certain amount of time, their shells may still stick to the ship so the paint- falling-off process is necessary. Then this paint will fall and remain in the ocean, killing other organisms.
CR: What are some other methods for preventing biofouling that are currently being explored?
JT: Some people have proposed regular polishing of the hull to work quickly and prevent heavy buildup of barnacles, but this is both time-consuming and expensive. Although anti-fouling measures are necessary, we can't forget that shipping is the main service, and too much cleaning may not be profitable.
A strategy not yet on the market, still undergoing research, is using a paint that signals to the barnacles that it is attaching to something not stable, like water, so that it will not try to adhere to the hull. However, it is uncertain how this would apply to things like slime and algae.
CR: Yale iGEM is currently trying to produce an anti-microbial protein that could be used in the field of anti-fouling. What are some things we should consider"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#11 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," with lower steam temperatures, and thus lower the input energy necessary to get anything out of the process.
Alternatively, we could design bacteria that can effectively crack longer carbon chains. This would held circumvent the energy expenditure required to bring the bitumen up to a high heat and pressure that are currently employed in the cracking process.
Mining versus SAGD. Different technologies are more appropriate for different environments: the former is useful when the oil sands are close to the surface; the latter is more suited to sands that are too deep to be mined safely. Mining is advantageous because up to 95% of the bitumen trapped in the sands can be extracted for use. SAGD looks better because although the extraction efficiency is much lower, the surrounding land doesn’t look as scorched. Nevertheless, a day of production at the Cold Lake site uses as much input energy as the entire city of Edmonton in that time! Moreover, SAGD only extracts 65% of the bitumen that is actually present. From what we were told, the rest remains trapped in the sand pores and could be later extracted with different technologies, but that would entail re-drilling the well, re-clearing the reclaimed land and re-setting up the equipment for the well – each of which require time, money and energy.
Bacteria that can survive the steam treatment and extract some of the remaining 35% of the bitumen that SAGD technology misses will enable us to gain more output energy for a similar amount of input and thus increase the efficiency of the process.
Reclamation. Syncrude and Suncor both proudly displayed their reclaimed land and seemingly-flourishing ecosystems on earth that was once scorched. As mentioned yesterday, these efforts are admirable. I was particularly impressed by how they recruit people specifically to further their reclamation efforts. Again, however, we don’t know what the long-term effects of the former excavation site will be – say, whether tar ponds leach chemicals into the environment a generation down the road, or whether the reclaimed land better supports the survival of species that should not ordinarily flourish there, or the list goes on. Note that the latter point is not necessarily negative, but it remains unknown.
There would be great value in developing bacteria that can digest harmful residual chemicals of the well site and release waste products that will not devastate the local environment if they leach beyond their containment points in the future. Similarly, bacteria that can serve as an obvious indicator of whether or not certain chemicals are present (before plants start dying off) can warn us that something is amiss, and will allow us to react before serious problems occur in"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept1_-_-_TEXT.html,"acteria like Mycobacterium avium developed resistance strategies highly specific to foil the Immune system .
So, M. avium, facultative intracellular microorganism, has the capacity to infect some cells of the immune system like macrophages or dendritic cells, responsible for phagocytosis.
Infection generates phagocytosis death, and then we observe in the host a decrease of its non specific immunity, which permits to M. avium to persist in its host.
To fight against macrophages, M. avium inhibits phagolysosomes maturation, initially responsible of bacteria lysis. This mechanism paradigm is not already determined, but the principal hypothesis involves a cell wall glycolipid, the lipoarabinomannan.
To fight against dendritic cells, M. avium upsets cellular transduction signals by releasing some enzymes regulating the second messenger’s rate.
Indeed, M. avium has, in its genome, 12 genes containing classes III cyclase adenylate domains, the most important is Rv0386. This one facilitates the AMPc formation in macrophages. AMPc is a second messenger leading to the pro-inflammatory TNF-α cytokines synthesis.
But, at high concentration, TNF-α stops dendritic cells maturation and then the immune response sets off.
M. avium does not “fear anything” in front of the immune system, its elimination is low. It has the capacity to persist in the organism and therefore has more chance to attempt its target and to establish itself.
Back to top
Cell wall and tissue vector envelope
Mycobacterium capacity to resist to the immune system is essentially due to its wall and cellular envelope. These both present a complex structure and is specific to Mycobacterium.
Real breastplate, M. avium envelope is composed by several elements. Some, like soluble proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids are common to all bacteria.
On the other hand others, specific to M. avium, are the most interesting, like these three insoluble macromolecules:
- arabinogalactan,
- peptidoglycan,
- mycolic acid.
Together, these 3 constituents form the mycoylarabinogalactanpeptidoglycane (MAGP) heart of the cellular membrane. MAGP represents one of the two lipopolysaccharides (LPS) common to all mycobacteria, but M. avium possesses a second LPS: the lipoarabinomannan.

iGEM focuses on science, but also encompasses community outreach, communication, representation and last but not least, fun in the lab. All this is often communicated best with visual impressions. Several team wikis feature great photos, but some of them are hard to find. Therefore, we thought it would be best to bundle them and highlight the best ones to maximize impact. This is why we started an iGEM photo-contest: The Cuckoo Clock Competition. As the name implies, the first prize is an original Cuckoo Clock typical for the gorgeous Black Forest surrounding Freiburg. All teams are cordially invited to participate! Please send your pictures of choice representing your team, project, spirit or fun in the lab along with a short description to our e-mail address:     igem.freiburg.2010@googlemail.com
Your pictures will be uploaded to the competition webpage as soon as we get them. In addition, we will send you a participation badge for your team wiki. A judging committee consisting of members from three different iGEM teams will vote for the winner picture.  The team with the best picture will receive our amazing Cuckoo Clock in Boston at the socializing event on Sunday. So put your stressful projects aside for a few minutes and take the fun part!
Looking forward to meeting you in Boston.

We have successfully talked to microorganisms. Yeast cultures already talk to us when they are hungry ( neat and marked fluorescence is emitted when there is no glucose in the medium). Taking into account the relevance of yeasts in fermentative processes of the alimentary industry, these results open up new possibilities in the application of our talking yeasts in the control and monitorization of that kind of processes. Moreover, we achieved true dialogues with E. coli. All our biobricks worked as expected in E. coli, and allowed it to answer the following questions: “Are you hot?” (thermal shock sensitivity); “Are you hungry?” (glucose); “Do you have enough nitrogen?” ; and “Can you breathe?” . We did so by encoding the questions into light wavelenghths that excite reporter proteins, which were cloned under the control of environment-sensitive promoters. Emitted light pulses were encoded back into the answers “I am cool”, “I am hungry”, etc. We could even make E. coli obey our orders by encoding the “Express your gene” sentence into a promoter-activation wavelength.
We submitted seven biobricks to the registry and fulfilled all other requirements listed at the judging form. Most of our constructions did also work on another bacterial species, Citrobacter freundii: We collaborated with the Edimburg iGEM team sending them our bacterial biobricks (BBa_K763000, BBa_K763001, BBa_K763002, BBa_K763003 & BBa_K763004).

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," world and the world affects our project design, we did a series of surveys with School’s students, teachers and staffs, as well as team members’ friends and parents, and also for the public in using online Google forms. Totally more than 900 people participated in this survey. The graphs in the following are the results sorted into different genders and ages. In this survey, we wanted to see what people of different ages and of different genders prefer their sugar intake to be, what people will do to burn off the calories after drinking a bottle of Coke, and whether people like the idea of our genetically engineered product eating away the excess sugar. And also, we want to know how much do the public welcome our design and the engineered product.
- Conclusion -
We can see the survey shows that doesn’t intake of carbonated beverages of the female population is twice the male population, and, as people age, their preference of sugar is reduced. In this survey we can see that women take their health more seriously than men, and that men need more energy for their hard labor. Children are usually hyperactive and need a lot of energy, so we can see that children and younger people under the age of 18 have the highest consumption of sugar, but the older the person, the less energy is needed, so their consumption of sugar is lower than children.
In the second part, we asked them what exercise would they do to burn off all the calories from a 500mL Cola. Most of them chose to jog for 30 minutes or ride a bike for an hour. After some research, we found out people would have to walk for two days without sleep to burn all those calories. However, due to the fact that we only have 24 hours in a day, and that we are sleeping ¼ of the 24 hours, we don’t have much extra time to exercise and burn off the calories. We concluded the survey by asking them that if they could have a probiotic that absorbs the sugar taken in, so they wouldn’t have to worry about their health, would they take it? 76 percent of people said that they would take the probiotic. We can see that people would prefer to use our solution than to take the time to exercise.
According to research, in 2015, about 7 in 10 adults suffer the problem of being overweight or even being obese, and it is predicted that this problem will become apparent in more adults in the near future. One of the major factors that leads to obesity is “sugar”, which is found in beverages, desserts, and almost any kind of food"

The difference between the first an the second measurement is the relative quantity of what has bound to the cellulose.
Cloning of the Cellulose Binding Domains
The cloning of the CBDs should fit to the cloning of our laccases, so the BioBricks were designed with a T7-promoter and the B0034 RBS to have a similar method of cultivation. After investigating the restriction-sites it was found, that at least for the characterization of the CBDs a quick in-frame assembly of the CBDs and a GFP would be possible, because neither the CBDs nor the GFP (<partinfo>I13522</partinfo>) of the Partsregistry inherits a AgeI- or NgoMIV-site, which makes Freiburg-assembly possible. To do so, primers for the constructs <partinfo>BBa_K863101</partinfo> (CBDcex(T7)), carrying the CBDcex domain from the C. fimi exoglucanase and <partinfo>BBa_K863111</partinfo> (CBDclos(T7)), carrying the CBDclos domain from the C.cellulovorans binding protein were designed. The protein-BLAST of the two CBDs gave an exact picture of which bases belong to the binding domains and which do not. To be sure not to disturb the folding anyway 6 to 12 bases up and downstream of the domains as conserved sequences were kept. Even if the CBDcex is an C-terminal domain both domains were made N-terminal, so the BioBricks can carry all regulatory parts and the linked protein can easily be exchanged. This would also be nice for other people using this part.

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," lots of         enzymes and toxic intermediate, the nitrate and nitrite respiration [1] and nitrogen assimilation pathway in E. coli [2] fit our goal instead.
According to the literature on nitrate and nitrite respiration, we decided to take advantage of nitrate reductase (NaR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) to convert nitrate to ammonia. Surprisingly, both pathways can be found in E. coli; hence,         we take E. coli as the primary host. In nitrogen assimilation pathway, ammonium can be converted to glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and further to glutamine by glutamine synthetase (GS). In these pathways, intermediates of the         metabolic pathway are not toxic to the host, E. coli. Moreover, nitrate ion can be successfully transformed into glutamine, an important and valuable amino acid.
Nitrate Assimilation Process
From nitrate to nitrite
In E. coli, there are two ways to catalyze the nitrate to ammonium. One is in the periplasm and the other is in the cytoplasm. Based on our project, we want to capture the nitrate in the waters and change it to other product inside the         cytoplasm. As a result, we use the nitrate and nitrite reductase to convert the nitrate to ammonia. At first, we want to use the nar cluster in Pseudonomas, because the activity is much more than the E. coli. We divided the nar cluster into three parts and took it for IDT synthesis. However, due to too high GC content of one-part sequence, it failed to synthesize. Therefore, we are looking for another solution, in which original nar cluster existed         in the wild type E. coli MG1655 had been used in our project.
Figure 1. The arrangement of nar cluster in the genome
From nitrite to ammonia
Furthermore, we take advantage of the gene nirBD which encodes the sequence of nitrite reductase to convert nitrite into ammonia. Both two gene are NADH-dependent. The reaction formula shows below:
nitrite + 3 NADH + 5 H+ → ammonium + 3 NAD+ + 2 H2O
According to the data from Brenda database, the specific activity of nitrite reductase is just 0.052 µmol/min/mg in E. coli. We want to amplify the amount of nitrite reductase in the cytoplasm. As a"
BIT,2017,Team:BIT#Model#Bioamplifer_-_-_TEXT.html,": the concentration of lysine from the upstream is higher , the rate of survival of lysine-deficient Escherichia coli is higher , the fluorescence intensity of GFP is greater . And this is also consistent with the original intention of the team members who design this line diagram. We proved the feasibility of this gene line.
2.The gene line which produce red fluorescent
Without considering the inhibitory effect of protein lacI on the promoter pLac, according to the gene map of the above chart, imitating the green fluorescence generation process, we can get the expression, transcription and degradation of the following genes. Among them, k3 is the producing rate of mRNARFP, k-3 is the degrading rate of mRNARFP, k4 is the producing rate of proteinRFP , k-4 is the degrading rate of proteinRFP:
The expression formula of promoter activity was constructed by Hill equation. β2 is the maximum starting ability of the promoter (generally set to 1), M2 is the amount of leakage of the promoter, S is the amount of regulation factor, kd is the S value when the model change trend is changed:
Finally, according to the differential equation to express the expression, transcription and degradation process of the whole gene line:
From these differential equations, theoretically, the RFP expression rate is approximately the same as the expression rate of GFP, regardless of the effect of protein lacI on the expression of the promoter pLac. While taking the inhibition of protein lacI on the promoter pLac into account, from these differential equations, combining the gene line of the whole expression group,we can get the model of green fluorescent protein expression and get the conclusion: the concentration of lysine from the upstream is higher , the rate of survival of lysine-deficient Escherichia coli is higher , compared with GFP ,the fluorescence intensity of GFP is lower. And this is also consistent with the original intention of the team members who design this line diagram. We proved the feasibility of this gene line.
The following was the initial value of each dependent variable in the model.
Through the modeling of the first part, we could verify the feasibility of the gene line of the expression group and verify that the dual fluorescence system can really play the role of mathematical amplification in theoretically.

We introduced a gain factor, Fg, which could be used to quantify the change in fluorescence.

Step 4 – Selecting a Colony: Select a clear, isolated colony and using an inoculation hoop scoop up a colony onto the tip. Deposit in the falcon tube
Step 5 - Culture: Culture your falcon tubes overnight at a temperature of 37 oC. Leave for no longer than 16 hours.
Friday 3.8.12
Aim:Check the results of colony picking.
Results: There was growth. Next we can proceed to run a gel and a nanodrop to detect the presence of the correct bands, and whether we have a useable concentration.
Thursday 2.8.12
Aim - Transformation of alternative BioBricks: We have colony picked the BBa_J23119 constitutive promoter and the BBa_B0034 Ribosome Binding Site twice (Expt 6.3 & Expt 7,3), and gained a reasonable plasmid concentration. However the concentration was not high enough to be able to detect the product on the gel. This concerns us, because although we have detected the correct plasmid backbone, we are worried that we lack evidence that the transformation was successful. One option is to attempt several other BioBricks with the same function, in order to increase the chances of generating a product on the gel - and confirming that we definitely have a BioBricks with the required function.It would also increase the chance of generating successful ligations if we can reach a higher concentration of plasmid. We will also be reattempting the transformation of BBa_I750016 which failed several attempts at colony picking.
Method:
Transformation Protocol 1
Step 1 - Addition of BioBrick: To the still frozen competent cells, add 1 - 5 µL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube.
Step 4 - Incubation: Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 45 minutes.
Step 5 - Heat Shock: Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes.
Step 6 - Incubation: Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Step 7 - Add media: Add 1.5ml of Lysogeny Broth and transfer to a falcon tube.
Step 8 - Incubation: Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 1 hour at RPM 550"
Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Sequence_-_-_TEXT.html,"ed confirmation. Another utilizes alkaline denaturing electrophoresis to separate the DNA into single strands, which then can be assayed for fragmentation, which appears as long smears on a gel. We have also considered approaches that utilize S1 Nuclease to convert single strand breaks into double strand breaks.
Irradiated DNA Lesion Experiments
Our first set of experiments involved pairing alkaline denaturing electrophoresis with the repair enzyme T4 Pyrimidine Dimer Glycosylase (T4 PDG) to reveal whether or sequences with UV mutation sites removed actually exhibit greater resistance to damage by UV irradiation. Because our protocol was highly adapted from a number of sources, we first had to demonstrate the assay produced consistent results under controlled conditions. A large amount of troubleshooting was necessary to optimize both the conditions of enzymatic processing, alkaline denaturation of the DNA samples, running conditions for the alkaline gel, and neutralization and staining conditions for generating images.
After considerable modifications, we managed to develop a protocol that consistantly 1. Shows little or no fragmented DNA with samples that are not irradiated and not processed with enzyme 2. Has no significant difference between unirradiated and unprocessed control samples and samples that are either irradiated without enzymatic processing or enzymatically processed without irradiation 3. Is responsive to dosage, meaning samples with greater irradiation show greater fragmentation
As the images and quantification above demonstrate, our final protocol satisfies all of these conditions, thus establishing it as a effective method for quantifying UV-induced DNA damage. The linearity seen in response to increasing UV dosage further allows us to state that differences in measured fragmentations between control and mutation-optimized RFP reflect reductions in mutagenic lesions that are equivalently linear. By that logic, an optimized sequence that produces a ten percent reduction in fragmentation intensity relative to control should have ten percent fewer mutagenic lesions than the control.
During our early experiments we used a UV-mutation optimized sequence, labeled RFPyy, with 12% of its UV mutation sites eliminated. Quantification of RFPyy's rate of fragmentation relative to the E1010 RFP control sequence revealed a trending to significant decrease in UV-induced fragmentation on the mutation optimized sequence (two-sample t-test: n=7, t*two tailed=2.57, p=0.13). The results are depicted graphically as bar graphs with standard error bars, alongside dot plots of raw data. For each data point, the ""background"" seen in the no enzyme negative control lane was subtracted from the fragmentation smear intensity"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Gibson et al (2009) . A gentle introduction was written by the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team, and is found here .
We sequenced a colony with the correct phenotype, as well as others with incorrect phenotypes:
Colony ""gby"" [blue, yellow] - expected scar is missing at approx base 680 of the forward chromatogram. Also, the spacer ends with ATG and the part starts with ATG, but only one ATG is seen. In total 9 bases are missing. There is homology of ""tatgg"" at both ends of the deleted fragment. There is a point mutation at approx base 500 of the forward chromatogram.
Colony ""gb"" [blue] - there is a deletion of about 80 bases at approx base 700 of the chromatogram. This has been caused by homology of a ""gggcgagg"" found at both ends of the deleted sequence. The 9 bases mentioned for gby are also missing.
Colony ""gwy"" [yellow] - seems correct except for a point mutation in the reverse chromatogram. The mutation is synonymous (ctg -> ttg). There's no clear reason why the colony wasn't blue.
Lessons learned: bits of homology, even quite small, can cause problems with this method.
BioSandwich with Overlap Extension PCR
Overlap Extension PCR can be performed using spoligos as primers. The extension time should be calculated from the entire product size. The final product will not be circular, so can be run on a gel to test its length. Later, it will need to have its ends ligated.
This method produces many correct colonies, although it also produces many incorrect colonies.
[For our tests, different primers were used and spacer2 was not needed.]
Colony ""bby"" [blue, yellow] - correct sequence.
Colony ""bb"" [blue] - has a massive deletion (several hundred bases) in the EYFP gene after about 60 bases. There is partial homology between the start and end of the deletion: ""tggtcgagctggac"" vs ""tggacgagctgtac"".
Colony ""bw"" [plain] - has spacerT7 joined to spacer1, and the same massive deletion as bb.
Again homology seems to be an issue. Parts joining randomly (in bw) is worrying.
BioSandwich with Ligation Independent Cloning
In our experience, this method has been only weakly successful. We have seen one correct colony in several attempts.

About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta and the largest in Canada between Vancouver and Toronto. The city is best known for ecotourism and winter sports. Winter sports attract many people to the nearby regions of Lake Louise, Banff, and Canmore, situated in the Rocky Mountain region west of Calgary. Calgary is also home of the Calgary Flames, our National Hockey League (NHL) team. Because of its strong agricultural and ranching history, Calgary has sometimes been deemed “Cowtown”, a nickname that is celebrated every summer during the world-famous Calgary Stampede.

Market Strategy
To attract customers, Synbiologica will initially donate and sell units at a low price to researchers to try and break into the research market. Additionally, representatives from our company will attend scientific conferences of related fields with the intention of soliciting our product to potential customers whose research would benefit from BEAR. Advertisements on scientific journal websites and in scientific journals will also be used to advertise our product.
The majority of BEAR’s initial market value will stem from the research conducted by Synbiologica’s first customers who have incorporated BEAR into their methods. BEAR is designed to yield fast, accurate, real-time results, which is a form of data collection that has not yet been used in hormone research. As researchers begin to acquire results using BEAR, they will publish more scientific papers and advertise BEAR through a description of their methodology.
Eventually, Synbiologica hopes to license out the finalized BEAR product to existing biotechnology companies. This would allow us the ability to develop other technologies rather than just mass-producing one product, and the biotechnology companies would have more financial backing to promote BEAR as well as the resources to manufacture the device of a large scale. In addition, these companies already have employees with the skills to manufacture, market, and sell BEAR. We intend to sell a licence to our technology to these companies and they will be responsible for getting BEAR to its final customers.
Our pricing policy would be penetration pricing. Synbiologica intends to sell individual BEAR units and the accompanying set of modular units for as low a cost as possible to establish the benefits and use of BEAR in the scientific and medical community, thus gaining market share.
Initial distribution of BEAR will be very small while Synbiologica is still in the research and development phase and can be achieved by mail or courier. As the product gains market value, Synbiologica will contract a distribution company"

Summary
Our project is aim to construct a plasmid with formaldehyde detection, color display, and formaldehyde degradation on an existing basis. There are two strategies for formaldehyde detection (HxlR and frmR), and also two strategies for formaldehyde degradation (PADH+FDH and FDM). Therefore, there are four possible choices for the combinations.
1. BBa_K2890006: HxlR + eRFP + FDM
The sequence is composed of formaldehyde promoter HxlR (BBa_K1334002), gene RFP, and formaldehyde degrading gene FDM (optimized FDM gene BBa_K2890003).
 
Figure 1 Composition of part BBa_K2890006.
When the pathway works, we can see the E.coli turns to red with naked eyes at the presence of formaldehyde. Then FDM gene will be further expressed to biodegrade formaldehyde.
2. BBa_K2890005: HxlR+PADH+FDH
The sequence is composed of formaldehyde promoter HxlR (BBa_K1334002), gene RFP, and formaldehyde degrading gene PADH+FDH (BBa_K2890002).
 
Figure 2 Composition of part BBa_K2890005.
3. BBa_K2890007: frmR+eRFP+PADH+FDH
The sequence is composed of formaldehyde promoter frmR (BBa_K2890001), eRFP (BBa_K1357010) and PADH+FDH (BBa_K2890002).
This part was successfully constructed, but did not work as we expected.

Viscosity of water is 1.002cP at 20°C

At present the medium being used by the lab is still be discussed. Currently though the medium most resembles water and therefore the water's viscosity value can be used. This allows us to assume that the medium is Newtonian (dilute aqueous medium that doesn’t contain long unbranched molecules such as methylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Note that methlycellulose does not alter the run and tumble statistics, only bundle and motor rotation rates are affected by the addition of methylcellulose). If agar were to be used then the medium would be Non-Newtonian. Even though it would be Non- Newtonian John Hogan in passing said that we could assume it is Newtonian.

The “X-Median” seen on the three tables above shows the fluorescence intensity of all of the cells that were counted that were not considered dead (Median).  Each sample measured 50,000 cells (Seen under All Events - Count), and then counted all of the cells that were alive (Median - Count), where each sample had between 47,000 and 49,000 live cells. From the data, and as illustrated in the graphs above, we can gather that the fluorescence intensity (X-Median) of the LB only cells was approximately 63 arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU), the IPTG-negative cells was ~17,000 AFU, and the intensity of the IPTG-positive cells was ~107,000 AFU, meaning that the IPTG-positive quorum sensing cells increased fluorescence intensity over 6X the background intensity (IPTG-negative cells). These results indicate that our quorum sensing construct works and greatly increases GFP expression when activated through IPTG-induction. The IPTG-negative cells also expressed some non-negligible degree of GFP, which suggests that the construct could still be improved further. However, the successful proof of concept of our quorum sensing construct is incredibly promising and allows us to proceed toward the next step.
Since we know that the quorum sensing construct is functional and inducible with IPTG. We can now work towards replacing the GFP gene with the genes for our degradation enzymes, allowing us to control degradation by applying IPTG at different time points.
In conjunction with working on controlling the initiation of degradation, we simultaneously worked with our two degradation enzymes, esterase and cellulase. After successfully transforming the esterase gene into E. coli, and confirming via colony PCR, we grew up a large culture of transformed cells and used this to extract and purify the esterase protein.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," observed when the off-promoter regions, specifically on the non-coding strand, are targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression, each reflecting a different physical mechanism that allows leaky YFP expression. In the first mechanism, RNA polymerase is sometimes able to cleave the bound dCas9-sgRNA complex from the DNA. In the second mechanism, the complex binds inefficiently and is sometimes separated from the DNA, permitting transcription to continue.
We assumed that the incomplete repression is accounted for by the first mechanism. This assumption was based on several studies
showing radically different repression rates if the complex targets the promoter, preventing transcription initiation, rather than targeting the DNA further downstream and impeding transcription elongation. The differences in the system behaviour depending on whether or not RNA polymerase has the opportunity to bind suggest that the ""cleavage"" mechanism may more closely resemble the chemical reality.
Consequently, we modelled incomplete repression using a leaky expression term proportional to the expected YFP expression when the complex is saturated. The differential equation model was updated with the following term: When the concentration of the complex is zero, YFP mRNA is produced at the rate expected from the unrepressed sarA promoter. At a large concentration of the complex, the YFP mRNA is produced at only 60% of the possible rate from sarA.
Parameter Search and Fitting
We turned to the literature to find parameters for our model. We first looked for exact parameter values in S. aureus. If these could not be found, we next looked for ways to to estimate the parameters using other available data for S. aureus and finally searched for the parameters in other gram-positive bacteria. Aggregating parameters from many experiments across the literature is by nature a somewhat uncertain endeavour, but those parameters about which we are very uncertain are marked with asterisks. A general rationale is given for each parameter, but details on the more circuitously estimated parameters are given after the table.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to treat BCWD. Our collaborations are detailed below.
Bath, New York State Hatchery
Background: Bath Fish Hatchery, established in 1893, uses fish obtained from Cayuga Lake to produce roughly 86,000 pounds of rainbow, brown and lake trout annually [1]. The hatchery has had a tumultuous history, including a 1955 fire that leveled the main production facility, but remains an essential component of the New York aquaculture industry. The work the hatchery does ensures that the New York State Finger Lakes are teeming with fish during the annual angling season.
Collaboration: Cornell iGEM first toured Bath Hatchery over the summer, during which we were able to gain a behind the scenes look at how fish are bred and treated. Bob Sweet, a long-time employee at Bath Hatchery, spoke to us about how he had once seen BCWD kill up to 1000 fish/day at the hatchery. Sweet also brought to our attention the lack of real-time fish tank monitoring systems at Bath Hatchery that could be used to prevent diseases like BCWD. This inspired the team to develop Heimdall such that fishPHARM could not only treat BCWD, but prevent it as well.
Kenneth Osika, a Fish Culturist at Bath Fish Hatchery received our prototype and gave us feedback related to the application of the device. His responded that, “This applicator was too large for [his current] fish this size [5 inches long].You might have more luck with a smaller applicator that will produce only a small puncture wound.” After receiving his feedback, dry lab is working on reducing the diameter of the applicator, which can be done by having the applicator fit more snugly around the tag and using less metal overall to produce a narrower applicator .
Rome, New York State Hatchery
Background: The Rome Hatchery, located in the eponymous town in New York, has served the region for more than 75 years [2]. The hatchery is one of the state’s largest, with total production of brook and brown trout in excess of 160,000 pounds [1]. The hatchery provides fish to over 350 bodies of water, all of which are open to the public for recreational fishing.
Collaboration: We have also been in contact with Rome Hatchery, which houses a fish pathology lab that researches fish diseases such as BCWD. Andy Noyes, a fish pathologist at Rome Hatchery, spoke extensively with us about the devastating effects of BCWD on-site.  He mentioned"
Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment facilities as well as in situ tailings pond treatment.
Background and Rationale
Oil reserves are found in many corners of the globe and all nations must address the challenges of (I) extraction, (II) refinement, and (III) managing the byproducts of these processes. The byproducts are stored in the form of tailings ponds where the water contains (1) toxic organic compounds such as naphthenic acids and catechol, (2) heavy metals, and (3) fine clay sediment1. The tailings ponds raise critical environmental issues as the water cannot be reused and is harmful to organisms. Traditional methods used for tailings pond remediation can take decades to complete with the first reclaimed tailings pond only being completed in September 2010 after 40 years2.  Our goal is to address the challenge of decreasing the time necessary for tailings ponds remediation by creating a tailings pond clean up (TPCU) kit that can be applied (A) directly to the ponds or (B) in a large-scale treatment facility.
Catechol as the entry point into Escherichia coli metabolism
To address the decontamination of (1) toxic organic compounds such as naphthene and catechol found in the tailings ponds, natural pathways that can break down the toxic chemicals can be utilized. The toxic organic compounds can be broken down into molecules that are metabolizable by all organisms, such as 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS)3. Catechol is a prime candidate to function as a hub for the funneling and subsequent degradation of other toxic compounds found in abundance, such as naphthene, anthracene, and fluorene into 2-HMS (Figure 1)3,4,5. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE) is found in Pseudomonas putida and hydrolyzes catechol into 2-HMS, which can enter the citric acid cycle6. In 2010, the Lethbridge iGEM team confirmed that xylE when introduce to E. coli hydrolyzes catechol to 2-HMS demonstrating and that this critical step can successfully be performed to convert toxic chemicals to metabolic intermediates7. XylE is inefficient on its own, especially in vitro, due to instability caused by oxygen sensitivity, and oxidation of the active site iron molecule during it’s functional cycle rendering the enzyme inactive8. It was demonstrated by the Lethbridge 2010 iGEM"

Overview
BioBrick Search is a novel BioBrick search tool with the aim of providing more efficiency and reliability in searching existing BioBrick parts.
This tool provides a search result page with detailed information and ordering based on popularity and reliability, a much-needed feature that the current search implementation at partsregistry.org and other conventional BioBrick search have not offered. The tool also features a sophisticated web-based interface that everyone can intuitively use on their browsers without installation.
We have already made this software available to the public in August 2012 and received several positive responses from users. You can try it out at our website!
Background
In deciding and carrying out iGEM projects, you are frequently faced with the task of searching BioBrick parts. Currently, partsregistry.org is the official and most comprehensive BioBrick database and most of iGEM participants use partsregistry.org to search for BioBrick parts.
Even though searching for BioBricks is such an essential process in iGEM, it has been quite a time-consuming and irritating process to some iGEM participants, partly because the search software is not very user-friendly.
Problems with the current partsregistry.org BioBrick search we identified include:
Search results are not ordered by reliability or relevance to the search query but by ID (e.g. BBa_K123456), which is not likely to help users find the BioBrick they need.
Information given for each BioBrick in the search result page is insufficient for users to judge whether the BioBrick suits their needs and thus users need to take the additional step of jumping to the wiki page for the specific BioBrick to find more detailed information.
We thought these problems severely compromise the usability of the partsregistry.org BioBrick search and so created a new search software, ""BioBrick Search"" that resolves these issues. In order to achieve an efficient and reliable search experience, our tool has the following features.
Easy-to-view, informative result list

The University of Guelph is a mid sized, comprehensive University that is generally regarded as Canada's agricultural university and outstanding in the field of life sciences. Our university motto is actually, ""Changing lives, improving life.""    Add the words, ""using synthetic biology"" to that motto and you've got a university which was made to participate in iGEM.
This is our first year in the event, and we hope that it will take root here, becoming a creative outlet for competitive students to prime themselves for jobs and careers in research and development to sustainably and profoundly help the world's biological science tackle problems of food, medicine, and material production that we face.
Initial funding for the team was provided for us by the Gordon Nixon Leadership Award, which was won by our iGEM superman Dave earlier this year. Subsequent partnerships and sponsors have given us products to work with (NEB and IDT), an operating budget (Departments of Plant Agriculture, Graduate Student Association, and Molecular Cellular Biology), and lab equipment and space (Dr. Manish Raizada). It has been hard to organize and bushwhack through a totally new realm, but we hope next year we'll get funding for paid positions and University recognized course credit to help ensure this adventure in synthetic biology will continue and benefit future groups of grad students and undergrads.

4. Targeted Sequencing with dxCas9-Tn5
We used Oxford Nanopore Technology as DNA sequencing platform for two reasons: no amplification of DNA required and the possibility of extremely long sequencing reads (examples show an average of > 100 kb) ( Jain et al, 2018 ). To prepare samples for sequencing, DNA molecules have to be ligated to DNA adapters containing a motor protein that will guide and control the diffusion of the molecule through each nanopore. Commercially available kits for library preparation make use of a transposase that randomly fragments DNA while adding these adapters ( Jain, Oslen, Paten and Akeson, 2016 ). We modified this step in library preparation to use our fusion protein (dxCas9-Tn5) instead, to direct this adapter integration specifically to a DNA target, as depicted in figure 12.
Figure 12. Schematic scheme of the targeted adapter integration for Nanopore Sequencing. The fusion protein Tn5-dxCas9 (A) finds and binds to a specific DNA target (with use of a sgRNA), (B) adds sequencing adapters at this specific site that (C) are ligated to a motor protein attached adapter to undergo (D) Nanopore sequencing.
We developed a model to generate suitable sgRNA sequences to catch all possible variations of gene doping, and we also designed and tested DNA adapters compatible with our fusion protein and ONT sequencing. We tested the directed integration of these sequencing adapters on EPO coding sequence DNA ( BBa_K2643004 ). Furthermore, we sequenced samples with ONT (MinION device) that simulate a gene doping scenario and developed software for data analysis to determine the use of gene doping.
4.1 Background Information
The rapid sequencing kit from ONT consists in two enzymatic steps to prepare DNA to be sequenced. Figure 13 represents the molecular principle behind library preparation of Rapid sequencing from ONT. The first step consists of an enzymatic fragmentation with transposase that integrates sequencing adapters (shown with a red box). These adapter sequences contain a motif that is later ligated to a second sequencing adapter that contains a motor protein (needed to assist DNA to difuse through the nanopore).

The NemR recognition promoter
As part of our design we wanted cells that would self destruct when the target molecules (TNT or NG) were depleted. This would prevent cells persisting in the soil that was being decontaminated after their job was done. One of the problems faced by the 2009 Edinburgh iGEM team was the issue of how TNT was to be detected in order to generate a gene expression response. See Edinburgh '09 Results and Edinburgh '09 Biobricks
They developed the following system:
Figure 1: TNT sensing pathway developed by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team. https://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/biology%28tntsensing%29 TNT binds to TNT.R1 in the periplasm. The TNT-TNT.R1 complex induces a conformational change in the Trg-EnvZ (Trz) fusion protein. Trg-EnvZ autophosphorylates and subsequently phosphorylates ompR. Phosphorylated ompR activates transcription.
There are a large number of parts within this system that all have to work. We decided instead to develop a simpler system that would be easier to engineer . After the discovery that the NemA enzyme could already be expressed at in E. coli, it was hypothesised that E. coli should have a gene regulatory molecule which controlled the nemA operon. This would enable its expression in environments where TNT was present. In E. coli, nemA is located downstream of a gene encoding a transcription factor known as NemR, previously entitled YdhM1.  Disruption to the gene encoding NemR results in a decrease in nem"

Figure 13. Possible design of CRISPR-based Cas9 integration plasmid.
Using HIV-modified vector to specifically deliver Cas9 gene or gRNA plasmid into CD4+ cells
One of the main limitations of our transfection system is non-directional, especially for A-B toxin based gRNA delivery because its target receptor is widely distributed on many cell types. However, the main group our system intends to protect is CD4+ cells because they are most susceptible to HIV. Interestingly, a paper published in 2009 reported a clinical trial that 2 X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) patients received very positive treatment effect after gene therapy by using HIV-based lentivirus vector to transfect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo (Cartier et al., 2009). So we will utilize the targeting capability of lentiviral vector while disarm its genome integration function to enable transient expression of the gRNA in the proper cells in vivo without the side effects of random genome insertion. There’s a saying in Chinese which is ‘Like cures like’. We think it explicitly expressed the idea of this approach.
Application in other retroviral diseases
The system designed by us can also be applied in treating other retrovirus diseases, such as Hepatitis B. We’ve designed gRNA for HBV and constructed target sequence plasmids to test its effectiveness.
See how we design gRNA for HBV

Fig 2 System construction based on function of AWA and AWB neuron in C.elegans
Next, we need to design the gene circuit to achieve our goal.
Wetware Engineering
We need to construct a system inside the worms which can make them show specific response to the inducing signal, and form the learning behavior after training. However, former researches of learning ability based on C.elegans were more focused on chemical signals like olfactory inducing, heavy metal stimulus. These methods can surely demonstrate the existence of the learning behaviors but seem not tenable as reliable experimental data, since the residue of the stimuli is difficult to erase. Thus we choose optogenetic method to realize this goal.
Fig 3 Gene circuit design
In order to express the functional components in specific neurons (Pairs of olfactory neurons: AWA and AWB in our project), we use the promoter of Odr-10 (specifically expressed in AWA) and Str-1 (specifically expressed in AWB) respectively in AWA and AWB. The reason why the promoter from cell-specific protein enables expression of target components is demonstrated by the published paper [2] . Thus, if the channelrhodopsin(Channelrhodopsins are a subfamily of retinylidene proteins that function as light-gated ion channels.) expresses in specific cells of organisms, with a specific wavelength of light stimulation, we are capable of activating or suppressing the specific ion channel to manipulate the condition of the target cell.
To study the nematodes’ behavior with optogenetic method, we have to decouple the crosstalk of the light sensing elements. In our final design, we chose a pair of channelrhodopsins, the red-light sensitive Chrimson and the blue-light sensitive CoChR. The channelrhodopsins intensely used in previous research, ChR2 and C1V1, have a large overlap on the excitation spectrum which indicates the high risk of cross-activation. CoChR is chosen because it is five times more sensitive to blue light than the commonly used ChR2, so low-intensity blue light can be used without triggering cross-activation of Chrimson. These two channelrhodopsins are sensitive to light of certain wavelength (blue light stimuli correspond to 400 to 520nm band and the red light stimuli correspond to 600 to 725nm band).

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design Regulatory_-_-_TEXT.html," as a control. Next, we have measured the same constructs using the CAT-Seq system.
2. Regulatory part interaction recording
Next, we want to give an example on how to record regulatory part interactions using CAT-Seq. In this case, we will be using Toehold Switches.
The Toehold Switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the Switch and Trigger. The Switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. The Switch RNA forms a hairpin structure that includes the RBS site. While the hairpin structure is formed, the translation is inhibited. The Trigger RNA is a molecule that can selectively bind to the Switch RNA region and expose the gene RBS site for ribosomes. Once that happens, the protein translation can be initiated.
While these riboregulators are extremely useful in engineering synthetic biology circuits, there is still a huge lack of orthogonal Toehold Switch and Trigger pairs. The orthogonal pairs are needed in order to create complex circuits, which require a large amount of logic functions. Yet, finding properly working pairs of Toehold Switches is still difficult, as in-silico methods still require more experimental data to generate well-working Toehold Switch pairs from scratch. Moreover, creating a Toehold Switch pair that is not only working by itself, but also does not cross interact with other pairs is an even more daunting task.
To give an example, if we had 50 working Toeholds and wanted to see how they would interact with each other using currently available methods, we would have to do 2500 separate measurements. For that reason, we want to demonstrate that CAT-Seq allows to measure regulatory part cross-interactions simultaneously and with ease.
Once again, only the first part of general CAT-Seq design needs to be changed - the library preparation. Instead of using a catalytic biomolecule library, a single enzyme is used. Then, libraries need to be prepared - one for Toehold Switches and another for Trigger RNA. The Trigger RNA libraries also require a separate T7 promoter for RNA expression. Then, both of those libraries must be ligated to the enzyme DNA fragment. Resulting library contains fragments which have the same catalytic biomolecule, yet each of them have a random combination of a specific Toehold Switch and RNA Trigger.
After the encapsulation, the droplets which have the correct Trigger RNA and Toehold Switch combination (in which Trigger RNA binds to that specific Toehold Switch), can produce catalytic biomolecules. In turn, those catalytic biomolecules can produce the Product Nucleotides.

Cell-Free System
Linear versus Plasmid DNA
We obtained promising data from adding plasmid DNA to our cell-free system. However, because the Collins paper specified the use of linear DNA in their experiments, we compared the signal from eGFP in linear and plasmid form in a cell-free reaction. The linear construct does not produce a stronger signal than the plasmid construct.
Reaction Volume Reduction
We decreased the cell-free reaction volume from the 25 µL given by the PURExpress protocol. To make their sensor, the Collins group only freeze-dried 1.8 µL of reaction onto paper discs, so our system would have to produce a signal with a much smaller reaction volume. In addition, performing experiments with a smaller reaction volume would make PURExpress last longer. PURExpress was one of the most expensive reagents we used, yet it was also central to our project. We set up reactions with a range of volumes from 1 to 25 µL and measure the fluorescence from eGFP. The reaction  produces an appreciable signal when the volume is as low as 5 µL.
Dilution
To obtain a good reading from the plate reader, we had to add at least 10 µL of liquid to the plate wells. For endpoint assays, we diluted the completed cell-free reactions by two before reading, which gave us good results. We wanted to try diluting the reaction before incubation to run a time course without increasing the amount of PURExpress used. However, cell-free reactions to not proceed nearly as quickly when diluted.

Therefore he used in 1898 filtration experiments to show tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an agent smaller than a bacterium. He named that new pathogen virus. (Dimitri Ivanovski discovered viruses in 1892, but failed to report his findings.) He is considered the founder of virology.
Nitrogen fixation is the process by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and become available for plants. Beijerinck discovered that it were bacteria who performed the fixation of nitrogen: it were symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria.
Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. Spirillum desulfuricans, the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.
Finally, it was Beijerinck who first devised the principles of the enrichment (or elective) culture, a fundamental technique used for studying microbes from the environment which is  still in use today.

Secondly, to generate as a standard BioBrick part and assembly vector, the part of Promoter CP29-RBS-aeBlue (BBa_K1033280) was cut by EcoRI and PstI and assembled with the vector. Finally, because there’s a SpeI recognition sequence within the 169dn element, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change a nucleotide to leave a single SpeI site in the BioBrick suffix region. (See the flow chart and data below).
Function:
A vector can be used to transform Lactobacillus acidophilus by chromosomal homologous recombination at the downstream location of slpA (LBA0169), which encodes a surface layer protein A. The aeBlue gene, which is driven by the wide host range and high constitutive promoter CP29, acts as a reporter. The transformed L. acidophilus will express blue color proteins.

After a few weeks of brainstorming project ideas we had narrowed it down to two options: heavy metal filtration or electric genes. Through a final vote we decided to work on a project on rare metal recycling (however idea changed over the following weeks).
Week 6 (28th May - 1st June)
Dry Lab Overview
We applied for two official iGEM sponsorships, GenScript and Promega, to provide us with funds for wet lab products. Dr Pinheiro gave us a much needed crash course in cloning techniques including Golden Gate, Gibson assembly and the Biobrick standard.
Week 7 (4th of June - 8th of June)
Dry Lab Overview
We set up Benchling as our main data management platform for wet lab aspects and started planning our cloning protocols. A lot of research was required to learn about the use of bacteria in metal recycling.
Week 8 (11th of June - 15th June)
Dry Lab Overview
Dr Brian O’Sullivan, Department Safety Officer in Biochemical Engineering, gave us a safety tour around the building. After we also completed online courses on Basic Fire Safety and Principles of Laboratory Safety were finally allowed to enter the lab!
Week 9 (18th June - 22nd June)
Dry Lab Overview
We secured GenScript’s sponsorship! This will be very valuable for our constructs once they are ready. While we were looking for a suitable scaffold for metal filters we read about spider silk for the first time. Its incredible mechanical properties and biodegradability convinced us to focus our project on it.
Week 10 (25th June - 29th June)
Dry Lab Overview
BMG and Eppendorf also became our sponsors! BMG’s plate reader will be used for our fluorescence measurements, and Eppendorf’s pipettes are everyone’s favourite. The wet lab team had meetings with Dr Pinheiro to finalise our constructs. Following our discussion last week about spider silk, Silk Engineered Technological Applications (SETA) was born.
Week 11 (2nd July - 6th July)
Dry Lab Overview
After running into slight issues due to the repetitive nature of spider silk sequences, our constructs were finally ready to be ordered. The UCL Synthetic Biology Showcase took place on Wednesday, allowing us to hear about cutting edge research in this field. We also got a chance to present our project and gather feedback. Our conversation with a representative GenScript proved to be very helpful for our presentation skills.

Fluorescence of GFP under expression of promoter Pspac
The mutagenesis of the Biobrick E1010 was successful and confirmed by sequencing, the thus created Biobrick is called BBa_K1351021 . The fusion with the His tags were also successfully conducted and confirmed by sequencing. The ligation into the vector pBS0K-Pspac was confirmed via Colony PCR and the transformation into B. subtilis was conducted successfully.
The intensity and spectrum of the fluorescence was measured by a TECAN Plate Reader, kindly provided by the AG Leonhardt from the LMU.
The fluorescence of all of the proteins, however, proved to be not very good and often at the same level as the auto fluorescence of the B. subtilis wild type. The examination of the cells under a microscope revealed, that the promoter is not suited for this experimental set up, since the gene expression is very heterogeneous and rather low.
This problem will be solved by recloning the FPs into the vector pBS1C ( BBa_K823023 ) together with the xylose-inducible promoter Pxyl( BBa_K1351039 ).
Linkers
Linkers are short peptides used to fuse two protein domains (or even whole proteins). They are designed not to interact with the fused parts. A linker of the wrong length can lead to sterically inactivated (if the linker is too short) or instable (if it is too long) constructs. Last but not least, linkers need to exhibit a certain flexibility. We evaluated a set of linkers partially already found in the registry using FRET.
Background
Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a phenomenon that occurs when two fluorophores with overlapping spectra are not more than 10 nanometers apart. When the donor fluorophore gets excited, and FRET happens, it does not emit all the energy as light, it transferres a part of the energy non-radiatively to the acceptor fluorophore, which starts fluores"

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#background_-_-_TEXT.html," ligand binding, and reduced risk of immunogenicity (2), and most of the therapeutic proteins approved and currently in development are therefore modified (3). However, the genetic tools used for constructing mammalian cells vectors are based on outworn methods, and since 60-70% of all recombinant protein pharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cells, there is a desperate need for simpler and more efficient cloning techniques (5).
The U-2 OS cell line
The U-2 OS cell line, originally known as the 2T line, is an immortalized human-derived cell line that was established in 1964. An immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely through either random mutation or modifications such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene. Several cell lines are well established as representatives of certain cell types. U-2 OS cells show epithelial adherent morphology, and no viruses have been detected in the cell line (17). In comparison, the HeLa cell line contains the well known HPV virus. U-2 OS cells are also very good-looking in the microscope, and therefore this cell line was chosen for the proof of concept of the Plug 'n’ Play assembly standard for mammalian cells.
Transient transfection
Transient expression is the ability to express heterologous DNA during a short period of time, which allows fast production of a desired protein. A high copy number of plasmids are introduced into the cells, and expression may be transitory over a period of time until the DNA is lost from the population. This allows for protein characterization or to verify the integrity, functionality, and the efficiency of different recombinant vectors. Production of a large amount of recombinant protein has been reported for transient expression systems at large scale. A small number of the transfected cells may incorporate the exogenous DNA into their genome by recombination leading to a stable transfection of a gene (6).

2. the type of expression desired
3. the genetic marker of the expression vector

5. the compatibility of the transfection method and the cell line
6. the use of assay for detection of recombinant protein
7. the presence of serum and/or antibiotics in the culture medium
Typically mammalian expression vectors have a multiple cloning site (MCS). The gene of interest (GOI) to be inserted into the MCS is therefore required to hold restriction sites compatible with the expression vector. The insertion of the GOI"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," where intellectual property is distributed across a wide variety of interested parties. This institution, Sangamo Biosciences Inc. , is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company which focuses on zinc finger production for clinical applications. Sangamo has acquired most of the patent rights for the exclusive production and use of zinc finger proteins as DNA-modifying molecules. The result is an imbalance in the legal rights to research zinc fingers and their related medical applications which has notable consequences.
""Scientists who purchase zinc fingers... must sign a license that imposes certain restrictions. To prevent scientists from selling or even sharing ZFNs, there’s a limit to how many animals can be produced [that express the zinc finger nuclease]. Nor can a scientist share anything made using the zinc fingers outside her organization.""
Implications of Monopoly
Opposition
First, researchers outside of Sangamo may be less motivated to research zinc finger technology because there is less of a foreseeable reward with patent rights blocking any prospect of earning a profit from patenting new technology. Even if there is no profit motive involved, it is impossible to do open source research using purchased zinc fingers, as licensing and high costs inhibit effective research. [3] The cost of purchasing a single zinc finger protein from Sigma® Life Science (licencing partner with Sangamo) is prohibitively high - up to $15,000 for a single functioning zinc finger nuclease, which only work as pairs [3] - limiting the possibilities for significant outside research.
In Favor
Second, Sangamo is able to monopolize the zinc finger market and intellectual capital: this means that they become a powerful, specialized research institution with the ability to potentially achieve progress at a faster pace than multiple individual institutions. Specialization naturally allows Sangamo to make progress more efficiently than individual researchers. Centralization also brings specialized researchers together under one roof for effective collaboration without having to cross communication barriers that exist between multiple isolated institutions.
Forward
These two effects act in opposite directions from the perspective of making intellectual progress for humanity. Thus we arrive at the central question: Does the Sangamo zinc finger monopoly augment the positive effects of research benefits for humanity and profit for individual researchers? Is the Sangamo research monopoly more beneficial to all involved parties?
In Favor of Opening the Field
Imbalance of Research Benefits
The economic consequences of monopoly have been posed by some as a clear negative consequence of the Sangamo phenomenon. In a single-actor monopoly, standard economic theory predicts that the rational market actor will sell at the profit-maximizing price. This price, however, does not necessarily maximize social benefit especially since monopolistic trade results in deadweight loss ["

In the PpcoA samples we successfully found PpcoA and mRFP. However, at the end of PpcoA's sequencing result, there is more 6bp than HUST’s sequence. We took PpcoA promoter to detection.
4.2 Promoter test
a. Add 2mL LB culture medium, 2uL Kanamycin (50mg/L) and 20uL bacterial samples to a 5mL centrifuge tube. Shaken overnight in the 37°C shaking incubator and set the rotational speed at 180 rpm/min.
b. Add CuSO4 solution to induce in concentration of 0, 0.02, 0.1 and 1mM. Set three copies for each concentration as repetitions. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator at the rotational speed of 180 rpm/min for 4 hours.
c. Add 200uL bacterial samples from each centrifuge tube to the 96-well plate. Set two copies for each centrifuge tub as repetitions. Meanwhile, add LB culture medium containing and not containing 1.0mM CuSO4 as blank controls.
d. Read the OD600 and fluorescent intensity (with the emission wavelength at 607nM and excitation wavelength at 584nM) using a multifunctional microplate reader.
e. Divided the fluorescent intensity result using the value of OD600. Record the data for compare and analysis.
5. Result and discussion
When we added the 1.0mM Cu to bacterium solution，we observed the color change of the visible to the naked eye. So we tried to test the 1.0mM Cu in LB medium. Then we found its fluorescence value and the value of OD600 with only LB medium samples differred greatly. So we decided to use the 1.0mM Cu in LB medium as the blank samples of the 1.0mM control.
We can observe from the figure, when the copper ion concentration is range of 0-0.1mM, with the increase of concentration of copper ion, promoter strength increased. In the copper ion concentration of 1mM, the promoter strength decreased.

Stochastic model giving insight on parameters
Tuesday, October 4th
We modeled the XOR module with a stochastic model, as the sites are discrete and not continuous and thus binding events might be sensitive to stochasticity. In this process, we figured out that the concentration of GFP was rapidly increasing due to fast flipping rates. It is very unlikely in biological systems. Thus, this model helped us debug an estimated paramter

Both inputs are present. There is an immediate GFP response, followed by degradation.

Week 18 : Decisive meeting
Monday, September 22th
This meeting was a turning point of our iGEM adventure. We reviewed all the experiments that had been done so far. Most of them concerns quorum sensing and its non-orthogonality. We summed up the results in a three-layer graphs.
The dry lab part presented for the first time a whole-cell model. With the parameters estimated, the model actually implemented an XOR gate. However, leakiness of promoters and crosstalk seemed to be affecting the robustness of our design.
As all our experiments were done in our plasmids, we have to standardize them into the Biobrick format. This year, the deadline corresponds to the delivery in Boston of the biobricks. Thus, it is becoming slowly urgent...
