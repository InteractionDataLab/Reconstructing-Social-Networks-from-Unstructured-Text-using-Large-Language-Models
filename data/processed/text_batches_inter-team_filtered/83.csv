After biobricking them, will work on characterizing them.   - PUF: tested WT PUF with YFP. Whenever there is PUF present, YFP doesn’t glow. This answer has been affirmed 5 times. However, the control is also not glowing, but it shoudl be. Also did protein expression gels for WT PUF and mutant PUF. Found that mutant PUF has good expression, but WT PUF has little expression. Today did a mutant PUF test and found that the mutant PUF when applied to the PUF binding site YFP, did not bind. This shows the specificity of binding of the PUF molecule. Dr. Wong has also sent a help construct in order to reproduce his experiment. The construct consists of an engineered mutant PUF. It was inserted into BL21. The mutant PUF site specifically binds to LacZ. Our next steps are to transform the mutant PUF and he Lac Z testing construct to BL21. Biobricking: WT PUF and mutant PUF with plans to characterize both of these.

Our team had a poster set up at the Symposium that introduced the University as well as its members, to this year's high school iGEM project. We gained expert advice from the scientific community, and everyone was very interested at what our project had to offer. Furthermore, we were able to answer questions about our system, which introduced us to the types of questions our project may receive from a scientific expert. By participating in the Chinook Symposium our team was able to become prepared for the poster presentation we would experience in Boston.
BioTreks Paper
We wrote a scientific paper, called “Capture and Removal of Ions from Seawater"", in a peer reviewed website to gain feedback on the design of our system. We received six medals on our BioTreks paper for the following achievements: Problem Solving, Conference Participation, Scientific Rigor, Innovation, Collaboration, and Visual Communications. Additionally, one of our team members, Michelle Wu, received a special recognition award for her excellent participation in the online conference that took place. BioTreks helped us extend our project as a result of the questions and comments posted on it by the public; for example, some areas of confusion were mentioned, which improved our scientific language in our presentations."
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," success of the construction of BBa_J13002 with hpaC was also explored by using forward and reverse primers of R0040 (the promoter component of the composite part J13002). However, the eventual gel verification was inconclusive and sequencing results finally indicated an unsuccessful ligation. Additionally, the minimal media M9 preparation had been contaminated in the previous effort so this process was repeated to create tubes of each of the growth condition treatments detailed previously, and two repeats, one with an extra filtration step and one without was used to prepare the cultures.
Week 13 (July 23 - July 27)
Decarboxylation
The gene sequencing results for the aldehyde decarbonylase were unsuccessful. It was presumed that this occurred because the mini-preparation procedure being used may potentially be leading to a high contamination rate. As such, a colony PCR was done with a new colony for ADC, followed my mini-preparation using a different procedure, and then a restriction digest. The sequencing results now yielded a high complementarity rate and were considered successful. We then proceeded with making the biobrick consisting of the acyl-acp reductase (AAR) being ligated with aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC). Upon successfully forming this biobrick (ideally the same as a functional petrobrick), we will be able to test for hydrocarbon production using the general production media protocol. The University of Washington also responded, and said that they will be able to send us their functional petrobrick that was being used in 2011.  With regards to culturing Nocardia, a “brain and heart infusion (BHI)” broth was used to inoculate the Nocardia in an attempt to get growth. Six pairs of mutagenic primers were also composed for carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), which is found in the Nocardia, as well as primers for the OleT enzyme.
Desulfurization
Mutagenic primers were redesigned after initial design was found to have premature stop codons. As part of the redesign process in constructing our overall gene circuits for desulfurization, a backbone switch of R0011 into a chlor-resistant vector was necessary, so this was attempted. The subsequent transformed products were plated on a Chlor plate and selected colonies were used to prepare O/N cultures, then miniprepped before finally being digested with enzymes EcoRI and PstIA. The resulting gel verification images were inconclusive as they did not show the required banding pattern around 50bp. Meanwhile, colony PCR was run"

RewirED
Better control of bacterial populations should allow more complex biological systems to be created. RewirED has worked to bring the first components of that future closer through iGEM, in order to allow greater access and sharing of scientific knowledge, and greater communication and responsiveness from bacteria.
Our aims
In order to improve globally equality, both monetary and medically, the accessibility of new technologies is imperative. Our project designed a intercellular communication and control system that could be used to stabilise the composition of dynamic population of bacteria. This would simplify the use of complicated biological systems such as microbial consortia.

Our Project
We focused on the definition of microbial consortia, namely, systems. This was done through three sub-projects; Metabolic wiring and the three wires we investigated, degron characterization to improve the responsiveness of systems, and population control to experiment with actual control mechanisms. Policy and Practices informed the considerations of our model system’s design and it in turn influenced the exploration of these same themes in iGEM teams.

NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," there is less biofilm.
Key insight
It may be difficult to inhibit all pathways in bacterial communication, due to its complexity.
Optimize the biofilm measurements by providing information regarding incubation times and growth media. Recommended a cell viability assay in combination with the crystal violet assay.
In modeling we should only include parameters that can be measured, like pH, O2-levels, concentration of inducer.
Summary of interview
After the interview with Kåre Bergh, we were still unsure about what the optimal experimental setup would be for measuring the biofilm production. To further investigate this, we scheduled a meeting with Sven Even Borgos who is a Senior Research Scientist at the Department of Biotechnology and Nanomedicine at SINTEF Industry here in Trondheim. Sven has among other things knowledge within molecular genetics, biochemistry and system biology.
Sven was very curious and showed great interest in our approach to reduce bacterial biofilm formation using CRISPRi and bacteriophages. He informed us that it may be difficult to fully inhibit all pathways involved in the bacterial communication due to its great complexity. Still, he said that targeting important quorum sensing molecules may be a possible solution to reduce the bacteria’s ability to communicate, and thereby decrease their biofilm production. Sven was very helpful in the making of the framework of our experimental procedure. He told us that an optimal setup would be to combine measurements of the biofilm production with a cell viability assay. Furthermore, Sven put us in contact with his colleague Anne Tøndervik who was eager to help us with some tips and tricks regarding the theoretical and practical aspects of our project. They both helped us find recipes for growth mediums, incubation times and informed us about a potential cell quantification kit (BacTiter-Glo).
Lastly, Sven had some comments regarding the modelling of our project. He reminded us that biofilms are not homogeneous, and that bacteria do not necessarily respond similarly and/or linearly to outer stimuli. Sven said that not all parameters are of interest, and that we only should include those that we can measure (eg. pH, nutrients, O2-levels, concentration of biofilm inhibitor, etc.).
How did this interview shape our project? The interview with Sven Even Borgos influenced how we conducted our experimental procedures. To obtain more valuable results we incorporated his idea to combine cell count with the Crystal Violet assay. We also used the growth media and incubation time suggested by him and Anne Tøndervik, and included some of the suggested parameters into our model.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," method would you suggest if we want  to extract amino acids from the cells?
Sh: Internal amino acid extraction requires two main steps - breaking open the cell and purifying the amino acids within. The cell wall and membrane can be disrupted either by physical techniques (sonication, heat, beads) or by chemical techniques (lysozyme). The choice of techniques is dependent on factors like equipment availability in the lab, number of samples to be purified at a given time, characteristics of the cell (i.e. cell wall thickness) and so on. The second step of purifying the amino acids from the cell extract also differs based on which amino acids are of interest (free amino acids, protein bound amino acids).         The method I used in my study was based on a physical disruption of E. coli cells using heat and sonication followed by solvent based extraction of internal free amino acids. This method is useful for extraction of internal amino acids from numerous and multiple samples.
TD: Did you also measure the composition of your cultivation media to know how much of the produced amino acids are exported? If you did, can you suggest a method to use here as well?
Sh: I was using minimal media for all my experiments and during the chemical analysis of my samples for amino acid quantification I always used asterile control media. This was especially important because minimal media contains ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source and the NH-group here interferes with LC-MS measurements. More specifically because we were derivatizing (using FMOC to basically label the amino groups to make it detectable in the machine) the samples prior to amino acid quantification and we had to add excess reagent to first nullify the NH-groups already present in blank minimal media.
TD: We are working on a co-culture with different organism classes. Did you use organisms other than E. coli and what are your experiences?
Sh: We used Acinetobacter baylyi in the cross-feeder co-cultures with E. coli. A. baylyi is a gram negative soil dwelling bacteria hence not very different from E. coli in terms of amino acid biosynthetic pathways and lab cultivation. It was however tricky to introduce the auxotrophic and over-production mutations in A. baylyi as compared to E. coli. This (genetic manipulation) I think is the biggest hurdle in organisms that are less established than E. Coli, followed by finding the right media that supports the growth of all partners.
TD: What do you think are the advantages of co-cultures and co-cultivation in general?
Sh: I think"

High-School Presentations @Athens, Greece
Judging from our own high-school experience, we observed a lack of engagement with the cutting-edge technological advancements, Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology included. Thus, we sought to include high school students in the discussions.
We presented in three different high schools over a two-week period in May 2018, in an audience of 10th and 11th graders. Our presentation entitled “Synthetic Biology: Engineering Life”, span from an analogy between living cells and machines, to biotechnology and the principles of synthetic biology and, finally, to our own iGEM project.
At the same time, a questionnaire was handed out with two sections, pre- and post-presentation. This way, we wished to observe how our presentation had engaged the students, gave birth to new questions and planted the seed of interest towards Synthetic Biology. The students’ answers to the questionnaire can be found on our report . Some of the stunning comments we received are the following:
At the same time, a questionnaire was handed out with two sections, a pre-presentation section and an post-presentation. This way, we wished to observe how our presentation had engaged the students, gave birth to new questions and planted the seed of interest towards Synthetic Biology. The students’ answers to the questionnaire can be found on our report . Some of the stunning comments we received are the following:
“How much should everyday life applications of Synthetic Biology intervene with human nature?” - 11th grade student
“Is the consumer able to know which GM foods are healthy?” - 11th grade student
“Which is the impact on the one’s health if we do not know everything there is to know in Biology?” - 11th grade student
“After all, is genetic modification “good”? If yes, why is there so much propaganda against it.” - 10th grade student
“Will there be experiments on living organisms or human clones? Using the tools of Synthetic Biology is it not possible that there will be mistakes? How do we know that these experiments will not have a negative impact on the organism instead of a positive one?” - 10th grade student
Some of the comments we received surprised our team. Many of those fall under the emotional engagement category, as students tried to process the new information in a sentimental way, while other remarks fall under the cognitive engagement category, as they used prior knowledge and their own logic to analyze the facts. For more information on our observations and analysis of the students’ reactions to the"

With regards to the interest of human health, we will provide the information necessary to distinguish our organism from known pathogens. We hope to have these experiments complete by December 2014.
Protocol development for accidental release: because our strain will be mass produced and packaged for field use, containment is very important. We will likely use established level 1 biohazard clean-up protocols should our system breach. The protocols will be fully developed when we know the details of how, where, and who will be contracted to manufacture the organism. The device that will be taken to the field is designed to keep the microbe contained within it, whereby a cytotoxic chemical is released to the microbe upon completion of the assay. This chemical compartment will be built into the cartridges and release will be initiated after the assay is run to completion. The final mechanisms for this will be developed as we approach the product development phase where the prototype is finalized.
The deadline for submitting this information for approval is 120 days prior to when we plan to start using the organism. Being well organised and using an innocuous genetically modified organism, we do not expect delay from this regulatory approval. The costs associated with this application are currently in the cost of performing the required tests.
Standards Approval
For the FREDsense biosensor to be a measure of toxins, it needs to produce accurate and reproducible measures of the compounds we claim it is detecting. In the highly regulated field of oil and gas, this is a crucial step towards  increasing adoption of the FREDsense biosensor as the industry standard for detection of these compounds.  The Environment Canada branch that manages this certification is the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program (Canadian Environmental Technology Verification Program: Applicant Information Package, Global Performance Solutions) . The program independently validates the claims we make of our product.
EVT is a voluntary internationally recognized program for validation of environmental technologies. Recognition for accuracy and reliability would help assure our investors that our product is credible and has the potential to become widely used in industry and worthy of continued investment. There are several steps associated with gaining validation through this program:
Eligibility: we to ensure that we are will be screened eligible for the program. The main criteria are: we have the intellectual property right to our technology; its performance claim must meet minimum Canadian standards for that type of technology; the technology must be commercially available for full-scale up at the time of application.

Professor Oscar Kuipers from the University of Groningen (RUG) then gave a presentation on his research on antibiotics. Lastly, Roel Bovenberg of DSM talked about what DSM is doing in the field of synthetic biology and the possible future of the bio-based economy.
Figure 3. Discussion with
policy makers held by iGEM Team
TU Eindhoven 2014
Next, the audience was divided over the four iGEM teams for a discussion on synthetic biology. We were interested in how our click coli system would be received by policy makers, but since we have a general tool we used two of the scenarios developed for the Synenergene project. The general consensus of the group of experts was that the responsibility for using the tool lay with whoever manufactured a product with it.
Figure 4. Panel of experts during the closing discussion
The final part of the day was reserved for a general discussion based on input from the smaller previous discussions. Questions were asked by the audience and answered by a panel consisting of the first three speakers. This gave a nice quick overview on how synthetic biology was seen and could develop itself within society.
The official report of the RIVM on the debate ‘Responsible approach to synthetic biology’ that took place on this day is available here .

Purification of these hydrocarbons would contribute an added economic and industrial benefit.  We aimed to house this system by designing a bioreactor for our bacteria as well as optimize product output through a flux-variability based model.   Finally, in order to create higher quality hydrocarbons we explored desulfurization and denitrogenation pathways to upgrade our fuel.  To do this in a safe and environmentally sound manner, we built into our design structural containment, as well as genetic control mechanisms through novel inducible ribo-killswitches and an auxotropic marker.
Characterization of new parts submitted to the Registry
( BBa_K902000 ) and ( BBa_K902004 ): two novel hydrolase enzymes were submitted to the registry for the hydrolysis of two different sugar-conjugated electroactive compounds: PNPG and PDPG.  Used in conjunction with the existing lacZ part in the registry ( BBa_I732005 ) which hydrolyzes CPRG, this allows for the electrochemical detection of three compounds with a single electrode.  A uidA inducible generator ( BBa_K902002 ) was submitted and characterized electrochemically.  This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
( BBa_K902008 ),( BBa_K902023 ) and ( BBa_K902074 ): three novel riboswitches sensitive to magnesium, molybdenum cofactor, and manganese were submitted along with two associated promoters ( BBa_K902009 and BBa_K902073 ) in addition to a rhamnose inducible, glucose repressible (Prha) promoter ( BBa_K902065 ).
The magnesium riboswitch ( BBa_K902008 ) was tested with GFP and a constitutive promoter using this construct, ( BBa_K902021 ), with its promoter and GFP using this construct ( BBa_K902017 ) and with its promoter and the S7 kill gene using this construct ( BBa_K902018 ).  This data can be found on our killswitch Regulation page.
The Prha promoter was characterized via fluorescence output using a GFP composite part ( BBa_K902066 ).  This promoter was additionally characterized with our S7 kill gene as a composite part ( BBa_K902084 ).  This data can be found on our killswitch Regulation page.

For our application, this gRNA generation tool is an addition to the sequence classification tool discussed above. The sequence classification tool adds doping sequences to it’s database. The sequences have either an amino acid sequence which is already known by us, or a different amino acid sequence. If it is a protein sequence which is already known, the database improvement stops there. This is because gRNA’s have already been made for this protein sequence, so generating the gRNA’s again is not necessary.
However, if it is a new protein sequence, this sequence is fed into the gRNA generation tool. New gRNA’s are generated and added to a gRNA database. This databases consists of all gRNA’s which we have designed to catch gene doping athletes. The gRNA’s stored in the database are used to bind to our target with our fusion protein . By updating the database in this way, we increase the chance of catching gene doping users with every run.
Method
We have developed the gRNA generator tool in R, adapted from the gRNA model . The figure below guides you through the steps of the code. For a more detailed description of the tool, please click the dropdown below the figure.
Figure 7. Summary of the gRNA generation code. The inputs and output are shown in white, with a oval shape for file in and output and a diamond shape for (sets of) parameter settings. The code being executed is summarized in square blue boxes. The gene for which the gRNA’s should be generated is submitted as a .fasta file, a file format commonly used for genetic information. The DNA sequence it contains is translated into amino acids. Each amino acid has a certain number of DNA codons that encode the same amino acid. A vector containing these values per amino acid is generated next. Using the target region and Cas property input parameters, the target region of the gene is scanned for possible gRNA positions. Combining the information on the possible gRNA locations and the vector with the amounts of possible codons, positions are selected with the least possible codons. At these positions, gRNA’s are then generated and stored. This output can be exported as a fasta file.
Detailed methods
The tool takes as input:
A .fasta file containing a DNA sequence.
A vector with target region(s). These are the bps that the tool"
Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Team#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," focused particularly in the area of pharmaceutical biotechnology, with emphasis on animal cell cultivation and the purification of biopharmaceuticals. To enrich my theoretical knowledge with practical experience I successfully applied for a bachelor thesis at Boehringer Ingelheim at the division of Purification Development. Moreover, I performed a project work abroad in the laboratory of the Animal Cell Technology Group located at KTH in Stockholm during my term as an exchange student in 2009.
In my spare time I support the German association for students of Biotechnology “btS” at its local group in Bielefeld. After the daily work at the university I like to go to the gym and play football or handball. Recently I am also taking much pleasure in the invention of new board games, although my first developments still need some improvements.

Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
In 2005 I started my bachelor studies in molecular biotechnology at Bielefeld University. During my studies, I gained more and more interest in structural and functional genome research. Concerning my bachelor thesis it was important to me to work at the interface of genome research and biotechnology. During this time I discovered my passion for genetic and metabolic engineering. By joining the masters programme 'genome based systems biology' I was able to get an overview about the functionality of regulatory networks and metabolic competence in general.  At the beginning of this year I completed a student's project at the Institue of Molecular Systems Biology at ETH Zurich. Currently, I am looking forward to finish my master thesis by the end of November.

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," thinking about the medical infrastructure in these countries and how we would have to think about this for our final design. This comes into the portability of our device and how it does not require any specialist equipment that would only be present in well-equipped hospitals.
Safety and Ethics:
When talking about ethical issues surrounding the diagnostic the main worry that Michael had was issues with abortion as we were working with congenital diagnosis. However, we ascertained that this would not be an issue as the test is done postnatally and there is no danger of abortion being encouraged or even coming up in any discussions. He thought that this was an important thing to be clear on as we would be dealing with maybe more religious and less westernised cultures.
Michael suggested it might be a good idea to have a public health campaign to go along with this diagnostic. To see a draft of this click the link below:
A public health campaign would be good because it is important for people to know that Chagas disease is something that their child could have and needs to be tested for; as often it can be seen as a disease of the older generations. This kind of insight from Michael into thinking about different cultures and societal factors and how it would affect our product design was invaluable in our final vision.
Before we had a outline for how our product would work, we were thinking of possible using the placenta as the blood source. However, after advice from Michael we realised that this might not be the best idea for a number of reasons. There could be cultural issues surrounding use of the placenta as well as the practical and legal issues in storing human tissue. He told us that there are not many specific legal issues surrounding diagnostics, as long as standard safety measures are kept.

Introduction
The Gifsy promoters with their respective repressors and anti-repressors are important regulatory elements in the switch and this is why we wanted to characterize them and submit them as BioBricks. We already know that this system is tight in its natural settings in Salmonella, but to our knowledge no one before us has tried to characterize the system in Escherichia coli. A good way to characterize it in E.coli is to test whether the repression of the pR promoters is tight, and if the anti-repressors indeed do antirepress. Because of previous knowledge of the strength of the promoters in Salmonella all characterization had to be done in low-copy-number plasmids.  We have characterized the following BioBricks:
BBa_K374008
BBa_K374009
BBa_K374010
Construction of BioBricks
BioBricks BBa_K374008 and BBa_K374009
In wildtype Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium (strain ATCC 14028) the Gifsy immunity region, consisting of the two divergent promoters pR and pRM and the repressor gogR/gtgR downstream of the pRM promoter, are present in the chromosome.  We designed a primer pair to amplify the immunity region from Gifsy 1 and Gifsy 2, and by adding the standardized prefix and suffix as a tail, the amplicons were made Biobrick compatible. The amplicons were made by PCR. After the PCR the fragments were cleaned up using a PCR clean-up kit .
The amplicon as well as the linearized backbone plasmid pSB1C3 were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI leaving sticky ends.  Both the digested PCR product and the digested plasmid were run on a gel in order to estimate DNA concentration.

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"mediate toxic levels of fluoride was a viable idea.
Here is a study guide that we made using the information gleaned from the OWASA trip. The study guide was distributed amongst students in AP Environmental Science Classes at East Chapel Hill High School, who were learning about water treatment during the first quarter of the school year! The feedback from the class was overall very positive; they were thankful for a resource straight from the very people who treat the water they use everyday!
Interview with Laura Craig, hydrogeologist
The implementation of our project in the real world relies heavily on public support and the education of the people who are affected by excess fluoridation. We wanted to fully understand the background on our project and its effect on target populations, so we had a skype conference with Laura Craig, the author of “Recommendations for fluoride limits in drinking water based on estimated daily fluoride intake in the Upper East Region, Ghana” - an important document for our team during the early stages of project development. Ms. Craig has a background in water resources and water quality. We explained to her our project that we are taking to the iGEM competition, in which she expressed enthusiasm and gave us tips on how to incorporate our technology into the real world. One of the most important things we learned from Craig was that the residents she lived with in Ghana did not know their water was causing fluorosis. They said “the water looks great and tastes great”; they believed there is nothing to be worried about. If they don’t understand what fluorosis is within their own communities, we can’t sell the idea of SWITCH to them. We must start with education from within the community, illustrating our idea in a way that is understandable and relatable. Laura expressed that the best way to implement our improved riboswitch would be in some type of biological absorption system with an additional step for filtration. In Ghana, she saw water filtration companies selling treated water for a couple cents in sealed sachets. They used a reverse osmosis filter, and tests show that the water they sold had virtually no fluoride in it. Adopting a similar model where water is treated at a plant and people fill their jugs at a low cost would keep everything centralized, easier to control, and cheap. Also, these water companies may be interested in using the cheaper method (fluoride riboswitch) rather than a reverse osmosis filter. The cheaper the production costs, the cheaper they can sell the water to the people! The interview with Laura, offered up a new perspective and brought our attention to things we had never even considered before.

After several unsuccessful transformations, we attempted to clone the tryptophan system into a low-copy-number plasmid provided by iGEM HQ (pSB4A5). PCR-amplified product was digested and ligated with the backbone, followed by an overnight transformation. A self-ligation was used as a negative control.

A colony PCR was performed, both on the negative control plate and on the desired product. The results showed the presence of the fragment of interest, along with other unknown products.

Hypothesis 2: Bacterial proliferation of tryptophan regulatory system with RFP in medium containing tryptophan in a concentration gradient

The follow-up steps after cloning of the tryptophan regulatory system would be to measure the bacterial proliferation and the expression of RFP in cumate-containing medium. Unfortunately, the sequencing results showed multiple mutations and due to time constraints we were unable to optimize the system and perform the tests.
Hypothesis 4: Cloning of Im2 into pSB1C3

Theory & assumptions
The first method we attempted was to put the user in control of the change in HSL within the cell, and take any HSL produced and remove it from the system entirely. In this fashion a gradual increase in cell density was simulated by a linear “ramp up” of the HSL in the cell; a gradual decrease (presumably due to cell death) was simulated by a linear “ramp down” in HSL. The activation of the cell was measured by plotting the GFP concentration. The practicalities of our code can be viewed here .
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the LuxR quorum sensing circuit
Parameters
In finding the parameters for our model we searched through a great number of scientific papers in order to collate the various pieces of data which we required. Ultimately however, the most useful resource in our search proved to be the previous work done by other iGEM teams, notably Aberdeen’s Pico Plumber project of 2009. A comprehensive list of all rate constants used is given in the table below:
Results
In order to simulate the effect of the cell colony growing in number we first set the change in HSL concentration to a fixed value and ran the model until a steady state was reached. It can be clearly seen from figure that the level of GFP in the cell reaches a point where the concentration starts to sharply increase before a plateau is reached and there is no further activity. This is the switch-on, where the cell has moved from a down-regulated to an up-regulated state and starts to produce greater amounts of HSL, LuxR, LuxI and GFP.
Figure 2: Graph of the HSL input over time
As figure 2 shows, when ramping the HSL down we chose a rate which was significantly slower than that used when performing a ramp up in HSL.

This intervention began with a short video of the cartoon: “Once upon a time life”. In this movie, each protein or enzyme that usually play a role on DNA were represented as little characters. This way, the kids could better understand the different tasks of these molecules. For example, our famous histones were personified by little workers condensing DNA.
The video was followed by a little discussion in which we explained that DNA was present in all living system. To better understand this concept, DNA was compared to a manual mode with sentences, words and an alphabet. After these explanations, the class was divided into two groups to perform two different activities:
They experimented a banana DNA extraction. The aim was to understand that DNA is found inside cells which must be broken if we want to access DNA
They learnt to speak the language of DNA by using a set of Lego. We explained that DNA has its own alphabet and they had fun finding the complementary sequence of a DNA strand
Finally we showed them why the study of DNA was important and we gave them a feedback questionnaire about the new information given during the meeting and their impressions.

BioSynSys
From June 27 to June 29, iGEM Bordeaux participated in a symposium called BioSynSys for Synthetic and Systemic Biology (Biologie Synthétique et Systémique). This symposium was organized by the National Institute of Applicated Sciences (NIAS) of Toulouse and hosted by the University of Bordeaux.
During three days, we attended many conferences focusing on the research advances in the field of synthetic biology. Between the different sessions, scientists exhibited their work through posters and we had also the chance to do so for our project « Sleep with EpiC elegans ».
A lot of the talks we listened to were very interesting and taught us more about synthetic biology.  The first one of them was about « a CRISPR-based gene drive system to suppress population of malarial mosquitos » presented by Tony NOLAN, a researcher working at the Imperial College London.  In order to eradicate malaria, his team created a tool whose purpose is to target and alter the genes having a role in the female Anopheles mosquito’s fertility. This could allow to eliminate the populations of mosquitos which are the vectors of malaria.

We were ready to re-attempt the three day plan which starts with 3A assembly ligation of the lac-ferredoxin- FNP with the lac-hydrogenase.
As these were both in CAM backbones, they were digested then ligated into Amp backbone.
We used new incubation settings for ligation which ramped up the temperature based on advice from Rob.
Transformed cells were grown on plates overnight.
We were excited to achieve one colony of our Fer/Hyd plasmid cells however with very low numbers even on the puC19 positive control plates the competency of the cells was in question.
At the same time we ligated the newly arrived biobricks- GUN4, HydG and Double terminator into CAM backbones.
These were also transformed into cells and successfully grown overnight.
Subcultures of these as well as the one Fer/Hyd colony were grown in liquid media ready for miniprep.
PCR (both KOD and Q5) was attempted again on all three backbones and the gel showed disappointing results (Figure 1).
Having discussed this with Rob it was decided that our templates were a poor choice (iGEM linear backbones).
Our next attempt to amplify the backbones- CAM, Amp and Kan utilised the RFP/antibiotic resistant backbone plasmids from previous iGEM members.
While running PCR products on gels we had the opportunity to tweak our NEB 1kb ladder.
The ladder used was a 1:10 dilution of the original now with loading dye added to the mix so we could confidently just drop 2uL in a well and see a great result every time.
In an attempt to test the competency of the cells we’d been using we challenged Thi’s cells against Rob’s cells (all DH5α).
We transformed each with our Fer/Hyd ligation and with puC19 +ve control.
As we plated up the cells someone noticed that our heat block temp was not set correctly so effectively our transformants had never been heat shocked.
Given these probably won’t work we re-did the transformation.
The next day we found those that weren’t heat shocked did grow very few cells for the puC19 +ve control and none for Fer/Hyd.
Rob’s cells showed more colonies."
Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#Project#Overview#UVA_-_-_TEXT.html," uirR and start of lsiR, which was demonstrated to contain the uirR transcriptional activator binding region for the promoter of lsiR. The G-block was synthesised with the biobrick prefix and suffix attached, and a SpeI site within mutated away by one base (t58a). The uirR gene and PlsiR promoter region were both biobrick compatible and were therefore ligated directly into the pSB1C3 plasmid; whereas uirS possessed three BioBrick incompatible restriction sites, preventing ligation into pSB1C3 and submission to the registry. In order to make uirS biobrick compatible we first had to clone it into a vector which would allow us to alter the  incompatible restriction sites by PCR mutagenesis. We chose to use the TOPO® TA Cloning® Kit from Invitrogen ( 450641 ) and followed the protocol provided (See protocols). Through a diagnostic digest of 5 miniprepped transformants it was observed that uirS inserted into TOPO vector reversed in all 5 cases. TOPO cloning is a non-directional process, but it was hypothesised at this stage that the combination of the lac promoter and very high copy number resulting from the pUC origin of replication present in pCR 2.1 TOPO vector lead to selection against expression of uirS. Once successfully cloned into a vector we began the process of PCR mutagenizing the BioBrick incompatible restriction sites in a stepwise manner using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent ( 200523 ) (See protocols). The Agilent QuikChange Primer Design tool was used to design mutagenic primers to modify a single base in the three illegal restriction sites without altering the amino acid sequence of uirS and attempting to match codon frequency. Although we were modifying uirS in its reversed conformation within TOPO vector, the following sequence labels were numbered in the forward direction from the start codon.

The rise of the water level then endangers oil refineries, which are built at a certain level above the water, but cannot change their initial height. As an example, an oil refinery near New Castle, USA, is endangered by severe storms [6] . Over the past decades, there were several catastrophes with oil spills, that leaked from fractured factories and had a major negative impact on the local sea life. This is why a factory like the one near New Castle is not only endangering  itself, but is also a high risk for its environment.
The Solution
All the above mentioned problems make it clear, that there is a great need for an alternative to petrochemicals. As reported by the Center for International Environmental Law [7] , more than 99% of plastic is produced using petrochemicals. This is why we want to particularly challenge the plastic production. In our project, we chose to provide a sustainable, environmentally friendly synthesis of PLGA and PLGC. These polymers are not only biodegradable, but also useful for a wide field of applications, such as drug delivery systems, prosthetic implants or cosmetic products. They consist of three monomers: glycolic acid, lactic acid (to form PLGA) and caprolactone (to form PLGC together with glycolic acid and lactic acid). To ensure „green“ monomer manufacturing, we engineered the glyoxylate cycle of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  With this alternative, we hope to minimize the dependence on petrochemicals, thereby reducing the demand for petrochemicals and indirectly decreasing the need for oil and natural gas extraction. This way, we hope to further the climate, air quality and water pollution goals in the future.
The Highlights of our Project
As you can see from our proof of concept subpage [1] , we achieved to produce our monomers in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. In addition, our chemistry group successfully produced PLGA and PLGC. We also created an example application, the nanospheres. These find a rising demand as drug delivery systems because of their harmless degradation in the human body and their  ability to constantly release medicine. This unharmful degradation is called biodegradability and is a major benefit for our project. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a biodegradable substance is able to decay naturally and without harming the environment [8] . This differentiates us from many other plastics, for example the slow degradable pol"

The Butanol Approach
Our goal is to achieve photosynthetic production of butanol and its derivatives with the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as the final host organism.
Background
Cyanobacteria have the capability to harvest the energy from the sun and convert it into other forms of energy. The natural way for these organisms is to store it as sugars or other carbohydrates in a way similar to plants. By introducing a cassette of genes for isobutanol production, we would like to derive a cyanobacteria that produces butanol and its derivatives.
The Constructs
We designed two final constructs ( & ) that actually only differ in the promoter, as our final host organism Synechocystis sp PCC6803 does not allow the use of conventional inducible promoters. More information about pPetE, a copper inducible promoter for Synechocystis sp PCC6803, can be found here .

The Pathway
The original pathway to obtain branched-chain higher alcohols was proposed and successfully established in E. coli by Shota Atsumi, Taizo Hanai and James C. Liao from the University of Californa, Los Angeles. [1] As we expect a broad range of higher alcohols, we will exemplary demonstrate the biochemical mechanism with the pathway of isobutanol, the product we expect to be the most abundant.

- Initial condition: no chemo-repellent is present in the chip at time zero (a).
- Boundary condition: at infinite distance the concentration is zero (b) and the there is conservation of dissolved material mass (c).
We modelled the change in concentration of the chemo-repellent based on a ""Top Hat Function"" solution for the diffusion problem:
v [M] is the chemo-repellent concentration.
D[m2/s] is the chemo-repellent diffusion coefficient.
N [mol] is the number of moles of the repellent .
A [m2] is the cross-section area of the channel.
h [m] is length of the sample in the channel.
x [m] is the distance on the channel.
t [s] is time.
The solution for this problem is:
Equation 1: Chemo-repellent diffusion problem.
Equation 2: General solution for chemo-repellent diffusion problem.
Graph 1: Chemo-repellent concentration: top hat diffusion.
If x=0 [m] is defined as the point where the sample is loaded to the chip, then the solution for the diffusion problem is:
Equation 3: Chemo-repellent concentration.
Model Results
We ran the chemo-repellent concentration equation in Matlab - Our code can be found here . The parameters used:
Table 1: Parameters for diffusion model.
*This is the diffusion coefficient for potassium permanganate (see ""Comparison to Experiment"")
** h = (Sample volume)/(Reservoir cross section).
The output for different times:
Graph 2: Model for repellent concentration.
The change in distance of the diffusion limit between 0 to 15 minutes, is relatively big. As the time passes the diffusion limit's speed lowers significantly, and the concentration profile becomes more linear.
Comparison to Experiment
Most diffusion experiments need a dedicated system that is based on the diffusion of an isotope or a fluorescent material that can be detected easily and very precisely. we chose a more basic system since this is only a preliminary testing for showing that the overall system behaves as we expect.
The experiment ran as the setup shown in the ""Overview"" section: The channel was filled with bacteria in motility buffer and then the sample was inserted. We replaced the motility buffer with water and the chemo-repellent with potassium permanganate in the following amounts:

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#humanPracticeC_-_-_TEXT.html,"cgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know"

Outreach
Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Outreach page. Outreach is fundamentally the communication between fellow scientists and non-scientists.
Nottingham iGEM 2018 participated in the University of Nottingham Discovery Day an open day for young children and parents. This was our first outreach event and it helped the team establish a dialogue with members of the public.
We also held workshops at 3 schools with students ages 15-18. They engaged strongly and positively with the activities and showed ample curiosity towards synthetic biology. Not only did this open a new avenue but it helped us understand just how much students knew about synthetic biology and different components of our project, we hope this can be developed further for future curriculums that will be taught in schools.
Finally, we published articles for local newspapers describing what possibilities our project could bring, as well as encouraging readers to engage with us.
Discovery day
16th June 2018
Nottingham iGEM took part in Discovery Day 2018 at the University of Nottingham! We put on a range of fun activities for kids aged 4-10 to learn more about synthetic biology and bacteria microbes!
First, the children got the opportunity to make their own plasticine microbes and put them in petri dishes! They used inspiration from our fun cuddly toy bacterium friends and produced some amazing results.
After that, both kids and adults had a go at guessing which mode of transport had the most bacteria- bus, train or plane. The answer- bus surprised a lot of people- including the adults!
Finally, everyone had a go at seeing how much bacteria was on their hands by using a special gel, then showing their hands under UV light to see how dirty their hands were. It seems that the kids had cleaner hands than most of us university students!
Overall it was an amazing day where we educated kids all about synthetic biology! The parents feedback to our team was incredibly posititve and"

DCMation: decimating DCM pollution using bioremediation
Bioremediation is a form of clean waste management that relies on the ability of organisms to break down a wide range of pollutants and toxic wastes that would otherwise harm the environment and potentially pose a threat to human health. Dichloromethane (DCM) is such a toxic waste product, and we have made it our mission to explore and develop a system to safely degrade DCM using bacteria.
The three 'DCMation' links below will guide you through our interdisciplinary approach of evaluating and improving the DCM-degrading capacity of the native bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens DM4. Additionally, these pages explain how and why we have expressed the DCM degradation system in E. coli and P. putida, and how we are adapting them for DCMation.
The three 'Microcompartment' pages will take you on a journey of how models of microcompartments designed by our engineers work hand-in-hand with the results that our biochemists obtained in wet-lab experiments. After explaining what microcompartments are and why we use them, we introduce our collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team and their project, the Star Peptide, which is a possible alternative to the use of microcompartments.
DcmA catalysis
DcmA is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of DCM and is expressed in M.extorquens under the control of the regulatory protein DcmR. This enzyme is a member of the glutathione-S-transferase family. We propose the following plausible mechanism for the catalytic dehalogenation of dichloromethane by DcmA, in which glutathione (RSH) is a co-factor:

This is the area in our wiki dedicated to thanking everyone that really made this project and trip to Boston happen. Many institutions, companies and individuals have given us immense support and should be recognized. A very special thank you to RAIN Incubator for allowing us to use their labs and other facilities free of charge for this project, and a huge thank you to Judy Nguyen, our mentor and leader. Without her guidance and training there would really be no Tacoma RAINmakers.
During the 2018 competition, we successfully performed a wide array of tasks, including learning how to perform molecular cloning, coding an elegant wiki page, performing meaningful educational outreach events, conducting interviews with industry experts, and understanding how the arsenic sensor can help our community. It’s important that we recognize those who have helped our team so much.

Stuttgart, Hamburg, TU_Darmstadt, JMU_Wuerzburg, ETH Zurich, and BOKU-Vienna performed the complete Vibrigens InterLab experiment. Thessaloniki and NTNU_Trondheim each performed a growth curve experiment. The measurements from iGEM Hamburg cannot be used for evaluation since the negative control showed a higher fluorescence than the positive control at times. This is likely due to a contamination or a pipetting error.
Unfortunately, the other three teams on the list couldn’t produce results due to various reasons. The Valencia_UPV Team got their own Vibrio natriegens from CECT, listed as the same strain we use.
They encountered problems with transformation. We think this might have to do with the strain used, since most other teams were able to insert their plasmids using our strain. Regrettably we don’t trust this website to have the right strain, because in the description of the organism it lists Vibrio natriegens as an Archaea. TU-Eindhoven couldn’t finish the experiments due to issues not related to the Vibrigens InterLab. NAWI_Graz had no valued measurements and were missing two of the devices, because they broke during transportation and the plates were too moist.

Red light switches Cph8 Pr to a far red–absorbing state (Pfr), which dephosphorylates phospho-OmpR, deactivating the transcription of OmpR. So the inverter has no effect and RFPs are continuously transcribed.

In the blue light-inducible system, FixK2 promoter is the downstream signalling promoter of YF1/FixJ blue light-sensing system. The YF1/FixJ system becomes inactive when illuminated by blue otherwise active. An inverter is placed behind FixK2 promoter.
In the absence of blue light, YF1 phosphorylates FixJ that activates FixK2 promoter, allowing the transcription of lambda CI, thus repressing the amilCP output (Blue Chromophore Protein).
Fig.5
In light, however, YF1/FixJ has no effect on FixK2 promoter, which in turn has near-zero activity. The lambda CI repressor concentration drops, eventually amilCP will be produced.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune a community and a platform for long term sustainability.
SEE OUR WORK WITH NONA
NONA and the iGEM Community
We mentioned that our team could give NONA a hand. Indeed, Neptune is the first iGEM project to be placed on NONA, and in our discussions with NONA we found that our team could pave the way for future iGEM teams that want to have a place for their software tools.
The Problem: iGEM software tools get lost
Each year, software solutions to synthetic biology problems are generated from teams around the world. iGEM software tools are especially prone to losing support or community after they are developed, as teams that developed those tools for the competition often find it hard to maintain those projects in the years thereafter. And worse yet, there have been dozens of software tools to come from iGEM, and none of these tools have a clear or coherent locations where they can be found.
The Solution: NONA to protect iGEM software tools
Our team offers itself as a point of contact for NONA at the iGEM Giant Jamboree this year. We want to extend the hand to other iGEM teams that have developed amazing tools, but are worried about how these tools will be maintained in the future. We will have an active NONA “about” booth at our Jamboree table, where we will provide information about what NONA is, how NONA can help iGEM teams with software, and information about how these teams can contribute their tools to NONA. We will also actively help these teams contact NONA and we’ll give them information on how to properly send their tools to NONA, expediting the integration process.
We are very excited that Neptune is now part of the NONA software tool platform. We are even more excited about the incredibly potential of integrating iGEM software tools with NONA. We envision a future where iGEM is integrated with NONA such that NONA has an entire section dedicated to tools developed by iGEM teams.

TACG Biotech                         helped us contact TSINGKE Biotech to explore the source of synthetic genes and GENERAL SYSTEMS to learn more                         about commercial gene synthesis technology .
On top of the above, CTO Peng also introduced us to the most promising applications of current                         gene                         synthesis                         technology, employing DNA as a data storage medium to achieve high-density long-term                         preservation                         of                         data. In                         theory, only about 1 kilogram of DNA powder is needed to store all the data in the world today,                         yes,                         all of it! It                         is indeed startling! However, due to the high cost of synthesis and the hysteresis of                         sequencing                         reads,                         the                         technology has not been widely promoted. At present, many companies and research groups in the                         world                         are doing                         related research in this field. The description of CTO Peng inspired us to take the advantage                         of                         the                         utility of DNA                         storage to make DNA time capsules that store the kids’ dreams. And this was implemented later.                         (DNA                         time capsule                         link)
Genome mosaic scheme design:
There exists a low GC content and a very uneven distribution in the wild-type mitochondrial                         genome,                         presenting many                         GC-rich regions and AT-rich regions, as well as multiple repeat sequences. This is really a                         disaster                         for the                         splicing of the entire genome. Based on their experience, TACG Biotech suggested that we divide                         the                         entire gene                         combination so that the interface sequences between the fragments can be free of these complex                         sequence                         regions,                         thus facilitating subsequent splicing. For the synthesis of these individual fragments, TACG                         Biotech                         used the Oligo                         design software they developed to help us design these Oligos. The technique is to synthesize                         the                         longer Oligo                         containing the complex sequence areas. Of course, there will be some increase in the cost of                         synthesis,                         but it is                         worthwhile.
Genome synthesis：
Genome synthesis is a study that entails plenty of funds. After learning our financial                         predicament                         this                         year, TACG                         Biotech has generously opened the lab to us, providing us with most of the financial support                         needed                         to                         complete the                         synthesis. TACG Biotech aided us in synthesizing most of the kb-level fragments, and                         specifically                         guided the                         subsequent integration of the entire genome, which is essential for our whole project.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," It was really inspiring and lovely to see what the other teams had accomplished during the previous months.
7th of September 2015
On the 7th of September it was time for the real event. The invited public consisted of people who had expertise in government affairs, synthetic biology, and industries, and therefore look at synthetic biology from different perspectives. The aim of the day was to create a discussion about the advances in technology that may have a large impact on society and industry.
Introduction to synthetic biology from different viewpoints
The day started with an introduction into synthetic biology, taught by Jack Pronk, a professor at the TU Delft. He gave a lot of insights in what kind of opportunities synthetic biology could give in terms of research and development. The next talk was given by Dr. Bart Wesselink, RIVM. He discussed the meaning of sustainability in the biobased economy and industry. He succeeded in relating the subject of synthetic biology to the social and economical impacts of a biobased way of thinking. The last presenter was Dr. Dirk Stemerding, senior researcher “technology assessment” at the Rathenau institute, who expressed feelings surrounding the implications of synthetic biology and that social debate is necessary. He related this thought to the Ecover case, a producer of cleaning products. Ecover did not want to use any palm oil for their products and therefore decided to use genetically modified algae for the production of oil. However, this raised a lot of resistance from people who thought oil produced by genetically modified algae was not ‘natural’, while palm oil was. According to Stemerding, this case illustrated an early warning. This talk was the most related to what we understand as the main goal of the “Policy and Practice analysis” of iGEM. We, as an iGEM team, should encourage debate, education and maybe even acceptance.
iGEM teams and related discussions
After a short break the stage was ready for the Dutch iGEM teams to pitch their projects, and what their views were of iGEM in the synthetic biology world. First to start was our project, represented by Max van ‘t Hof and Michelle Post and our DIY printer. iGEM aims to be a platform that informs the world about synthetic biology, via students who are open-minded about ethical issues. In this way, it can reach a large public. This is combined with full transparency on all achievement reached by its participants, in both our wiki and the iGEM database. We described our concerns about being transparent and therefore being an open source for people who haven’t been in contact with iGEM"
Arizona_State,2016,Team:Arizona State#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," addition, these 5 Senders will be tested using mass spectrometry to further measure AHL production. This data will be available on the parts pages of each Sender, which will confirm that the AHL is being produced within our chassis.
Induction Plates
In order to begin testing of our Senders, we plated the Senders in BL21(DE3) E. coli alongside a positive GFP control, F2620 (LuxR), and a negative receiver control. The positive control was used as a visual standard for GFP expression in F2620, which, if shown to fluoresce, meant that induction by the AHL Sender was occurring. The 10 induction plates along with a negative sender control are shown below:
From these results, it can be shown that 8/10 systems induced F2620, with Las and Sin being the two exceptions. Las was shown to induce by the Canton Lab(2008), so the lack of induction could be due to a molecular diffusion issue. Fluorescence found in the middle of the plate by the Senders themselves was likely due to mCherry production, which was constitutively produced alongside the AHL. A more comprehensive induction test using a plate reader was done afterwards to test these results. Of the 8 systems that induced F2620, Esa showed the greatest level of induction, even greater than that of the native system Lux. This is likely due to the fact that Esa and Lux produce the same AHL molecule and the Esa construct may be more capable of efficient AHL production than that of Lux. The images gathered suggest that many of these systems are not entirely orthogonal to Lux, and that some degree of crosstalk will occur between these networks. SinI remains the top candidate for orthogonality with F2620.
F2620 Induction Tests
Once the production of AHLs by the Senders was tested via the OD test and gas chromatography as well as induction plates, the direct interaction between the Senders and the well-characterized Bba_F2620 by Barry Canton and Anna Labno from MIT was tested. This system originates from the Lux system and is well-understood, which will likely provide the most immediate utility. This test will aim to determine orthogonality between the Senders and F2620 while also providing a direct comparison between systems' inductive capabilities.
The Induction test was done by extracting AHLs from the supernatant of a liquid culture and then plating with uninduced cells. This was done at a 10% and 50% AHL concentration, as well as 3 negative controls and 1"

Also, decided today to scrap multimeric proteins, despite all the work I'd done on them. Putting your TetR together before you can use it is just a pain, transcribing/translating it twice before you can use it is a pain, representing larger protein complexes accurately in SL is nearly impossible, and it all adds very little of value to the simulation. Removing this functionality was surprisingly easy to do without introducing any new bugs, and the unbind screen in the HUD still remains useful for getting your now single object proteins to detach from DNA.
The only reason that I might resuse the type of binding I had before, is if I have time to introduce cofactors to the sim. It only makes sense for IPTG to associate with LacI, for example, and this would add quite a lot of power to the simulation.

As the usage of the applet increases, more and more people are paying attention to our project. Some of them made comments on the applet. among these comments, what people concerned most is the sanitation problem, especially cockroaches. Many people feel those lives are tough, and they harbour in nutritious and damp places, so dining places such as canteens and restaurants are vulnerable places. In the high-risk areas, everyone is deeply worried about the quality of their daily diet. At the same time, there are many people who want to get some basic knowledge about cockroaches through our applet platform, especially about how to kill and how to curb excessive reproduction. In order to solve everyone's concern and meet everyone's needs, we plan to carry out two activities.
First of all, we interviewed the manager of the catering industry. We chose to interview the school cafeteria where people who eat more frequent and the food reserves is more abundant. From the manager's interview, we know that the dining hall had done a lot for cockroach control. When we are still sleeping, they have to start sifting vegetables to prevent insects from being mixed in the meat. After the meal, they sprayed around the canteen and the dining hall to drive away the cockroaches and flies. However, they still can't eliminate cockroaches completely after doing so much. In order to make students eat healthily, they have to enlarge the investment on food sanitation especially cockroach control. This also increased the effort of pest disinfection and increased the consumption of funds.
Then, in order to meet the needs of the public about knowing knowledge about prevention and control more accurately, we went to Shenzhen Nanshan District Center for Disease"

Dr. Domenico Bellomo
Department: Molecular Cellphysiology, VU
Team role: Instructor
Domenico is a postdoc in the Systems Bioinformatics IBIVU at the VU University Amsterdam. Trained as an electrical engineer with a specialization in systems and control theory, he now enjoys himself as a computational biologist. He is interested in understanding the decision & control machinery of the cell (systems biology), and in tinkering with it (synthetic biology). Since 2008, he has joined different iGEM teams  as instructor and is still not fed up with it...
Dr. Pernette Verschure
Department: Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, UvA
Team role: Instructor and advisor
Pernette Verschure is Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam, leading a research team focusing on the rules that dictate mammalian epigenetic gene regulation using a systems and synthetic biology approach. She is very enthusiastic about using the rational design of synthetic cell systems to uncover systems behavior ultimately providing tools and solutions for public health problems. Presently, Pernette is instructor and advisor of the iGEM team. Pernette is exceedingly positive about student learning through the iGEM competition, since it clearly stimulates creativity of multidisciplinary students. It also gives students a taste of their future careers as independent scientists by making them responsible for their own fund raising and PR as well as socio-public awareness.

Uppsala-Sweden,2011,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"3x5F. We decided to do PCR again by using primer PEG3x5F2 as a template, PEG3x5F and PEG3x5R as primers in order to check the functionality of the primers PEG3x5F2. The new result was to short bands on the gel. The primer PEG3x5F2 doesn't work and we need to design and order new primers.  The mutagensis product of ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI showed accurate length on the gel and was therefore re-circulized.

St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a primer design tutorial set up for the following Monday.  All this success left us with one very important and so far unanswered question- how exactly are we going to assay all this?"" (Team Member Hannah Taylor, Week One Report, 12/06/2012)
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
Research into polyunsaturated fatty acids has been active for over 15 years, with successes varying from creating transgenic plants enriched in ω-3 fatty acids to expressing an entire synthetic pathway from a gene clusters extracted from marine bacteria. We want to expand on this area of research by attempting to express a aerobic synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in E.coli, which has never been done before. By combining the genes of the cyanobacteria Synechococcus and trypanosome T. brucei into E.coli, this vector should be able to synethise a unsaturated fatty acid up to at least 22-carbon length!
This week, our team has been focusing on preliminary research by reading relevant scientific papers and understanding the various pathways and methods of recombination. We’re focusing on groundwork research done in the early 1990s that appears to have fallen off the radar, and are excited to see where this path will take us!
Week 2
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
Using E. Coli DH5-alpha: good at replicating vectors but not good at expression Using pGEX-6P-1 vector with internal GST tag, selected with ampicillin http://ecoliwiki.net/colipedia/index.php/pGEX-6P-1 (further information via the “source” link) Purpose:
First day: incorporate desired vectors into vector-replicating E.Coli and incubate them on selective plates to select out recombinant colonies with antibiotics
Second day: incubate the selected colonies in large quantities for vector harvesting
Third day: harvest vector from cell pellet thus pure vector miniprep.
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
This week, we took the first steps to put our grand scheme into laboratorial action! It also occurred to us that if we started calling ourselves DJ Omega 3 & the Fatty Acids, we would intimidate the other squad.
First of all, we chose a vector to work in, pET-15B. We started looking into promoters suitable for both the vector and the chain of genes we want to express, and figured out how to use the Registry of Standard Parts. The next step was to design primers for all four of the genes of our pathway - and that was certainly"
DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"U Biobuilders participated and presented our project “Yeastilization - from waste to value” in front of many bio-interested students and professors.  The event was a great opportunity for us to tell about our project and share our passion of biotechnology with like minded.
DTU BlueDot
The DTU BioBuilders team is recognized by DTU as a “Blue Dot Project”. DTU Blue Dot is the story of a sustainable society, where students work as real-life engineers.
Being a DTU Blue Dot project is great honour which shows that DTU acknowledge the work that we put into iGEM and the importance of the projects that we contrive.
“The name ’Blue Dot’ refers to the Earth, which - although it is huge - looks like a small blue dot when viewed from space. While big ideas can appear simple and tangible when seen from the outside, from the inside they are often rather intricate and complex. The name ’Blue Dot’ thus also refers to an engineer’s ability to remain focus and see the big picture while simultaneously delving into the details in order to solve problems and challenges.” - DTU
Open House
The open house event at DTU is a possibility for younger students to visit the University to hear about the study lines and meet students already enrolled at DTU.  We seized this great opportunity for us to impact students even before they are attending university, and of course spread the word about synthetic biology and the cool things we are doing in the iGEM competition.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," that governs the state of a sensor. Its counterpart, the deactivation rate is the backward rate of the same rule and is constant. The activation rate is calculated as the integral over all space of the product of the sensor's frequency response with the frequency spectrum of the incident light.
This images shows the red light sensor (Cph8) being activated by incident light with a wavelength spectrum in the form of a sine wave. The red line shows the absorbtion spectrum of Cph8, the black line is the incident light spectrum and the filled in blue area is the area under the curve of the product between the two. This gives us the activation rate for the sensor which in this case is a very high 913.3643. Such a high rate will cause the sensors to be activated permanently
This has two important implications. Firstly it means that the sensor will not be activated by light that has no overlap between its spectrum and the frequency response of the sensor. Secondly there will be a saturation point at high intensity light where increasing the intensity will not appreciably affect the system as the activation rate will dominate the deactivation rate. These characteristics are representative of those of the light sensitive proteins being used.
Biological pathway simulation
Our stochastic model is comprised of red, green and a blue light activated pathways. Using multiple runs of the simulation, the stability of the tri-chromatic control system, its pigment balance, and image development time can all be tested in-silico. These have implications for future projects that might use a similar system and the model provides a platform for others to build on in the future.
Each pathway is independent in their signalling but shares the common resources of the cell. The independent variable is the activation rate of each light sensor species, this is determined by the incident light and effects the expression of pigments, the dependant variable.
This image is an alpha run of our stochastic model. It shows the populations of the cyan, magenta and yellow pigments over time in a single cell. In this simulation all three light sensor had the same activation rate
The Kappa model describes in detail the pathway specific biochemistry and includes simplified descriptions of pathway related biochemistry. For example, the controlled transcription and translation of pigment proteins is described in full, but the constitutive transcription and translation of light sensor proteins is simplified. The rates were created to recreate experimental results recorded in literature. With experimental results this model can be readily updated to accurately describe our system.
All molecule species, with the exception DNA, are constitutively expressed. Molecule species apart from DNA, RNA polymerase and ribosomes have spontaneous decay"

Friday: Fun day with the BU iGem team. We went to the MFA for some out of lab culture absorption. While we did wander through a good portion of the museum, most notably, we went to see the Michelangelo exhibit and Samurai armor exhibit. It was really amazing. The BU iGem team then returned back to their lab as they still had work to do, but the majority of the Wellesley team then went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, which was beautiful.
Week 6: July 1 - July 5
Monday: We have decided to make Eugenie into a surface application rather than a web application based on the limitations we have discovered while attempting to develop Eugenie as a web-application. It's time to dust off the C# hats. Together, the Eugenie team discussed the backend coding that would be required for creating the surface application.
Tuesday: We created a paper prototype for the surface application version of Eugenie, and created a video to show to the BU iGem team. Then we began trying to fix the drag-and-drop in the surface application in the afternoon.
Wednesday: We continued to work on drag-and-drop for Eugenie now on the surface. It is giving some trouble, and our deadline for getting it to work is Monday. The stress is mounting, but we will overcome it together. We went to a talk given by Dr. Jagan Srinivasan, who works with C. elegans and how they communicate using scent. He has done some great work, and was a great speaker.
Thursday: Happy 4th of July!
Saturday: Worked on drag and drop. Touching the items causes them to disappear, but we are unable to drag the items. The item
Sunday: Success with drag and drop! We finally managed to get the items to drag and drop, though they were appearing at a random half of the screen. It took us the longest time to finally find where the drag target was, but once that happened, progress was made!

Project Description
The world’s cutest extremophile is the tardigrade, a multicellular microscopic organism found in almost every environment on earth. Also known as ‘water bears’, these little creatures can survive the dryness and cold of outer space when in their cryptobiotic state.  We transferred the tardigrade proteins thought to be responsible for this amazing resilience to other organisms to see if they provided protection from desiccation. Our results suggest that these proteins could be valuable additives to bacterial cultures and protein formulations, potentially acting as a preservative during storage.
Since tardigrades are somewhere between C. elegans and Drosophila on the tree of life and have limbs, they are attractive models for studying development. We investigated how this might be achieved by using CRISPR to knock out tardigrade genes implicated in development.
Additionally, we developed a novel qPCR-based method for measuring plasmid copy number.
For full description please see the full project description page .
Accomplishments
We uploaded 16 new parts to the online registry.
We synthesized and submitted 9 new DNA parts (see parts page for complete list).
We characterized 2 new parts we submitted ( BBa_K2128100 and BBa_K2128104 )
We improved the characterization of pSB1C3 , the iGem standard submission backbone, by using qPCR to better quantify copy number .
Collaborated with 3 other iGEM teams : Stony Brook, BioBrick Foundation, and University of Georgia Teams
Ran 3 public engagement events around synthetic biology and use of CRISPR
Integrated human practices into project design when using CRISPR
Improved characterization of pSB1C3 by developing a new method to measure copy number more precisely
Demonstrated that tardigrade proteins can protect E. coli from desiccation.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes and tubes this summer, far from it. Choosing such a complex strategy against cholera required to carefully think about where we were heading to.
Our starting point has been long discussions with NGOs, professionals and the general public .  This led us to carefully think our project in both the iGEM scope and its application on the field.
In the iGEM prospect, Modeling was our best friend to design our project, ensure its feasibility, predict its strengths and limits, and orientate our experimentations.
In the application prospect, ethical matrixes were built to evaluate the social and human issues of our invention considering autonomy, fairness and welfare.
Combined to our experimental results, both prospects led to our first device prototype, whose application was analyzed through a Scope Statement and a business plan .
We were also amazed during this project by the richness of microbial biodiversity. We used resources from bacteria to crocodile, from nematode to yeasts. This we wanted to share with the public and we deeply committed in the process ( practical sessions for schools and highschools, press, and scientific exhibitions participation and organization, a conference ) . But what we are the most proud of our card game MicroBioWorld , a great and innovative pedagogical tool.
The intense efforts we have accomplished in all these aspects of the project lead us to ask for the judges attention about the following price:
Applied Design
Modeling
Integrated Human Practices
Entrepreneurship

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The PCR amplicons of the colony PCR performed on 12-06-2018 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
Unfortunately, the PCR reaction did not result in the required PCR amplicons. However, the positive control colony (pACYCDuet-1) did also not results in any PCR amplicon. Therefore, it is likely that the PCR reaction itself was not successful and needs to be repeated.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#The Jellyfish Factory_-_-_TEXT.html," each bucket, already half-full of seawater, and would then take the buckets to the cutters. Two cutters cut the jellyfish with the machines that were installed side-by-side: the cutter would place a jellyfish onto the cutting board, quickly rotate it with a peg to spread out the edge of the umbrella where the light organs are located, and then-pushing the jellyfish to the cutting blade while simultaneously rotating the jellyfish quickly-cut off the rings, all in less than 5 seconds. The rings would fall automatically into the ice-cold reservoir, and the ringless jellyfish body was slid down into a waste bucket. These buckets, each filled with about 200 spent jellyfish, were carried to the nearest seashore about 50 yard away, called by us “jellyfish cliff,” and dumped onto the rocks below. The heaps of jellyfish bodies, several thousands of them, were carried away by the next high tide.
The process of extracting aequorin from rings began at 2 PM; it was carried out by a team of two persons. The extraction was done in batches of 480 rings (i.e., six buckets). The first person would drain the rings on a nylon gauze, then mix the drained rings with a cold EDTA solution saturated with ammonium sulfate. The rings shrank quickly and were also desensitized by the salt. They were cut with scissors into pieces l-2 inches long, then stirred with a cake mixer for 10 minutes to dislodge the granular light organs from the tissue. The mixture was squeezed through a nylon gauze to remove the shrunken ring tissue, and then the turbid liquid obtained was filtered on a Buchner funnel using some Celite. The filter cake, containing the light organs, was given to the second person, who was responsible for the rest of the extraction process. The second person put the filter cake into a 2-liter flask containing cold EDTA solution (1 liter), then shook the flask vigorously to extract aequorin from the light organs into the EDTA solution. Finally, the mixture was filtered through a large Buchner funnel, and the filtrate containing aequorin was saturated with ammonium sulfate to precipitate the protein. The first person in the team would start a new batch of rings every 20 minutes, and the second person’s work would also take 20 minutes. Thus, 3360 jellyfish rings could be extracted in about 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The precipitates of crude aequorin were purified at our laboratory in Princeton."

When handing their products over to consumers, Blacktrace noted that they spent the most time covering thorough cleaning of microfluidic devices. When receiving a chip for the first time, many users underestimated the impact a tiny blockage or strand of hair can have. Although we cannot offer a two-day training seminar for researchers using our chips, this feedback led to us including the “Cleaning” tutorial video and protocol in Microfluidics 101. To see these protocols, please click here.
We were also able to discuss their quality control motto which is to avoid testing every chip and instead ensure their fabrication process is airtight. Although this did not feed into our Fluid Functionality checklist directly, it inspired us to broaden the MARS archive through tutorial and how-to videos. Through this we will be able to streamline and simplify our workflow in order to reduce the number of errors future users experience.
