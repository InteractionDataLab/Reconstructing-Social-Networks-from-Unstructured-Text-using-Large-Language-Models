Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Achivements_-_-_TEXT.html," on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy
Requirements
Our bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The first stage of worm culturing.
2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
Transcriptomics
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!                                       As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Figure 3: Flowchart representing the trancsriptomics outline.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these"

To see if we could increase the hirudin production rate, we tried changing the concentration of DNA.
[Fig 3]
We ran the simulations from 10 nM to 100 nM of DNA at 10 nM intervals. We see that increasing the amount of DNA can reduce the time taken to threshold, however, there is saturation at high concentrations of DNA. Further increasing the DNA concentration in our simulations revealed that it is unable to reduce the threshold time to lower than 20 minutes (at 3 μM of DNA), which is still too slow to inhibit blood coagulation.
Another initial condition that could be changed is the amount of excess TetR that is not bound to a promoter. To reduce chances of leakage, we assumed that the amount of TetR added to the kit will be higher than the amount of DNA. However, these excess TetR will competitively inhibit cruzipain cleavage of the TetR that is bound to the promoters. This can be seen in the graph below
[Fig 4]
[Fig 5]
We ran simulations at different concentrations of excess TetR from 0 nM to 50 nM, but found very little difference in the hirudin threshold time.
Finally, we ran a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to determine the most suitable parameters to change to have the best impact on the hirudin production rate.

Aims and Methods:
Please refer to July 29th and July 30th
Results and Discussion:
As it turns out the naked PCR product Switch BioBrick failed to be transformed, whilst the positive control worked. We found out that the efficiency and probability of transformation to works with just naked PCR product is very low. So, we then planned to clone it into a plasmid first before transforming it into our Bacillus subtilis.
Visualising L-forms under Microfluidics
We created a silicon wafer of the mother machine using the master mold courtesy of Sunny Park . Once the wafer set we removed any impurities using a combination of dd.H2O, acetone, and isopropanol. In order to let the silicon wafer hold together we heated with plasma under vacuum condition. We then load L-forms with two different tags on them (GFP and mCherry expression). The results showed potential endosymbiosis or cell fusion between the L-forms.
Cell wall modelling
Opened the peptidoglycan biosynthesis model in copasi, to try and understand what was happening. The species names were particularly complicated so we attempted to simplify them, whilst making clear what was being referred to. There are 54 species so this took some time.

I realized how very quickly each of our groups has specialized to the point that I have to concentrate deeply to understand what seems to be second nature to members of the phage group. That’s good! It means each of our groups is moving along nicely. The objective of the phage project is to make a library of sizes - the biggest and smallest phage capsids possible using phages that have already been well characterized and approved for medicinal purposes. One group is working on selecting for the largest phage possible, one for the smallest, and another group is developing a method to purify both phages as they are made.

We visited the Instituto Hamilton, a private school, with the purpose of carrying out three of the experiments that are included in our Handbook so we could prove with veracity the usefulness and to start gathering opinions from what could be the future users: children and teachers.
Before doing this, we talked directly with the Principal of the school to schedule one hour per group so we could carry out the experiment and the little surveys. We lasted three hours in total to cover six groups of approximately 20 children each. To follow the age range established, we taught two group from each of the following grades: 1ª, 3ª, and 6ª (it's important to consider that in Mexico, elementary school lasts six years). The first graders worked in creating a Water Filter. The third graders learned how impressive could be a Volcano Explosion while the sixth graders loved the creation of crystals to simulate geode`s creation.
We arrived early in the morning to the institution with all the materials prepared since the day before. As soon as the kids saw us, they started jumping and yelling with excitement as they had already been told what they were going to be doing with us.

Meanwhile, we need to develop new antibiotics, which can sufficiently eliminate the pathogenic bacteria without affecting beneficial and harmless bacteria such as the well-known gut bacterium Escherichia coli (Witte et al., 2008).
c-di-AMP
What a good antibiotic should target? The answer has been given by Dr. Sven Halbedel. From his point of view, a good antibacterial target should:
● be essential for growth/ virulence of pathogenic bacteria
● have no homolog in humans
● be pleiotropic
● have no suppressors
● be conserved among pathogenic bacteria
Of all those possible targets for novel antibiotics, c-di-AMP is the ""shining star"". Though very recently discovered (in the year 2008), it has already caught a lot of attention. It is the only known essential signaling nucleotide. It exists and plays a vital role in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Meanwhile its trace has never been found in known beneficial Gram-negative bacteria nor human beings. With all these reasons, c-di-AMP and its regulatory compartments become the most heated targets of interest in the development of new antibacterial substances.
Therefore the iGEM Team Göttingen addresses the problem of multi-resistant bacteria by targeting c-di-AMP,the achilles heel of our enemy.

Our project is aimed at finding a way to fight against multi-resistant bacteria by targeting c-di-AMP. We made three different approaches.
We built two reporter systems which enable us to visualize the level of c-di-AMP (accomplished by Reporter Team ).
We also searched for the genes in Bacillus subtilis, whose expression level is affected by the level of c-di-AMP. We found ydaO and identified a Riboswitch upstream of its open reading frame, which responds to"

Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Modeling#ParameterEstimation_-_-_TEXT.html," is then a measure of how good the model fits the measured data with             respect to the three paramters $k_\text{aSNP}$, $k_\text{dSNP}$, and $k_\text{MG}$ given that all other parameters are set.  The objective is             then to minimize the penalty $f(\theta)$ under the stated conditions. This was done in MATLAB 2017a using LSQNONLIN which is a nonlinear least             squares solver which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Fig. 2 shows the resulting fit and one can see that the model manages to catch the             structure from the dose-response data. The resulting parameters were estimated as $\text{k}_\text{aSNP} = 4.61 \cdot 10^{-4}$             nm-1min-1, $\text{k}_\text{dSNP} = 3.81 \cdot 10^{-6}$ min-1 and $\text{k}_\text{MG} = 0.168$ min-1.
Figure 2: Fitting the model to the dose response scheme for the NahR system taken from the iGEM parts registry documentation                   page . As indicated by the figure, the model manages to capture the sigmoidal appeareance.
Regarding the validity of this estimation, it might seem ambiguous due to the ansatz of 100 nM induction base level. However, at the maximal             induction level, this yields an expression of approximately 9000 nM of protein per cell. Assuming a molecular weight of 30kDa (a GFP has about 27             kDa) and a cell concentration of $2 \cdot 10^9$ cells per milliliter for an overnight culture [3], this would correspond to a yield of $0.432$ µg/mL, which is regarded as reasonable. In addition, the transcription rate constant was estimated as $\text{k}_\text{MG}=0.168$             min-1 which is slightly higher than the transcription rate $\text{k}_\text{MR}$ for the lac repressor but lower than the ones             estimated for NahR and GFP10-ER-GFP11. This indicates that although the exact value might not be correct as the proposed model is coarse, it is             likely to at least lie within the right order of magnitude.
To conclude, the ad hoc proposition of 100 nM base induction level seem reasonable as it yields plausible expression levels. In addition,             the estimated transcription rate of the GFP1-9 transcript conforms with the"

Asian Conference
Introduction
We are a bunch of teenagers who have profound dreams. When facing the recent food safety issues in Taiwan, we will never allow such problems  from happening again. We will think of some biological engineering ways to ease all the unstableness. Cooperating with 6 univeristies and 11 laboratories, we wish to proclaim our philosophies and achievements while presenting and exchanging ideas during the Asian Confernece, letting people to eventually know our profound dreams and carefully listen to our inner voices.
Preparation
In order to show our decent performances during the conference, we went early to the school to practice. We also invited our parents to listen to us presenting the project and then gave us some suggestions and encouragements.
The First Day
[17:00] Drizzles tickle down today, yet they cannot throw cold water on our passions. We arrives at NTCU to attend a special carnival.
[18:00~19:00] Dinner time~ At first, people don’t know well about each other. Probabaly through having dinner together, we can get to know other groups as well.
[20:00~ ] Meeting each other~ Every groups has to introduce their own schools on the stage. Some even give out talent shows. We HSNU-TAIPEI choose to sing a Chinese song called “100 suns and moons”with guitars, hoping everyone can feel our “sunlike”passions.
The Second Day
[8:00~9:00] Breakfast time~ During the breakfast time, we can look at others’ posters and also ask some questions regrading to their unique projects.
[9:00~9:10] Opening Ceremony
[9:10~9:40] Professors deliver speeches

Then selecting the positive clone, we used electroporation to transform plasmid TargetF (Figure 4) with a pair of specific sgRNA, and a piece of homologous DNA (Figure 5) which consists of the two gene segments located at the either side of tnaA. Guiding by the sgRNA, Cas9, a nuclease, cut the tnaA segment, leaving a leakage between the two homologous DNA. The cell tended to keep the chromosome integrity, so there was the probability to repair the leakage with the piece of homologous DNA we transformed before, because they have two paired sequences on either side. Also, we gave higher-fold of homologous DNA to increase this probability. After the whole process, we needed to cure the exogenous DNA we introduced.

Fragrance introducing
Then we devoted our effort to introducing diversified odor to make our roses not only vivid ones with traditional flower fragrance, but unique ones with more kinds of odor like lemon and rain. So we improved part of the iGEM project of Paris_Bettencourt in 2014 [4]by putting their parts into our RGB system and under the control of light. What’s more, we also made some adjustments to the concentrations of substrates provided by Paris_Bettencourt in 2014[5]. As tested in the LIGHT TO COLOR , the RGB system functioned well, no matter whether the actuators was fluorescent proteins or enzymes. But for further validation, we used HPLC to detect the products of our actuators.
We constructed a plasmid (BBa_K2598062) containing lims1 (BBa_K2598060), gds (BBa_K2598058), bmst1 (BBa_K2598059) as actuators, which produced the smell of lemon, rain and flower respectively. The function of the system and the actuators was shown in Table 1. Then we transformed the plasmids of RGB system into E.coli, cultured the bacteria by 96-well plates and induced the expression of odor enzymes by light. (More details, please see Hardware ).

--CS-- Today we did the colony PCR for the transformed BLa E. coli that Julie had made at the end of last week. We followed the given protocol and used 7 white colonies and 1 red colony (definitely not recombined) in the PCR. Realizing that I would need a ton of the iGEM backbone plasmid (pIG91) for all of the different genes that I would be making standard parts for, I also transformed 2 μl of the previously isolated pIG91 into thawed DH5α according to the given protocol and grew it up in 5 ml LB+Cam overnight in the 37°C incubator shaker.

--JR--Ran a gel to verify PCR. Colonies 1, and 4-7 look good. Set up overnights.
--CS-- Today I did the plasmid preps of the pIG91-transformed DH5α that I grew up yesterday according to the protocol in the kit. I also confirmed that there was DNA in the products by measuring the DNA concentration with the NanoDrop. All of the samples had concentrations about 300 ng/μl and 260/280 ratios near 1.8 so they looked great. I recorded the concentrations on the tubes and put them in the freezer. I also ran our PCR products from our colony PCR on gels. Our colonies 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all had bands, meaning that these colonies were a success in terms of cloning and transformation. Julie also started overnight liquid cultures of these colonies from the streak plates that she made.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure (12): Relative beneficial effect of the different PtNTT2 variants.
As expected, the native transporter variant shows the highest positive effect since it most likely also exhibits the highest activity. Surprisingly, the two truncated versions show a higher effect than the versions with a pelB and TAT signal peptide.
Of all transporter variants, the native PtNTT2 showed the highest beneficial effect with a value of 1.360 ± 0.161. The second highest value was reached by PtNTT2(31-575) with 1.294 ± 0.107. PtNTT2(66-575) reached a value of 1.166 ± 0.105, pelB-SP-PtNTT2 one of 1.073 ± 0.114 and TAT-SP-PtNTT2 one of 0.732 ± 0.116.    This data suggests that the expression of different PtNTT2 variants, especially of the native PtNTT2, is beneficial for the cell when cultivated in MOPS minimal media supplemented with ATP as the sole phosphate source. Given that the reference strain does not express PtNTT2, the expression of PtNTT2 must have a beneficial effect for the cells since they grow better compared to the reference in ATP when compared to the reference in K2HPO4. Therefore, the beneficial effect is larger than the metabolic burden associated with recombinant protein expression. Consequently, the transporter exhibits a function beneficial to the cell in ATP supplemented media, meaning it can facilitate the direct uptake of ATP from the media.
Subcellular Localization of PtNTT2
To investigate the subcellular localization of the different PtNTT2 variants, GFP fusion proteins were constructed. Each PtNTT2 variant was tagged with a cMyc epitope tag as a linker and GFP (BBa_E0040). The cells were cultivated and prepared for microscopy as described in the methods section. Microscopy was performed using the Zeiss LSM 700. The pictures shown in figure (13) were taken at 100x magnification and clearly show the subcellular localization of the different PtNTT2 variants.

Team Activity Test:
What a day! The deadline is coming closer and we still had (!) a lot of measurements to do, so today was chosen to be a day full of important measurements. First we measured the activity of the TVEL0 and BPUL in a CuCl gradient. As well we examined what our BPUL laccase does when its supposed to work in different pHs. BPUL was additionally characterized regarding its behavior in different concentrations of MeOH and acetonitrile. This output is of course most interesting for Team Substrate Analytics.
Comparison of activity of ECOL in sodium acetate buffer and Britton-Robinson buffer, measured at OD420 respectively.
Since we already compared the behaviour of TVEL0 in the environment of sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) and Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5), respectively, we also compared BPUL and ECOL in those buffers. ECOL is not impressed by the two different buffer systems and thus not influenced in it´s activity.
BPUL laccase activity measured via ABTS and OD420 under usage of different pHs of sodium actate buffer. The results show a high activity at pH 5.
Negative control for pH measurements using ABTS. ABTS is oxidized through havy metals like Cu, which we are using for laccase activity tests. At different tested pHs ABTS gets oxidized but not very fast allowing us to leave it outer consideration.
BPUL laccase activity measured with different concentration of CuCl showing that an incubation with 0.6 mM CuCl is optimal for the laccae activity, but higher CuCl concentrations seem to interfere in the activity.
Negative control for analyzing the oxidization of ABTS by different CuCl concentrations. An effect on the oxidization of ABTS is clearly distinguishable, but between the applied concentrations there is no difference in OD420.
Characterization of the activity of BPUL with sodium acetate buffer and Briton-Robinson Buffer at pH 5. Using the Briton-Robinson Buffer the saturation of BPUL activity is reached slower but stays constant. With sodium acetate buffer the maximum is reached considerably earlier.

1.Introduction
Mosquitoes are one of the most harmful insects in the world because they bite animals and human and spread virus. How to control mosquitoes in an efficient, green and cheap way has been a worldwide problem. This year, FAFU-CHINA iGEM team decide to start with the food source to control the amount of mosquitoes.
According to preliminary researches about physiological characters of mosquitoes larvae.  They feed on algae, plankton, fungi and bacteria and other microorganisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.) is a Gram-positive bacterium which commonly used as biological pesticide. Based on the previous research in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, LLP29 is a bacterial Bt. which isolated from the natural environment in Mountain Wuyi. LLP29 has been proved the specific and efficient toxicity to Mosquitoes larvae by bioassay. But the Bt. owns fatal weakness that they cannot live for a long time in the natural environment, especially when they are under sunshine exposure. The heterologous expression of toxins in suitable organism will be a good choice to solve this problem. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a general choice for heterologous expression in eukaryote. But to decrease the cost of this method, we decide to make use of photosynthetic organism which can live in water. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular alga which belongs to the Chlorophyte Phylum. It can be the food source for mosquitoes larvae.  According to the result of identification and clone from LLP29, Cry and Cyt proteins are the main resource of toxicity. According to the previous research, Cry proteins can improve the toxicity of Cyt proteins by combination. Therefore, we chose 2A-peptide expression system to co-express Cry and Cyt proteins.
2.The Damage of Mosquitoes
Mosquitos are the one of the most harmful pests in the world. They can spread various mosquito-borne pathogens by biting animals and human. Nowadays, epidemic diseases like Zika, dengue and malaria that transmitted by mosquitoes have infected human seriously and tended to distribute around the world.
Take Zika for instance, it is spread mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species female mosquito (Ae. Aegypt"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," this approach we have all came to conclusion, that even though we could modify DNA in some way, we still did not have the link mechanism between biomolecule activity and it‘s sequence.
.
Week 20
We have then decided to explore a different approach - instead of looking at the DNA molecule modifications, we have started to look at separate modified nucleotides. By using the recommendations from Vilnius University professors, we have met with Rūta Stanislauskienė.
More
She specializes in modified nucleotide molecular biology. During the meeting she has told us about her research concerning modified nucleotide and DNA polymerase interactions. One of the most amazing thing she told us is that there are modified nucleotide and DNA polymerase combinations, wherein the polymerase cannot incorporate the nucleotide because of its modification.
Close
Week 23
After the last meeting we have done another round of literature analysis on modified nucleotides and their interactions with different DNA polymerases. It appeared that phi29 DNA polymerase, in many cases, refuses to incorporate nucleotides with modifications. We have then figured out the solution on how we can link the DNA sequence and the catalytic biomolecule activity - connecting the substrate for catalytic biomolecule to a nucleotide
.
Week 23
With the help of scientists from Life Sciences Center we have successfully have chosen a specific substrate and attached it to cytidine. Then, using standard screening methods we have selected an esterase that can remove said modification.
More
Audrius Laurynėnas suggested that we should first produce a single pair of well-working substrate nucleotide and enzyme pair before starting to build activity recording system. This was an amazing suggestion as it gave us a way to test the performance of the system we are building, while we were building it.
At that design stage, the performance of catalytic biomolecule was measured by the sequence length and number of amplicons. The amplicons had to be fragmented, because standard sequencing methods are not performing well with long read. Also, amplicons had to be barcoded in order to know that those amplicons came from the same droplet, as the amount of amplified DNA was crucial to us.

However, these methods can be applied only after harvesting cells"" - Secretory and extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli, 2004, p.630
""E. coli normally does not secrete proteins extracellularly except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin. Secreted proteins can leak from the periplasmic space into the culture medium possibly due to an increased permeability of the cell membrane during a lengthy incubation period. Small proteins secreted into the periplasm are frequently released into the culture medium (Tong et al. 2000). In general, movement of recombinant proteins from the periplasm to the culture medium is the result of compromising the integrity of the outer membrane. However, care must be exercised during such recombinant protein production so as not to compromise cellular integrity, which often causes cell death"" - Secretory and extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli, 2004, pp.630,632
Nina: It is good that e.coli does not secrete many types of proteins since we then would have this bacteria secreting somewhat only our proteins and other molecules of interest.
""Another method of extracellular protein production involves fusing the product to a carrier protein that is normally secreted into the medium (e.g. hemolysin), or to a protein expressed on the outer membrane (e.g. OmpF). For example, human β-endorphin could be secreted into the culture medium when fused to OmpF (Jeong and Lee 2002; Nagahari et al. 1985). Recently, a method of releasing active scFv antibody and human interleukin-6 into the culture medium using the hemolysin secretion pathway was reported (Fernandez et al. 2000; Li et al. 2002). The hemolysin transport system (Hly) is a type-I secretory apparatus that forms a protein channel between the inner and outer membranes o fE. coli. Hemolysin toxin (HlyA) is secreted by direct passage of the HlyA polypeptide from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium using the hemolysin transport system (Fig. 2). For extracellular production using the hemolysin secretion pathway, the target protein is fused to the C-terminal hemolysin secretion signal. The H"

Collaboration  – Meet all the deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page
At the beginning of iGEM, we created a flyer showcasing the strengths of our team and the various ways we could help other teams. As a result of this, we were contacted by three teams: Edinburgh overgraduate team , Exeter , and Evry Paris-Saclay . For the Edinburgh team, we used our modelling knowledge to help fix their model. We aided the Exeter team by repeating one of their experiments, and they gathered single-cell fluorescence data for our deGFP construct using their FACS machine. Finally, Paris designed a novel psicose-regulated promoter to be used in a biosensor. We then incorporated their promoter into our framework so that many different variants of a psicose biosensor could be designed, made and tested. Check out our collaboration page for more information

Human Practice (Silver)
This year, we've done a lot of works on human practices with painstaking effort. In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.
When we designed our project, we had so many questions of how we can optimize the design to fit the patients’ needs and release their pain; how to make our design and experiments more scientific and efficient. For solving these questions, we did lots of researches and make so many interviews with scientists, researchers, clinical doctors, patients, biomedical product designer and ethicist.
2016 Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology
Before determining what we will do this year, we made many alternative plans, and one choice was using intestinal probiotics to cure human diseases. However, for the lack of relevant knowledge, we decided to learn more before we made the final choice.
On 4th December 2016, the Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology was holding by the Gastroenterology department of West China Hospital, Sichuan University in Chengdu. As the students of Sichuan University, we were very lucky to have a chance to take part in this conference.
During the meeting, the report Intestinal Flora, Host Metabolism and Related diseases made by Shen Xizhong, professor of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, attracted us a lot. Professor Shen gave a detailed introduction of the change of intestinal flora during the progress of host’s metabolism diseases and he mentioned some advance researches. What he introduced exactly was what we were interested in. Thus, we tried hard to gain a chance to communicate with him face to face, after the conference. We illuminated our project to him, which is using synthetic biology method to remold intestinal flora, and using these bacteria to metabolize some metabolite in the human body to cure some diseases. Professor Shen encouraged us, but he also"

We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Results
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. Figure. illustrates the changing distribution of EBFP2 florescent intensity in response to Dox gradient. With higher concentration, the distribution shifts to the right till reaching saturation. (TRE-EBFP2N:IntN and TRE-EBFP2C:IntC group is displayed as an example)
The shift, however, is only intuitive. We need more accurate methods to study the quantitative properties. To do this, we plot transfer functions of each group. Transfer function demonstrates the relation between the input level (Dox concentration) and the output level (amount of florescent protein). Plot the function, and the shape of the curve is highly informative.
The transfer functions of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though"
Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#projectresearchdesign_-_-_TEXT.html," can use 470 nm light for growth, making this an ideal expression system for CAB extraction. The expression system will be tested by monitoring cell viability in the presence of varying wavelengths of light, as well as the length of time in the absence of 470 nm light needed to effectively kill the cells. Since bioreactors can be used for CAB extraction, growth conditions can be tightly controlled to prevent degradation while the bacteria are needed to produce CAB products. However, daily light cycles will ensure that any bacteria removed from the bioreactor will be rendered inert and non-threatening to the environment.
Figure 4. Light-repressible kill switch module. Constitutive expression of heterodimer pair, YF1 and FixK, when exposed to light at 470 nm will prevent expression of the kill switch modules. When the bacteria are not exposed to 470 nm light, YF1 and FixK will not be expressed, which will allow for expression of the recombinase RecA and the proteases ClpP and ClpXP, which will destroy genomic DNA and essential proteins, rendering the cell inert.

Science in the Swamp
Science in the Swamp was an all-day event run during National Science Week at Centennial Parklands. It aimed to promote science to everyone, and educate people on the different ways in which science can be applied in everyday life. We were able to score our own booth, and spend the day interacting with thousands of children and their parents as they flooded through the park. We set up agarose gels with multiple lanes of wells and taught kids as young as 4 how to load gels with different coloured dyes.
We also had some plates with various familiar microorganisms that we had grown up, including yeast and mould, for people to inspect under microscopes. Our collection of fluffy microbes were also a hit, and allowed us to educate people about the difference between viruses and bacteria, for example, which later became the topic of a contribution we wrote as part of our collaboration with Team Michigan.  Of course, this was also an opportunity to talk to anyone who would listen about iGEM, genetic engineering, and our project!

Explore Engineering Workshop
The University of Sydney Faculty of Engineering and IT held the first Explore Engineering workshop over a three-day period at the end of July. 64 students in their middle two years of high school spent these days working in teams on an engineering problem, whilst also engaging in other engineering activities, listening to guest speakers, and exploring the facilities and technology available at the University. Claudia was not only a mentor to the students during this week, but also was part of a student panel that was held on the final day of the workshop.
She was able to talk about iGEM, explain the project and answer questions dispelling myths and misconceptions about genetic engineering. It was a fantastic opportunity to show younger students the possibilities of genetic engineering, and gave insight into a different potential career path for those who were already considering science and engineering.

We solve this problem by adding an ROS sensor, which has a suitable                         sensing threshold so that it can maintain the balancing between the high level of ROS in living                         cell and survival rate of cells.
Output
Last but not least, the part of characterizing residual amount of intracellular ROS.
Different from chemical detecting methods, our signal output substance must be:
● simpler for users to detect.
● harmless to cells.
● accurate and sensitive enough to reflect the intracellular ROS content.
● Reversible so we can get real-time data.
To meet those needs, chemical redox probe has been out of our consideration, even though they                         have characteristic of extreme-high sensitivity, still they are irreversibility and unstable.                         We prefer a kind of characterization which can exist in living cell also in a consist level for                         stable measurement.

Overview
This year our team focused on yeast prion SUP35, trying to make it a useful tool. So after we primarily determined what we would do, we cousulted Dr. Dong Men from Wuhan Insititue of Virology for advice. In the middle of this summer, we attended the conference held in NCKU, Taiwan. There we introduced our project design and potential applications. During our project, we also did a survey about public opinions on yeast prion being applied. We also communicated with Team HFUT. We learned about each other's project, giving and gaining suggestions.
Consulting Dr. Dong Men
When getting trouble in scientic research, seeking help from other researchers or institutions is always a good way and so did we. We contacted Dr. Dong Men and got the SUP35NM gene which was vital to our experiments as well as some practical suggestions.
This year, our project involves yeast prion Sup35. Although we had got the genomic sequence of it before we started our experiment, we failed to acquire this sequence for lack of saccharomyces cerevisiae containing it. So we searched on the web for any institutions which were possibly doing researches with Sup35. Then we got to know that Dr. Dong Men, Associate Professor of Analytical Biotechnology in Wuhan Institute of Virology of Chinese Academy of Sciences was who we were desiring to contact.
We first emailed him on July seventh, delivering our respect, explaining what we were going to do and making it clear that we needed gene model of Sup35 or specific saccharomyces cerevisiae containing it as well as some professional advice on our project. Before long, we got reply, knowing that Dr. Men Dong was dealing with nano material of auto-assembling protein useful for sensing with Sup35 and willing to offer"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," this is caused by the aeration of the anode chamber with nitrogen. The periodic aeration intervals correspond directly with the variation of measurements values. Because of the slight mixing through the rise of nitrogen bubbles, reduced mediator molecules are transported to the anode and the voltage increases. Therefore, the system works under diffusion-limited molecular transport conditions. An improved agitation of the cell suspension or a decrease of the distance between membrane and anode could increase the power output.
However, these results show the high accuracy of the measurement procedure and its usability to generate valid data for comparing even small differences between the performances of different strains.
Besides these scientific results, the usage of the developed microbial fuel cell for various applications is possible. Since many of these applications need higher voltages than one fuel cell can deliver, several have to be combined in a series circuit. One easy way to realize a compact multi-cell system is building a stack of several cells. The construction, described in the MFC evolution part, contains 5 membranes, 10 electrodes, 20 frames and 40 gaskets and supplies a voltage of up to 2.4 Volts. Using the OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172502</bbpart>) expressing strain it can be used for permanent operation of LEDs or little buzzers, or to power a small ventilator like shown in the video below.
Watch our stack of five MFCs with genetically optimized E. coli
produce 2.4 V and thereby lighting several LEDs, enable
sound output from a little buzzer and power a small fan.

Efficiency
In order to get a better evaluation of our Microbial Fuel Cell, we calculated several characteristic numbers. Furthermore we considered a feasibility study and compared it with our results. For detailed information concerning those efforts see here .
Outlook
Both the measurement results previously presented show the limitations of the our system in terms of power output. However, the experimental parameters were chosen to make comparison of different biobricks easier and not to achieve a high power output. Thus, there are still many  possibilities to increase the performance of the microbial fuel cell by changing the fuel cell design, the genome of the bacteria and the cultivation parameters.
The reduction of the frame thickness would allow for stacking a higher number of fuel cells in the same space. Because the space lost inside the anode chamber is that which is far away from the anode where electron transfer is severely limited by diffusion speed, only a fraction of each individual cells power output would be lost.
An improved agitation of the liquids in the fuel cell would increase the speed of"

Future Plan
The application we have developed can be used by all iGEM members.     As the iGEMs database expands and the recognition of the field of Synthetic     Biology increases, data resources from other biological databases such     as NCBI might be needed to be integrated to the application. In such     a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources     and new functions should be added easily.
Before planning ahead, feedback from other teams and iGEM headquarters     about the BioGuide 1.0 will be collected. That will help us to fill     in the missing features of the application and check the theories which     are basis of our algorithms.
As our application is not geared towards any commercial use and will     stay as an academic application, keeping track of the weekly developmental     process on the wiki notebook environment was satisfactory. If the need     for a commercial application emerges, we should be utilizing professional     software development approaches to determine the exact requirements     and to facilitate the use of a common language between interdiciplinary     members in the team.
For constructing BioGuide 2.0 we have some plans.
Short Term plan:
Next year we are planning to generate BioGuide 2.0 by using all parts     data but inorder to do this we will update our part database but easyway     is standardization and reorganizing all parts in partsregistrty.org     according to our suggestion because re-organizing and normalization     are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation. BioGuide 2.0 will be more faster because     we are planning to use OODBMS and all all platform will support BioGuide     2.0.
Long term plan:
We want to improve our algoritm and add more parameter to make graphs     more effective. Our dream is embeding our software into partsregistry.org     so no mere iGEMers will choose parts in real time by using our software.

Thanks for support from: Fudan, ICT-Mumbai, NUDT_CHINA, JNFLS, Tongji-Software, TUST_China, GreatBay_China, SCU-China.
OUC-China
At CCiC, we were attracted by the exquisite comic books made by China Ocean University . This comic book introduced the basic knowledge of synthetic biology in an academic way without losing wit. We used this booklet to help the iGEM team at Fudan Affiliated High school and received fantastic feedback. ""I’m rather surprised at the affinity between synthetic biology and engineering，both featuring logic and inspiration, and thus have a better understanding of the “E” in iGEM.” “The comic vividly explains the basic logics in the biological gene regulation mechanisms. I used to know the very basic control systems like the Lacrosse operon model in E.Coli before, but now I found the more intricate systems no longer out of reach.""
Major Conferences
The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
Exchanging ideas is always good for igemers and researchers, so we attended many meet-ups and conferences this year. We intended to attend a conference in NKU on the 6th of July. However, bad weather condition prevented our flight. A video was made to introduce our project before we answered questions from professors and other iGEMers online. Advice was collected and applied to the refinement of project design and purpose. Also we watched the presentation of other teams, getting to know how their experiment goes on. We got familiar with Peking, NKU_CHINA and Jilin_China through this conference and developed collaboration afterwards.
6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference In Taiwan
At the iGEM Reporting Conference held by National Chung Hsing University , we introduced our project to professors of synthetic biology and other teams. By this way, we gained valuable feedback from them to enable us to perfect our project background and made us realize the importance of pertinency we should pay more attention to hereafter. Moreover, we are more convinced of the rationality of our modeling after discussing with other universities on modeling issue. Besides, we met many iGMEers cherishing the same ideals and following the same path and we still kept in touch. In the end, we got"

Plastic lab video
One of the main goals of the Plastic Lab campaign was to offer other iGEM teams to see that along with the whole bioresearch industry, they too are contributing with their wasteful impact on the planet. While making the video, we invited other teams to collaborate on the campaign by filming their ways of reducing laboratory plastic waste. We want to thank all the teams that sent out their video material: University teams Marburg and Washington and High school teams Lahore and Ruia-Mumbai.
UK meetup
On 12th and 13th of July, the Worcester College iGEM team organised the UK meetup along with SynBio UK. The conference was extremely well organised, allowing the participant teams to meet with each other, present their ideas and the work that was done so far, while offering them to discuss about potential collaborations in between, troubleshoot and understand the role of entrepreneurship in such competitions. Many teams attended including the London teams (UCL, King’s, Imperial), Warwick, New Castle, Cambridge, Oxford and Exeter.
iGEM Marburg collaboration
We collaborated with iGEM Marburg team. They had a great idea to provide ways to read iGEM wikis for disabled people. We followed some of their guidelines but could not complete all of their requirements in time. They did a good job supporting the disabled people and we hope this approach will be passed on to the future iGEM teams
What we managed to achieve is:
Color contrast: high contrast between background and text
Scalability: text is set as % rather than fixed size
Header: all headers are h1 and h2 what makes them different from other text
Text: used italics and bold text to identify which text is important
London iGEM team troubleshooting sessions
Together with Imperial College, UCL and KCL, we organised a troubleshooting session that took place a month before the Jamboree at the KCL campus. During the session, the teams managed to get in contact with students from UAL to give us a presentation on designing a good wiki page.
It was a good opportunity to also go over each other’s projects and help troubleshoot issues that were occurring with other aspects of our projects.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Integrated Facilities and tried to gather information about the process. There,                  we were given a thorough tour of the facility and were able to ask questions regarding our project.
In the first step, we were assisted to the laboratory where we gather general information about bioethanol, its purity, and its use.                  Later on, we were guided to the fermentation plant where ethanol was produced with yeast. The ethanol that is produced is then taken                  and sent to distillation. With fractional distillation, the purity of ethanol is increased up to 96%, in this state it could be used                  for cosmetic purposes. For fuel use, with an additional step called flash distillation, the purity is increased up to 99.9%.
The factory we visited was a symbiotic factory where the wastes were reused and the waste used for ethanol production was molasses cane.                  Molasses cane is basically composed of disaccharides, hence, it doesn’t require an additional pre-treatment process. However, since our                  project aims to produce ethanol from the lignocellulosic material that is more complex, we asked them whether it was possible to add an                  additional plant for pre-treatment and continue producing ethanol from lignocellulosic waste. They were interested in our idea and had a                  positive approach to it. This encouraged us to move on with our project and also turned out to be an approval that it was possible to                  produce ethanol from the lignocellulosic waste in our country with the help of our project. They claimed that their bioethanol production                  was barely meeting the demand and the facility had to be always active. This also made us more enthusiastic. Overall, the conversations we                  had with the authorities and our observations helped us shape our design, prototype and further develop our project.
Visiting Çatalhöyük, the first Agricultural area in Turkey
Since our project basically focuses on agriculture, we decided to see the first place in human history for agriculture to be made,                  Çatalhöyük. Çatalhöyük was a Neolithic City and now it is described as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We thought of this as an opportunity                  that such valuable archaeological remains are settling in our country and we took advantage of it by paying a visit.

As part of the collaboration they sent us four devices that they assembled, which we transformed and characterised in the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. The results of this collaboration can be found by following this link to the Thessaloniki Team’s wiki . We would like to thank the Thessaloniki Team for involving us in their noble study on trying to improve and standardise the field of synthetic biology.
Characterising Nottingham's promoter library
The Nottingham team is working on tackling the development of antibiotic resistance via phage therapy. As part of their experiments they required characterisation of a library of promoters, which we helped measure using our plate reader, the data for which can be found on their collaborations page . We wish Nottingham all the best and hope that we may have contributed to the success of their project.
Team communication App: Let’s Talk About This
The theme of communication is present all throughout our project and has been something on the forefront of our minds the whole time. We understand that working in a team, especially one that is formed of members who may not know each other, can be quite stressful and awkward at first, especially when it comes to raising issues. For this reason, we took the initiative to develop an app, ""Let’s Talk About This"" , that allows the initiation of difficult conversations in a fair and mature manner. The development of the content for the app couldn’t have been possible without all the help from the iGEM community, who gave us their valuable time and attention by answering some awkward and even difficult questions regarding their own team communication issues. Specifically, we would like to acknowledge UCL, KCL, Oxford, Warwick, Edinburgh, Bielefeld, Valencia, Thessaloniki, METU HS Ankara, HebrewU, UIUC Illinois, NCTU Formosa and KUAS Korea for helping us broaden our perspective on team communication issues and helping us create a tool to take a step towards addressing them.

Science communication collaboration
Communication from scientists to non-scientists can have its challenges.                              Communicating scientific information is one aspect,                              but sometimes words are not enough to help the audience understand our work                              or inspire them to help us in our endeavours as synthetic biologists."

Even a relatively small amount of recombinases can switch the DNA fragments. Therefore, it is really important to control the recombinases expression with a well-locked promoter. You can look at our specially designed regulation sequence (riboregulator) to get as low as possible any undesired expression and production of the recombinases ( BBa_K1132005 , BBa_K1132006 , BBa_K1132007 , BBa_K1132008 , BBa_K1132042 ).
In the present design, the strength of the promoter does not allow high level expression of the controlled output. However, change to stronger promoter than P7 should potentially lead to better expression levels.
Resetting the gate to its basal state requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state.
The same type of design was used to build a XOR gate ( BBa_K1132002 ).

BBa_K1132002: XOR gate with recombinases switching gene regulatory sequences
This XOR gate was built with one promoter- one terminator surrounded by the Bxb1 integrase sites and the Tp901.1 integrase sites. This system is designed to be activated only in the presence of excusively one recombinases (transcription of the output gene). The switch is permanent.
The input signals for this gate are the production of either one or both integrases Bxb1 and Tp901.1. The output can be choosen at will by assembling this biobrick to any ORF containing an RBS site. We also designed a test Biobrick of the gate ( BBa_K1132032 ) with the RFP protein as output.
This gate can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements. For example, if you want to activate the gate in presence of aTc or AHL but not with both, you just have to put the recombinase after the promoter activated by LuxR/AHL ( BBa_R0065 ) and the promoter activated by aTc under the repression of TetR ( BBa_R0040 ).

Plants as Plants: natural factories producing fuel, plastic, flavoring, and more
Welcome, to the Penn State iGEM wiki page! This year our team took on the challenge of working with plants.  Through several projects we hope to help characterize key plant parts and demonstrate the ability of plants to be used as natural factories.  Below you will find a short description of our projects, for more information please refer to the ""Projects"" page linked on the left of the screen.
Team Abstract
Plants as Plants: Natural Factories provides a green approach to the manufacturing of valuable chemicals and materials. Through synthetic biology, we are able to control the expression of genes that regulate the production of desired secondary metabolites. Via the manipulation of established metabolic pathways, we hope to produce vanillin and butanol. The prospect of being able to synthetically produce a biofuel provides vast possibilities for the scope of synthetic biology and green energy. Additionally through the manipulation of the cellulose synthase genes, we hope to increase the biomass of plants by a hybrid plant cell wall. As shown through these projects, the use of plants provides various green energy possibilities. However, due to the limited use of plants within synthetic biology there are various regulation issues. Thus we have additionally worked on characterizing a range of plant promoters as well as introducing the Cas9 crisper system into plants.

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," continuous food production regardless of the season would result in a significant cost reduction of food which could reduce hunger in the world. This raises the issue of the spread of this technology in the environment, which remains a major problem. Through the spread of artificial products, some ecosystems could become seriously threatened, and maybe even face disappearance. Humans introducing foreign species into different environments has, historically, not gone well, as the Australians can tell you regarding rabbits[5]. Introducing a species which is genetically engineered to be more resistant to harsh temperatures or produce more seeds could therefore lead to even greater problems.
The question to ask ourselves here is no longer “can we achieve this?”, but rather “should we achieve this?”. We have ventured into the  technology necessary to modify living beings to our design, creating new subspecies in our free time. We must now study with intense scrutiny the impact of our actions and the moral justifications behind them.
The prospect of developing more efficient antibiotic formulations might seem attractive, yet the reckless and unregulated use of antibiotics will soon spawn new strains of resistant bacteria, harbinging a storm of more drug-resistant infectious diseases. Unfortunately. the current state of matters leads to the very distasteful and unpalatable consequence of breeding drug-resistant pathogens. Effects of these drug-resistant pathogens places undue pressure on the pharmaceutical industry, for the Sisyphean task of developing newer antibiotics to keep up with the development of stronger drug-resistance.
As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure - we strongly believe that judicious usage of the available classes of antibiotics, coupled with vigilant antibiotic stewardship programmes in healthcare settings, should become more commonplace. The fearsome tragedy of having no available antibiotics for treatment, such as in the case of carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, harkens back to the Dark Ages before the discovery of antibiotics, and must not be allowed to catch us off guard.
Once we have our priorities settled, even more important questions need to be asked. Is modifying the human genetic code different to modifying that of the plants and animals around us? Again, the risks and benefits require heavy evaluation. Fixing a deleterious mutation causing diabetes or multiple sclerosis could change someone’s life, but deciding what your child’s eye colour will be is probably going too far.
To conclude, it is safe to say that these new developments are not much more different than others before it. Humanity has caused a great deal of damage to the environment through greenhouse gases and deforestation, all for the sake of ease of life and financial profit, to cite only one example. While synthetic biology affects a"

First when the light is on, we can find the whole body of this worm contract, which means the blue light lead to the muscle contraction of the worm. Secondly the worms will stay still until we turn oof the lights. It means that the blue light prevent the worm from moving. When giving the light, the worm will stop move. When the light is off the worm will start move again. These mean taht the speed of the worm is changing. It is very interesting that all these reactions are taken place instantaneous.

What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been the major concern to the public, to the companies and the researchers. Doubts and worries raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapidly growing of synthetic biology and iGEM community, more and more synthetic biology products are built with the widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service(Synthetic and Will); we are facing unprecedented biosafety issue that unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment may cause an unexpected but definitely disastrous problem.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches(Lee et al.), holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most of the failures of the previous devices were caused by mutation and evolution of immune(Moe-Behrens et al.) .
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible Horizontal Gene Transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the entire ecosystem, or the engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.(Wright et al.)
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, by using genetic circuits and logic gates, to establish biosafety devices which can apply to the real-world situation.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute the escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, accidentally or intentionally. We used two"

People we chose
We tried to engage with actual participants in the debate around synthetic biology and genetic modification. To that end, we conducted interviews with people representing several organisations:
Eric Hoffman; Friends of the Earth
‘Friends of the Earth’ is an international environmental group. Eric is based in the U.S. and has a background in sustainable agriculture policy but is increasingly involved in critical analysis of synthetic biology.
Murdo Macdonald and Glenn Walker; Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland is a presbyterian church, and the most common religious denomination in Scotland; in the 2001 census, 42% of Scots said they belong to the Church of Scotland. Murdo and Glenn are both involved in the Church's Society, Religion and Technology Project (SRTP). Murdo trained as a molecular biologist and Glenn as a chemical pharmacologist.
Nicolas Peyret; Scottish Enterprise
Scottish Enterprise works with the Scottish government to encourage economic development in Scotland. Nicolas is a technology and market analyst for Scottish Enterprise, focusing on the life sciences.
Graeme Reid; University of Edinburgh
Instruction of biology students at the University of Edinburgh is the responsibility of the Biology Teaching Organisation (BTO). Graeme Reid trained as a biochemist. He is now Director of the BTO.
Patrick Harvie MSP; Scottish Green Party
The Scottish Green Party has 2 seats in the Scottish Parliament (out of 129 total). Its policies are focused on the environment and social justice. Patrick Harvie is a Member of the Scottish Parliament (an MSP) for the Glasgow region, and co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party. He has been part of the parliament's Science and Technology Cross-Party Group.
Armin Grunwald; Office for Technological Assessment
Armin Grunwald is the Director of the Buro fur Technokfolgen-Abschatzung (Office for Technological Assessment) and of KIT's Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis. He is also a technological philosopher and ethicist.
The questions
The questions were partially prepared and partially a response to what was said during the interviews.
In preparation for the interviews, we consulted continuously with our two human practice supervisors (both sociologists working in the field of Synthetic Biology) who helped us to develop our questions. At all times we attempted to frame our prepared questions as openly as possible, not leading the interviewee. This had an interesting effect on the varying"

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Methylmercury Results (II)
0
0000000000
Unencapsulated ""E.coli"" cells containing the mer operon were tested in both 1mg/L and 4 mg/L starting concentrations of methylmercury chloride to provide degradation rate information for the mathematical modelers. Methylmercury was only degraded in the 1 mg/L cultures and 4 mg/L was toxic to all cells tested. We suspect that this concentration was too high for cell survival and that initial demethylation of methylmercury occurred due to the presence of Mer enzymes from leaky expression in overnight cultures.
Heavy Metal Bioprecipitation Results
In order to measure thiosulfate reducing activity of phsABC of NaS2O3 to H2S, the operon was first inserted into the pBBRBB vector with a constitutive Plac promoter and transformed into E. coli K12. As a negative control, pBBRBB::gfp was tested under the same conditions. The pBBRBB::phsABC K12 and pBBRBB::gfp K12 cells were grown in three test tubes each containing heavy metal tryptone medium as well as 3mM NaS2O3. A third set of test tubes were set up with the same contents except without cells as an additional negative control. After 24 hours of incubation, The exact amount of H2S present in each of three different sets of tubes was then measured using a hydrogen sulfide assay designed by J.D. Cline in 1968 to determine hydrogen sulfide concentrations in natural waters. This consisted of adding 1x or 0.5x 30μL of Cline's Reagent (2g Diamine + 3g FeCl3 in 50mL of 50% cool HCl) to 270μL of sample. The results were tested against a known standard curve of various Na2S concentrations. Each sample was allowed 20 minutes for the color to develop before being diluted 1:10 with water for testing. The plate was then read at 670nm with the numerical results displayed. The bar graph shows that the sulfide concentration was considerable higher for the cultures containing pBBRBB:phsABC (380.1 μM ± 13.5) compared to the pBBRBB::gfp negative control (118.9μM ± 1.1). These results are in line with those seen by the Keasling"

Country Profile
Dear fellow iGEMers,
We got the ideia to perform this country profile from Hong_Kong_HKUST Team last year. We figured it would be an awesome idea to try to compare the Synthetic Biology and Biotech panorama among all continents. We would like to encourage you to do the same in your region! Go for it!

Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits, and cells or the redesign of existing biological systems. The element that distinguishes synthetic biology from traditional molecular and cellular biology is the focus on the design and construction of core components (parts of enzymes, genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, etc.) that can be modeled, understood, and tuned to meet specific performance criteria, and the assembly of these smaller parts and devices into larger integrated systems that solve specific problems. Being considered to hold significant technological potential, the development up to now has mostly been centered in the West, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
In more recent years, South American countries have begun to participate on the international synthetic biology field. But it stills only the beginning. With the target of amending this situation, we present this literature research as a reference for progress in synthetic biology in South America: Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Colombia. It includes data of research achievements, regulations and funding that we got using online search (in native language – Spanish) and also in Portuguese, our native language.
Regarding to our home country, the development of biotechnology and synthetic biology has been significant in Brazil, both in terms of production of goods and services such as knowledge. The country has applied a great deal of public policies in the last thirty years for biotech development. From 2004, with the Industrial, Technological and Foreign Trade (PITCE), biotechnology and synthetic biology have earned the status of ""bearing area of the future"" or ""strategic"". Among the most important aspects of policies is promoting new businesses and the growth of the business"

Any goal can be efficiently and quickly realized, only if the procedure of achieving it, follows a meticulously tested, standardized protocol. After an extensive research on the how-tos and methods to investigate issues regarding our project and receive feedback on a synthetic biology idea, we came up with next to nothing results; at least nothing that included an across-the-board approach to our objective. Hence, we developed our own methodology with that goal in mind. OSIRIS protocol guides the implementation of a course of actions to take under consideration a wide range of opinions, across multiple fields, evaluating them and elucidating various weak points. From risk analysis and prediction of health/environmental hazards to anticipatory governance and the integration of ethical considerations, OSIRIS covers every step of the way. For a step-by-step guide in implementing OSIRIS, check here . The results of our widespread analysis and the integration of experts’ opinion in our design can be viewed here .
Considering safety an issue of utmost importance, we have received biosafety training by the advisors and attended seminars in order to get accustomed with emergency crisis management in the laboratory. Such seminars are organized in Greece by the Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the Pasteur Institute in Greece and the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas. We have taken part in the seminar titled ""Health and safety in research laboratories"" (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, March 5, 2017) organized by the aforementioned authorities. In addition to that, our project was redesigned, after extensive conversations with clinicians and biologists, in order to introduce a 5-star safety system , on regard of the environment and the users. Check out more about integrating feedback about safety here .
In order to properly identify various Human Practices issues, our launching pad was our multi-level public engagement and education campaign. The public’s valuable feedback enabled us to isolate significant issues and weaknesses that needed to be strengthened. Check out our efforts here .
Every major project is affected by multiple factors. On that ground, we analyzed possible risks, effects and stakeholders that could influence our work negatively, by creating a Risk Map. Hover over the points of the map for more info!

NYMU-Taipei,2018,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," techniques to build quite different things, we have the common goal of eliminating the use of ELISA in the domain of interest for that Elisa is a detection technique too expensive to be widely applied.
Both of our teams have common in finding another countermeasure rather than using Elisa. We both wish the best for our projects’ performances in iGEM competition. But most of all, we hope our idea impact globally and improve our lives in our future.
Future Plan
LaunXP Biomedical -- Understanding how our system can be put in practical drug development use
As our drug screening system will be applied most in the pharmaceutical industry, we visited the LaunXP Biomedical in Taichung. Dr Jay Hsieh, their director of the office of research and development (R&D), mentioned that the trickiest part during the long process of drug development is the screening. First, there needs to be a database to perform the screening on. Second, there needs to be hardware to analyze the mechanisms of hair loss in the human body, and to simulate the effect of the combination of pathway-related proteins and the drug. Dr Hsieh also reminded us to make sure that our system must not only be able to increase the screening efficiency but also decrease the cost. His advice was very constructive, but LaunXP specializes in cancer drugs, for more detailed suggestions, we must visit a company that aims medications for hair loss.
Brion Research Institute  --Discussing future use with potential users
We wanted to make sure that our project meets the actual need of potential users and some suggestion on further application. Therefore, we decided to have a discussion with Brion Research Institute which had developed a hair regrowth product B401. (Brion Research Institute is the R&D department of Sun Ten Pharmaceutical Co., the biggest Chinese medicine and herbal product manufacturer in Taiwan.)
They do face the same challenge of lacking appropriate screening system for hair loss treatment and give affirmation to the effort we made. They questioned that whether the reporter would be blocked by pigments or other molecule, and whether it’s better than current method such as ELISA and western blot. They also suggest that we could establish a stable cell line via viral transduction or lipofection as future plan since pharmaceutical company would prefer a cell line that could be reuse much longer.

UQ-Australia,2011,Team:UQ-Australia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is limited in their project due to patents on key components.
In the past, the issue of patenting has been less significant on iGEM with a recent survey indicating that less than twenty teams faced any legal issues regarding patenting and their parts [2]. This would likely be since the majority of teams worked in bacteria, where the parts have either never been patented, or any patents have since expired. However, as more explore synthetic biology in mammalian projects, patenting is going to become an unavoidable issue. Consequently, we propose two possible mechanisms for iGEM to handle patents on biological parts.
The first - and seemingly simplest - solution is to simply allow teams to use patented parts, and require them to submit the sequences online (including detailed information on how they modified and used it), but without requiring the submission of physical DNA samples. This would mean that other teams could still utilise parts by purchasing them direct from the license holder and modifying them as per the instructions, without the traffic or redistribution of any patented parts. The problem with this idea is that it is highly likely that the iGEM registry would then rapidly fill with these ‘information only’ pieces that cannot be included in the distribution kit. This goes against the central aim of iGEM and the BioBrick model if there is no sharing of parts. A slight alternative to this model would be to limit the number of patented parts each team could use and submit in such a way, but we feel that this still goes against the aims of iGEM, and depending on the individual team’s project may well still present problems.
As a result, we have developed another alternative solution. In this case, we propose that iGEM should enter into formal agreements with the companies or individuals holding the license of many patented materials. This could operate in a similar manner to iGEM’s current sponsorship agreements, whereby the companies in question get advertising on the iGEM website, or a presence at the jamborees, and in return they provide iGEM with an overarching licence agreement that allows the distribution of patented parts within the competition (i.e. amongst registered teams). In this way, the registry could continue operating as is, and teams would be unhindered in taking on their projects. This avoids the current ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ mentality that some has, and alleviates the issue of unwary teams not knowing to search for patents before initiating their projects.
However, we do see that this plan could open iGEM up to the influence of outside corporations, and of course that not all companies may be willing to undertake such a partnership."

Week 4: June 19-23
Monday (06/19/17)
Sense/Respond: After the weekend, the students met in the lab and initiated a second digest. They were determined to get everything measured correctly and leave minimal room for mistakes. This time around, the students were much more knowledgeable about buffers and enzymes used and proceeded carefully combining them with DNA. After the digest was complete, the young scientists began prepping another gel for electrophoresis. Everything went smoothly while the digest was completed and DNA was extracted and cut by the enzymes. Next, the students prepped the DNA by adding a loading dye and then proceeded to put it on the gel. After electrophoresis for 30 min, the gel was complete. The LabPats were able to use this downtime for updating lab journals, creating new and exciting logos, as well as continuing to work on the wiki. Next, another experienced mentor helped with analyzing the gel and cutting out the DNA from the gel. However, they were quite disappointed to learn that there were 3 bars, indicating more base pairs than expected. The mentors ensured them that the gel still worked and that they just needed to cut out the fluorescent band that was relevant. Meticulous work was done to cut out the gel, and the labpats were finally able to let out a sigh of relief once the gel was safely placed in the tube and put in the fridge to be melted down tomorrow.
Packaging: To start the week, the RX team ran a miniprep and restriction digest on the dCBD DNA. After the restriction digest, the team ran a gel to test the different digested DNA lengths. The gel results weren’t as expected and the team began to re-do a miniprep.
Tuesday (06/20/17)
Sense/Respond: The students quickly resumed where they had left off to begin their gel extraction. Two different protocols were used to see which one would achieve a higher concentration. The teams were divided into Tina and Annie working with Svetlana on (QIAEX II Agarose Gel Extraction) and Jason and Dallas (who unfortunately was ill, so Annie and Tina tag teamed his sample) working with Mike on QIAEX Gel Extraction Kit. The gel extractions were performed and the nano drop test was performed. The only successful gel extractions were performed by the girls (Svetlana’s protocol), so they took home the victory!

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.2_-_-_TEXT.html," fatty acid is released from the corresponding fatty acyl-ACP via hydrolysis by C16-specific thioesterase,TesA.
FabG, FabI, FabZ play significant roles in the elongation of carbon chain of fatty acyl-ACP. It is TesA that processes fatty acyl-ACP into valuable products. Therefore, we recruited these four enzymes which together would finally make it possible to efficiently produce fatty acids with longer carbon chains which are much more preferable biofuel precursors. We have standardized the fatty acid biosynthesis related genes, TesA, FabG, FabI, FabZ, into BioBrick Parts Part:BBa_K771301 , Part:BBa_K771302 , Part:BBa_K771303 , Part:BBa_K771304 , Part:BBa_K771305 , respectively.
Alkane biosynthetic pathway
2011 iGEM team of Washington University has introduced two enzymes that could convert ACP-Fatty Acid into alkane. The first enzyme is Acyl-ACP Reductase (AAR) which reduces long chain length acyl-ACPs into the corresponding fatty aldehydes. Long chain fatty aldehyde acts as a substrate for Aldehyde Decarbonylase (ADC), the second enzyme. The enzyme removes the carbonyl group (C=O) from the fatty aldehyde, yielding an alkane molecule one carbon shorter than the original Acyl-ACP and a molecule of formate. Note that FabA, FabB, FabD, FabF, FabG, FabH, FabI, FabZ, and ACP in E.coli could together synthesize long chain fatty acyl ACP that could be readily processed by AAR and ADC to produce alkane.
Fig.2 shows alkane synthetic pathway that originates from cyanobacteria species. Alkane Biosynthetic pathway is combined with Fatty Acid carbon-chain elongation pathway in E.coli
Design of Experiment
Membrane Accelerator in Fatty Acid Biosynthesis
Mechanism beneath our idea suggests the Membrane Scaffold enjoys two fundamental privileges: the Priority to Exportation and the Refinement of Interaction. We tested them in the context of fatty acid biosynthesis.
The Priority to Exportation
Fig.3 shows how one solo enzyme anchored onto membrane could serve to facilitate the reaction in term of the priority to exportation.
The fatty acid synthesis is terminated by the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-ACP and the release of free fatty acids into cytoplasm. We suppose TesA anchored on membrane could effectively increase the concentration of fatty acids"

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," light response element with a strain producing GFP at a constant rate. First of all, we see that the fluorescence levels are on the different level of magnitude. This is presumably due to significantly longer half-life and presumably higher transcription rate. This is supported by the fact that the fluorescence accumulates through the time (although the effect is largely contributed by the dividing cells). The main interest is, however, to compare the effect of blue light to the fluorescence. First of all, we observe inclination to higher fluorescence levels at higher blue light intensities. This is opposing our previous observation with negative control. Moreover, this change is the opposite to what is observed in our light response element, which supports our hypothesis. The higher fluorescence may be, among many other possible reasons, result of LEDs heating up the sample a little bit and enabling the cells to proliferate a little bit faster during the measurements carried out in room temperature. We also need to take into account that as we only had one sample per intensity, the fluorescence values are subject to fluctuation and we cannot reliably conclude that there would be an increasing trend towards higher intensities in fluorescence of the positive control strain.
Induction Dynamics and GFP Fluorescence Under Varying Light Intensity
As we noticed in the previous measurement results, the response dynamics are too fast to be observed in the time scale of one hour. We designed a new experiment which aims to capture how fast the bacteria are able to respond to the differences in light intensity. There are two main factors in this feature: delay in transcriptional activation/deactivation and half-life of the protein being measured. We can approximate that the delay includes all the steps from YF1 phosphorylation to protein translation. These experiments were carried out in transparent minimal medium to avoid fluorescent bias by LB medium. In the beginning of the experiment, all the cells were diluted to OD600 of 0.5.
In addition, we needed to examine how the bacteria would respond to varying intensity of light, which would be the conditions for example inside a bioreactor. The biomass in the reactor would decrease the light intensity as distance to the nearest LED increases. The culture in the bioreactor would be constantly mixed and we assumed that one cycle in the bioreactor takes approximately 8 minutes. If there are 4 horizontally spaced LED rigs, travelling from LED rig to another would take 1 minute. Thus, we set 8 LEDs in our LED rig to change the intensities linearly from zero to maximum intensity in one minute cycle. Here, we need to state that the linear fit of the parameter is done in logarithmic scale as the log10"

About Synechocystis
Overview
Synechocystis PCC sp. 6803 is a species of cyanobacteria which is used as a model organism in numerous different areas of biology. Its genome was one of the first to be completely sequenced and is freely available online, initially on Cyanobase but now in many places. The functions of a significant proportion of its genes are understood. As such, it is simple enough to target genes that code for particular functions and it is possible to alter specific systems with considerable precision. Together with the fact that synechocystis is fairly easy to transform, this makes it an ideal organism for use in synthetic biology and it has attracted substantial interest in the last few years as a potential producer of biofuels. Nonetheless, its use is not particularly widespread in iGEM and there are very few parts that are specific to it. Therefore any team that chooses to use it faces substantial obstacles, such as the lack of suitable plasmids, promoters and ribosome binding sites.

Photosynthesis
Cyanobacteria are the only known prokaryotes that carry out plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis. It is thought that plants’ chloroplasts are, in fact, derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria is unusual in several respects. In particular, the cellular machinery involved in it is organized in an atypical manner. In cyanobacteria, the electron transport chains for photosynthesis and respiration are both embedded in the same membrane system. Electrons are shuttled back and forth between the two electron transport chains and various components are involved in both processes. These are: Plastoquinone (PQ), the cytochrome b­6f complex, Plastocyanin (PC) and cytochrome c533. These act much like switches on a railway, shifting electrons between the two electron transport chains.
Inefficiencies
The process of photosynthesis itself is much the same as in plants."

Conclusions
Modifying C. reinhardtii
We attempted to introduce MEX-1, a maltose exporter gene normally found in the plastid membrane, into the cell membrane of C. reinhardtii.
Unfortunately, the results were bleak.
The GC-content of C. reinhardtii’s genome is around 60% [1]. This is a likely cause of the modification’s failure, since high GC content is linked with difficulty in amplifying through PCR [2].
Further, despite our best attempts at performing the transformation, we simply did not have enough time to get a successful result. C. reinhardtii has a relatively slow growth rate (doubling around once every 8 hours at 25°C [3]) which, coupled with the waiting time for sequencing results, meant that, over the short period in which we could use laboratories in our Department of Biology, we only had time for two attempts at modification. Both were unsuccessful and, thence, we had to abandon the idea that C. reinhardtii could export maltose as a carbon source for LW06.
Will it grow, if...?
Concurrently with the above, we tested the growth of our organisms under different circumstances and on different media to see what ramifications the effects would have for our proposed co-culture.

How do you identify genes in a DNA sequence?
Genes are initially identified as open reading frames (ORFs), that is, stretches of sequence delimited by a start and a stop signal (designated start and stop codon). Open reading frames are generally compared with other sequence in the data banks to identifiy similarities to other known genes that may indicate that they truly represent functional genes.
What is directed evolution?
You can find the answer to this question in article of our blog Tornillos y genes ""Evolución Dirigida I. Reescribiendo la vida (in Spanish)"" and then reach the next level in ""Evolución Dirigida II. Debugging de un circuito genético (in Spanish)"" .
If scientist can manipulate DNA, would it be possible to activate pluripotency and differentiate  pluripotent cells?
Actually this was achieved by Yamanaka et al. by first time in 2006 reprogramming somatic cells in pluripotent cells and then testing their ability to specificity a somatic linage. You can read more about it in the blog Tornillos y Genes: Celulas iPS
Marta: Do you feel any moral concerns that the advances in Synthetic Biology could be used in a harmful way?
Yes, SB could be used as a tool for unacceptable purposes in the same way that a knife it is really useful in the kitchen but dangerous in the hands of a killer. SB has a great potential, if we use it to create or to destroy depends on ourselves. Ethical commities are necessary to harness the potential of Synthetic Biology so it is not used for harmful or unethical purposes.
Lualy: If the advances of Science allow living to people with severe diseases, wouldn’t be that a way to direct the evolution of humanity?
