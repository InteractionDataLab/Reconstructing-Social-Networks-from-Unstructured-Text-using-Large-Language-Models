・More than half people say that they did not changed their opinion about radiation after the accident. People who answered “Yes”, also says “I got to make efforts to find out correct information” and “I became to pay attentions to the news of nuclear power plants than before” and so on.(Q14)
・Many people seem to afraid both gene recombination and radiation technology, but radiation technology is feared more than gene recombination. In order to use bio-dosimeter practically, we would have to ease people's anxiety about gene recombination very carefully. (Q15)

Public Engagement and Education
Motivations:
iGEM is not only a competition standing at the front of synthetic biology, but also a good chance and a platform for future scientists and engineers to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Further, we should never “work behind closed doors” — though non-technical individuals may lack knowledge about synbio, they might provide us with many sparkling ideas and inspirations on our projects. More importantly, if our project is hardly understandable to the general public, then it cannot be a successful one. If we can establish a bi-directional communication with the public, we can get more feedbacks on our project and, based on the feedbacks, we can make our project more accessible not only to the scientists but also to the public.
Practices:
1.Garden party for introduction of synbio to the public. Collaborated with SYSU_CHINA, we held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our audiences included students of life sciences and many other majors, teachers of different backgrounds, and residents in the campus who are neither students nor teachers.                            Our parade includes 3 parts:
Watch a Video
Design a Circuit
Project Sharing
In the “Watch a Video” part, we displayed and explained several videos related to synthetic biology. Students of non-biological background were attracted to the videos. They said that they “We had never imagined (that) life could be so complicated!”. After watching videos about the process of translation and transcription, a student from Graphic Design exclaimed, “If only I could devoted myself to such wonderful research!”                           As for the “Design a Circuit” part, we designed a funny game. The participants were allowed to design gene circuit based on the genetic parts provided by us for specific purpose. At first, we thought this game would be very easy. All they need to do is just put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. The situation, however, is quite different"

Blog #10 - Microorganisms on the rise
By NBailly 16:05, May 26 2014 (CDT)
Last lesson students at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium took environmental samples using a variety of different contact agar plates. On the weekend, René examined the plates under the microscope and took photos. Today René and Nina present the students the results of the experiment. But first, we showed the students an excerpt from the TV show ""Planetopia"" that broaches the issue ""Hygiene in every-day life"".
Staphylo- and micrococci as well as Enterobacteria, Candida yeasts and miscellaneous fungi are found on the majority of plates. But why is there no growth on the plates containing the antibiotic? Actually, what is an antibiotic, how does it work and why are there multi-resistant pathogens? Nina explained the answer to all these questions to the students using descriptive graphics, and concluded the topic ""Microorganisms in our Environment"" with a short summmary.
As a starter for our next topic that is relevant to our project, we distribute a worksheet about quorum sensing among the students. For the remainder of the lesson, the students read the text and begin to answer the attached questions.

Overall Project
Our project was divided into three tracks: degrading materials such as plastics and cellulose; increasing biofuel production by using proteorhodopsin pumps and Nuo/Ndh knockouts, as well as other cell types such as Z. mobilis; and collaborating with California Institute of the Arts to produce animations using fluorescent bacteria.
Degradation Project
View the Degradation Notebook
We pursued multiple routes to develop possible degradation pathways for our compounds.  One route involves conducting “gene fishing” experiments to isolate organisms that are capable of degrading our compounds and from them isolating the genes responsible.  It’s possible to isolate an organism that can subsist on our compounds by taking samples from the environment and growing them in a medium in which the sole source of carbon is the compound we wish to degrade.  Specifically, this method involves growing bacterial cultures in liquid minimal media and sequentially inoculating new cultures in order to further dilute the sample, and then plating onto solid minimal media (in order to establish that the organism is in fact degrading the compound and not simply living off of trace amounts of, for example, carbon dioxide). If an organism can grow in such a medium, then they must have a mechanism to degrade the compound, and we can then isolate the genes responsible for degradation.
The other facet to the degradation project is transforming Z. mobilis so that it is able to ferment on substrates outside of what it naturally consumes. There are two parts to this subproject.
In the first part of the subproject, we needed a plasmid containing the gene that codes for a degradation enzyme. The vector must be Z. mobilis compatible. We will be getting this vector from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The DNA insert must not have more than 4 BioBrick restriction sites. Then, we electroporated the Z. mobilis cells and then grew the transformants on the substrate as the sole carbon source.

The data from the supernatant growth experiment was partially analyzed. It appears that 14 hours was not sufficient to reach a final OD in some cases, but there was growth in many of the wells. It was also suggested that we could just test the relevant amino acid concentration using HPLC. One thing that I was wary about concerning this is that the HPLC would only pick up pure amino acid, and if there was, for instance, a short protein fragment, it could be used for growth, but not show up on the HPLC. Any thoughts?
The cultures for the MinteinC (As it shall henceforth be known) grew well, but were not miniprepped. Once they are miniprepped, then site directed mutagenesis must be done. The cultures of the potential yddg biobricks grew well, and will be confirmed either by PCR of the plasmid using VR and VF2, or by restriction digest.
From our previous experiments concerning the consortia syntrophy, we saw that three cultures inoculated straight from LB into minimal M9 led to a mixed culture OD that reached about 1.3, similar to 0.1 mM (saturating) Met for metA-, and 0.1 mM Trp for TrpA-. We suspect that this is due to syntrophy, but have yet to do the relevant tests to see if 1 in 100 LB actually does supply significant amounts of amino acids.
I will be going on vacation for the next couple of weeks, and will return in September.

Teams we collaborated with!
ColumbiaNYC team
The ColombiaNYC team is housed in Dr. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia Medical Research Center. We needed access to an electroporator to transform our Pichia pastoris. Team members allowed our team to use their electroporation device, and they also showed us how to correctly use it. This was critical our project.
New York City High School team
We allowed students and mentors from team access to our lab in the fall, since they lost lab access near the end of their project. This allowed them to complete their project.
iGem Team Meet Up
We invited ColumbiaNYC and CUNY-Kingsborough team to a meetup at our lab where we introduced ourselves and discussed our projects. We Had a great time, and brainstormed and coordinated collaboration efforts.
Makerere University team
We video chatted with this team from Uganda to gauge how our project would work in other countries with different infrastructure. They did a survey for us of the needs of health professionals in their country for alternative ways to test injectables for endotoxins. In turn, we helped them brainstorm an experiment to test an existing part for the bronze medal criteria. We are also providing them with lodging during iGEM."
UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," GRAIL, we understood that despite its limitations, liquid biopsy seems to be more advantageous and addresses many of the concerns we had uncovered earlier. As a team, we decided to shift from tissue specimen analysis to liquid biopsy because of the inherent challenges with the molecular heterogeneity.
Dr. Mikael Eliasson, head of Global Product Development and Strategic Innovation
We also got a chance to meet with Dr. Eliasson to discuss some of our questions. In talking to him, we wanted to get a better sense of the liquid biopsy space and the direction that it was heading. He helped identify some of the key bottlenecks; although scientists have been working on liquid biopsy since the early 2000s, there are relatively few commercial tests available despite advances in research. He chalked this up to stringent regulatory oversight as well as some technical limitations. Although tissue biopsy provides a large amount of genomic DNA for sample analysis, liquid biopsy relies on analysis of significantly smaller amounts of DNA and without highly accurate tests, it is very easy to miss the mutations that would indicate cancer. For that reason, he told us that the key to a viable diagnostic test depended on its overall predictive value , or its sensitivity and specificity, which should be around 100% if possible.
Takeaway:
After talking with Dr. Eliasson, we reaffirmed that our project was going to be in the liquid biopsy space. We also realized that one of the most significant challenges would be to eliminate as many false-positives and false-negatives as positive. After performing some literature review, our team also came to the conclusion that NGS’ limitations and tissue specimen  analysis’ limitations were because they were looking at point mutations. Thus, our focus shifted to identifying and developing a diagnostic metric that could identify cancer but was not necessarily mutation-based. We wanted to look at epigenetic determinants instead of focusing on somatic alterations.
Amogha Tadimety, pHD student at the Thayer School of Engineering
After performing further literature review, we came across a paper that detailed some of the prevalent methods of analysis for the liquid biopsy space. We contacted the primary author of the paper, Amogha Tadimety, who was a pHD student writing a thesis in a focus area similar to ours. She explained that there has been a recent push to expand liquid biopsy technologies into clinical settings and point-of-care settings. She walked us through the biosensor design, explaining that a biosensor is a device that take a a biological material and puts it in contact with a recognition element to capture an analyte and a transduction element to allow"

Figure 3 Colony PCR of more colonies from the Gibson reactions plated in Table 1 using the VF and VR2 primers. 1kb DNA ladder from Promega. Lane 16 contains the (+) control(pSB1C3:rfp) and lane 22 contains (-) PCR (dH2O) control. Lane 12 contains a band of ~ 1.7 kb while lane 16 contains a band of ~ 1 kb.
Figure 4 Plated colonies of Gibson reaction using linearized pSB1C3:Fragment 1 and Fragment 2. 1kb DNA ladder from Promega. Negative controls of transformations using only linear SB1C3:Fragment 1 contain similar number of colonies compared to reaction using SB1C3:Fragment1 + Fragment 2. Plates are imaged on a light box with emission centered around 470 nm.
Because half of the toggle switch was inserted into the plasmid, another Gibson reaction using a linear plasmid and Fragment 1 could be used as the vector and Fragment 2 could be added in a higher ratio. Fragment 1:pSB1C3 was linearized using the plasmid Fwd primer and Fragment 1 Rev primer. This was used in a Gibson reaction along with Fragment 2 and DH5α was transformed using this reaction (Figure 4). These colonies were all red, but the number of colonies seemed to be only largely between the DH5α samples if Fragment 2 was added or not. This was as expected because Fragment 1:pSB1C3 can circularize as seen in the original colony.
Conclusion
This project set out to create a new biobrick for the 2018 iGEM competition. This strategy involved removing an EcoRI site from the starting toggle switch and then placing that control element into pSB1C3. Gibson assembly of the two fragments and the backbone proved mostly unsuccessful as it appears that only Fragment 1 successfully ligated into the plasmid for one colony during the Gibson assembly.
To continue to benefit the team it would be useful to try to combine some or a few of our projects into one system to test the efficiency of producing PHBV. Ideally this Biobrick would be able to act as another modular promoter and allow future iGEM teams to only use glucose concentration modulation for simple protein production or for the production of enzymes that would construct a metabolic pathway.

Supernatant was vaporized at 55°C for 30 minutes at the blowing station until all liquid residues were removed. Subsequently the plate was warmed up for 1 minute at a cabinet dryer (65°C).
After drying 60 μl of solution 2 were added and the mircotiter plate tightly closed with micromates. The plate was shaken gently and heated up again for ca. 15 minutes at the cabinet dryer (65°C). Micromates were drawn off and supernatant vaporated on heating plates (55°C surface temperature) with a constant air stream. Again no liquid residues should be remaining. Samples were heated up for 1 minute in the cabinet dryer (65°C).
Finally 100 μl solution 3 were added (it is possible to dilute the sample up to factor 3 with solution 3). To avoid evaporation losses, the microtiter plate was covered with aluminium foil.
SDS-PAGE
1 ml culture was pipetted into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. This was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl loading buffer. The samples were boiled with closed lids at 98°C for at least 10 minutes under the hood, after which they were let cool down and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for another 10 minutes. 25µl were loaded in a 3-8% Tris-Acetate Gradient Gel from Invitrogen, 10 µl NOVEX Pre-Stained Standard was used and PAGE was let run for 1 hour at 180 V with Tris-Acetate running buffer from Invitrogen. The aforementioned loading buffer is composed of 800 µl ddH20, 250 µl 0.5M Tris-HCl (pH = ~7.3), 400 µl Glycerol (50%), 400 µl SDS (10%), 100µl β-Mercaptoethanol (99%) and bromophenol-blue to obtain 2ml of loading buffer.
1st Pre-Experiment

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," Therefore, a total of 93 biosensors were used for analysis in our systematic review (Figure 3 and Table 1). The systematic review revealed that all biosensors could be split into four components: 1) Detector: The part responsible for detection of the target molecules. For example, riboswitches and transcription factors. 2) Processing: Adds downstream processing to a signal, which enables response turning. For example, logic gates, signal amplification and sensitivity tuning. 3) Reporter or output: Produces a response to the target. For example, fluorescent proteins and beta-galactosidase. Additionally, some biosensors may produce outputs which interact with the target molecule once it has been sensed, such as the production of degradation enzymes in bioremediation projects. We have termed these outputs as “effectors”. 4) Adaptors: If the molecule is hard to detect, adaptor components can be placed before the detector unit, to convert the target molecules to something able to be sensed by the detector component. For example, for target that degrades into an easily detectable molecule, a biochemical conversion adaptor could be placed before the detector component which enzymatically degrades the target molecule into the molecule detected by the detector module.
Figure 3: Frequency of projects based on biosensors development in iGEM.
Table 1: Percentages of biosensors components used in iGEM.
We propose that splitting these modular biosensor components into different cells, as shown below, and co-culturing the cells together, will greatly reduce the complexity of biosensor circuit development.
Implementation
To prove that our concept of splitting biosensors across multiple cells would work, we designed an IPTG sensor. The design of this system can be found in Figure 4. In this system, LacI is constitutively expressed in the detector cell and represses the production of LasI. When IPTG is added, it binds LacI, preventing repression. Therefore, in the presence of IPTG, LasI will produce C12, our first connector molecule. To determine that our system would work, it was first tested in silico. Details on the model of this system can be found on our Modelling page .

Promoters of human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor–alpha (PPAR-alpha), liver fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and glucose regulated protein (GRP78) are of human origins, and they govern basic metabolic reactions. Based on their functions and origin, we believe these BioBricks pose no threats to the public.
Bacterial Fatty Acid Metabolism Regular Protein
Fatty acid metabolism regular protein (fadR) is a bacterial transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism of fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation. fadR and fatty acid dependent promoter (PfadBA) are obtained from the 2013 distribution kit and iGEM headquarters, submitted by the NTU-Taida 2012 team. fadR and PfadBA are native to E. coli and no study has been conducted in introducing them into a mammalian system. Based on the native functions of fadR and PfadBA, we believe that these two BioBricks will not raise any safety issues when introduced into a heterologous system.
Researcher Safety
This year, our team was authorized to work with two non-pathogenic bacterial strains, the Escherichia coli DH10B and SURE strains. Both strains are regularly employed in research, industry and study. Biosafety Level 1 standard regulations were strictly followed while using these strains.
The characterization part of our project involved human liver HepG2 and HEK293FT cell lines. Only three of our trained members were allowed to enter the Tissue Culture Room and conducted experiments with HEK293FT and HepG2 cells in level 2 biosafety cabinets. They received special training about biosafety and clearly understood potential risks and methods of resolution. Gloves and lab coats were worn while researchers were in lab to avoid contamination and corrosion.
Additionally, some toxic or mutagenic substances were involved in procedures like genomic DNA extraction, cell fixation and fatty acid quantification. Phenol, chloroform, formaldehyde, BF3, n-heptane, diethyl ether and petroleum ether were used in the experiments mentioned above. Our team members who were dealing with these chemicals had received full supervision from lab technicians. Gloves, lab coats and protective goggles were worn during these procedures.

Brian Pfleger
Brian F. Pfleger: Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, 2007-present with appointment in Biomedical Engineering. He received his PhD after studying in the laboratory of Jay D. Keasling at Cal-Berkeley where he developed metabolic engineering methods to enhance the biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals. This experience trained him to design, construct and evaluate strains of Escherichia coli for the production of small molecules by integrating synthetic and systems biology. After graduating, he accepted a postdoctoral fellowship (NIH-GLRCE) in the laboratory of David H. Sherman at the University of Michigan, where he studied six Bacillus anthracis enzymes and how they assembled a complex natural product essential for iron acquisition and pathogenesis. Research in the Sherman lab exposed him to the combinatorial nature of natural product biosynthesis and taught him how to work with these novel enzymes. His current interest is engineering sustainable chemical production using synthetic biology.

Impact of Lambert iGEM’s Integrated Human Practices on the Final Project
For our 2018 iGEM project, we strived to address the devastating effects of waterborne diseases, specifically cholera. We altered and adapted our project over time, integrating feedback from researchers, professors, and doctors working in the field. The goal of our project is to create a practical and beneficial detection mechanism for pathogenic cholera. An inexpensive and efficient mechanism for individuals living in developing nations without access to clean drinking water and for organizations such as the Thirst Project.
iGEM members spoke to residents living in a city called Hato Mayor in the Dominican Republic.  Since a vast majority of the residents living in the Dominican Republic do not have access to clean drinking water, iGEM members wanted their feedback on the usefulness of our overall project and design.
Most of the Lambert iGEM team members have never truly witnessed the tangible consequences of drinking contaminated water; therefore, Lambert iGEM strived to inform every team member, as well as other high school students, to the global problem.  By listening to speakers from the Thirst Project and residents living in the Dominican Republic, we have been inspired to take action.
For example, Lambert iGEM presented the 2018 project in front of researchers working at"
TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in the ethics section of this wiki. Safety (or risk) itself is not really a problem for our team in a scientific sense, but the moral obligation and distribution of responsibility is what is probably ultimately the most challenging subject relating to safety.
Generally, currently we distinguish in our project between
safety (while working in the lab)
security (while working in the lab)
the assessment of both.
This can relate to either new BioBricks that we made ourselves, and the old BioBricks that we got from MIT. The different opinions of the team members on these topics can be found here . The distribution of safety and security responsibilities is in a certain balance (which differs per person) between the following stakeholders:
iGEM organizers
The BSO and permit holders
The Delft University of Technology
Researchers themselves
Future users of the BioBricks we made (misuse)
The team deliberated on the relation between importance of the issues and the relevant responsibility of the different stakeholders, but no clear conclusions can be drawn (see Ethics discussion ). This is difficult matter, and it is probably best to just follow our instincts, which generally coincide with what is written in the Code of Conducts for Dutch universities .

DESIGN
DR. CHE-HONG CHEN
Stanford ALDH2 Researcher & TAIES Cofounder
In our experiments comparing the enzymatic activity of normal ALDH2*1 and mutant ALDH2*2, we first used E. coli cell lysates. Although our results showed that the produced ALDH2 enzymes were functional, Dr. Chen recommended that we purify our recombinant ALDH2. He pointed out that many other enzymes in the bacteria may also utilize NAD+ and convert it into NADH, which interferes with our test. We listened to his advice, and by purifying our ALDH2, we obtained much better results with the purified enzymes. (Interviewed by Longan S, Charlotte C, Justin L, Justin Y, Leona T, and Catherine C)
.
SURVEY
Public Opinion
We created a questionnaire covering a broad spectrum of project topics. With close to 700 (n=697) responses, the results of our survey ultimately helped us shape our construct design and final delivery prototype.
Since we seek to combat acetaldehyde buildup in the head and neck regions, we considered treatment options targeting these areas, such as oral medication, nasal sprays, and probiotics. When asked the preferred method of treatment, we found that 53.4% of the people preferred using probiotics as the method of delivery. Since probiotics are commonly used, beneficial, and most importantly, safe to consume, it is no surprise that this is preferred method of treatment. In addition, most people preferred treatment only when they drink (as opposed to taking a product daily, weekly, etc.). This would require the product to remain in the mouth, so we envision delivering our ALDH2 enzyme as a throat lozenge to be consumed before or during drinking. (Survey questions by Emily T, Iris H, Justin L, Chloe W, Catherine C, Christy C, Nicole C, Colin H, and Longan S)

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small strongyles.
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the"

Lytic phage model
Temperate phage models
Why consider a temperate phage?
One of the biggest issues surrounding Chlostridium difficile infection, is that of reinfection. We originally planned on using a temperate phage, modified so that it could not enter the lytic cycle, with the hope that a stable population of non-toxigenic lysogens (see lab pages for how we developed non-toxigenic C. difficile) would be formed that could outcompete toxigenic C.difficile strains [10]. Hence, we wanted to model the interaction between our engineered temperate phage and bacteria to see if a steady state could be reached and what conditions would be necessary for this to occur. We also wanted to see the time difference in effective treatment between a lytic and temperate phage to ensure that we did not sacrifice speed of treatment in order to prevent reinfection. We later decided to see what would happen if we allowed for phage to undergo induction.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#testtest_-_-_TEXT.html," 16 ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which causes an inflammatory response of the urothelium.
It is estimated that approximately 40% of women have had a UTI at some time in their lives [ 10 ]. UTIs may be caused by a variety of different organisms, most commonly bacteria. The most frequent cause of UTI in adult women is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85% of community-acquired UTIs and 25-50% of hospital-acquired UTIs. Nosocomial infections may involve more aggressive organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species.
The Solution
Break down bacterial biofilms to liberate the bacteria encased within and reduce the dose of antibiotics required
Directly kill the bacteria encased within the biofilms to provide an alternative to antibiotics
Overview
Our solution is focused on providing a treatment for UTIs because conventional antibiotics are unable to treat these and other biofilm-associated infections. Given the prevalence of such infections, there is a growing need for alternative therapeutic agents that can specifically degrade biofilms and kill the bacteria encased within. The use of synthetic biology to produce enzymes is the most effective way to achieve this specificity based on current technology. Our solution aims to investigate how bacterial biofilm disrupting proteins and antimicrobial proteins can be exported from E. coli and subsequently retain their antibiofilm/antimicrobial function. Using this secretion device we seek to create a system that offers persistent protection against biofilm formation.
We have designed a device that can exert antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the two leading causes of CAUTIs [ 4 ]. A nonpathogenic laboratory strain of E. coli is used as the expression host for the production of these enzymes as a proof-of-concept. The antibiofilm enzymes that we are using are Dispersin B and Micrococcal DNase, and the antimicrobial proteins that we are using are Art-175 and Microcin S.
Degrading the Biofilm
Prof. Malone-Lee stressed to us that sensitivity is a greater problem than complete antibiotic resistance. “Many more strains of bacteria are just insensitive to low doses of antibiotics, many can be overcome by high doses over long periods of time. Resistance is definitely not absolute.” Breaking down the biofilm increases the sensitivity of the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.

1. Background
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in womenworldwide,with an estimated global incidence of 470,000 newcases and approximately 233,000 deaths per year. Then, we try to make an idea to build a new prototype for early detection to cervical cancer, especially caused by HPV 18 and HPV 16. From the previous results of the two teams, Calgary Team 2013 and Freiburg Team 2012, we build a new prototype with some combination from those teams. We learn about the prototype sensor from Calgary Team 2012 that consist of detector, linker, and reporter that combined into one small test pack. Then, to make the detector, we learn from Freiburg Team 2012 to constructing a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it"

In medical applications and plant protection, CDAs are used for designing antifungal and antibacterial biofilms  [2] .
NodB - Sinorhizobium meliloti
Introduction
The CDA NodB is isolated from the organism Sinorhizobium meliloti (strain 1021)  [6] , which belongs to the family of gram-negative proteobacteria  [5] . Rhizobium sp. often form a root endosymbiosis with legumes in nature. Through this, nitrogen assimilation in legumes is provided. For cell signalling the microbial partners and plants exchange diffusible molecules, the so-called nodulation factors (Nod factors)  [7] . Belonging to these Nod factors are NodC, NodB and NodA.
For further information to NodC visit the following link to the  Chitin Synthase .
The nodB gene is 653 base pairs long and translates into a hydrolase with a molecular weight of approximately 24.4 kDa  [2] .
The enzyme works optimally in surroundings with a pH of 9 and temperatures reaching 37 °C  [2] . It solely deacetylates the first position of the non-reducing end in a chitin oligomer  [2] . Due to regioselectivity  [7] , monomers are not deacetylated by NodB, therefore chains of dimers up to hexamers are converted to mono-deacetylated chitosan oligomers  [7] .
If NodB is incubated for a long time with the substrate and high enzyme concentrations, the possibility of double-deacetylated oligomers arises. However, the emerging amount is insignificant  [2] .
Figure 1. Structure of NodB. Modeled from SwissModel. A 3D simulation showcasing the enzyme on molecular level.  [8]
Mechanism
As explained before, CDAs occur in many different organisms and produce chitosan out of chitin to outwit plant defense systems. NodB deacetylates the first N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit (GlcNAc) of the non-reducing end  [2] . Deacetylation describes"

The minipreps containing BBa_J23101 were measured for DNA concentrations and aliquoted into the same test tube. These plasmids containing BBa_J23101 will be used by Davis High School for future transformation experiments. We spoke to our advisers in the morning and showed Dr. Siegel our preliminary data on our pBAD+Riboswitch+GFP (BBa_K598010) and pBAD+GFP (BBa_K750000) constructs that we had assayed a week earlier. He noticed that the output of the pBAD+GFP construct did not have a higher background level as time progressed. The lower background level suggests that after a certain amount of time the culture was degrading arabinose thus resulting in full repression of GFP expression. In order to mitigate this, Dr. Siegel advised us to use DH10B instead of MG1655Z1 for Tecan measurements. DH10B is known to not express the arabinose operon with the exception of araC. After finishing the restriction digest of pSB3K3 , we ran the results through the gel and saw that there was no evidence of correctly sized bands. We decided to do a transformation anyways.

The transformation involving our potentially mutated pSB3K3 plasmid did not work, so we retried site-directed mutagenesis PCR, but increased"

Introduction
The Impacts of Excess Fluoride:
Fluoride is present in all bodies of water. Within the oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, the mineral is existent and the extent to which fluoride is present depends on the amount of sediments or volcanic rocks being eroded in the area. It is when fluoride concentrations are at the toxic level when health concerns can arise. The FDA recommends that fluoride concentrations in water do not exceed 0.7mg/L, while the World Health Organization (WHO) limit is 1.5mg/L, and the Environmental Protection Agency designation for contaminated water is 4 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations at or above 1 mg/kg of body weight are deemed poisonous. Ingesting this amount in one sitting requires immediate medical attention. While constantly being exposed to 10 mg/L to 6 mg of fluoride everyday can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, in which the teeth and bones decay and deform. More severely, doses above 4.5 mg/kg body weight can cause developmental and reproductive concerns. Therefore fluoride concentrations can affect the growth and the IQ of people. In countries like China, India, and Sri Lanka, water sources are decentralized and residents in some areas experience concentrations of fluoride as high as 30 mg/L (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Map of documented occurrences of high-fluoride groundwater
Source: http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/groundwater/health/fluoride.html
Solution
In order to combat excess fluoridation of water in third world countries, we envision solutions that utilize the recently discovered fluoride riboswitch, a structured piece of RNA that kind interact with fluoride and regulate the expression of a downstream gene. We envision technologies utilizing fluoride riboswitches that can be used to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in water. We think these strategies can be used in cell-free and cell based systems. However, before we can work on developing these technologies we first needed to better characterize the responsiveness of fluoride riboswitches and develop a way to select for riboswitches with a higher responsiveness to fluoride.
What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitch"

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#project#safety_-_-_TEXT.html," The lab is also equipped with flame-retardant benches, spill kits, safety showers, eyewashes, fire extinguishers, and clearly marked emergency exits.
Dry Lab
We use the Emerson Machine Shop for fabrication; each of the drylab subteam members has attended the prescribed training session for use of the shop and has learned to use each of the tools safely.  Each member of the drylab subteam was trained in the safe usage of the milling machine and the metal lathe.
All machine shop work is conducted under the supervision of the Emerson machine shop staff. Safety goggles were worn at all times. Masks and gloves are worn as appropriate.  Closed toe shoes and long pants were also worn when working in the machine shop.  While working in the machine shop we maintained a clean work environment so we could maintain visibility at all times.  When lifting heavy objects, proper lifting technique was used, and an appropriate number of individuals were used for lifting said objects.
Training and Enforcement
Required Safety Training
All team members are required to take the EHS Chemical Safety and Laboratory Safety Training, as well as an orientation session with the building coordinator. In addition, before gaining access to the lab, all team members go through an orientation with our lab's manager detailing proper equipment usage and safety within our lab space. Before any independent lab work begins, wet lab members spend the first week of every summer project in a laboratory Boot Camp hosted by experienced team members and, if needed, graduate advisers. These training sessions ensure proper laboratory technique, protocol, attire, and safety. Dry lab members are required to undergo machine shop training in order to gain access to the Emerson machine shop, to similarly ensure proper equipment usage.
Safety Officers
The safety officers were chosen to be team members who could directly supervise the activities of the other team members. One team member each was chosen for the wet and dry lab subteams to ensure that all team members are working safely, whether with bacterial cultures or power tools. These team members also act as liaisons to the wet lab and machine shop managers and, when necessary, the Institutional Biosafety Committee , to ensure proper equipment usage.
These team members are responsible for discussing the proposed workplan for the project with the wet lab and machine shop managers before starting work to ensure that it is safe to continue. In the case of the wet lab in particular, this involves going through a detailed list of protocols, including all organisms, chemicals, and genetic constructs being worked with, to ensure conformity with the Environmental Health & Safety guidelines . They must go through the same safety training as all other team members, but are required to redo"

•  Pricing a new cancer drug involves trading off a complex set of variables. The potential for multiple uses, with differing clinical value  and numbers of patients, further complicates the process.
•  Pricing based upon favorable clinical data in a small population may produce a price that is higher than optimal for one or more uses, and may lead to restricted access.
•  Pricing based upon a weighted average of clinical values and expected patient volumes appears to offer a solution; however, this approach can threaten a product’s commercial viability where a low weighted average price is negotiated, but access then is restricted to small patient groups.
•  Alternative pricing strategies that allow separate and distinct prices to be paid for individual patient groups, based upon the clinical value demonstrated by real world evidence, may be preferred by payers and manufacturers
        Pricing
Our product pricing is complicated due to the following reasons:
There is no similar product available on the market
Potentially similar products are in use only in clinical trials
Our product depends on development of other technologies which are not on the market yet (gene delivery vectors etc.).

Re-suspend the pellet in 500 µl LB medium and transfer the cells to a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf cup. Prepare a cryo culture by adding 500 µl of 50% glycerol. Store the cryo culture at -80°C.
Incubate the rest of the culture at 37°C and 220 rpm for 24 h in the dark.
After 7 h (time t7) and after 24 hrs (time t24) take additional samples from the growing culture. Measure the OD600 and prepare with appropriate amounts of cells cryo cultures of OD600 1.0. Store them at -80°C.
After all the samples are taken, thaw the cryo cultures on ice and dilute the cells in 0.9% saline up to a dilution of 10-3.
For counting of the survivors, plate 100 µl of the 10-3 dilution on SP plates with a sterile glass pipette and incubate the plates over night at 37°C in the dark.
For illustrative figures, you can additionally spot 10 µl of the 10-4 dilution of the samples from the different time points next to each other on a SP plate, which you incubate over night at 37°C in the dark.
The next day, you can count the grown colonies (from step 11.) under the stereo fluorescence microscope. Using the YFP and CFP filter set, the survivors of the yfp- labeled and cfp-labeled strain, respectively, can be made visible and you can exactly determine the outcome of the competition experiment. (Dividing the plate with a black pen into four parts and labelling the already counted colonies makes counting easier!) With respect to the total number of colonies on the plate, calculate the percentage of „blue“ and „yellow“ colonies.
To make the clonal composition of the cell population visible at a glance, analyze the spotted samples. Use the cold light source of the stereo fluorescence microscope to bring the spot into focus. Switch the filter to the CFP-filter and take a picture. Do the same for the YFP-filter without moving the plate.

Sharing the Experience of iGEM
Lab Tutorial Video Series - East Chapel Hill High School
In collaboration with East Chapel Hill High School iGEMs ""Tasty Lab"" lab tutorial video series, we contributed a video tutorial on how to run and analyze an agarose gel. The target audience for this video are those that know about agarose gels, the theory, as well as the applications, but haven't actually poured and ran a gel themselves. Find the link HERE!
Lab Safety Video Series - Tübingen iGEM
We contributed to team Tübingen iGEMs lab safety video series by providing a video outlining how to properly read an MSDS and PSDS before working with any unfamiliar chemicals or organisms. We believe that being able to properly navigate safety forms is an ever-important skill and is somewhat lost in todays labs, as many of the chemicals we work with on a daily basis are fairly benign. Ethanol, ethidium bromide, and pathogenic E. coli, along with their safety considerations, are covered in this video. Find the link HERE!
Synthetic Biology Playing Cards - Franconia
We put together five playing cards for team Franconia's interactive and education-based synthetic biology card game (the game can be found here ). Because our project is based on antibiotic resistance, we made our cards related to our project and included: MRSA, methicillin, vancomycin, hand hygiene and Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B. Our cards can be found here.
Calgary iGEM - Canada-wide Newsletter
We participated in a Canada-wide monthly newsletter hosted by the University of Calgary iGEM team . The goal of the newsletter was to keep all the Canadian teams up to date on the research and human practices efforts being made by the other Canadian teams. Prior to this, we had a skype call with Calgary iGEM to discuss our projects and iGEM, as we are a young team and they had much advice to offer."

This part allows more flexibility in trying out different variants of our strip system as in this case we have the capability to create a reporter that is directly fused to part of our detector system. Both of these constructs are expressed under the promoter PlacI allowing for the expression of these parts as we need the proteins produced and purified for our in vitro system.

So can our Recombinant Ferritin become Prussian Blue Ferritin?
After our proof of concept efforts and once our own constructs of ferritin ( BBa_K1189018, BBa_K1189021 ) were purified it was necessary to see if this same treatment could be applied to bacterially produced human ferritin. The same synthesis reaction to cause the Prussian blue surface modification of this ferritin was performed except that it was scaled down to match the concentrations of our ferritin. Our own Prussian blue ferritin was then exposed to the TMB substrate (Figure 18). From the results we can see that the ferritin with the E coil attached had excellent catalytic activity ( BBa_K1189018 ). The same ferritin with TALEs attached did not display as high of activity ( BBa_K1189021 ). While this result is disappointing it may be remedied with further optimization of the Prussian blue synthesis reaction. It also does not signify a major problem as we have multiple variants of our strip system and ferritin fused directly to TALEs is not a part that is absolutely necessary.
Figure 18. Measurements of the coloured substrate TMB (10 mg/mL) at 650 nm over a 600 second time period for our own Prussian blue ferritin and unmodified ferritin. Sample volume was 242 µL. Controls for this experiment include bovine serum albumin (1 mg/mL)and the substrate solution by itself.  Due to limitations on the protein available only one replicate was performed. Zero time points do not have low absorbance as colour change was rapid and began before measurements started.
How does the use of Coils versus Direct Fusions of TALEs Affect our Prussian Blue reporter?
After successfully confirming that we could convert our own ferritin proteins that were produced from the parts we constructed ( BBa_K1189018, BBa_K1189021 ) into Prussian blue ferritin the next step was to evaluate how"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#essay_-_-_TEXT.html," and in a funny, accessible way for the open public. In our outreach part we experienced how important it is to break the complexity of the own down to make it accessible for a broader public. On our way of spreading the word of synthetic biology we had many enriching encounters. We met many different people and encountered the phenomenon already described in our survey. The people we met all showed interest in trying to simplify complex problems and a will to understand what seems complex in first place.
We did not find a universal answer to the question guiding our human practice project. What we found are many different approaches to address complexity arising in many different fields. This project helped us to improve our understanding of complexity as a whole and how we could profit from this profound, interdisciplinary knowledge.
Complexity in our project
Wet lab
At the very beginning the work in the wet lab seemed straightforward. The way we planed our time was ambitious, but soon after the start we faced first problems. In different experiments we could observe cross-talk between the different quorum sensing molecules. In a next step we focused on quantifying the crosstalk . We found interactions between the subparts (AHLs, AHL binding molecules and promoters) on different levels. The various ways of crosstalk are characteristics of a complex system with emerging features. The whole is more than the sum of its parts; living beings, even if not multicellular have various naturally emergent properties.
In fact the observation of emergence was one of the central topics of our project. The techniques of rapid prototyping and   3D-printing followed by PDMS molding allowed us to use custom-designed millifluidic chips . The chip with the alginate bead grid on it enabled us to observe the phenomenon of guided emergence . In this case we do not have a simplification but a contextualisation. The design of our experiments aimed at the consideration of different interactive factors rather than a complete reduction of complexity. Since the knowledge of biological systems is limited such an approach seems to be nearby.
During our project we experienced that many times biological systems are not behaving as expected. While in some cases mistakes of the person planning or conducting the experiment were discovered, we could many times not localize a causation for the unexpected behavior. This taught us about the influence of parameters that have a priori not been taken into account or that are beyond our control. A cell is an open system that interacts with its environment; it is possible to reduce the number of factors influencing the system, but is not possible to eradicate them all.
Modeling
A model is always a simplistic representation of reality. Using standard"

If the Kilobots sense enough signals transmitted by a i_bar1 Kilobot [value =1], it will go down a stage.
i_bar1
This code is meant to mimic yeast cells that produce Bar1, which degrades mating alpha factor and can cause negative feedback to reduce activity in nearby cells. The Kilobot will flash magenta every time it transmits a signal [value = 1], which may inhibit nearby bar1-sensitive Kilobots to reduce signal if exposed for long enough.
i_sense_average_bar_rand
This code allows Kilobots (yeast cells) to sense and transmit electronic signals (mating factor alpha) that will influence other Kilobots’ states and may influence its own state (self-sensing) in order to converge to a medium level of expression. The Kilobots are randomized into different initial states, representing different initial constitutive expressions. There are five possible states, which describe the Kilobot’s output: NONE [blue], LOW [cyan], MED [white], HIGH [orange], and MAX [red]. At each state, the cell lights up in the assigned color and transmits signals [value = 0] at the assigned frequency, NONE being the lowest level of frequency and MAX being highest. If a Kilobot senses enough signals transmitted by other Kilobots, it will go up in stage to the next highest level (so from NONE to LOW to MED). If the Kilobot initially is at a HIGH or MAX state, it will gradually reduce its expression until it matches that of other cells at the MED.
Results
ConvergeHigh
When all the Kilobots were programmed with code 1, they each started at different initial states, but they all reached maximum level of expression very quickly. Note that robots in the center seem to turn red faster while the slowest robot to turn red is in the bottom corner, where it gets less signal due to having fewer adjacent neighbors.
This progression from random to maximum is similar to how a noisy but highly expressing yeast strain would respond to mating factor alpha.
Diverging Bar1
In this clip, seven Kilobots were given program 1 and three were given program 2 (flashing magenta) to mimic Bar1 cells. This produced a diverging response, in which robots further away from the Bar1 Kilobots still reached maximum expression level, but those closer to the Bar1 Kilobots stayed at low"

For this purpose, we ordered the gat gene as a g-Block from Integrated DNA Technologies , which was free of charge because the company supports the iGEM competition. Next, we amplified the gat gene by PCR using the g-Block as template DNA. An artificial promoter and a ribosome binding site was attached during the PCR (Figure 25D). The promoter-gene fusion was cloned and introduced in single copy into the genomes of the B. subtilis wild type strain and the gltT mutant strain to further increase its glyphosate tolerance (Figure 7). To assess the potential of the GAT to disarm glyphosate in the different B. subtilis strains, we propagated the bacteria on CS-Glc minimal medium agar plates that were supplemented with different amounts of glyphosate. As shown in Figure 26, the strains synthesizing the GAT tolerated significantly more glyphosate than the wild type strain. Moreover, the inactivation of the gltT glyphosate transporter gene and the overexpression of the gat gene confers high-level glyphosate tolerance to the bacteria. Thus, when introduced into B. subtilis, the optimized gat gene confers indeed robust tolerance to glyphosate. To conclude, the engineered bacteria possess two interesting properties: (i) B. subtilis promotes plant growth by protecting plants against pathogens and (ii), the bacteria take up glyphosate from the environment and inactivate the weedkiller!
Figure 26. (A) Growth of the wild type and ΔgltT mutant and of the isogenic strains overexpressing the gat R11 and aroA* genes on CS-Glc minimal medium in the presence of different amounts of glyphosate. (B) Growth of the strains described in A on CS-Glc minimal medium in the presence of different amounts of Roundup® Alphee.
Cultivation of the different strains in liquid media allows more detailed characterization. Therefore, we analyzed growth of the bacteria in CS-Glc minimal medium supplemented with increasing amounts of glyphosate, using a multi-well plate reader. In general, the analysis supports previous results (see Figure 26). The strain containing the aroA* gene confers only a slight increase in resistance in comparison to the wild type strain and hence a significantly lower resistance in comparison the gltT mutant strain (Figure 27A, B and D). However, for the strain containing the aroA* gene and lacking the glyphosate transporter GltT a 9-fold higher glyphosate concentration is needed to reduce the growth rate by "

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," codons having the slowest insertion time, were designed and constructed. The TIR of each variant GFP was then varied by attaching ribosome binding sites (RBS) of varying strength to the synthetic genes. The genes were then expressed in E. coli cells.
Shows the similarity between GFPs. Genes with opposite criteria, such as slow/fast and common/rare, show very little similarity.
To design the genes a custom program was created which replaces all degenerate codons in a gene with the desired codons, for example, replacing all rare codons with common degenerate codons or all slow codons with fast degenerate codons. The variants were sent for construction at a commercial laboratory (Integrated DNA Technologies), and then inserted into viral DNA vectors which were incorporated into the cells’ plasmids through existing replication machinery. This was accomplished through basic cloning, and the expression of the fluorescent protein was then characterized using flow cytometry, a quantitative method of measuring fluorescence. Using this data, the maximum translation rate capacity of each variant GFP was determined and that data was used to distinguish between rare, slow, frequent, and fast codons.
3) Introduce the Synthetic Genes Optimized Using Our Criteria into E. coli
Our general plan for expressing our variant GFPs in living cells was to ligate the genes into a vector, transform the cells with the vector, then sequence to confirm the presence of our variant genes. After this we ligated in a dRBS, measured the florescence of the cells, and then sequenced again to determine which colonies were using which RBS.
The figures below show the construction process that we used to insert an RBS library and variant GFP into plasmid pFTV.
Inverse PCR
Through inverse PCR, we cut away the existing superfolder GFP while amplifying the rest of the plasmid. By adding ""tails"" to our primers outside the annealing sites we were able to introduce new restriction sites into the plasmid.
Inverse PCR Products
Inverse PCR cuts out the pre-existing coding sequencing while simultaneously amplifying the plasmid backbone with the new restriction sites.
Inserting GFP
Each GFP variant is inserted separately
A decision was reached to use a leader sequence to homogenize the first 60 base pairs of each GFP.
Why use a leader Sequence?
Leader Sequence is heavily optimized to ensure it does not become the rate limiting step in translation. It ensures an even range of translation initiation is sampled across all variants by homogenizing the first 60 base pairs, which can impact TIR.
Our construct before insertion of the dRBS"

People of the institute of professor Schwab will participate in our team as advisors. They will receive accession to the Wiki and officially be registered for the iGEM ream.
Maybe the new advisors can offer a crash course in yeast-techniques. Complexity still needs to be defined. The most important issue would be the organization of yeast gene structures and the methods of selection. The genome integration and afterwards the selection is another important topic.

Thaumatin, limonene and coumaryl could start very soon (1-2 weeks).
Caffeine needs to be synthesized.
Sponsoring
Many different sponsors are acquired. Most important is Eurofins, because they will synthesize oligonucleotides for 0,10 Euro per base. More information are in the sponsoring section
Gene synthesis
3 genes need to be synthesized for the caffeine team
2 genes might be needed for the thaumatin team (they might be able to get the genes from Heidelberg)
1 gene is necessary for the light-inducible promoter team
Final orders need to be posted in the sponsoring section
Lab work
Who has time? Timetable in internal wiki!
A clear defined agenda of your lab work should be made to show it Prof. Skerra. This is very important for your lab work, too!
Genes need to be ordered now or very soon. Otherwise we will run out of time!
Presentation of thaumatin
The presentation needs to be uploaded for everybody.

Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device
Our new pSB1C3-BsFP (BBa_K1736000) Part has the potential to enhance reporter gene assays, improve biomarker tracking in cell tissues, create fluorescent fusion proteins, and many other applications. It is also appropriate to note that the gene encoding the protein is substantially different to the previously submitted parts BBa_K376004, BBa_K1094000 and BBa_K660000; while these cannot be directly compared in terms of fluorescence intensity, we note that our part is the most rigorously characterised of these. In particular, the ability to easily detect its fluorescence on agar plates is especially convenient. This part was inspired and is building on the function  of the BBa_K1094400 part from the 2013 Copenhagen team , the BBa_K376004 part from the 2010 Penn State team , and the BBa_K660004 part from the 2011 Glasgow team .

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Hence, for practical reason, we tested A1 RNAT that derived from ROSE family. Thank BIT-CHINA for provding DNA sequences of this part. The possible secondary structure of A1 was simulated by RNAstructure (Fig.3).
Figure 2: Proposed RNA secondary structure of the 5’ UTR from the prfA gene of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which belongs to ROSE family (Neupert and Bock, 2009).
Figure 3: The possible secondary structure of A1.
FourU
FourU thermometers as naturally occurring RNA thermometers, for the first time, were found in Salmonella, so called as four highly conserved uridine nucleotides are placed right opposite to the SD sequence. FourU elements usually have two hairpin structures, in the case of temperature rising, the one without SD sequence is relatively steady while the other contains hidden SD sequence would be melted. In 2008, TUDelft designed and submitted part K115002 to iGEM registry based on natural forms of FourU elements. The possible secondary structure of FourU was simulated by RNAstructure (Fig.4). We test this part this year to determine the validity of this part.
Figure 4: The possible secondary structure of FourU.
Synthetic RNA thermometer
The possibility of designing synthetic RNA thermometers was explored based on the assumption that the RNATs do function by the proposed simple hairpin-melting mechanism that expose the ribosome-binding site. Therefore, Stem-loop structure with the SD sequence embedded in the stem would be the simplest RNAT. Based on the work of Juliane Neupert, Daniel Karcher and Ralph Bock (2008), Synthetic RNAT U6 was chosen as one of our testing RNATs. The possible secondary structure of U6 was simulated by RNAstructure (Fig.5).
Figure 5: The possible secondary structure of U6.
2.2 Method
In the first trail of experiments the RNA thermometers we’ve tested are from part registry of previous iGEM competition (K115002, K115017), support of team BIT-China (A?1, A2, A3), literature (U9, U10) and our own design (U6-GC). We constructed parts on pET-28a as PT7-LacO- pET-28a random sequence-RNAT-eGFP. Plasmids are transformed into BL21"

Restriction
In our laboratory, we experienced some trouble with restriction ligation cloning. Therefore, I aimed for checking the efficiency of all restriction enzymes used in the cloning process. I used the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid and restricted this plasmid with the restriction enzyme XbaI and one of the restriction enzymes EcoRI, KpnI, NotI or FseI. To compare, I restricted the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid only with XbaI and as negative control I used no restriction enzyme to cut pACYCDuet-1.
The following table shows an overview of what fragment(s) were cut with what restriction enzyme(s).

Collaboration with Fujian normal university
1.   Online meeting
In the process of online meeting (Figure 1), we initially introduced our projects and aimed to help each other. Then we talked about our problems that we meet during the experiments. For example, we often failed in the construction of plasmid. Through our communication, we hoped that we can have a further cooperation and help each other to overcome the current difficulties.

(1) Beer factory in FJNU（Beer Factory）
When we mentioned that the lactic acid biosensor can be used in fermentation factory, students from FJNU said that the beer factory in their school can produce beer by yeast fermentation. To better understand the production of lactic acid in fermentation, we visited the beer factory with the help of FJNU.
(2)Brochure of FJNU_China
In order to publicize the project of team from Fujian normal university, they hoped that we can help them to propagandize their notebook. After receiving the well-made brochure made by the team from Fujian normal university (Figure 2), we went to the campus, explained the project and IGEM competition to students from other majors.
Figure 2. Propaganda
Collaboration of experiments
After discussion, we found that the team from Fujian normal university constructed their plasmids in a different way. According to our protocol, when we construct our plasmid, we firstly used overlap to connect each gene, and then combined them with plasmid by enzymatic ligation. But the team from Fujian normal university used Gibson assembly master mix system to construct the composite plasmid. Therefore, we decided to help the team from Fujian normal university construct plasmid proU-GFP, They help us build plasmid proLsrA-GFP.
Finally, we helped them construct plasmid proU-GFP (Figure 3a) successfully. According to their verification, this plasmid can express GFP (Figure 3b).

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Danci-K8,2016,Team:Danci-K8#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with Dietician – Mrs. Meirav Ben Zaken
Hello Meirav, How common is overweight?
Overweight is considered to be an epidemic. People invest a lot of money, time and energy to reduce weight gain. Overweight is common amongst children (and in on a steady rise), youth and mainly adults. I imagine it could be avoided if there was an option to receive guidance at a young age.
What is the importance of ensuring proper nutrition and avoiding overweight?
Good nutrition leads to a healthy lifestyle. Proper nutrition enables the rejection or postponement of chronic diseases that may break out because of a poor diet as well as the genetic component. As far as a proper diet is concerned we have the ability to influence, the moment a chronic disease breaks out then it is no longer in our hands. Then the disease is treated by medicinal means. Overweight can cause a wide variety of diseases – diabetes, high blood pressure, hypoglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease and various blood vessel related problems.
Who has the most chance of suffering from overweight?
Genetics - Obesity in the family increases the chances of obesity in children. Environment - an unhealthy lifestyle in sports and nutrition. To my great regret in recent years the culture of eating is unhealthy. People are in a hurry to eat fatty foods, fried foods and tend to eat snacks, which in turn eating fruits and vegetables are disappearing from the menu in most of the population in Israel. The amount of fat in junk food is very high. A person who eats a lot of cheap fast food may find himself in the obesity graph even if genetics is in his favour.
How do you check who is a person that suffers from overweight? What are the indicators? (What Is The Definition)?
Weight in kg. /height in cm. = BMI.  With this definition – if the result is 20-25 then it is normal. Above those numbers it is overweight/ obesity.
What can be done to avoid reaching a situation of overweight?
Keep a healthy lifestyle which includes a variety of healthy foods. Do sport. In the end every human being will consume unhealthy foods, the thing here is proportion.
A significant portion of people with high affinity desire to eat sweet food, others like salty foods or dislike bitter foods. Theoretically if we succeed in changing the desire for sweet things, would it be possible to maintain the desired weight?
Of course, most of the people fighting to maintain a steady weight are addicted to sweet tastes. Change could help them with their inner fight which exists while on diet. But .. how is that possible?
- That is"

To be more concrete, visitors were expected to go firstly at the peripheral venue before they enter the cinema. If we could birdview the whole space, we would interestingly find that the entire visiting route resembles a boot very much. This layout not only provided us exact space to post all the panels, but also created a mysterious atmosphere which attracts visitors' interests tightly, for that they had to adjust their directions frequently to follow the content and it seemed that they were travelling in the history of synthetic biology development filling with success and setbacks. At last, visitors sat down to enjoy short videos and even to think about science and ethics. Actually, the human-based route received many nice comments.
Visitors
   
Visitors for the exhibition came from various fields, ranging from students to businessperson and from officials to professors. This means our exhibition was accepted by people from different background. We selected some visitors in five scenes as representatives.
Scene 1 on Aug. 25
A lady with her girl stepped in the exhibition hall. After their visiting, the lady told us that her husband who is a professor in life science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology served as one of the judge committee members in 2011 iGEM Asian Jamboree. She also said it's a pity that her husband was not able to travel with them to Xiamen this time due to personal schedule, or he must be interested in our exhibition and proud of us.
   
Scene 2 on Aug. 26 A retired biology professor came to the exhibition hall. He did research in enzymes and cancer-treating. We noticed that he, though covered with silver hair, was still hale and hearty. He carefully viewed the panels one by one, nodding sometimes to show his agreement with the content in front of him. When we talked with him, he praised us for well organization of the exhibition. What's more, he also give us some suggestions on how to simplify and visualize obscure scientific concepts.
Scene 3 on Aug. 26
Some middle school students paid a visit to our exhibition. They came from Quanzhou, Fujian Province and they hoped they can enter Xiamen University"

Testing why a-GFP didnt bind to GFP:
2 plasmaactivated Slides (287, 303) were prepared and stamped. 50 ug/ml GFP (Dia-Chip) and 400 ug/ml bBSA (iGEM-Logo) on each Slide. After stamping 1 slide (303) was blocked with PDMS. Fluoresence of GFP was measured within fluoresence microscope. Surprisingly, on no slide GFP fluoresence could be detected. –> There seems to be no GFP; this would explain why we didnt observe a a-GFP binding to GFP in the last experiments. Obtained new GFP from Max (~1ml of 1mg/ml GFP → stock in the -20°C fridge ZBSA), retried same experiment with new slides (121, 215). 121 was blocked with the backside of a PDMS flowchamber.  On both slides GFP could be detected, but quite inhomogeously distributed.
19.06.2015
3 identical slides (i1,i2,i3) of the following experiment were prepared: Stamped 3 different dilutions of GFP and bBSA on 1 Slide (so 6 on each slide) Concentrations were 50 ug/ml, 200 ug/ml and 500 ug/ml for either GFP (antibody stamp) and bBSA (stars-stamp / christmas tree-stamp) - Incubated 30-40 mins (50 ul) on the stamp, then stamped on the plasma activated slides. After stamping they were put in PBS. Fluoresence of all slides were measured. GFP signal was clear; slide 1 antibody for 500 ug/ml was missing (cause I screwed up stamping). Yet, intensity of GFP fluoresence was quite similar for all GFP concentrations (all measured with 3s shutter speed).
After measuring slide i1 was taken dried and blocked with backside of PDMS flowcell to see if GFP signal gets less (if blocking pulls of protein). Fortunately, GFP intensity was same before and after blocking with PDMS.

Figure 6: Autoclave A2
The substrate used for the fed-batch phase of the fermentation is sterilized in A2.  The same type of   sterilization and conditions as in the A1 are chosen. Simulation in Aspen Plus   yielded a volume of  16.2 [L] and a heat duty of 7.457 [kJ/batch]. The composition of the   substrate can be viewed in table 4. It should be noted that in order to avoid  dilution of the cell concentration, the concentration of glucose is considerably   higher than in S1.. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.
