Killling Ability Test
I. Background
      The ideal killing ability of the warriors includes the two following characters. First, the killing ability of the warriors from the two sides must be roughly equal. Second, the killing ability of the warriors must be adequate——neither too strong nor too weak.
II.Experimental design
    To test if the killing ability of the warriors from two sides are the same, we let equal amount of the two kinds of warriors to grow together. We attach different fluorescins to different warriors in order to differentiate them. We compare the killing ability of the warriors by monitoring the ratio of the two kinds of the warriors.
    To test if the killing ability is adequate or not, we do a gradient experiment. We let warriors and beggars from different sides to grow together with different starting ratios. The warriors and beggars from different sides are attached to different fluorescins. We monitor the change of the amount of beggars with time to see if the killing ability is ideal or not.
III Methods
1. Construct our warriors and beggars by co-transformation. (the gene circuits are as follows) *if you want to know the details of how we assemble the parts together, see our protocol “DNA construction”
Fig 1 gene circuits of warriors and beggars from both sides
2. Pick bacterial clones from the petri plate, then shake it overnight in the LB medium (3ml) with 50μg/ml Ampicilin and 30μg/ml Kanamycin at 37℃. For each combination, 3 clones are"

Biologia syntetyczna to dziś najmłodsza dziedzina nauk przyrodniczych, powstała w wyniku integracji nauk biologicznych, inżynieryjnych i matematycznych. Podobnie jak w przypadku budowy domu, mostu czy samolotu, gdzie najbardziej skomplikowane elementy składają się z niezliczonej ilości podsystemów i elementów podstawowych, tak i biologia syntetyczna wykorzystuje najbardziej podstawowe elementy kodu genetycznego celem zbudowania nowych, skomplikowanych, funkcjonalnych systemów biologicznych. Te podstawowe cegiełki (BioBricks) dostępne są dla uczestników konkursu w centralnym rejestrze iGEM oraz stanowią ustandardyzowany punkt wyjścia dla wszystkich zespołów. Każdy zespól otrzymuje cały atlas cegiełek, zawierający ponad 1000 elementów, modułów i systemów, a projekty zakończone sukcesem wzbogacają istniejący katalog.  Przez całe lato zespoły studentów pod czujnym okiem swoich opiekunów będą pracować w uniwersyteckich laboratoriach i przed komputerami nad projektami własnego pomysłu, które następnie zaprezentują w listopadzie na “Jamboree” w Bostonie. Najlepsze projekty w każdej kategorii otrzymają nagrody i wyróżnienia.

CERN OHL
The CERN OHL was developed to do for hardware what the General Public License (GPL) did for software, and is available for free download*. In 2009, scientists in the community at CERN began to create the Open Hardware Repository: “a place on the web for electronics designers at experimental physics facilities to collaborate on open hardware designs, much in the philosophy of the free software movement” [1]. To complement this, they also developed a hardware-specific license.
The fundamental principals of the CERN OHL are:
If modifications are to be released to the community, they must be under the same license scheme as the original product
This ensures that the license is persistent, and ultimately everyone in the community benefits
The process of improvement uses collaboration between anyone in the community
CERN itself uses the license to release Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) that it develops back into the physics community. CERN recognised the potentially huge benefit of releasing hardware to the community, where it is effectively peer-reviewed and reconfigured to precisely match end-user requirements [1].

Training process of ProteinGAN
Generator receives a set of numbers from random gaussian distribution called noise which is passed through pre-defined number of filters that contain trainable parameters. These filters are arranged in blocks called residual blocks. After each block the length of the input increases until it matches the length of a real protein (analogy to increasing resolution in image generation) (Figure 2). The last layer ensures that the range of values and shape matches original data.
Figure 5. Visualization of protein generation
Discriminator receives generated and real sequences and passes them through the network containing same size filters stacked in reversed order compared to generator (in order to not overpower one over another). At the end, discriminator arrives to a single number for each sequence that corresponds to the confidence level of discriminator that a particular resembles natural protein sequences.
Using the scores from discriminator, each part of the GAN is evaluated using loss function.
Hinge loss where D - function of discriminator that returns a single number for each sequence, G - a function of generator that takes noise as an input and returns sequence of amino acids. N - the number of examples looked in one step.
Intuitively, this means that discriminator will do well if it assigns low scores to generated examples and high to real ones. On the other hand, generator is penalized if generated examples are scored low. These scores drive the direction of how parameters are being tweaked to improve the scores of discriminator and generator separately.
As generator and discriminator have opposite goals, they compete against each other in so called mini-max game. Forward pass and backpropagation is repeated until the generated sequences are not improving further or is hardly distinguishable from real ones.
To train ProteinGAN we used Google cloud instance with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU (16GB). Training took approximately 60h for each class which contained at least 20000 unique proteins. Entire network contained ~4M trainable parameters. For optimization Adam optimizer has been chosen with learning rates of 0,0001 for discriminator and generator (β1 = 0, β2 = 0,9). Both discriminator and generator were trained the same"
Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the cell’s internal mechanisms significantly though and expand their approach to other living conditions, only adjusting the DNA duplication and AHL diffusion processes.
We built this first model to better understand the constraints and basic properties of the physical system, before going into greater depth in the following sections. A caveat to our extrapolation is that cellular metabolism could be significantly altered when cells enter a stationary growth phase, impacting the core QS functionality. We keep this in mind, but have found no way to account for it.
In the following section, we present exploratory simulations of the system's behaviour.
Results (no custom growth model)
Figure 3: Evolution of the QS dynamics when the dilution protocol described in [ 1 ] is implemented. Dividing bacteria constantly dilute their cytoplasm, severely slowing down QS. Culture volume: 0.2nL
Figure 4: Same culture volume (0.2nL), but without the dilution protocol and with the bacteria in the stationary phase
First, we simulate the system exactly as specified in the source material ( figure 3 ), with the cells in a constant exponential growth phase and their density ($\Rightarrow$ their number) maintained. This implies constant dilution, which affects all chemical species apart from the DNA, which exactly compensates with replication. Because there are only 100 bacteria with a total cytoplasmic volume of 1.7e-4 nL in a 0.2 nL culture, AHL increases very slowly and QS toggling doesn’t happen within 25 hours.
Without growing, and therefore without diluting to keep the bacteria at a constant density, the quorum sensing transition is triggered at 15 hours ( figure 4 ) (t=0 refers to the time when the bacteria have adapted to their environment and begin producing AHL). This is evident by the beginning of the sharp drop in uninduced “DNA”, as well as by a wrinkle on the AHL graph. This wrinkle is telltale: as the DNA is induced, the production rate of LuxI & LuxR is increased. LuxI increases more slowly than LuxR however, resulting in a transient drop in AHL, as more of it is captured by LuxR. A little later, LuxI catches up and AHL levels increase faster.
Figure 5: Same conditions as in figure 4 , changing only the culture volume. Left: 0.1nL Right: 0.4nL
Keeping all the conditions the same as in figure 4 and only tweaking the culture volume, its effect on QS becomes evident ( figure 5 ). When the total"

Levansucrase (sacB)
Background
SacB is the levansucrase enzyme from Bacillus subtilis (Gay, Coq, Strinmetz, Ferrari, & Hoch, 1983) which converts sucrose into fructose polymers which are lethal to Esherichia coli (French & Kowal, 2010) . This part was deposited into the Registry by Team Edinburgh 2010 and can be used as a counter selectable marker (French & Kowal, 2010) . Our aim is to improve the part by assessing its counter selection efficiency.
Cloning
The plac-RFP fragment was obtained from the standard BioBrick plasmid and inserted in front of the sacB BioBrick. Method . The construct was confirmed with sequencing .
PCR of pSB1K3 plasmid (Kanamycin resistance) with psBNX3 insF2 forward primer (specific for BioBrick prefix) and dsred r2 reverse primer (specific for RFP) was prepared in order to obtain the plac-RFP fragment.

a. How would you assess the potential of Synthetic Biology?
b. How would you assess the risk of Synthetic Biology?
5. Would you support an enhanced promotion of Synthetic Biology?
The survey said that the members of the parliament believe in a high potential of synthetic biology in the area of healthcare, medicine and energy research. In the field of nutrition, they do not expect to significant improvements through synthetic biology researches. The members of the parliament classified the risks of research in the field of synthetic biology as average.
This survey also shows a positive trend for the enhancement of research in the field of synthetic biology by the German government. Mainly the members of the parliament regard the field of healthcare, medicine and energy research as having great potential for the future of synthetic biology.
Potsdam_Bioware meeting a member of the German parliament
In our survey we asked politicians about the potential and risks of Synthetic Biology. We only got a few answers, which is a statement by itself. This outcome raised some questions: What should we expect from non-scientists? What do they know about Synthetic Biology!? Having this in mind, how can they judge Synthetic Biology, if they do not even know what it means?
That is why we were very lucky that Mr. René Röspel, a member of the German Parliament and of the party SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschland/ Social democratic party of Germany) invited us to the governmental Paul-Loebe House in Berlin on the 27th October as a response to the survey. He holds a diploma degree in biology and closely follows governmental actions in Synthetic Biology. We had a vivid discussion with him and his group about Synthetic Biology, its advantages and disadvantages for the community, its potential, as well as the differentiation of Synthetic Biology from classic gene- or biotechnology. We presented them our project and our perspective on Synthetic Biology.
Synthetic Biology is the mindset to use and combine principles and modularity of nature with technical ideas in order to achieve useful systems. We pointed out that Synthetic Biology is a combination of research fields. It is a connection of biology, chemistry, physics, informatics and engineering. There are no clear defined borders between Synthetic Biology, molecular biology, biochemistry and gene- or biotechnology. Synthetic Biology links life sciences and engineering, which provides enormous potential. The discussion with Mr. Röspel revealed that Synthetic Biology is more controversial in Germany compared to other (European) countries. In Germany many people are skeptical about technology involving gene manipulation. We learned that it will be our task to dismantle these concerns and make people understand"

Lastly, a promoter that is activated by a compound resulting from the activation of the previous two units. In our sketch, this compound is a LuxR-HSL complex, which can activate the promoters of several BioBrick parts, such as <partinfo>BBa_K145150</partinfo> or <partinfo>BBa_R0062</partinfo>.
Genes
LuxI is a acyl homoserine lactone syntase, an enzyme catalyzing the production of a homoserine lactone (HSL) from the precursors S-adenosyl methionine (Sam) and hexanoyl-ACP (Hex). The normal function of LuxI is as part of the bacterial lux system, a quorom-sensing system allowing cells in proximity to sense each others presence, estimate the local cell population and regulate bioluminescence . LuxI is available as the BioBrick part <partinfo>BBa_K092400</partinfo>.
File:NTNU 3OHSL.gif
3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone is synthesized by LuxI
LuxR is another protein in the lux system, and acts by binding to 3OC6HSL, the product formed by the catalytic activity of LuxI. LuxR-HSL then acts on gene promoters to regulate genetic expression. We will use the simultaneous expression of LuxR and LuxI leading to the the formation of LuxR-HSL to activate the lysis device which causes the cell to dissolve and release its produced toxin.
The lysis device was made by the UC Berkeley iGEM 2008 team. The genes are from the bacteriophage T4 (a virus that infects bacteria). We have placed the LuxR+HSL-activated promoter in front of the part to control the initiation of cell lysis.

Colicin E1 is a type of Colicin, a bacteriocin made by E. coli,and which acts against other nearby E. coli by forming a pore in the membrane, leading to depolarisation of the membrane killing the cell [7] .

ACHIEVEMENTS
With significant advances in sequencing and synthesis technologies, and our understanding of gene function and genetic regulatory networks, we have the capacity to design complex biosynthetic systems that distribute metabolic load optimally between multiple co-existing strains1.  A significant challenge in the engineering of synthetic co-cultures is the regulation of population dynamics within the culture.  In natural systems, relative fitness, growth rates and interdependencies lead to an equilibrium between members of a community1-3.  In engineered co-cultures, activity of the biosynthetic pathway of interest in not related to fitness of each individual strain.  Competition between strains, as well as varied growth characteristics, may skew ratios in the population in ways that decrease the biosynthetic efficiency of the system1.
Various methods of addressing this concern have been employed.  Engineering interdependence of strain, where auxotrophs are reliant on a metabolite produced by the other strain will maintain co-culture members4.  Engineering dependence on specific carbon sources can also minimize competition between members of a synthetic community.  A previous iGEM team ( Imperial College ) used quorum sensing to engineer communication between strains in a co-culture, enabling the maintenance of a set ratio between strains.  However, in none of these cases is the ratio related to the engineered biosynthetic process.
This project aims to engineer a co-culture in which population dynamics are regulated by the production of the pathway intermediate naringenin2,3.  A biosynthetic imbalance in strain ratios will lead to either a build-up of naringenin in the culture or a naringenin deficit, with strain 1 being unable to produce as much naringenin as could be consumed by the strain 2 component of the population.  Both of these outcomes will decrease the biosynthetic potential of the co-culture.
In order to overcome this risk, growth rates and activities of strains were coupled to the biosynthesis of naringenin within the system using the FdeR biosensor system 5.  By coupling GP2 expression directly to the FdeR biosensor, the growth rate and activity of strain 1 will decrease as naringenin builds up6.  By using the pt"

The Exeter iGEM team aided us in characterising the deGFP using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to get single-cell data. The J23100-deGFP plasmid DNA (BBa_K2205002) was transformed into Top10 E. coli cells by the Exeter iGEM team. They then used a FACS machine to analyse the fluorescence of 10,000 cells in 2 cultures of wild types cells, and 5 cultures of Top10 cells expressing deGFP. We then analysed the data to determine that approximately ~50% of cells in the culture were fluorescent (Figure 5).
Figure 5: Single cell data for E. coli cells expressing deGFP (collected by Exeter iGEM). Columns 1-6: cells expressing deGFP. Columns 7 and 8: wild type Top10 cells. Red parts of the bar are non-fluorescent cells, green parts are fluorescent cells.
Expression of deGFP in a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system was then tested. Commercial S30 cell free kits for circular DNA from Promega were used so that results could be easily compared between labs. Reactions were prepared as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a master mix for 10 reactions was prepared (200 μL S30 premix, 150 μL S30 extract, 25 μL amino acid mix minus leucine, 25 μL amino acid mix minus cysteine) and 40 μL was added to nine tubes. To three tubes 1.2 μg J23100-deGFP was added, and J23100-sfGFP plasmid DNA was added to a further three. All reactions were then made up to 50 μL with nuclease-free water and transferred to a 96-well plate. Reactions were incubated in a BMG Labtech Fluostar Optima plate-reader at 37oC with fluorescence readings (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm) every 15 mins. It was found that, as expected, expression of the J23100-deGFP construct showed fluorescence above background level (Figure 6). It was also found that expression of the J23100-sfGFP construct in a CFPS system results in higher levels of fluorescence than deGFP. Therefore, although deGFP may show improved expression in CFPS systems than other GFP variants, sfGFP still shows higher fluorescence levels.

This is a promoter that is activated by the OmpR-like two-component response regulator BCAM0228 (BBa_K1315007) in the BCAM0227-BCAM0228 sensor system. The Burkholderia diffusible signal (BDSF) is picked up by the BCAM0227 sensor kinase that is hypothesised to eventually lead in involvement to the phosphorylation of BCAM0228.

pRB23 assembly was unsuccessful, pRB22 is correct (plates turn blue), pRB24 seems to be correct (small deep blue colonies), pRB19 didn't work, pKH5 seems correct. We prepped the marked colonies. Sequencing showed that pRB22 is correct and doesn't carry endogenous RFC10 cutting sites any longer. Test digestion with EcoRI and SpeI also enforced this result.
We performed a PCR with Phusion HF and KH3/4 from pRB22, assembled it in a CPEC approach with ccdB KH9/10 and transformed OneShot cells.
Colony screenings and test-transformation in TOP10 cells showed that the assembly was successful and that we're able to shuffle the T-domains.

Local Survey
Background on our respondents:
Out of the 68 people that were surveyed, 52.9% were 18-20, while the next most common age group was 21-29 with 29.4%. The gender balance of our respondents was 52.9% male and 47.1% female. Additionally, over 60% of respondents are not Evanston residents; however, 25 people surveyed (36.7%) live in Chicago.
The pie chart below shows the varying levels of education among respondents:
Figure 1: Responses to Education Level
Based on the responses, a vast majority (60 out of 68) identified water pollution as a moderate to serious problem on a national level. However, only 41 thought it was a moderate to serious problem on a local level. This data is logical as 55 respondents stated that their knowledge of the U.S. Steel chromium spill into Lake Michigan was “very poor” or “poor”. In addition, 88.2% of those surveyed had never tested their water for contaminants. Through this, we learned that we not only needed to develop a sensor to make testing water more accessible and easy, but that we also needed to educate the public on the prevalence of water contamination in their neighborhood.
Figure 2: Responses to Local and National Knowledge
After the results from the survey came in, we resolved that we needed to have a paper-based sensor that had an immediate colorimetric output (as per suggestion from Professor Jewett as well). 46 respondents said that they favored a paper-based system and 30 said it would be concerning to send the sample into a lab. This coincides with the idea that people will not use a product that is an inconvenience to them, especially if they do not know exactly how it works or where its going, as most of the general public would not.
Figure 3: Responses to Willingness to Using Paper-based Assay
In terms of distribution, an overwhelming majority, 82.4%, thought the best way to get our system into citizen’s hands was through mail; thus we deduced that in future developments, we would partner with a distributor to ship them out.
Survey Limitations
It should be noted that the survey was self-selected and was distributed"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," pick out the binder amongst the rest of the non-binders.
Testing the cutting/ligation by combining all of the oligos first, and then carrying out the construction of the different expression plasmids all in the same tube.
Note that the results for both will ultimately yield DNA libraries if they work (except that the first experiment is much more foolproof in terms of actually yielding a library than the second experiment).
To carry out the first experiment, the following steps need to be undertaken:
Perform PCRs on each of the practice plate oligos such that we end up with a relatively high concentration of DNA after PCR and PCR purification (over 40 ng/ul).
Cut both plasmid backbone and oligos with BsaI type II restriction enzyme.
PCR purify restriction products to get rid of enzyme and junk DNA.
Run phosphatase reaction to prevent autoligation.
Mix and ligate to get full plasmid.
Some tips:
Each ligation reaction should only have 10-15 ul volume.
You should have 100 ng of backbone per reaction
Since we are planning 18 reactions, we will need 1800 ng of backbone, which is several minipreps worth
The backbone:oligo ratio should be appoximately 1:4
In our case, the backbone is 2.2 kb and the insert is 131 bp, so for 100 ng of backbone there should be ~20 ng of insert
Gel extract plasmid to get final library.
Today, we did PCRs and PCR purifications for step one as outlined above.  We tested the concentrations of the results, displayed below:
DNA concentrations
In order to have enough backbone to work with, we seeded some LB/spec with CB bottom bacteria in preparation for 4 minipreps of 3 mL each tomorrow.  This should definitely yield the 1800 ng of backbone we will need for the ligation.
Practice plate primer tag test
We tested the primers to see if their selection of subpools was exclusive enough or not (i.e. to make sure that our control primers did not amplify the CB bottom sequences, etc.).  We ran a PCR crossing primers with DNA with the following results:
Strange results
The first and third lanes are CB primer/CB DNA and control primer/control DNA respectively, which should yield bands.  Lanes two and four were control primer/CB DNA and CB primer/control DNA respectively, which should yield no bands.  The fact that we got bands for these lanes is a little bit worrying, and so we are repeating this PCR"

EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#HumanPractice#Article_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the absence of pressure, CpxR is divided in two distinct and inactive parts. These parts reassemble in case of pressure on the bacterial envelope and constitute the CpxR protein itself, active this time. The team of students based the concept of their project on this mechanism. « We have genetically modified Escherichia coli, so that it emits light when it is subjected to pressure », details Sakura Nussbaum. The luminescence is ensured by a protein coming from glow worm, the luciferase. This protein is « grafted » on the CpxR protein and emits light only when the two parts are assembled.
Thus, the students have bacteria that emit light when we touch them. To take advantage of this, they used a microfluidic chip. This is a small plate of a few centimeters long, composed of PDMS, a carbon and silicium polymere which structure is slightly malleable. The chip is made of 768 tiny cavities of a few micrometers in diameter in which are placed bacteria with a little culture medium. « Each chamber constitutes in a way one pixel », indicates Axel De Tonnac, the microfluidics specialist of the crew. The students are currently verifying that their bacteria really emit light when pressure is applied on it. Here is where their work is. Of course, they are still far away from a hypothetical « BioPad », but the project only started this summer. « We are still at the stage of proof of concept, admits Axel De Tonnac, But our objective now is to make sure that everything works as expected, and to present our work at the iGEM competition. »
The whole team is going to fly to Boston, where the competition international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) will take place. Starting on the 30th of octobre and organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), this competition reassembles 220 teams of students, from different specialities. It brings synthetic biology at honour, a discipline in which biologists work as engineers and build standardized biological compounds, « biobricks », which can be useful in the future for other researchers wanting to give particular function to living organisms.
Naturally, the obstacles to the realisation of a screen are numerous. How to renew the culture medium once it is used ? How to control the multiplication of the bacteria without compromising the performance of electric circuits ?

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Lab#Plants_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of HBV-positive cells five-fold or more, but mechanism of immunity not entirely clear. For most gRNA designs, the Cas9 breaks induces short insertions and deletions, likely caused by error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining of the cleaved ends, and the number of indels correlated with the reduction in virulence. One design, however, left 55% of cells wild-type while achieving similar reductions. The dynamics of repair and deletion after double-stranded cleavage by Cas9 is a major focus of the mathematical modelling this year. However, we didn't have time to finish those models before ordering our gRNA constructs, so we decided to design targets for several possible situations.
I. Targeting P1, P3, P5, P6
We chose to target these genes because they have well-established functions related to the dynamics of CaMV inside the plant cell. P2 is not targeted because it is related to interactions with the aphid vector and P4 has a number of isomorphisms that make it somewhat impractical for targeting. You can see more about the functions of each of these genes on the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus wiki page .
II. Multiple targets on P6
P6 trans-activates the 35s mRNA and is responsible for many of the viral defences against the plant cell, making it the obvious choice if only a single gene is targeted. By placing a number of targets on P6, we hope we might disrupt its activity more immediately and induce large deletions when multiple cuts occur at one.
III. Target non-coding locations around promoter
This design lets us examine whether large deletions may be created by flanking a region with Cas9 sites and whether double-stranded breaks alone are descrutive. If CRISPR immunity is mainly conferred by frameshift mutations or small deletions caused by NHEJ, we wouldn't expect this design to offer much reduction in virulence. However, if CRISPR immunity is mainly conferred by degradation of cleaved DNA or large deletions between neighbouring cut sites, we would still expect a significant reduction in virulence. If we see a significant reduction in virulence with this design, we'll have to examine the DNA structure to see if there are large deletions.
IV. Reduce mRNA transciption using dCas9
Perhaps NHEJ is insufficiently error-prone to eliminate the viruses at the pace we need or that non-destructive mutations introduced by NHEJ will change the DNA sequence enough to prevent prevent Cas9 from recognizing the site for a second attempt. In these cases"

GeorgiaTech,2010,Team:GeorgiaTech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," recA, and aceE,F, and hypbB [8]. Qoronfleh et. al. have demonstrated that naturally occurring cold-inducible promoters in E. coli could be exploited to develop more effective systems for low-temperature expression of heterologous proteins in plasmid-based vectors. Based on previous characterization by UCSF in 2005, we chose the HybB promoter due to distinct on/off states between 37°C and 20°C.
Future Focus
Biofilm Formation
In a large number of microbial species, non-optimal growth conditions and cellular stress stimulate biofilm formation [9]. In E. coli, lower temperatures promote several adhesive factors [10]. These factors are largely dependent on a stress-response gene, RpoS, initiated in the σs subunit of RNA polymerase. Translation of σs increases at 20°C suggesting that RpoS-dependent gene products play a role in cellular adaptation to a cold shock [11]. As a defense mechanism against an environmental stress, cells can produce various extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) that can be manipulated for adhesion and biofilm formation. One EPS signal molecule regulated by RpoS is cyclic-di-guanosine monophoshpate (c-di-GMP). c-di-GMP is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) which is associated with the GGDEF domain [12]. The GGDEF protein YddV can stimulate cell aggregation and EPS production via its diguanylate cyclase activity. Overexpression of the YddV protein results in a major rearrangement of the bacterial cell’s global gene expression pattern causing the culture to transition from planktonic to biofilm growth through upregulation of EPS-related genes and RpoS [13]. YddV increases EPS production through stimulation of specific gene transcriptions leading to expression of the protein CsgD. CsgD activates curli fiber production, which is an adhesion factor in E. coli.
Cold shock induced biofilm formation can be heightened by a mutation in the ompR gene, ompR234. This mutation initiates transcription of the CsgD protein thereby resulting in an increase in biofilm formation [14]. The resulting cold activated biofilm formation will be paired with expression of the alternative oxidase (AOX1) gene. Pairing cellular group formation with heat production will provide evolutionary insight and allow for the engineering of microorganisms holding utility for institutions such as the Department of Energy and Department of Defense.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

2) Spot test compared to control (top: BL21; bottom: W3110)
Circular plaques formed for each spot test. The plaques decreased in size as phage in LB becomes more diluted. No contamination seen.
3) Titer test compared to control (top: BL21; bottom: W3110)
Phage is clearing up the entire plate. This indicates that the phage we used are at too high of a concentration.
V) Conclusions
- T7* is the WT T7 phage. It is able to grow on E coli BL21.
- Our stock phage liquid culture is at too high concentration to form a few individual plaques on a plate. It’s clearing up the entire area.
VI) Proposed next step
1) Perform the same spot test with more diluted T7 solution. Look for where the plaques are barely forming.

There is a not so clear band at the height about 29 kDa, which could indicate that EGFP was expressed.  For the MG1655 samples only samples 1, 8 and 9 were taken to see whether there was an increase in intensity (this gel was less promising than the XL1-Blue samples).

SDSgelMG1655 12% SDS gel with the bugbustered samples of the Mg1655 anaerobic expressions of EGFP (1-9 in the Biofermentor, 10&11 in the incubator.
The gel with the purified samples is shown in . For the XL1-Blue samples there is a band around 50 kDa that increases in intensity. There is also a less intense band that might increase in intensity at around 30 kDa. This could indicate that EGFP, of which the molecular weight is 30kDa, is being expressed. Since the concentrations measured using nandrop after purification were very low, this could explain why the intensity is not that high. For the MG1655 a clear band is located around 45 kDa, which seems to correspond with the bands seen before on the unpurified gel, but this does not give us any information about EGFP expression.  By cross referencing these gels with previous gels from other experiments we were able to propose with high certainty that the thicker bands at 50kDA were native proteins being expressed naturally in anaerobic environments. A good follow up experiment could be to find out which proteins these are and to investigate their expression mechanism, although this is most definitely beyond the scope of our current experiment.

Repeat Experiments
To further test the FNR promoter and therefore the expression of EGFP, the above mentioned experiments were repeated two further times. The first of these repeats was equal to the previous expression experiments, where the oxygen concentration was kept at 0%. The second differed in this fact by maintaining a constant oxygen concentration of 5%. During both these expressions the optical density of the medium was recorded each time a sample was taken, which would allow for a more accurate representation of the EGFP expression per bacterial cell.

We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.
--Luojun Wang, author of USTC_SOFTWARE human practice
Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong (in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang (in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As"

Financials:
We were sponsored by Zymo Research with Kits and T-Shirts. To thank them, we will take a group picture with the shirts and post it on our facebook profile.
Events:
We decided to participate in the meeting of the European iGEM teams in Paris (16/06/01-16/06/03) and intend to book the hotel rooms organized by the iGEM teams from Paris and bus tickets.
16/05/18:
Wet lab:
The vector from Thermo Fisher has arrived, so we could start with inserting our constructs. The work on electro competent cells, test transformations and ligation of the MutB construct should be finished by 6th of june.
Human practice:
We intend to present our project and iGEM at the “GZMB Sommerfest”. In return, we will offer our support in organizing the event.
Organization:
We discussed the final design for our team T-Shirts and possible offers for printing them.
16/05/30:
Dry lab:
Genis will help us to design the first primers and give us an introduction into the snapgene program.
Wet lab:
The newly prepared electro competent cells need to be tested. If necessary, we will repeat the preparation.
Human practice:
We need to continue working on our poster for the Master Information Day.
Organization:
For our website, we want to create a new figure of our “Synporter”.
June
Week 1: IF, LK, TK, GH, ME, AB
Test transformation:
The newly prepared electro competent cells were tested and compared with a test transformation of cells provided by our supervisor Genis. Only the S. blattae cells showed antibiotic resistance.
MutB construct:
After having received the synthesized constructs from IDT, we could start to prepare the constructs. MutB had to be ordered with a restriction site and synthesized in two fragments due to its length. Therefore, it had to be digested with HindIII, purified and ligated.
Week 2:
No wet lab work done.
Week 3: AB, ME
Competent cells:
The preparation of electro competent cells was repeated for R. planticola and test transformations with a simple kanamycin vector were successful.
MutB construct:
The ligation of the two fragments was repeated. Additionally, the synthesized MutB1 and MutB2 fragments were amplified by PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis and gel extraction to prepare a stock.
Week 4: AB, ME

Example measurement proving incorporation of amino acids: The wild type Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with pFRY , a flourescent reporter plasmid for measurement of incorporation of ncAA into BL21 DE3 gold, which is induced by 100 µM ITPG. pFRY is one part of the two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation efficiency of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing an amber stop. When induced with IPTG, a the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelty and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1, and sfGFP were obtained through measurements with a modified Biolector set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020051
- mutated tRNA synthetase specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli → Y-RS with Y32G This is a DMNBS-synthetase to be used as an orthogonal tRNA synthetase in E. coli. It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA K2020042 to incorporate tyrosine in response to an amber stop codon. This synthetase has Y32 mutated to glycine and is therefore a template for further mutations for the purpose of changing amino acid specificity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

How our knockouts and insertions will work:
Synechocystis have an interesting characteristic in that it will undergo homologous recombination between its’ chromosome and plasmid in the homologous region. This is because Synechocystis is naturally transformable. Our gene deletions and insertions work by undergoing recombination in regions that they share homology with. The gene deletions will replace the gene with kanamycin resistance and the insertions simply place another copy of the desired gene into the Synechocystis genome.

If westernblots are successful: Perform cell lysis, pool enzymes and make in vitro experiment, have Prof. Hoffman analyse/detect Xanthohumol on monday (LC-MS).

Milestone from last week: finished Cloning + start expression
Jeff is sleeping - finally :-)
All BiobBicks will be finished, despite all the problems (large BioBricks!)
Parts will be transformed in yeast
Constitutive promoters
Milestone from last week: begin with characterization of the promoters using thaumatin and GFP?
TEF2-luciferase ligation/transformation did not work. TEF1 promoter is being used by several other groups.
Characterization of TEF1, ADH1 promoters: Promoter-Luciferase-constructs have been transformed in yeast.
Terminators are finished
Genome integration and brewing
Integration transformation worked well. Integrated constructs: mOrange, G418 resistance
Now: Culture cells for a number of generations without selective pressure and then analyse how viable they are under selective conditions afterwards --> if they are still resistant, the casette has been integrated successfully. Generate additional data (not only the resistance has been integrated, but is the expression casette also functional?): Measure mOrange fluorescence.
Integration of Limonene: Integration vector is almost finished --> miniprep tomorrow. Integration of Limonene-Synthase can be finished by Sunday/Monday.
Integration of Thaumatin: Has already been done, we have colonies, but results are ambiguous. Will be repeated?

Bigger challenge for gene circuits
    Obviously, the idea of periodically changing codebook is a bigger challenge for the construction of gene circuits. We consider to realize it by designing a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing auto inducers (AI-1: AHL & AI-2:DPD) to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately.
When one substance reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one, which represents the changing of codebooks. For an example, when a red light is inputted, whether the bacteria will express RFP or GFP is determined by the relative quantity of AHL and DPD. If the quantity of AHL exceeds DPD, the bacteria will produce GFP. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered.
It is hard for oscillation system to maintain stability because of interference from bacteria division, product accumulation and other possible factors. We use micro-fluidic technology to refresh media in time, and maintain the quantity of bacteria. We hope we could observe a more stable, and sturdier oscillation, providing a reliable switch for our cipher machine.

Overall
Part improvement
     For better description of single oscillation system, we measured the response intensity of pluxR to AHL. The part we used is
BBa_R0062 from ETH_Zurich 2014.
ZJU-CHINA 2016
ETH_Zurich 2014
     We found that the response threshold of pluxR to AHL isn’t exactly as what shown in ETH_Zurich 2014. The minimum response concentration is about 10^-9 M instead of 10^-11M, the maximum response concentration is about 10^-6M instead of 10^-7M. And the relation curve is different with ETH_Zurich 2014, too. We believe that our result are more precise and our model match reality better, since more samples were used in our experiment.
"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," risks associated with GMO food. The mentioned risks are only a select few of all conceivable scenarios but we thought them to be the most conceivable ones.
1. Unexpected gene interactions
This problem can be solved by inserting the desired gene conjoined with a promoter into the GMO. The gene next to the insertion site will then be expressed by the promoter and if it codes for a toxin or an allergen the researchers can look for a more suitable location to insert their gene of interest.
2. Introduction of new allergens
To tackle this problem creators of new GMO´s should avoid using genes from known allergen sources like peanuts. Furthermore there must be an evaluation of the new protein´s stability regarding the processing of the food as well as digestive processes.
3. Horizontal gene transfer
The most commonly feared type of horizontal gene transfer is between ingested food and microbial organisms in the human gastrointestinal track, giving bacteria the chance to incorporate genes for antibiotic resistance. This problem can be either addressed by using unusual antibiotic resistances like the kanamycin resistance or, like the EU did, by mandating the excision of the antibiotic marker genes after the initial multiplication step ( EU directive 2001/18 ).
4. Destruction of biodiversity
While it is true that GMO´s could supersede their wildtype equivalents, a maintenance of seed banks to preserve wildtype genomes could prevent loosing natural species for good. Additionally delivering food aid processed to countries prohibiting the planting of GMO crops on their territory can counter a fear of unwanted spreading of said transgenic plants.
Conclusion
Our research has shown us more clearly than we imagined that there is a wide disparity between public perception and actual scientific advancement in the field of genetically modified plants. We accredit this observation to several factors. Only a few decades ago science progressed slow enough for society to adapt accordingly but with the emersion of computers and the Internet the intellectual output grew exponentially making it very difficult for laymen to comprehend where modern research has arrived. This circumstance combined with the natural human tendency to be skeptic about anything new and the fact that GMO crops were not beneficial for consumers but for farmers when they were introduced, created an attitude of rash rejection of genetically altered food. Additionally there has been a rapid emergence of environmentalist groups in the EU and specifically in Germany. As most of these groups became more influential they tried to block public discourse about biotechnology by influencing media outlets and prohibiting educational measures further intensifying the problem. In conclusion we feel that the problem of a negative public perception regarding biotechnology and synthetic biology is a big one and it is of great importance to address it. In this day and age scientists are not only researchers anymore"

New tests with the same UV plate but with different filter, lent by Clément. While trying them, I remembered an advice given by my optics teacher Lionel Bastard, that reducing the habitable area decreases the noise level. Moreover, I was yet very close to the saturation, so these were 2 reasons to hide a great part of the photodiode with black scotch tape. I reached 3.9V with an assembly of 2 filters, but I noticed I had better performance with my own filter as I reached 2.9V. This measures were performed with fluorescent bacteria. I felt confident and performed several measures on this Petri dish, then with a Petri dish with LB agar, and I calculated the dark current of the photodiode. This day was the 1st time I got coherent results about qualitative fluorescence, as the voltage was higher with fluorescent bacteria:
Actually the control is wrong, and new measures were performed with transformed bacteria that are not fluorescent, which changes the voltage, but I didn’t make the calculus yet.
To confirm the previous result, I wanted to measure fluorescence with another Petri dish which is also highly concentrated in fluorescent bacteria, but still less than the 1st one. Here the results are not good as the voltage is lower than the control voltage. However, I should do this experiment again as I think I went a little too fast through it.
Now it begins to be shitty: the UV transilluminator I used doesn’t work anymore. So I changed it, but it means I need to do my experiments again as the light excitation is brighter. So I began to do again the experiments but now I have no voltage difference. The voltage is higher (3.9V), so I guess the light should not be too bright.  So I did the experiments again, and I don’t know why it failed before, but with the light reduced to 70% of the maximum, I can see a voltage difference again:
So I can see something, but with such concentrated bacteria, I’d hope to have higher voltages. Well, this shows how important the amplification stage is. It seems that I could use a gain of 10. But this will be determined undoubtedly with a liquid detection. This is what I tried to perform next but I struggle to have a decent apparatus to do my experiments: the photodiode"

Collaborations
During our iGEM summer, we have been in contact with different teams. In the iGEM competition, working together is a springboard for going as far as possible. Indeed, we think that collaboration makes better science and inspire each other: Together, to go further!
This year iGEM Évry has collaborated with several teams:
Science
Paris Bettencourt
As working with Pseudomonas putida, we provided to the iGEM Bettencourt team our organism, allowing the study of its ability to degrade quercitin for their project.
We also helped them studying the degradation of quercitin, antocyanin and malvidin, by running HPLC and MS experiments. Check it out here!
Imperial college
This year, Imperial College aimed to develop a framework for engineering co-cultures. We were contacted by the team and we helped them by running specific grow experiment on our organism Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We provided the data for their tool to facilitate the design and optimization of co-cultures.
iGEM Event
The European Experience
On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS: team. This event allowed to gather more than 150 iGEMers with about 30 teams coming from 11 different countries in all Europe.
All the teams were able to present their project in a friendship mood. It was a great occasion to share our ideas, our different points of view and explore new possibilities about our project and collaborations. If you want to know more details about it, click here!

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#modelorganism_-_-_TEXT.html," referring to model organism: the term “chassis”. Though this term may surprise when first heard (one spontaneously think of mechanics rather than biology) it is quite coherent with the project of synthetic biology: making biology easier to engineer. The epistemology of synthetic biology is not a descriptive one but a pragmatic or a technological one. We have to produce knowledge by building and standardizing our construction, to make it possible to work in a large scale. As synthetic biology introduces new terms, it is important to analyze them in order to get clearly what they mean, and try to establish whether they are necessary or not. Recalling the Occam’s razor, maybe it is no use and sometimes misguiding to multiply entities when there is no need. We will first remind what is understood by the term model organism, and justify why Xenopus is a very interesting model organism. We will analyze the term chassis in order to emphasize the epistemological differences that can be made between a chassis and a model organism, and therefore wonder if Xenopus matches those characteristics.
R. Burian [5]  suggested four characteristics defining what a good model organism is: a) the organism should be useful to realize a certain objective of research, b) easy to manipulate regarding the topic of the research, c) there should exist a large amount of experimental resources coming with the organism such as genomic data, and d) the organism should represent a class of organism with a specific interest. Though the practical usefulness of a model organism is mainly the large amount of data gathered around it, it is important for biology to have many different model organisms, representing different nods in the phylogenetic tree and remembering us that contrary to what François Jacob once said, what is true for Escherichia coli isn’t necessary true for the elephant. As seen with the foreword, frogs have been by the past a quite useful organism for biology, for reasons different from those invoked before and on which we will develop in another part of our reflection. The old martyr of experimental physiology [6] has been progressively replaced by the now favorites model organisms of molecular biology and experimental medicine, which are the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the bacteria Escherichia coli, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the mouse Mus musculus (these are the most popular).
However batrachians in the name of Xenopus tropicalis are still widely use and might come back in the limelight. In 2010 Xenopus tropicalis’ genome was fully sequenced [7] and the frog is entering the realm of postgenomic model organisms. This frog is"

In 1998, it merged with two other institutes of southern Denmark and became SDU. It has locations in multiple cities all over Denmark including Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse, and Copenhagen with a shared focus on education and research. There are approximately 3.200 employees and more than 20.000 students enrolled; about half live and study in the city of Odense. Source http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU
Odense
Odense is quite an extraordinary city. Even though it’s the 3rd largest city of Denmark, Odense only has 2 buildings taller than the 4th floor. The city name originates from “Odins Vi”, meaning a shrine for the worshiping of Odin, the allfather of all gods from the Nordic mythology.
Located on the isle of Funen, placed almost perfectly in the middle of Denmark and with it’s direct connection to the ocean through a cove, Odense was a rich city of trade. A number of Danish kings lived in the city, Knud the Holy was even killed on the altar of the Albani cathedral during a tax-induced revolt. However, any historical figure pales in comparison to the famous author and storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, the most cherished son of Odense.

Effect of Toxin
Toxin and antitoxin (TA) modules frequently coexist in bacterial genomes. Toxins may cause growth inhibition or death by targeting at DNA replication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, cell-wall biosynthesis, and ATP synthesis [9] .
We study the effects of toxin alone on cell growth in our experiments. We prepare five kinds of plasmid: without toxin, with toxin 134, toxin 136, toxin 1204 and toxin 6249, all of which have RGP_Ptec promoter and are therefore regulated by tetracycline antibiotics."

It is important to realize that commercialization is a multi-year effort. As such, it can be beneficial to develop a commercialization plan (Office of Technology Transfer). This plan gives a general outline of what information the R&D industry will be looking for when it comes time to make a pitch. Details about market size and growth rates, predicted sales figures for the first five years, licensing agreements and more can all prove invaluable when attempting to bring a product to market.  Preparedness in regards to this information can make the difference between a successful pitch and an unsuccessful one.
In summary, pitching the Staphiscope to the R&D industry is a complex process that must be handled correctly to ensure its successful commercialization.

How Do We Achieve Public Acceptance?
For years, it has been believed that the prevalence of MRSA infections has resided within the walls of either a hospital or health care facility. Due to understated hygienic practices, a modified and relatively more virulent strain of Staphylococcus Aureus has also threatened several community based settings. In addition to Hospital Acquired MRSA, general health practitioners must also take into account the occurrence of community acquired MRSA.  It is important to educate the public about the applications and relative benefit of the Staphiscope. Thus, there needs to be a channel of communication that allows for a transfer of knowledge between the scientific and non-scientific community.
Who Do We Want To Educate?
Given that MRSA may not only be spread within a hospital but also within the community, there are quite a few demographics that would gain value in understanding the benefit of the Staphis"

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a commonly used method to separate complex mixtures of proteins. In an electric field the negatively charged proteins migrate towards the anode. Moving through the small pores of the gel matrix, the proteins are separated according to their size. Using a marker, the relative molecular weights of proteins within the sample can be determined. Denaturating gels are prepared as described by Laemmli et al. (1970). The gels consist of a stacking and a running gel and are poured to a thickness of 1 mm. The acrylamide in the mixtures builds long chains that are bridged by N, N′- methylenbisacrylamid (mixture 37.5:1), the result is a gel matrix. The polymerization process is induced by radical starter APS and the catalysator TEMED.
The Material
6x SDS loading dye
10x Running (PAGE) buffer
1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8
1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8
TEMED/TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine)
Acrylamide:Bis-Acrylamide (37.5:1, TOXIC!!!)
APS (Ammonium persulfate, 10 %)
SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 %)

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

The gBlock also contains the original qnrS1 gene sequence from E. coli. qnr genes code for pentapeptide repeat proteins. These proteins reduce susceptibility to quinolones by protecting the complex of DNA and DNA gyrase enzyme from the inhibitory effect of quinolones. Finally, this gBlock contains a double terminator BBa_B0015 from iGEM as well as the prefix and suffix for BioBricks. In summary the ciprofloxacin cassette consists of the following parts PAtpI+RBS+qnrS1+2TER. BBa_K823023 is an available BioBrick from igem Munich 2012. It is an   integration plasmid for Bacillus subtilis, which can be used for   cloning in E. coli as well. An RFP is inserted in BBa_K823023 for more   efficient screening after transformation. Construction of ciprofloxacin resistance cassette in BBa_K823023 integration plasmid was performed as described in the following.

Tip: Antibiotics should be added to liquid medium immediately prior to use from stock antibiotic solutions that have been filter-sterilized, distributed into aliquots, and stored in the dark at –20°C (see Antibiotics).
Sterilizing media
Sterilize liquid or solid media by autoclaving, using a pressure and time period suitable for the type of medium, bottle size, and autoclave type.
Tip: Fill bottles only 3/4 full with medium and loosen the caps before autoclaving to avoid hot medium boiling over. Tighten caps once the media is cool (<40°C) to keep it completely sterile.
Tip: Antibiotics and nutrients such as amino acids are inactivated by the high temperatures of an autoclave. They should be sterilized by filtration through a filter unit with a pore size of 0.2 µm, and added to the cooled, autoclaved medium from properly stored stock solutions.
Solid media
E. coli strains can generally be streaked and stored on LB plates containing 1.5% agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s). Preparation: Prepare LB medium according to the composition given in Liquid media. Just before autoclaving, add 15 g agar per liter and mix. After autoclaving, swirl the medium gently to distribute the melted agar evenly throughout the solution. Take care that the hot liquid does not boil over when swirled.
Tip: Cool autoclaved agar medium to below 50°C (when you can hold it comfortably) before adding heat-sensitive antibiotics and nutrients. Mix thoroughly to obtain an even concentration throughout the medium before pouring.
Tip: Pour plates in a laminar-flow hood or, if no hood is available, on a cleaned bench surface next to a Bunsen. Use 30–35 ml medium per standard 90 mm petri dish (~30 plates per liter of medium).
After pouring plates, any air bubbles may be removed by passing the flame of a Bunsen burner briefly over the surface. Do not linger with the flame as this may destroy antibiotics in sections of the plates.
Dry plates either directly after solidification or just before use by removing the lids and standing the plates in a laminar-flow hood for 1 hour. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a hood, plates can be dried with the covers slightly open in a 37°C incubator for 30 min, or left upside down with lids on at room temperature for 2–3 days.
Tip: Store plates inverted at 4°C in a dark room or wrapped in aluminum foil"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

Modeling
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aim for the comparison with experimental lab works. Molecular modeling is used to describe atomic and molecular movements inside a system.  With MD simulation we gained information which enzymes fit best for experimental work linking rhamnolipids to the chitosan matrix enzymatically.
Introduction and Assumptions
The state of the art does not allow perfect simulations, therefore some simplifications are necessary.  The possible states of the mechanical system are reduced into a microcanonical ensemble, which is a system that does not exchange particles (N) and energy (E) outside the defined box.  It also has a fixed volume (V). Because of that a system of N particles with coordinates X and velocities V can be defined into two ordinary differential equations shown on the right side.  These equations are termed as the potential in physics or the force field in chemistry. It can be defined through two different ways.  First, as the mathematical form (i.e. the functional approach for the individual types of interaction, mostly borrowed from classical mechanics) or as the atom specific parameters. The parameters are obtained from spectroscopic experiments, diffraction experiments (X-ray diffraction) and/or quantum mechanical calculations (quantum chemistry). For this reason, there can be different parameter sets for a force field approach.  The parameterization of a force field is a big challenge. The choice of the correct force field is an important decision. In general, force fields are only applicable to systems for which they are parameterized (e.g. proteins). The canonical ensemble is characterized by constant temperature.  For production run, the system of isothermal-isobaric (NPT) was used.  In the isothermal–isobaric ensemble, the amount of particle (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. For our simulation we used the npt condition.
$$ F(X)=-\triangledown{}U(X)=M\dot{V}(t)$$ $$V(t)=\dot{X}(t)$$
F is the force

Additionally, using this system allows us to control exactly when the cultures will start to produce the pigment biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore the pigments themselves. This will help the bacteria to survive longer and produce more pigment in case the enzymes or pigments are toxic to the cells. We can choose to induce the system earlier or later, depending on the effects we see. Upregulated expression of the T7 RNAP will also lead to overexpression of the biosynthetic pathway, thus maximizing enzyme and pigment yield.
Melanin
We chose Melanin as our Key color, the black. It was selected because it has previously been produced in E. coli (Lagunas-Muñoz et al., 2006) . The gene we used was melA from the organism Rhizobium etli which had been previously submitted to the Parts Registry (BBa_K193600). We incorporated this gene into our new construct as described above (New Composite Part BBa_K2481108, Figure 2). melA encodes a tyrosinase that converts L-tyrosine to dopaquinone, which then undergoes an enzyme-independent polymerization into melanin (Figure 3).
Figure 2. melA epxression construct for use in E. coli BL21(DE3).
Figure 3. The pathway from L-tyrosine to Melanin with the use of the melA gene.
Indigoidine
The cyan pigment we chose was indigoidine and will be produced by proteins encoded by the indB and indC genes from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Figure 4). The indB gene codes for a putative phosphatase and the indC gene codes for indigoidine synthase. Together, these enzymes convert L-glutamine into indigoidine (Yu et al., 2012, Figure 5.) It has been previously shown that indC alone can produce indogoidine, but the inclusion of indB expression in the system will increase yields significantly (Xu et al.,2015). A previous part for IndC has been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry (BBa_K1152013), though this part originated from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01.

Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
After we forgot to delete the signal peptide sequences, which are present in the fungal laccases we designed new forward primers for the laccases tvel5, tvel10, tvel13, tvel20 and pcil35 with the overhanging ends for cloning in our shuttle vector. Trametes laccases have a signal sequence after the start codon. This signal peptide we now delete by taking the first 20 bases after this sequence in our FW primers.
Our plants had a great time during the last weeks in the climate chamber. So today it was time for them to donate their seeds for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and a PCR (check protocols ). We ran an additional sample with actin primers as a positive control. However both samples did not show any bands. Maybe the high salt concentration in our sample was responsible or the laccase concentration in the 1:10 diluted cDNA was too low. We will do some washing and try again.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
The two plasmids (p570 and p714) with the cellulose binding domains of Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase gene and the cellulose binding protein gene (cbp A) from the fermentation group of Bielefeld University arrived.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
We searched for some information for the best cultivation conditions in the internet. We found an interesting report of the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) containing some interesting facts about different laccases as for example that the bacterial laccases are toxic to the bacterias, so that the production could be better under oxygen limitation and reduced temperature. Based on this article we decided to test flask with and without baffles and different temperatures.
We prepared the basic media and solutions we will need in the lab.
Note: All following BioBricks are cloned into pSB1C3 and therefore cultivated with 20 µg/mL chloramphenicol unless otherwise specified! Cultivations of E. coli KRX without plasmid will be performed without antibiotics.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," 96 well microplate (Figure 3).    This culture is then co-cultured with the reporter cell. This reporter cell detects C4 AHL and expresses GFP in response.
Figure 2: Initial test of the red and white fim switch strains which were spotted onto a lawn of the reporter strain ( BBa_K2205015 ).
Figure 3: Expression of GFP in the reporter ( BBa_K2205015 )strain in co-culture with the Fim switch strains.  The assay was performed using methods described in Fim 96 Plate assay Protocol .  The data shows the expression of GFP in the reporter strain over a standard growth curve.  The FimW and FimR strains represent the white and red variants of the Fim switch strain respectively, these were co-cultured with the reporter strain in a 1:14 ratio.  Each data point is the mean of 3 biological repeats.  RFU stands for relative fluorescence units.
Conclusions
The aim of the Fim switch part was to make a processor module which can be visually inspected for functionality.  The Fim switch has been shown to expresses the eforRed chromoprotein under normal (uninduced) conditions which allows the user to both determine that the strain is alive and has maintained the Fim switch plasmid.  Following induction, the Fim promoter flips direction and begins expressing RhlI which synthesises the C4-AHL quorum sensing molecule.  This has been shown to successfully induce expression of sfGFP in the reporter strain ( BBa_K2205015 ).
Despite several attempts we were unable to produce a Fim switch testing construct where fimE expression could be controlled using the E. coli arabinose inducible promoter.  Though transformations did yield some colonies when trying to make this part, none were red in colour.  This possibly indicates that the arabinose inducible promoter (even when grown on 0.5% w/v glucose) is still too active.  The design for this construct has been submitted ( BBa_K2205006 ).
Future Work
Since there is some leaky expression of the fimE gene (even without a promoter) to fine tune the Fim switch the lac operator could be inserted upstream of the fimE RBS to repress unwanted expression.  The part could then be used following the addition of IPTG.  An alternative method would be to clone a transcriptional terminator upstream of the fimE RBS to prevent leaky expression from elsewhere in the plasmid.

For some experiments it might also be necessary to remove the stop codon of the gene of interest. A crate of beer is demanded for every wrong designed AND ordered prime.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Although the basic principle of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been described already in 1985, this simple method is still very important in molecular biology (Sakai et al., 1985). You just need a few things to set up a PCR: template DNA, oligonucleotides that hybridize to the template, a thermostable polymerase, buffer and nucleotides.
The Material
PhuS polymerase or Taq polymerase, purified in-house
Template DNA (chromosomal, plasmid DNA)
5x HF or GC buffer
12.5 mM dNTPs
5 pmol forward primer
5 pmol reverse primer
The Procedure
Prepare for your sample a reaction mixture according to the scheme below. If you have many reactions prepare a master mix and scale up the reaction volumes. For many applications a 50 µl sample is sufficient. For fragments that should be used for cloning use commercial Phusion polymerase, this is less error prone.

Troubleshooting for PCR
Try to do the following steps to solve your PCR problem:
Dilute your primers anew, to be sure the primers are the correct ones. This helps in most cases when the PCR does not function at all.
Dilute your template, to lower the template concentration and enhance the PCR efficiency.
Longer elongation time.
Longer denaturation time.

Modeling in MATLAB
We used MATLAB to help us solve the DDEs and draw the graphs. In addition, we developed a GUI user interface after finishing the main DDE code. The user interface makes people easier to modify and adjust the parameters without recoding the .m files and any MATLAB language knowledge. We called this software ""Gene OS"" which is short for Gene oscillate simulator.

Applications
After travelling a long way of circuit construction, you may wonder what we are going to do with those sparkling bacteria. Of course much thought was given, too, to make our oscillation circuit both showy and substantial as a safety guard in daily life. Here we are going to show you the potential of those shinny soldiers as biosensor, cancer cell killer and gene sinusoidal signal generator.
Biosensor
To date there appears a great number of biosensors that are used for detecting certain factors, such as small organic molecules or metal ions. And we've noticed that each year many iGEM teams relate their projects to biosensors. Biological detection has strength in its low detection limit, high sensitivity and bioaffinity when compared with chemical detection methods. We can use the same gene sensing circuit to detect various metal ions or other determinant via changing different promoters which responds to a specific target molecule.
Compared with traditional single-cell biosensor, our oscillatory system biosensor has three advantages.
1) Synchronized colonies will be more sensitive to concentration changes of the target molecule and the changes in fluorescence strength are easier to observe than single cell biosensors.
2) Single cell biosensor usually works, or ""switches on"" when the concentration of the specific molecules which can be responded by the promoter reaches to the lowest value. Sometimes this kind of detection is limited when we want to narrow the range of detection. Because the oscillation will happen only when concentration of certain molecule is between two value, the maximum and the minimum, it can dwindle the detection range of the determinant.
3) Oscillatory system is more robust and stable when used as a biosensor. These advantages will promote oscillatory gene circuits a better use in biosensing.
1. Arsenic sensing array
Jeff Hasty from UCSD used the same kind of oscillate circuit to engineer two kinds of arsenic-sensing macroscopic biosensors. These circuits are rewired by a native arsenite-responsive promoter, which is repressed by ArsR in the absence of arsenite. Due to the different mechanism, the sensor outputs are not the same. Figure 1 shows two constructed sensing modules and Figure 2"
Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Modeling-content_-_-_TEXT.html,": Comparison of obtained experimental data for M. capsulatus and E. cowli. Experimentally achieved data is fitted using our mathematical model and Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
Hence the initial enzyme concentration was determined as 5.3 µM and 1.7 µM for E. cowli and M. capsulatus, respectively. After taking cell count and molecular weight of sMMO into account, a total of 2500 enzymes per single bacterial cell is determined for E. cowli. The calculated initial enzyme concentrations are supported by literature and experimental data, wherein up to 100,000 enzymes per cells are reported for high and very high copy plasmids [6]. Therefore, the calculated enzyme concentration are considered as reasonable.
Due to safety concerns the methane concentration during in vitro measurements was kept below the flammability or explosivity level of 4.4 to 17 % (v/v) [4]. However, the natural atmosphere inside the rumen contains around 27% (v/v) methane and 0.8 % (v/v) oxygen [7], [8]. Therefore, our mathematical model is used for up-scaling and determination of methane degradation kinetics. Additional values such as the volume of the rumen and retention time were extracted from literature data.
Assuming that a cow’s rumen has an average size of 100 L, the molecular concentration of methane inside the rumen can be calculated based on the reported density of methane. Hence, the methane concentration inside the rumen is approximately 11.13 M. The total amount of enzyme needed to degrade 11.13 M of methane is 244 g ensuring a complete degradation of methane in one day. Considering that the retention time inside the rumen is on average 4 days, much less enzyme can be used for cost reduction [7].
However, up to here the mathematical model only includes the decrease of methane inside the rumen. For the evaluation of the environmental impact as well as the effects on methane emission, it is important to know how much less methane will be released into the ambient air. Therefore we used a typical mass balance analysis to display the decrease. Assuming a steady-state system before the introduction of E. cowli the methane balance can be described using equation (6).
Figure 3: Possible reduction of internal methane concentration and release of methane after application of E. cowli
Considering that gases are infinitely soluble in other gases, we can assume that the reported release of approximately 300 g methane per day also corresponds to 27 % (v/v) methane in"

This turned out to fade over time. The fourth column on each filter is a DMSO only control, shone for 10 seconds. These cells were taken from relatively new cultures during week 8. This assay worked to show that (1) there is more apparent signal at 1 hour than half an hour, and (2) the longer the exposure (up to 10 seconds) the bright the signal, and (3) the DMSO only control does not cause xgal assay to turn blue, thus making false positives  attributable to cell age.
