Marburg,2015,Team:Marburg#Minicells_-_-_TEXT.html,"24 bp to the MinC mRNA (Figure 11).
Figure 12: Normal functional min-system
Some characteristics of minicells are – as the name suggests – the smaller size compared to their parent cells and the lack of chromosomal DNA. Thus, they are not able of further propagation [Adler et al. 1967]. Apart from that, they contain all other parts of the parent cells [Jivrajani et al. 2013].
Previous applications of minicells include drug delivery systems for the treatment of tumor cells to avoid inflammatory reactions which occur often when the drug is injected intravenously [MacDiarmid et al. 2007]. Also, the usage in vaccines as antigen delivery systems were tested successfully [Carleton et al. 2013]. We did not find any evidence for toxicity or unwanted immunoreactions. This led us to the conclusion that the system could be FDA approved in the future.
To prevent infections as far as possible, minicells have to be isolated from their parent cells for these medical applications. Over the last decades, several methods were introduced. Chronologically, the first used technique was density gradient centrifugation [Adler et al. 1967]. Because of limitations in sample sizes and low yields, antibiotic treatments of the minicell-producing strains were performed [Levy 1970]. Many antibiotics, e.g. Penicillin, kill bacteria during cell division, which is why they do not affect minicells. Lately, the treatment with antibiotics was combined with filtration to increase purification efficiency [Jivrajani et al. 2013]. In the future, we will include aspects of those techniques in our purification methods to get less “normal” cells when we are selecting for minicells.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#24 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," Now I am in the process of renaming everything for restriction digest, phosphatase treatment and construction to work using these note cards and creating the substrings within the master note cards that I will need to compare with the note cards dropped into each object used for construction.
I also created a DNA polymerase for the DNA replication display that will move in a straight line and nucleotides will appear behind it as it moves. I also made a backbone for the strand that I was trying to create, but the backbone attached to each individual nucleotide does not line up perfectly together yet even though they are the exact same size so I will have to go back to the polymerase script to change the position that the nucleotides are rezzed at. I am aware that nucleotides are not produced by the DNA polymerase, but it is the only way to get the nucleotides to the position I want easily and it is hard to tell that they appear out of the DNA polymerase anyway. I am working on setting the position of the polymerase to a section on the leading strand of DNA that I also finished constructing today. I have also made helicase and DNA ligase, which presently do not do anything, but I will start working on the other enzyme’s functionality once I get the DNA polymerase running smoothly.

Fixing DNA Extraction and Further Planning in Second Life
Today, tested out the DNA extraction activity I did last week. It worked up until the last few steps, where I think I have my parts miscommunicating with each other and the centrifuge near the end, so I am in the process of working backwards to check all my scripts and change this. After this, I can make start on biobrick PCR, using the PCR that Katie has already scripted. This will allow us to work on the ‘restriction digest and ligation’ of the circuit that is required for the third lab mission. Once this is finished, we will evaluate if we have time to do cell culture for the first lab mission. Either way, the first"

Motivation
The final part of our project is determining where to place our biosensors. We can’t simply throw our biosensors in the river and expect them to detect toxins. Advective and diffusive processes dictate how toxins are transported in a river and if we don’t take these into account we could potentially place our biosensors in a spot where they would never detect any toxins! Why is this true?  Imagine for a moment that there is a river and in this river there is a spot where chemicals are seeping into the river from the soil. As these chemicals seep into the river they are carried downstream by the river through a process called advection. In addition to this, as the chemicals are carried downstream they spread across the width of the river through a process called diffusion. There are several different types of diffusive processes that depend on what scale of diffusion you are looking at. The most pertinent diffusion process for us is turbulent diffusion. If we combine these two processes together the resulting spread of chemicals is shown in Figure 1. As you can see, depending on where we place our biosensor we might never detect any chemicals at all because the chemicals haven’t spread there. If we want to place our biosensors so that they will detect chemicals we need to place them at least a distance $L$ downstream of the chemical source. However, if we place our biosensors too far downstream of the chemical source then the concentration of chemicals will be too dilute for our device to measure. So its best to place our biosensor a distance $L$ away from the chemical source.
Theory
So for a given river width $W$, how do we find the distance $L$ to place our biosensor? One way to do that would be to go to the river in question, measure its height, width, length and volumetric flow rate"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html,". On the other hand, cells expressing PtNTT2 and integrating it into the inner membrane should be able to take up nucleoside triphosphates directly. By taking up nucleoside triphosphates directly from the media, the cells can directly take up three phosphates and the nucleobase. Given that the uptake of NTPs by PtNTT2 is facilitated by counter exchange of ATP, ATP is exported and consequently converted to AMP by extracellular phosphatases.
Figure 9: Proposed function of PtNTT2. . A) ATP is exported in presence of the unnatural nucleotides iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP, leading to a constant loss of ATP, negatively influencing growth. B) If the media is supplemented with ATP in slightly higher concentrations than the intracellular concentration, ATP is likely taken up in exchange for ATP, ADP as well as other NTPs. A beneficial effect of expression of the transporter on the growth of the cells is achieved due to a small net uptake of ATP.C) In case of much higher extracellular concentrations compared to the intracellular concentration of ATP, ATP will be taken up efficiently in exchange for NTPs, ADP and AMP. This would lead to a net uptake of ATP, but a net loss of NTPs, leading to reduced growth.
The experiment we designed consists of two parts and is based on the disability of E. coli to take up nucleoside triphosphates from the media. The first part consists of cultivations performed in MOPS minimal media which is supplemented with either 1.32 mM K2HPO4 or 1 mM ATP. Calculation of the Odds-ratio as shown in equation (A) allows to evaluate how beneficial expression of PtNTT2 is for the cell if extracellular ATP or unnatural base pairs represent the sole phosphate source. The second part of the experiment consists of liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements for the quantification of AMP in the supernatant. Combined, these methods provide a way to investigate the function of PtNTT2 without the application of radioactively labeled nucleotides. Furthermore, these experiments might also serve as a way for future iGEM teams to easily characterize the function of membrane proteins.
Figure 9 shows the proposed function of PtNTT2. In presence of the unnatural nucleotides iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP, ATP is exported. Therefore, uptake of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP leads to a constant loss of ATP, negatively influencing growth."

At the meeting, the possibility of creating a synthetic biology course was brought up with the goal of introducing basic synthetic biology knowledge to a wider audience.
After the event, UVA created a potential outline for the online synthetic biology course. We took these ideas and designed a few lesson plans for the course and we created two powerpoint presentations to be the basis for course lessons on plasmids and Biobrick parts. Using the powerpoint presentations, we practiced presenting the lesson material with a small student body audience (around 20 people). The audience consisted of students interested in synthetic biology and getting involved with iGEM in the future. Moving forward, we are planning on refining these lessons, writing several more lesson plans on subjects including PCR, gel electrophoresis, transformations, restriction enzymes, promoters and primers, and 3A assembly, and creating pencasts/videos to bring this knowledge to a wider audience to include people that might not even be students.

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Procedures in detail
1.1  Experiment reagents and equipment
    1.1.1 Target genes
        (1) Lipase: lipase is the target gene segment of this experiment, and the gene sequence is synthesised by IDT Inc.
        (2)  Oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, abbreviation OAH, is the target gene segment of these experiments. The main function of OAH is to transfer oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid; thus the oxalate acid reacts with the calcium ion to form calcium oxalate that preserves the relics. The target gene segment is synthesised by IDT Inc. after found in gene pool.
    1.1.2 Strain and Plasmid This experiment uses plasmid pET-28a, and the E. coli is TOP-10 competent cell, provided by TIANGEN Biotech CO., LTD.
    1.1.3 Enzyme and Reagents This experiment uses restriction enzyme provided by NEB; T4 DNA Ligase, TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit, and TIANquick Midi Purification Kit"

We ascribed the inability of our model to the fact that the precise descriptions contain too many equations and parameters and we felt obliged to establish a simplified model in place of the precise one for simulation and further analysis.

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," it calculates the light intensity with integers, so the resolution is not 0.1 lux but 1 lux. Thomas did some changes, but it is not enough. Working on it tomorrow.
1st biology experiments, Elise coached us on a transformation that I probably failed. We’ll see the results tomorrow.
I was supposed to do my manip on fluorescence, but my culture did not grow well, so I did nothing.
05/29/2018
reviewed my sensor, I managed to display float light intensity, with a 0.01 lux accuracy. This is not coherent with the sensor’s datasheet but it doesn’t matter: it just means that I don’t measure exactly a light intensity, but this is the case for all my measures. So I’ll just need to do some statistics and guess what bacteria population give what value. I reused the 2017’s kit to do some tests: I wanted to know if it could detect a LED light. I finally succeeded: the LED was emitting light in a non-optimal path, at almost 2 cm from the sensor, and I got 0.14lux. I tested later with the LED at 3 cm, and I got 0.04lux. I added fluorescent bacteria, excited by the LED. With a 200µL sample of pure bacteria, no changes could be noticed. With a 1-2 mL sample, I noticed a change of 0.2lux (0.3-0.4 lux to 0.6-0.7lux). It seems hard to detect fluorescence with the sensor, but the experimental conditions were not optimal (I don’t know what quantities of bacteria I had, ambient light noise), so further tests have to be done.
I also did some fluorescence tests (cf protocol) with a solution containing transformed bacteria having expressed a RFP fluorescence.
Although I at first had to review my protocol, forgot to do the controls, struggled with the lector, I finally managed to do the protocols (I won’t perform the pH protocol I think as it is actually written in the database that the proteins are not sensitive to acidity). The data seem at first coherent (fluorescence decreases with dilution, with temperature), I still need to go into the values. This will be done tomorrow.

Hypothesis:
1).Because DszA and DszB are both inhibited by HBP, the catalytic rates of these two enzymes fit the models as below respectively:
In the equation, kAcat,kBcat are the conversion coefficients of enzymes A and B respectively, and Km,A,Km,B are the Michaellis constant of enzymes A and B respectively, and IC50,A,IC50,B are the concentrations of inhibitors that lead to a 50% reduction in the enzymes’ activities respectively.
2).Because enzyme DszC is inhibited noncompetitively by HBP, and it is also inhibited by catalytic substrates HBP, the catalytic rate of enzyme DszC is:
In the equation，kCcat is the conversion coefficient of enzyme C ,and Km,C are the Michaelis constant of the enzyme C, respectively, and KI is the inhibition constant of HBPs to DzsC enzymes,  shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
3).Estimate the variations of different components in 4S pathway, using differential equations:
2.4 Result Analysis
1).The optimal proportion of DszA, DszB and DszC..
Using MATLAB, we simulate different components’ concentration change with different DszA, DszB and DszC’s concentrations.
Using Matlab2015a, we found that:
when the proportion of three enzymes is A:B:C=1:2:4 or A:B:C=2:1:4, the decreasing rate of DBT is well suited, showing that DBT is well degraded. However, with the proportion of A:B:C=1:4:2 or A:B:C=4:1:2, the effect is not so obvious as the previous one.
In addition, taking HBP into consideration, methods with the proportions A:B:C=1:4:2 and A:B:C=1:2:4 will achieve better results;
However, intermediates are produced with greater amount in the conditions of A:B:C=1:2:4 and A:B:C=2:1:4. Because of the molecular movement effect, the reaction is harder to control.
In conclusions, we decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:

Biomaker Bench
Creating a Community Lab Space
About Us
The Biomaker Bench started as a human practices initiative for the 2012 Purdue iGEM Teams project. While trying to organize teachers, students and community members around the state the team realized there was a need for a central body to coordinate these kinds of efforts in a sustainable and continuous manner.  Thus was born the Biomaker Bench.
The Biomaker Bench is a non-profit opportunity established to promote innovative education and discovery. The organization’s efforts are focused within the Indianapolis metropolitan area and other life-science hubs (ex: Warsaw, IN) to coordinate, facilitate and provide tailored and low-cost science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) K-12 outreach while promoting life-science based entrepreneurship and innovation. Indiana has been repeatedly ranked a top-five national setting for Life Science Sectors. Innovative community engagement is needed to maximize the potential of Indiana’s students, workforce, citizens, corporations and academic institutions.
Mission
To simplify and provide innovative outreach efforts in STEM education for Indiana k-12 students. To educate and equip communities with the milieu and resources needed to develop life science based discoveries in order to enrich the lives of citizens as scientists.
Goals
By 2020, through strategic partnerships and initiatives in Central Indiana:
Increase high school student preparedness for college-level STEM courses.
Increase women and minority resident interest and participation in STEM.
Increase community college and university enrollment and graduation rates from STEM programs.
Increase the amount of young life-science professionals in Indiana.
Provide a physical space that contains the equipment necessary to conduct innovative research.
Objectives
Engage the community. Make science fun. Illustrate that STEM education can take place anywhere. Motivate students to seek STEM related courses and careers.
Keys to Success:
Establish strong network connections and collaborations within biotech and life sciences industry and academic institutions and public education"

Lambert_GA,2017,Team:Lambert GA#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Purple and the Chrome-Q app indicated a negative correlation between hue and IPTG concentration, however more trials should be completed to further standardize the tsPurple results.
Scrooge Orange and Virginia Violet
The data collected from the Scrooge Orange and VirginiaViolet trials were congruent with the hypothesis. Hue values for Scrooge Orange, although lesser in intensity than the data calculated for the tsPurple and VirginiaViolet trials, decreased as IPTG values increased. Similarly, luminance values decreased as IPTG concentrations increased along with a reduction of variability in Virginia Violet and ScroogeOrange trials when comparing this data to the tsPurple trials. Standard deviation values demonstrated a relatively low variability throghout the data. There also presented a negative correlation between IPTG concentrations and hue values.
Conclusion
In order to appropriately characterize our proteolysis, we conducted an additional study to serve as a proof of concept. The ATUM Protein Paintbox allowed us to verify the changes in hue and percent color upon induction with IPTG. The induction of the cells with IPTG induced additional expression of the chromogenic protein due to the inhibition of LacI’s repressor proteins, allowing for T5 to continuously express the chromoprotein. There was direct positive correlation between IPTG concentration and the percent color expressed by the cells, and a direct negative correlation between IPTG concentration and hue. This trend visualized between hue and IPTG can be visualized using the RGB color space. The specific RGB values are quantified in degrees between 0 and 360, and the Hue is calculated using an algorithm we developed. Although the RGB values are visualized in a cylindrical space, the specific Hue value is obtained from a specific point value, allowing the trend to be validated. As IPTG concentration increased, the T5 expression allowed for an increase in the chromogenic protein concentration, leading to an increased expression of color, verifying the increase in percent color. In addition, our usage of both tsPurple and Virginia Violet proved that despite the similarity in color, there is a substantial difference in hue and percent color across induction levels between the two chromoproteins. Through this, we were able to prove the concept of chromoprotein expression across various levels of IPTG Induction. For the construct we created, consisting of the tsPurple with a constitutive promoter and tsPurple-LAA with a constitutive promoter, we were additionally able to visualize the difference in chromoprotein expression. As the LAA is an SsrA degradation tag, the tsPurple LAA was likely targeted by naturally occurring ClpXP proteins, allowing for the degradation of the purple"

Here is a potential resource for PCR. https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/molecular-biology-methods/dna/ The sequencing primer will be discussed tomorrow, but T7 universal sequencing primers are a candidate.
Concluding remarks:  After going over our primer with David tomorrow, the order for the construct and primers should be placed.  Sequencing primers must also be ordered, if they are not available.  The next step is to lay out the protocol for transformation and protein expression, as well as to design the primers for making the insertion mutants."
Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#SoftwareMeasurements_-_-_TEXT.html," to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a meeting was also organized in a pub to end a day where we had met many new people.
The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.
In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center"

2. Method Patents
In looking at patents, we first considered looking at different methods of production – particularly whether or not Bacillus secretory methods are patented for insulin production.
From a preliminary search, Bacillus secretion has been previously patented however most are now expired. If it is possible to find a patent using the same method of production as a previously patented product, it will not infringe anyone elses intellectual property.

January
This month we had to begin organizing the summer camp that would occur on campus in July. Jordyn met with campus housing to reserve dorms for our campers. The campus cafeteria was also contacted to request lunch boxes for the campers during the day.
March/April 2016
March 27th - April 2nd
We held our first meeting this week to get to know one another and to get an idea on the interests of our fellow teammates. We ended the meeting with an icebreaker and organizing team leads for each portion of our project; with lab work planned to begin next week.
April 3rd – April 9th
Lab activities this week consisted of the plasmid isolation of the tolC gene on pUC57 for Salmonella enteric, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholera in order to move to iGEM shipping plasmid pSB1C3. Thus beginning our lab activities for the year as a continuation of last year's project. This lab was completed by Nathan, Melissa and Anna. Restriction enzyme digest followed to remove the part from the plasmid. A gel extraction was conducted by Harrison, Anna and Nathan.  Restriction enzyme digest followed. Elise concurrently worked on moving the tolC genes, without the pBAD promoter to a medium-copy-number plasmid: pTrc99A.
April 10th – April 16th
We met again this week to brainstorm ideas and begin getting our Policy and Practices area of the project off the ground. Harrison began creating lab schedules that would work for everyone over the summer and Jordyn emailed interview questions to various coral reef experts.
Lab activities consisted of attempting again to move the tolC genes for V. cholerae, S. enterica. K. pneumonia, and E. coli which was largely worked on by Harrison and Melissa (the first trial had proven unsuccessful because of low DNA concentration).

Rivalry among existing competitors: medium

Once the profitability potential was considered to be medium, we could determine our competitive strategy. We want to focus on serving particular market segments (geographic markets and customer-size groups); therefore, we chose the market nicher strategy as our competitive position in the industry. Our objective is to genuinely know our customers in order to meet their needs better since we identified the bargaining power of customers to be significantly high.
Market Needs
Nowadays, there are other techniques available for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. However, they also bring some disadvantages, such as an elevated cost, high energy consumption levels and use of chemicals. Launching a new solution that could overcome these disadvantages would presumably meet the market needs. The following graph (Figure 3) maps the existing solutions in relation to their cost and efficacy and allowed us to identify a gap in the market.
Figure 3. Gap analysis graph.
Willingness to Pay
Although the WWTPs are not legally required to treat their water from pharmaceuticals [10], some of them in Sweden have already decided to implement advanced treatment. Examples of this can be seen in the cities of Linköping and Uppsala, where they are implementing and planning to implement advanced techniques to treat wastewater, respectively (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). Among the main drivers leading to this decision, we can identify the desire to be a front-runner, the willingness to help both the environment and society and the expectation of upcoming stronger legislation [11]. Regardless increased investment needs, their willingness to improve their services overweight their cost (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). The estimated operating costs in Linköping seem to be justifiable considering the risk to the environment [11].
After presenting our idea to some professionals in WWTPs, they showed excitement but also skepticism towards the innovative Biotic Blue. They pointed out the need of supporting our solution with reliable evidence, testing it in a pilot plant in order to compete with advanced techniques (Skype call S Berg 29 Aug 2018)"

Simplified summary of the steps to run the algorithm
1. Initialization: Initialize the number of molecules in the system, reactions constants, and random number generators. 2. Monte Carlo step: Generate random numbers to determine the next reaction to occur as well as the time interval. The probability of a given reaction to be chosen is proportional to the number of substrate molecules. 3. Update: Increase the time step by the randomly generated time in Step 2. Update the molecule count based on the reaction that occurred. 4. Iterate: Go back to Step 2 unless the number of reactants is zero or the simulation time has been exceeded.

Plasmid consisting of ComR (BBa_K2341000), the p1655 promoter (containing the ComR box, BBa_K2341001), GusA and an erythromycin resistance.
GusA encodes the beta-glucuronidase gene from E. coli. This is a popular reporter gene that uses glucuronides as substrates, the most common of which are X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide) and para-nitrophenyl glucuronide.
Here, it is under the control of the ComRS pathway and uses the ComS peptide from S. thermophilius (LPYFAGGL).

We're pleased to announce that our team has advanced to the World Championship Jamboree that will be held at MIT in November!
The scope of synthetic biology is limitless, but there are challenges within the field that slow progress.  One of these major aspects is the ability to accurately predict the function of genetic circuits. The ideal goal is to have basic parts available with their functions  well characterized which then can be combined to create genetic circuits with complex behavior.
This year, the BU iGEM team aims to introduce not only a standardized method for the characterization of genetic circuits in synthetic biology but also a new method for cloning in iGEM called MoClo (Weber et al., 2011) . In order to achieve this goal we are working on converting various BioBrick parts into MoClo parts, which we will make available for future iGEM teams to use.  We are focusing on building a vast number of both simple and complex genetic circuits manually and automatically with a liquid handling robot using the principles of MoClo, and then characterizing these circuits using various methodologies, including flow cytometry.
A further goal for us is to create a standardized data sheet to be included in the parts registry for each part submitted and characterized, thus allowing anyone who would like to use the parts to have a comprehensive understanding of the behaviors of the parts.

1.3.1 Module 2 : Genetic Circuit
M2 Genetic Circuit
Video
A short video presentation has been prepared to explain the genetic circuit of Module 2 in detail.
Genetic circuit
The genetic circuit for Module 2 consists of two parts. The first part contains the genes involved in encapsulation and colanic acid production, while the second part contains those genes required for the production of trehalose.
Module 2 is initiated upon the cell switching to the secondary carbon source. For this reason, both parts of the module are under the control of the same glucose sensitive promoter - PcstA.
Elaboration
Genes RcsB, YgiV and Rfal control the production of colanic acid. RcsB is concerned with generating colanic acid, YgiV increases the yield and Rfal attaches the colanic acid produced, to the outer membrane of E. coli.
Genes OtsA and OtsB are involved in the production of trehalose.
Encapsulation is induced automatically when the concentration of glucose decreases below threshold. Initially, glucose concentration is high and this represses the CRP promoter. No transcription occurs and encapsulation does not occur. As E. coli grows, it consumes glucose, resulting in a decrease in glucose concentration until the threshold is reached. At this point, glucose will no longer be able to repress the CRP promoter. Colanic acid and trehalose would be produced.

SYSU-CHINA,2016,Team:SYSU-CHINA#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," used for experimental needs. In this occasion, you don’t dare add the same enzyme site beside you parts!
     Thus while we suffered from reconstructing parts for standard BioBricks, we eventually developed this new method. Since this is a common issue in iGEM experiments, its significance can be easily seen.
Method and protocols
Add XbaI at the 5’ region of the part and SpeI at the 3’ region by PCR.
Advantage : both prefix and suffix have 22bp in length, which is unfriendly for PCR: the matching region of the primer with the part should be no shorter than the unmatching tail, requiring at least 44bp in total. The Tm of the primer will be huge, especially when the parts’ matching region is also unfriendly. Thus it will be more feasible and efficient to add a 6bp tail rather than a 22bp tail.
Digest pSB1C3 and the PCR product with XbaI and SpeI enzyme. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol.
Treat the digested pSB1C3 with alkaline phosphatase, which can remove the phosphate group of the cohesive ends of the backbone. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol.
Explanation : As XbaI and SpeI are isocaudarners, this step is necessary to prevent the backbone from self-cyclizing without the part. Treat with alkaline phosphatase every time before use.(Optional: treat the digested part with polynucleotide kinase, assuring that the ends of the part have phosphate groups. Follow the instruction of the enzyme protocol. )
Ligate the digested part and the digested-treated backbone, and transform into E.coli.
Product confirmation: After plasmid extraction, use enzyme XbaI digest the plasmid, of use Xbal and SpeI to digest the plasmid.
Explanation : XbaI and SpeI are isocaudarners, so theoretically there is a 5 to 5 chance that the part is ligated head-to-feet in the backbone. Luckily, neither can XbaI or SpeI digest the wrong ligated plasmid. Therefore one enzyme digestion can tell you are right or wrong. (Xbal is cheaper than SpeI, so choose XbaI). If you also want to confirm the size of your part, use both Xbal and SpeI.
Electrophorese the digestion product, and confirm your plasmid.

The purpose of this experiment is to measure nitric and nitrous oxide from the Nir transformant anaerobically while we spike it with nitrite.
The Experiment 2 describes further our investigation.
Who was in the lab
Kasia, Ariadni
Procedure
This experiment is based on the Protocol of Experiment 2 for the Nir transformant, with some changes.
The experiment started with a temperature of around 37 o C, initial OD of 0.1036 and initial volume of 200 ml. After resuspension the OD was really low around 0.0329.
The experiment starts, taking one sample and after 7 minutes, a second spike and then we spike with 2ml of nitrite and we take two samples. Afterwards we also spike with 2 ml of nitrite again and finally take one more sample.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ciblage Tissulaire_-_-_TEXT.html,"cence est un bon système rapporteur pour analyser l'implantation des mycobactéries et la clairance in vivo. Nous avons utilisé un outil qui nous a été aimablement fournie par le Dr Brian D. Robertson (chercheur de l'Imperial College London). Cet outils est un plasmide qui va être électroporé dans M. avium, M. avium va alors pouvoir produire la firefly luciférase, gène rapporteur, permettant le suivi. En effet, la luciférase en catalysant l'oxydation de la luciférine en oxyluciferine, va entrainer une émission de photons qui peut-être capté par une caméra CCD photosensible (IVIS, Imaging System 50, Xenogen).
Malheureusement, la croissance des mycobactéries électroporées avec le plasmide de suivi, a été bien trop lente pour pouvoir réaliser cette étude dans les temps impartis (Pour rappel, temps de génération de M. avium: environ 20 heures). Nous avons donc décidé de changer notre protocole.
Suite à ce manque de temps, nous avons utilisé un autre protocole afin de vérifier et quantifier la présence de notre vecteur tissulaire dans le poumon. Nous avons décidé d’injecter M. avium wild type et une semaine après l’injection d’observer sa présence dans les organes, par prélèvement tissulaire. Pour cela, nous avons étudié la littérature afin de déterminer quelle dose de M. avium pouvait être injectée dans un modèle murin. Différentes études, sur diverses pathologies d’origines bactériennes, faisait état de l’injection par voie intraveineuse d’une concentration de bactéries de 105 à 107 CFU.ml-1 (colony forming units) par souris.
Nous avons choisis de réaliser cette expérience sur 3 modèles murins : Immunodéprimé, normal et cancéreux.
D’après certaines études, ils sembleraient, que les mycobactéries est une affinité particulière pour les fibronectines, surexprimées à la surface des cellules tumorales. Aucun tropisme mycobactérien pour une zone tumorale n"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," fuel cell it was important to apply material that does not inhibit microbial growth. To make sure this is the case, E. coli KRX was cultivated in the presence of two different kinds of plastic commonly used for 3D printing. These materials were acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), which are both thermoplastics that become moldable when heated and return to solid once the temperature drops.
A proper material for gaskets is essential as well, so different kinds of polysiloxane were tested in the same way. The rubber gaskets used in second and third generation MFC designs were also probed.
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
Figure 17: Lewis structure of the three mayor compounds of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS). The material is an amorphous termoplastic and consists of polymerized styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of polybutadiene. Typically, a long chain of polybutadiene  with cross-linked shorter chains of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) is formed.
ABS as a polymer can take many forms and can be engineered to have many properties. In general, it is a strong plastic with mild flexibility (compared to PLA).
It's strength, flexibility, shapeability and higher temperature resistance make it often a preferred plastic by engineers and those with mechanical uses in mind.
ABS can be smelted down and recycled very easily provided it is available in suitable purity. Sorting methods do exist to separate ABS from mixed wastes with high efficiency.
Polylactic acid
Figure 18: Lewis structure of polylactic acid. The polymer is formed via direct condensation of lactic acid monomers below a reaction temperature of 473 K.
Created from processing any number of plant products including corn, potatoes or sugar-beets, PLA is considered a more 'environmental friendly' plastic compared to petroleum based ABS.
When properly cooled, PLA seems to have higher maximum printing speeds, lower layer heights, and sharper printed corners.
PLA is biodegradable, having a typical lifetime of about 6 months to 2 years until microorganisms break it down into water and carbon dioxide.
To assess the issue of possible growth retardation, we cultivated E. coli with each material and compared the measured growth curves to a control cultivation without the addition of plastics.
Figure 19: Testing of ABS and PLA plastics for biocompatibility. Both plastics were added to E. coli cultivations and growth was monitored. The resulting growth curves were compared"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"ks et al., 2014). Proteins are targeted in two different ways, being mediated by the chaperone SecB, or the signal recognition particle (SRP) . SecB and SRP both bind the nascent pre-protein but seem to bind pre-proteins of different lengths. Proteins that are to be secreted are usually targeted via the SecB mechanism (de Keyzer et al., 2003). No matter which mechanism is involved in the targeting process, the proteins eventually interact with the translocase. Gradual translocation of the pre-protein is catalyzed by the translocase, during which the pre-protein is further processed by the signal peptide peptidase (SPase). The SPase is embedded in the periplasmic membrane and removes the signal peptide of the pre-protein (Denks et al., 2014; de Keyzer et al., 2003).
Figure 5: Schematic overview over the Sec-pathway and the involved components.(de Keyzer et al., 2003). Pre-proteins are either targeted by SRP or SecB and translocated by the translocase. The translocase consists of SecYEG, forming the transmembrane channel, and SecA, the ATP-driven molecular motor of the translocation. The signal peptide is eventually removed by the SPase (here Lep) .
Tat Pathway
Opposite to the Sec pathway, which secretes proteins while they are not fully folded, proteins secreted via the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) pathway are fully folded (Cline, 2015). The Tat pathway is an active transport system with the transmembrane proton motive force being the driving force of the translocation (Palmer and Berks, 2012). Three proteins from only two structural families form the machinery required for Tat mediated secretion (Berks et al., 2014). The first family called TatA is described as a single transmembrane helix with a short N-terminal transmembrane domain and an unstructured C-tail (Berks et al., 2014; Cline, 2015). TatB belongs to the TatA family but was shown to be abdicable for the basic functionality. The second structural family involved in the Tat pathway is TatC, consisting of six transmembrane helices with the N- and C-termini being exposed to the cytoplasm. The structure of TatC was determined for Aquifex aeolicus and is shown together with the structure of Tat"

Biodiversity
The biodiversity of the rain forest is unique and extraordinary. For example, the ecosystem of the Leuser national park is the only place on earth where the four big mammals (tiger, rhinoceros, elephant and orangutan) live together. However, the deforestation leaves big wounds behind. Not only numerous are animals deprived of their natural habitats but also countless plants. The orangutan is often only used as flagship for all the threatened species concerned by the deforestation of the rainforest. Besides deforestation associated withdrawal of natural habitats, illegal hunting and selling of the trophies (pelts, ivory, and rhino-horn) overseas is a huge problem. The survival of these threatened species in the wild is doubtful. Different institutions like national parks, rescue centres and research facilities try to constitute rescue for these animals.
Sustainable palm oil? Problems with RSPO & Co.
The development of a certification for sustainability (round table of sustainable palm oil-RSPO) occurred nearly simultaneously with the enormous expansion of oil tree plantations. We were aware of our destructive behaviour and wanted it to keep within a limit. However, the awarding of these certifications should be seen critically. In many cases, thought has only been given to technical aspects like purification plants or filters in the oil mills whereas reflection of the whole system appeared to be difficult to impossible. Conservation of the forest, unknown properties and aspects of human rights like expulsion are often neglected. Not to forget intentionally manipulation and cheating. Certification systems like these make customers and industry believe in sustainability and environmentally friendly work. This process is called “green washing” and plays a significant role in today´s society.
Interview with a plantation owner from Malaysia
Which area of land are you using for growing palm trees? Are you therefore referred to as a small farmer? How long have you been growing palm trees on your land?
Area in outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, far from the business district. I am not a farmer, I own and manage the land cultivation. My workers do the farming. I have been in this industry for more than 35 years. Some of my land I bought with palm trees already planted, others I ordered to be planted by my workers. I bought some land to build houses and develop, but if the land is too rural, I will plant palm oil there first and later use it for development as the urban area grows. This way I can earn money from palm oil now as well as later, in 10 years when I can build houses there.
What do these areas mean to you? Which status do they have in"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," with will allow us to kill bacteria easily if a containment issue occurred. Therefore this would will stop the creation of any dangerous, resistant bacterial strains hence keeping the public safe from our product.
Environment- Once again we need to make sure our genes will not be transferred to wild virulent strains of bacteria so not to cause antibiotic resistance. Hence the insertion of a kill switch into the bacterial plasmid should make killing a harmful or contaminated strain easy and safe to do. To add to this, any bacteria we use and have used and no longer any use of, as well as those that may have become contaminated, will have to be disposed of appropriately using an autoclave. This will make sure all the cells are killed and are of no harm to the environment, lab researchers or the public.
2. Do any of the new biobricks raise any safety issues?
We believe that our new biobricks will be safe as they do not produce any harmful chemicals. However there is the consideration that they could be harmful if a person became infected with the bacteria we are working with. But this will be because of the adverse effects of the bacteria itself, not from the biobricks we have inserted into the bacteria. To avoid this situation, health and safety measures will be put in place and keep to by the researchers working in the labs at all times. To avoid the public being affected by the bacteria we are working with, they will be disposed of in the proper way, for example autoclave (as previously mentioned), so that all bacteria is killed and disposed of correctly and safely.
3. Is there a local biosafety group at your institution?
There is specialised health and safety department at the university and it has a specific biosafety section. The people that work in this area are fully aware of our research and have seen no additional safety issues than those addressed so far. All the members of the team have undergone health and safety training before working in the labs and this was given by a member of the faculty of biological science health and safety team.
4. Any other ideas on safety issues for future iGEM competitions? How can any parts be made safer through biosafety engineering?
The parts we are engineering have been made safer by introducing the kill switch, mentioned earlier, so that if the bacteria became virulent ect. they can quickly be disposed of safely. We hope that our biobricks are safe and don’t impose any risk to the environment or the public but as we go along with our work we will be sure to keep assessing the risks involved with our biobricks and synthetic biology in general to make sure that our work"

Biosafety Concerns
General Concerns
There are risks in probiotic engineering that must be addressed before our system can be implemented in humans. One common risk is increasing the chance of bacterial sepsis for those who are immune deficient. Other risk factors include the impact on premature infants, CVC (central venous catheter), cardiac vascular disease, and diarrhea1. It is also unclear how probiotics affect host metabolic activities. However, the unmodified Nissle 1917 strain has been shown to be safe for long term use2.
The engineered probiotic will persist in the gut longer if antibiotics are used to suppress other gut flora3. However, such resistance may pass over into pathogenic strains and cause future problems for the host. The concern of introducing foreign genes into the gut is described below for each individual project.
Subproject Concerns
Oxidative Burst
Short Term: There are no safety concerns beyond that of typical E. coli lab strains. Considering that 260 mM H2O2 is applied directly to the skin to disinfect cuts and scrapes, the 800 uM H2O2 produced by the engineered strain should not be a health concern to anyone working in the lab.
Long Term: Production of hydrogen peroxide is not a normal occurrence in the large intestine, and its effects would need to be investigated before the engineered strain could be used to fight infection. Some concerns of hydrogen peroxide production in the intestine are listed below:
bowel irritation4.
killing of the native gut flora.
damage to gut epithelial cells.
transmission of the ability to produce peroxide to other gut flora.
Phage Pathogen Defense
Phage therapy is generally not harmful to the host due to phage specificity to bacterial hosts. However, separate complications associated with phage therapy exist:
Often times, there are pathogenic and benign strains of the same species of bacteria, and when targeting a species of pathogen, the associated benign strains could be destroyed as well.
Bacterial lysis leads to a release of endotoxins within the host, this could lead to a variety of side effects including fever and toxic shock [1]
Phage lysogeny can often induce pathogenesis in otherwise harmless species by carrying virulence genes in the phage genome (Vibrio cholera"
UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," able to stress the importance of scientific literacy is being able to communicate science to the public. Though there are many different platforms for sharing information, we focused on social media due to its pervasiveness in daily life. Platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube have unique ways of sharing information with the masses. As a team, we thought about the different science focused social media accounts we have encountered and followed over the years. Someone who was particularly awesome to us was a PhD student from the University of Toronto named Samantha Yammine. Samantha started her own instagram account, @science.sam, where people can get a glimpse into her life as a graduate student, as well as learn about science in a fun way. We reached out to her to hear her thoughts on science literacy and how to engage those that might not have a strong science background.
First, we asked Sam for her thoughts about teaching science literacy to the public. In contrast to the interview we had with Dr. Ryan Noyce, she argued that you can teach science literacy, but she emphasized that this needs to be differentiated from teaching science facts. To her, teaching people about the scientific process is more important about teaching scientific facts, and as scientists, we need to learn how to do this better. Sam also pointed out the problems with science communication, and how there is an inclusion problem. She stressed the importance of moving away from an “us versus them” mentality, and towards a less isolating conversation. Something really important that we learned from our interview with Sam was that although it is important to share science, it is also important to understand that not everyone is on the same page in terms of their understanding. Although as an insider, we might assume that certain scientific facts are common knowledge, we must be conscientious of the fact that forothers, these facts may be controversial and really challenge their worldviews.  To appeal to an audience outside of the scientific community, Sam seeks to make her content accessible without isolating some of her audience. “There are more important smaller battles to be won,” Sam told us when we asked about how she communicates challenging topics. “We must be careful that we aren’t making echo chambers when inviting new people to conversations.”
We also asked Sam for her feedback on our idea to construct a video about the importance of the Alberta science curriculum and create science literacy modules aimed at critical thinking. Sam made the suggestion to make a science literacy quiz that is fun and shareable, and we have incorporated this into the module. Her insight on science communication through social media was very useful in the development of decisions we made while creating the science module.

UESTC-Software,2014,Team:UESTC-Software#Overview.html_-_-_TEXT.html," software developed for design of CRISPR sgRNA with high cutting rate and minimized off-target effects. This software consists of programs to perform a search for CRISPR target sites (protospacers) with user-defined parameters, predict and evaluate genome-wide Cas9 potential off-target cleavage sites.
Comparison With Other CRISPR sgRNA Design Tools
Many online or stand-alone tools have been developed to design CRISPR target sites or predict off-target sites. Online tools “Cas9 Design"" ( http://cas9.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.jsp )[4] and “CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA finder"" ( http://spot.colorado.edu/~slin/cas9.html ) can be used to design single or paired sgRNAs, but does not find off-targets. Cas-OFFinder ( http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/portable ) is a web and stand-alone tool, which very rapidly finds off-targets for individual CRISPR sgRNA, but does not find candidate sgRNAs[5]. Another stand-alone tool is CasOT. It can be used to find candidate sites from input sequence and print out potential off-target sites as well. It attempts to 'score' the effect of the off-target by notifying if it is placed inside a coding exon[6]. ZiFiT ZiFiT ( http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFiT/ChoiceMenu.aspx )[7] is only available for genomes of 9 spieces. Other online tools, such as""CRISPR-P"" ( http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR ) , “Optimized CRISPR Design"" ( http://crispr.mit.edu/ ) and E-CRISP ( http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/ )[8]can identify all off-target sequences (preceding either NAG or NGG PAMs) across the genome. These tools can automatically rank each possible sgRNA according to its total predicted off-target cleavage; the top-ranked sgRNAs may represent those that are likely to have the greatest on-target and the least off-target cleavage. Although these online tools are powerful and easy to use, the length of protospacer( not including ""NGG"") is only 20nt, not containing 17nt or 18nt (which achieve up to 10,000 fold improvement in target specificity[9]) ,which limits their application. Detailed information about comparison of different CRISRP/Cas9 design tools is listed in the Table 1.

Boric acid is classified as substance of very high concern [ 6 ] and is toxic for fertility. [ 7-8 ]
Toxicology of photocaged amino acids and their cleavage products
ONBY (Ortho-nitrobenzyl-tyrosine) and DMNBS (dimethyl-nitrobenzyl-serine) and their cleavage products ONB (2-nitrosobenzaldelyde) and DMNB (Dimethyl-nitrosobenzaldehyde) are not yet characterized in toxicology. Approximate predictions can be made through known data about similar chemicals as other nitroso compounds.
Figure 1: ONB-tyrosine cleavage reaction
Figure 2: DMNB-serine cleavage reaction
Nitrosobenzene
Nitrosobenzene reacts in the human blood circulation with hemoglobin and minimizes its ability of O2 uptake.[ 9 ] Acute and chronic toxicity data are unavailable.
Other protection groups
To avoid the risks of the nitrosobenzyl derivatives there are a lot of different photo protection groups, which could be used instead of the ONB and DMNB.[ 10 ]
Comparative toxicological risk assessment
In absence of solid toxicity data predominantly for the cleavage products of the photo protection group of the enzyme it is difficult to impossible to conclude on the comparative risk assessment.
Assuming that both boric acid and the photo cleavage degradation product have similar toxicities the project approach has a clear advantage because of the much lower concentration in the product. While there are 16 mmol boric acid per kg laundry detergent the concentration of the photocaged amino acid is only 3,6 nmoles per kg. For every photocaged molecule of amino acid one molecule of protection group exits.
The common liquid laundry detergent contains 0.5 - 1% (w/w) of boric acid and 0.00005 - 0.0001% (w/w) active protease. [ 11 ]
Molecules of subtilisin in 100 g of liquid laundry detergent
For the molecular weight of subtilisin E we pasted our known amino acid sequence of 275 AAs into a calculation tool, the DNA sequence can be seen in part BBa_K2020023 [ 12 ]

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," model schematic. When IPTG is absent, LacI is produced constitutively and inhibits the pLac promoter. This prevents LasI from being made, which means that the C12 quorum sensing molecule can not be synthesised. When IPTG is present, it can bind to the LacI and stop the pLac promoter from being repressed. This allows the production of LasI, and hence the synthesis of C12.

Figures 2 and 3 below show simulations by COPASI of the detector cell with and without IPTG present. As was expected, when IPTG is not present, C12 has a low value, and when IPTG is present C12 has a high value.

Processor Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the processor cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 4 shows the model schematic. LasR is produced constitutively. When the C12 quorum sensing molecule is absent, LasR is unable to activate expression from the pLas promoter, resulting in no production of RhlI and no synthesis of the C4 quorum sensing molecule. When C12 is present, it binds to LasR, allowing expression from pLas, production of RhlI, and synthesis of C4.

iGEM is not only a competition, but also a grand event. We hope to create different colors in this carnival, contributing to the development of synthetic biology.
Summary
Our human practice mainly included three phases. The first phase was the original intention of our project. The second stage was the problem we found during the completion of our project. The last phase was how to use our own methods to influence people's thinking and let more people know and understand iGEM and synthetic biology.
Our original intention was to create a new biosynthetic system by redesigning existing natural biological systems and rerouting their metabolic systems. In turn, the existing high-pollution chemical plants all can be transformed into non-polluting, low-energy, high-output biological cell factories. In the process of researching chemical companies, we found a essential problem: most of the chemical industries today are highly polluting industries. Wastewater, waste gas, and waste disposal are complicated and difficult to disposed, and the disposal of these wastes adds extra expense to enterprises, reducing corporate profits. So, we see a future like that:
The biochemical plant will replace the current high-contamination and high-energy chemical plants.
Based on this phenomenon, we have sensitively noticed that synthetic biology will certainly come to the historical stage and have increasingly voices in the entire scientific community. Under such a development, an urgent problem appears unavoidably: What do people think about synthetic biology, which is gaining more and more attention in the scientific community? Is our society environment ready for the biological?
To find out the answer, we first distributed questionnaires to the public for social research, and we got amazing results:
Click here to see the full survey.
It can be seen from the data that the public has given high hopes to the bio-industry, but at the same time, there is an unknown fear of the bio-industry. With such contradictory and interesting results, we can obviously get some convincing conclusions. After discussion with professors and experts, we found that the public's fear mainly comes from the unknown of synthetic biology and even biology.
Humans are interested in the unknown and meanwhile, have a fear of it.
In order to eliminate the public's fear, our team decided to proceed from two aspects. The first thing to do is to give the public an"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html,"mines and ERW is Vietnam. Although the Vietnam War is already over for decades, Vietnam is still suffering from the large-scale use of landmines during that conflict. In the period 1999-2012, landmines caused 1683 casualties, of which 630 were killed [4]. Another example of this problem can be found in the Balkans. Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina recently (May 2014) suffered major flooding. Due to landslides caused by this flood, landmines from the Bosnian War (1992-1995) resurfaced and dislodged, putting in danger the people living in the areas as well as rescuers [5][6].
Even the purpose of landmines usage has changed: they are more and more used against civilians, in order to terrorize communities and prevent population movement.  Sometimes they are laid to deprive a location population access to water sources, wood and fuel. New antipersonnel landmines have been laid in recent years in Yemen, apparently by government forces. There are also allegations that South Sudan, Sudan and Turkey have used antipersonnel mines. The governments of Syria and Myanmar have made use of landmines in 2012 and 2013. Mines are also placed by non-state armed groups (rebel armies, terrorists) in Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, and Yemen. In this case, the used devices are usually not “real” landmines, but victim-activated improvised explosive devices [4]. Within mine affected communities, the highest level of danger is faced by the “base-of-pyramid” people (people from developing countries, that live with 2$ or less/day). They need to ramble widely in search for fresh water, fuel and wood, increasing the danger of entering unmarked minefields [2].
*More facts and numbers about the global problem posed by landmines can be found in Desk study concerning landmines
Current landmine detection methods
To solve the landmine problem, first landmine usage has to stop. Due to initiatives such as the ICBL (International Campaign to Ban Landmines), landmine usage is seeing a steady decline. However, as already mentioned, landmines laid decades ago can still cause trouble. Detection and removal of landmines is therefore of the utmost importance.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Assumptions
Michaelis Menten Assumptions (see drug kinetics model) have been applied in the kinetics of consumption of enzyme and substrate
Effects of competition and induction can be represented by probabilistic variables (u and v) and are directly dependent on the rate of consumption of any given substrate Si within the mixture
More details about assumptions made for each individual variable are described in the paper.
Predictions
In a mixture of substrates, glucose is always used up first by the culture, and then any other secondary source present in the medium.
The time length of the primary and secondary exponential phases of growth in the biomass depend on the initial concentration of carbon sources.
This will help to predict the switching point between two sources.
In our project:
The primary Carbon source: Provides repression of the CRP promoter and delays the start of the encapsulation phase (Module 2)
The secondary Carbon Source: Will power the system once the primary source has been used up. Finding the best secondary carbon source can help us draw a relationship with the output yield of colanic acid.

Simulations
The simulations show how the population of substrate is consumed over time for different initial concentrations of glucose and lactose.
We also vary enzyme concentration.
  about the simulations.
Conclusions
The lower the initial amounts of glucose present in the medium, the longer it takes to get used up.

Advantages and Possible Uses
Motivation and Overview
We aim to design cell-free biosensors for an application in the open field, e.g. to detect heavy metals in water or date rape drugs in beverages. A promising approach for the development of these biosensors is Cell-Free Protein Synthesis, CFPS.
You may ask: Cell-free protein synthesis? Transcription and translation without any organism? How is that possible?
By applying one of iGEMs central ideas: Combination! For Cell Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) you need:
A DNA template which carries all information about your protein of interest
The protein synthesis machinery composed of proteins and ribosomes
Amino acids, energy resources and cofactors to fuel the machinery.
This simple principle is summarized in the following illustration:
Theoretical Background
""Cell-free protein synthesis"" (CFPS) is the production of proteins from nucleic acid templates without living cells, but with the use of the transcription and translational ""hardware"" that originally is built up by cells. This is possible because this ""hardware"" does not necessarily need a whole cell, but only some well characterized components to function properly. Among these components, the most obvious are RNA-Polymerase and Nucleoside-Triphosphates (NTPs) for transcription, as well as ribosomes and amino"

Then we observed each sample with an epifluorescence microscope. The results were promising. B2- did not express sfGFP, but B2+ did. Additionally, in both cases (B2+ & B3) and (B2+ & supB3) the fluorescence of sfGFP disappeared almost completely. We are going to do soon another experiment but with a rigorous protocol.
May 14 – 20, 2012
The Distribution Kit 2012 arrived! Now we have a lot of new parts!
We prepared for second time samples of B2+ & B3+ to observe in the epifluorescence microscope the effect of time in the samples.
This time B2+ & B3+ presented much more fluorescence, and it persisted over time (at least 1 hour with no significant variation).
Additionally, we began to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. But the amplicon was barely visible in the electrophoresis. We will have to try it again, or maybe try another technic like touch-down PCR. Or the primers are designed for repetitive areas?
May 21 – 27, 2012
We received the results of the DNA sequencing of Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid. Fortunately, these results are coherent with our designs. Great news!
Also, we went to the confocal microscope

Ideally, we would like to screen out then mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to mechanical force. As for the audiogenetics, we hope to screen out cells which are able to response to specific sound frequency, achieving precise and orthogonal audio regulation.

Taxol Side-Chain Synthesis
Taxol, the brand name of paclitaxel, is an anticancer drug which is often used in chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers1. Taxol was traditionally isolated from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) and research into cost-effectively producing Taxol has been ongoing since its isolation in 19672. Prof. Groundwater suggested that we look into synthesis of the Taxol side-chain synthesis, due to the production of a racemic mixture at that point in industrial synthesis. To combat the production of a racemic mixture, biosynthetic pathways, such as the one shown for Taxol (Figure 1) can be used to ensure the correct stereoisomers are produced1. However, these biosynthetic pathways are often slow and could benefit from co-localisation.
Figure 3: Overview of the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. Source: (Croteau et al., 2006)1.
The enzymes required for synthesis of the Taxol side-chain are Phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) and Tyrocidine synthase I (S563A) (TycA-S563A). These enzymes have a slow turnover rate (Kcat of 0.015 /s and 0.05 /s respectively) which could be improved through co-localisation and altering the stoichiometry of the reaction, both of which can be achieved using our Assemblase scaffold.
We tested this assumption with our  Enzyme Kinetics and Diffusion model , which showed that co-localising the enzymes with our scaffold could potentially lead to a six-fold increase in taxol side-chain yield.
Figure 4: Modelling Results
We have designed the gBlock sequences needed to express the Taxol synthesis enzymes in the appropriate form to attach to our scaffold (including a Spy or Snoop tag). Due to time constraints, we have not experimentally validated this section of our project. Moving forward, we hope to characterise this pathway experimentally to also show the flexibility of the Assemblase system adapting to different pathways.

We helped the Wageningen iGEM team with characterizing a part of their project. The team wanted to encapsulate fluorophores in vesicles. To prove that they were indeed able to make the vesicles, confirm their presence and characterize them, they needed pictures made by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Therefore, we used the TEM in our department to make the pictures for the Wageningen team.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project . Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
We have analysed the potential applications of our project in an extensive product analysis and we have done a risk analysis to determine the risks of our project. In order to specify the wants and needs of companies and the general public, we have discussed our project with several stakeholders. Stakeholders, like Nikon and Olympus highlighted, among other things, the need of uniform and spherical biolenses. We also have studied how iGEMs influence, potential and practice could be expanded. Therefore, we have written an analysis about iGEM with recommendations that can be used by, for example, the iGEM headquarters to optimize the potential of iGEM even more.

After last weeks succesful ligation of CAM and KAN resistance markers into plasmid pSLD3, we successfully constructed plasmids pSLD30 (which contains CAM) and pSLD31 (which contains KAN). All the steps and how we calculated the volumes needed of all the items for both restriction and ligation can be found in the lab book. Long story short, in order to have ample amounts of inserts, (FP's and resistance markers), we performed PCR's.. both de-novo amplifications of the inserts that weren't present as PCR products from Sebastien already, and re-amplications of the PCR products available from Sebastien. Once PCR was completed, we had ample amounts of all the FP's (yGFP, CFP, and CRFP) as well as resistance markers (CAM & KAN).
Next step was to perform a PCR clean up; in order to construct pSLD30 and pSLD31, for now we were only working with the resistance markers.. FP's will come in the picture at a later stage. So, a PCR clean up was performed (follow protocol) on the PCR products of CAM and KAN. These are now ready to use for the next step, which were restrictions.
The primers used when performing PCR on CAM and KAN had tails which contained restriction sites, which brings us to the point using restriction enzymes. The table with all the combinations of restriction enzymes used for each digestion can be found in the lab book, the point was to perform restrictions such that in the next step we could ligate plasmid with insert in the combination of:
pSLD3 + CAM = pSLD30
pSLD3 + KAN = pSLD31
Before proceeding to the next step of ligation, the restricted products (both resistance markers and plasmid) were checked on a gel to make sure restriction occured and that we actually still have material to work with.
The next step was the ligation. Ligation (follow lab book protocol) pretty much doesn't need an explanation as it ligated plasmid with insert.
The ligations were also checked on gel to make sure ligation actually occured.
This was followed by transformation, were we used the method of electroporation to insert our newly constructed plasmids (pSLD30 + 31) into electrocompetent cells, incubate them at 37 degrees in recovery media for 2 hours"

FRES(H) Sensor
We decided that the best way to prototype our system would be to develop an app that consumers could use to easily read the stickers on fruit. The app also comes to bear on the other side of the equation, workers can use it to read industrial sticker readouts during transport or storage.
The user can identify which specific region of the screen to analyze by tapping the screen to take a photo, which is then broken down into  red, green and blue components. The blue intensity is measured, and this is mapped to corresponding ethylene concentrations as informed by our modelling efforts. Unfortunately, our biological system did not progress to full operation, so we were unable to set the scale on real data.   FRES(H) was programmed in the SWIFT language, native for iOS platforms.
Hamburg Collaboration
Their team aimed to diagnose Chlamydia via the fluorescence of GFP. For this they required an app very similar to our own. A particularly key modification was incorporating the formula for fluorescent intensity into their app, as visible light is not merely a sum of the RGB components.
Instead, it follows this formula - (0.2126*red + 0.7152*green + 0.0722*blue)/5.
The app we wrote for them compares the negative, positive and patient micro-fluidic wells visible to the smartphone camera, and uses this to set a threshold and diagnose the patient.

Human Practice Overview
The Macquarie University Team had a significant portion of our project and time spend on developing our Human Practice, by targeting multiple areas in the community in a variety of different methods. Our aims were to educate society on the potential of synthetic biology, clarify the differences between genetic engineering and synthetic biology and to dispel any myths of synthetic biology being a dangerous field which is harmful to society. Synthetic Biology has applications in a variety of fields with massive potential to solve problems in society including pollution and energy. This page acts as a central hub for all of our aspects of Human Practice and contains a small description of the work. To learn more about our aspects in greater depth click on the headings.

Alternative cloning strategy
Another possibility is to use eg. XbaI and SpeI and also cut a vector with these enzymes, this would lead to ligation of the gvp-cluster in one direction. A possible vector for this strategy on the partsregistry is: BBa_J23018 (2298 bp).
Missing information
Used promotor for expression of the gvp-cluster:
Inducible (may be used for proof-of-principle)
Constituative (may be used for proof-of-principle)
Metal sensitive
What kind of vector was used by Li and Cannon (1995) or Melbourne (2007)? Is there a negative effect of high copy number?
What is the maximum amount of pressure gas vesicles can handle? At which depth would this be, how can one put this kind of pressure on a water column?
What is the density of gas vesicles in cells (normally or in case of over-expression)
Modelling parameters:
-Cyanobacteria (Bowen and Jensen, 1965): gas vacuoles made up of gas vesicles (75 nm in diameter and up to 1.0 ,um in length, single wall layer only 2 nm thick) 0,7MPa gives irreversible loss of buoyancy fenotype, but found in next generation.

Collaborations
This year’s Macquarie University iGEM team collaborated successfully with teams from 10 other universities. In doing so, we enhanced our own outreach activities as well as assisting other teams to reach their goals - with regards to the scientific completion of both their projects and their human practice goals.
For our major collaboration, we were able to assist University of New South Wales , to achieve their goals by sending them a transfectable Synechocystis strain, along with an integrative plasmid psBH02 (Synechocystis hemeoxygenase II that had kanamycin resistance), for use as a positive control in the transformation. This clone was useful to them as they had problems with the transformation of their Synechocystis strain.
The iGEM teams representing University of Sydney , Linköping University , Birbeck University and Oxford University directly took part in an episode of the world’s first synthetic biology themed gameshow, So You Think You Can Synthesise. Trinity College Dublin also added So You Think You Can Synthesise to their Youtube channel, helping to spread the word of synthetic biology and iGEM.
We took part in the outreach activities of other teams as well; for the team representing the University of Colorado Boulder , we constructed a short video addressing questions relating to our understanding of fracking; for team Paris-Saclay , we filled out a survey answering questions about our choice of chassis and participated in a synthetic-biology themed music video for Linköping University . We also answered surveys for the Oxford University teams about our iGEM experience and synthetic biology in general, respectively.
Australian iGEM Meet-ups
The Macquarie University iGEM team, and the teams representing the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales gathered to meet on two separate occasions - the 15th of July and the 15th of September.
On each occasion, all three teams delivered presentations detailing their project aims progress-to-date. These presentations were followed by questions, feedback and collaboration discussions which proved highly fruitful for all three teams.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a very short period of time. Mosquitoes will breed in these. So is it very feasible to get your intervention into those puddles or is that not possible. And also: if you go for such sugar-based traps: Do you want to lure the mosquitoes outside people’s houses instead of bringing them into it? You’re looking for a very personal protection in addition to the bed nets and insecticides. So you’ve got the push and pull approach: Pulling them to your trap where you could kill them and pushing them away from the person sleeping beneath the bed nets. So I think in framing your intervention, you have to put your intervention into the context of other existing interventions. I like it, it’s cool.
iGEM Hamburg: Thank you very much. Do you have any further questions regarding our project concept?
Dr. Hammond: Well. I wanna have a good look at how you set up your experiments, because these things a very important to get a clear answer. So you have the two aspects: One is how does it kill the mosquitoes? And I think, about this part you are more confident about, because it has been tested a few times already. But perhaps, there is a difference between the cell lysates and the bacteria itselves. And what is the product going to be?
iGEM Hamburg: So do you have any further questions regarding our idea?
Dr. Hammond: I would have a good look on how you set up your experiments because these things are tough to make sure you get a clear answer so you should have two aspects of it. You have the one aspect which how does it kill them. This part you are more confident about because it has been tested a few times already but perhaps there is a difference between the lysates of the bacteria and the bacteria themselves. And then what is it that you imagine the product to be. Is the product you will be selling a super solution that already got your bacteria lysate in it or is it that you are going to be spreading these bacteria somehow into breeding ground. I am not sure exactly how you intend to deliver.
iGEM Hamburg: The bacteria itself is supposed to do. So this is one of our concerns. We are using bacteria as a motor of our trap because the main purpose of our trap is to be sustainable and have no need of human intervention for a long period of time. So we did not tell you this before but the trap is supported by a coculture. We have E. coli that produces our lure and our toxin in one place. But this production is actually started by another culture which produces glucose. These"

Introduction
In order to design a functional sensor, we needed to be able to link the detector to the reporter. We considered a direct linkage between the reporter and the detector, which we decided to pursue for the beta-lactamase as a reporter. We have also built and submitted a construct with the a direct linkage between the TALEs and the ferritin. However, due to the massive size of the finished product (~1300 kDa) we needed another system, a system which allows in vitro assembly of the reporter and the detector. This is why we looked into the use of E and K coiled-coils in our system. The addition of the coiled-coils gives us flexibility in our system to disassembly of the target-specific detector from the reporter in order to switch in another detector for a different application. In other words, the coiled-coils add re-usability to the system making it a great platform technology .  In addition, ferritin serves as a great scaffolding protein, allowing us to stick multiple different detectors on it. We can also scale up the reporter response by adding reporters on ferritin, depending on the requirements of the system where the sensor is applied. Therefore, the ability to scale up and down allows us to incorporate informed design in our platform technology application.
What are E/K Coils?
E/K coils are synthetic coiled-coil domains designed to bind specifically to each other with high affinity and specificity (Litowski and Hodges, 2002) (Figure 1).  They are composed of a heptad repeat of amino acids that form a coil structure that is able to interact with each other"
Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama_-_-_TEXT.html," order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into E. coli to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway. (2) Second, in In addition to introduction of three genes in a MEP pathway, we further introduced farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene (ispA) or its mutant (m-ispA, S80F) in combination with geraniol synthase gene from Ocimum basilicum (ObGES). These gene-combinations are possible to convert IPP and DMAPP into to farnesol or geraniol, respectively. (3) Finally, we further introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (MarA) to release the farnesol and geraniol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase in these flavors in the air.  The results we obtained are as follows: (1) Ubiquinone 8, which is an end product of MEP pathway, as IPP and DMAPP are intermediate, so they are hard to be detected, was detected more in superimposed strain than the counterpart E. coli. (2) Farnesol was produced by E. coli engineered with farnesol production device (BBa _K1653025) . We were able to validate our constructed genes working well. (3) E. coli engineered with geraniol production device (BBa _K1653021) , ObGES, showed different smell as compared with counterpart control (pSB1C3). (4) E. coli engineered with MarA device (BBa _K1653020) showed exported intracellular geraniol. (5) E. coli engineered with MarA device (BBa _K1653020) showed increased tolerance to the geraniol as compared with the counterpart non-engineered strain.
