Discussion
Our project is to develop a new treatment for type 1 diabetes using a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria, which means that to this project became a real product someday, it would have to go under several safety assessments and approved to be used in humans.
Over this year, as we worked in our project, we were always worried about the legal requirements for a GMO like ours become a real product and how biosafety laws affect and guide the development of new GMOs. This work was very useful to us to look for and understand the laws of our country, the steps that we would have to take if we wanted our project to became a product. Knowing the informations that we've presented here is important not only for us while developing our project this year, but it is also important of us as biotechnologies students and professionals.
This work was not only useful to understand the complexity of Brazilian laws, but also to identify some aspects in the legislation that could be improved. In general, doing research and using GMOs in our country is not a trivial work. Maybe some deep reflections and revisions in the legislation could make the research and use of GMOs less challenging, easier and faster whereas keeping in mind the citizens' safety.
Another thing that we could notice is that the information about GMOs legislation in Brazil is very diffuse, this means that finding it is a very time-consuming task. An initiative from the government in creating a page where people could easily find all the information would be very useful. We hope this work could help future Brazilian teams and people working with GMOs"

Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet!

Plates were induced by spraying them with an 5% w/v aqueous arabinose solution.
The plates were again inspected under UV-light and this time the most red florescent cells were picked.
Colonies were grown in culture tubes and screened in parallel on the BioLector. Wells on BioLector plate were loaded with culture by transferring a toothpick from each overnight culture selected and into the wells of the plate. All wells were run in duplicate.
All duplicate colonies were run twice -- once with arabinose added at t=0, and again without arabinose.
The pBAD system BBa_K808000 was used as a reference.
This reverse primer sequence is incorporating randomized promoter sequences into the pBAD construct. The sequence is annotated with -10 and -35 consensus region. Note that I2-bindingsite is overlapping with the -35 region. Blue is the binding part of the primer, red is the USER made sticky ends. N=random, W=50% A and 50% T
Data analysis
Data was collected from the Biolector, and analyzed using a series of R scripts written by Chris Workman (unpublished).
The maturation and degradation times for mCherry were both assumed to be 40 min.
The growth rate, mu, was estimated to be 1.28 (from an average of all wells on all plates) since we expect each strain to grow at the same rate.
A time window representing exponential growth was selected (between 4 and 8 hours).
The RFP measurement for a constitutively expressed strain was used as a standard measure of growth.  This is plotted on the x-axis in the detailed plots per colony below.
Figures were plotted using R.
Results
Summary
Promoter activity when induced (with arabinose added) plotted vs basal activity (without arabinose; ie leakiness of the promoter).  The colonies that we selected all show less activity than the the constitutive promoter, and when induced, show higher activity than the constitutive promoter.  The induced activity of the arabinose reference promoter is shown as a band representing two replicates.
Details
Promoter strengths for two trials of each colony with and without arabinose.

    Since the process of encryption and decryption can derive a series of interactive activities, the idea of biological cipher machine itself can be a good carrier of synthetic biology. How does our Enigma machine inspire the public? And what will these voices outside the lab inspire us to reflect on our project?  Continue to find the answer!
 
 
STEM scientific festival
    In July, STEM scientific festival was held in Suzhou, China. STEM is a concept of education that advocates students learning like scientists and engineers, which fits well with the aspects of synthetic biology in a way. We introduced synthetic biology and our project to the public by setting up a showcase in the exhibition hall. With the help of a room escape computer game, we attracted lots of attention. We successfully educated people came there, and also got useful feedbacks.

    We collaborated with a local youth public service organization, and join them as speaker of a national famous skill sharing activity in China, Oneyouth Talk. We talk directly to the public, and heard lots of voices outside the lab. And we also set up our showcase in the fair, which allowed participates to sell original goods. In the process of selling the postcards with codes on the back (designed by ourselves), we talked to people who are interested and got useful feedbacks.

This section gives an overview on the strength of all evaluated promoters, which span a large range of activities. For more details and informations of the experiments see the Data page of the promoters. Note that Pveg was not evaluated with luminescence measurements and this bar is just projected from the results of the β-galactosidase assay.
Overview of promoter activity evaluated with luminescence measurements in pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. These values derive from the experiments you can find in our Data section. Lumi per OD600 are taken at a OD600 of 0.1. Values are the average and the standard deviation of three different experiments for clone 1. Shown is the activity of the Anderson promoters J23100 (#100), J23101 (#101), J23102 (#102), J23103 (#103), J23106 (#106), J23107 (#107), J23113 (#113), J23114 (#114), J23115 (#115), J23117 (#117), J23118 (#118) as well as the activity of the constitutive promoters PliaG, and PlepA. The activity of the inducible promoter PliaI is shown with (+bac) and without (-bac) induction with bacitracin (10 μg/ml). The promoter activity of Pveg is projected from the results from the β-galactosidase assay and was not measured with luminescence measurements. For the assays shown, an intermediate version of the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE was used, which still contained one forbidden PstI site.

Hackathon part 1
The beginning of our actual project. Before today we knew that our project would be about the mind gut axis which means trying to tackle mental health problems with engineered probiotics. Today we made an actual list of effectors and promoters that we want to use in our biobricks. It was brainstorming mayhem, but we cut down our list to about ten candidates from each category for which we are going to collect more information for tomorrow.
Thursday 25th
Hackathon part 2
We finished our list today and had a lengthy vote on the g Blocks to order for our biobricks. Our main criterium for now is the likeliness for the gene products to yield useful data. Here is our list for the genes and promoters that we are starting to work on next week:
Effectors
TPH1 gene with an adrenaline-sensitive promoter, BBa_K554001 . TPH1 converts tryptophan to a precursor of serotonin.
TPH1 gene with nitric oxide sensitive promoter, BBa_K381001
naked sequence for GAD, which codes for the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase which produces GABA.
naked sequence for KAT (kynurenine aminotransferase), an important enzyme in serotonin metabolism
naked sequence for Cholin Acetyltransferase, which makes Acetylcholin, an important neurotransmiter
Promoters
biobrick of the adrenaline sensitive promoter BBa_K554001
biobrick of an osmotic stress sensitive promoter BBa_R0082
biobrick of the nitric oxide sensitive promoter BBa_K381001
biobrick of a pH sensitive promoter BBa_K318512
Constructs
An estrogen induced construct that is not yet fully characterized.  We are going to transfect HeLa cells to model a pathway in mammalian  cells which is central to our project as it involves bacteria interfering with humans
An anti-sense Tryptophanase construct. We want to use this to control the  tryptophanase expression which would allow us (or a cell) to regulate serotonin expression.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," Protease break the large amount of connections accumulated between DAMP and Pexiganan in the cells and releases pexiganan molecules. These pexiganan molecules are active lysis molecules that cause cells to splinter. For this reason, pexiganan molecules lysing E.colis which contain pexiganan and get it out of the cells. The pexiganan which set the release of the cell will allow the elimination of Helicobacter pylori.
In this case, the protein that binds to DAMP and the tip imbedded in PEX. will be produced in the E. coli without rupturing the cell membrane. TEV Protease that produces in the presence of AND GATE and the active pexiganan will leave from DAMP,  and keep releasing the effective dose within and around the h.pylori. At the same time, we will provide eradication E.coli which is used as a producer and a carrier so that there won't be anymore possibility of colonization mucosa to have to be removed.
Background
Pexiganan
According to our researches, a very efficient protein called pexiganan, a molecule showing a broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activities against both gram negative and positive bacteria, seemed beneficial for killing H. Pylori.(Figure 1) Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are very popular because of their bactericidal activity and they seem potential alternatives to current antibiotics. Also, antimicrobial peptides are not affected by classical antibiotic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, so this class of peptide have advantages to eradicate H.pylori instead of using current antibiotics. The other advantage of AMPs is that there aren’t any resistance to them-yet.  This was shown in a study too. (Figure 2)
In a paper, pexiganan’s killer activity is proved under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. (Xiao-Lin Zhang et al. 2015) It has exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and it has been tested against 3109 clinical isolate strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ge, Y; MacDonald, D,L et al. 1999). By using normal H.Pylori treatment way, complete eradication is not possible because of the low antibiotic concentration in gastric mucosa. In addition, in the low pH of the gastric fluid, antibiotics are unstable. As a result of gastric emptying, the residence time is short for antibiotics in the stomach. Therefore, our strategy depends on providing production of pexiganan"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"olecules - enzymes, catalytic RNAs or catalytic DNAs. For example, such library may consist of billions of randomly mutated enzyme sequences, a few computationally derived enzymes or a metagenomic enzyme library.
The next step, after building the library, is adding the essential genetic regulatory parts - RNA polymerase promoter and a ribosome binding site (2). These parts are necessary and sufficient to synthesize the biomolecules in both cells and in-vitro. For example, this can be done by ligating the regulatory parts onto DNA fragments or by using overhang PCR, which adds additional sequences to the end of your amplified product.
After the regulatory parts are added the fragments must then be circularized (3). DNA fragments are circularized for two main reasons:
1. First of all, in order to amplify the DNA inside microfluidic droplets an isothermal amplification reaction must be used. That is because droplets become highly unstable and can break easily when the temperature is quickly altered - just like during the popular polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If droplets would break during the initial stages of amplification, all of the information from different droplets would get mixed in the tube and the knowledge about which activity belongs to which sequence would be lost, as it was not yet recorded by the means of amplification (before the amplification, the activity measurement information is in form of modified substrate nucleotides).
That is why CAT-Seq uses a multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which is a non-thermocycling (isothermal) based DNA amplification technique. MDA was chosen because of its ability to rapidly amplify single templates of DNA into long double-stranded molecules which contain multiple repeats of the starting template. That said, one of the core requirements of MDA reaction is that starting DNA template must be circular.
2. Secondly, as seen in the later steps of CAT-Seq, in order to efficiently express a catalytic biomolecule in droplets, Rolling Cycle Transcription (described in catalytic biomolecule production section) is used, which immensely increases mRNA synthesis yield from a single DNA template. Such technique also requires the DNA to be circular, as an RNA polymerase travels around it in circles producing mRNA.
Proof of concept
Choosing the first catalytic biomolecule for creating and optimizing CAT-Seq system was a classical “chicken or the egg” paradox. At the very beginning, when system design was purely theoretical and we have been preparing to build it, the main question we had was - what is the combination of substrate nucleotide and catalytic biomolecules we should use,"

student Zhaoyi Li is working on synchronized E.coli oscillator, a biological breakthrough
published on Nature 2009. Last but not least, this is a busy week for scheduling trip, paying
fee and talking to sponsor. Handling these things cost me lots of time, we should have a

Here's what I can remember.
Zhaoyi Li looked into the nature article on synchronized ecoli clock and gave a brief
lecture, then he started to analyze all the reaction and species in the model, and prepare to

We sought to add spermicidal property to these Lactobacillus sp. Inhabiting the vagina. Thus, the woman inoculated with our engineered Lactobacillus sp. Are always on contraception. We also sought the device to be able to be switched to not producing the spermicidal protein. Thus, we design a toggle switch circuit that can be switched back and forth between producing the contraceptive protein and not by addition of simple sugars such as lactose and xylose.
We aim to increase the convenience using contraception, thus increasing the number of participant of the national contraception program. With our device, once inoculated in the vagina, the user does not have to worry about unplanned pregnancy for life, as the Lactobacillus sp. Keeps expressing the spermicidal protein until switched not to. To be fertile, the user only have to apply substance that switch the direction of the toggle switch. With these, user would be able to “plan” the pregnancy before, and reducing the unwanted pregnancy."

USAFA
The United States Air Force Academy iGEM team, USAFA , was very close with us this year and spent five weeks sharing a lab space with us. Along with helping them with lab work, we also helped them with their Interlab and bounced ideas we had off of them. Since they were a first-year team we mentored them helped them a lot with all of the new things that come with being a new iGEM team, such as their Wiki, safety forms, and what iGEM is all about. Having a new iGEM team right there to talk to was a great experience for both of the teams because we were able to present to each other, bounce ideas off one another, and learn about each others projects.

The Midwestern Meetup
Some of our team members attended the Midwestern Meetup to present our projects to four other teams across the Midwest: Michigan State , RHIT , Michigan , and UIOWA . We discussed the details, applications, and the many problems that the teams were facing at the time. We tried to help where we could when speaking with some of the other teams. We spoke with the Iowa iGEM team about using superfolder GFP to get a quicker response time for their GFP that will help their project.

RHIT
One of our team members went to Rose-Hulman, iGEM team RHIT and was shown around the lab and discussed some of the problems that were going with their project. They had also just finished the Interlab and some of the results were discussed then later compared with our data. During this time the RHIT iGEM team was making trading cards and they agreed to make one of our very own Mike the Microbe.

The majority of respondents agreed that they would transform bacteria with more plasmids than usual if a system enabling plasmid compatibility existed. 75.9% of respondents confirmed that an ability to keep a fixed ratio of different types of plasmids intracellularly would be useful in their experiments. It provided us a critically important feedback on one of our main project goals.
More than 95% of surveyed scientists use antibiotics to select transformants. They mostly used a combination of two antibiotics, however 6.9% of respondents used more than 3 antibiotics for selection on regular basis. It corresponded to the number of different plasmids in their experiments. Most of respondents did not try to find an alternative to antibiotics by using another selection system.

What impact do you want to have on the world:
I would love to pursue a career in bioprocess engineering using synthetic biology to produce biofuels!
Hobbies:
I am an adrenaline-junkie at heart and love activities that get my heart pumping: from hiking to skydiving, I'm always looking for a new adventure!

Philip Lam
Major and Year:
4th Year Applied Biology, specializing in Plant and Soil Sciences
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year in order to appreciate the unlimited tamed potentials of anthropogenic biodiversity; it’s my favourite dynamic-and-renewable resource to exploit/domesticate/sustain.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Initially, I had merely hoped to learn how to transform brewer’s yeast to produce terpenes and polyketides of plant origin, just for the power-trip. Eventually, I decided to stay for the annual Albertan roadtrip of friendship.
What inspires you:
Plant chemicals, fungal and bacterial metabolism, and animal consciousness.  People like Paul Stamets, Alexander Shulgin, Francis Crick, Kary Mullis, Aldous Huxley, Paul Kroeger, George Abbas.
Desired Impact on the world:
I wish to honour my ancestors.
Hobbies:
Watching Youtube reruns of Fear Factor, while getting shunned for watching it.

Tudor Lapuste
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I've been fascinated by topics in synthetic biology ever since I saw a TED talk in 2010 where Craig Venter revealed the ""first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA"". I've tried to join various synthetic biology efforts since then, including the DIYbio group here in Vancouver, and when I saw that iGEM was accepting new team members, it was a no-brainer!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get my hands dirty (not literally of course, I'll be wearing gloves) in the lab and figure out the best way to present information on our team wiki.
What inspires you:
My main inspiration is this idea that technology is bootstrapping on itself and accelerating towards what Ray Kurzweil calls The Singularity. I am a positive person, and as such I see this resulting in a world of abundance, rather than a Terminator-esque dystopia where the machines take over. Radical abundance for all!
Desired impact on the world:
Currently I am planning/am actively pursuing entrepreneurship, and my mission statement"

Many workplans were revised
For the light sensor, the RBS was extracted successfully from the gel; but promoters did not show A new workplan for the light sensor because extracting promoters of 35bp & 130bp will not be a good idea, thus, we present to you: Light Sensor Take Two
For the ON switch: (picture will be put up soon)
|I12006(SP)-[B0034(SP)-C0051(XP)](XP)|(EX)-|[B0034(SP)-E1010(XP)](SP)-F1610(XP)|(EX)
For the initiator test construct, RBS-RFP will now be embedded in between the actual construct.  To illustrate:
Actual construct: R0082-RBS-C0051-B0015
Test construct: R0082-RBS-RFP-RBS-C0051-B0015
Many, if not all ligations were unsuccessful: parts were not cutting successfully since bands in the gel were not showing up in the right places.

For C#, D#, L# from the 16/07 PCR batch
Sequencing of QC J*4
J*4 (4) sequencing data shown to have many extra inserts, despite the desired mutagenetic site actually being correctly replaced. Two paths will be pursued:
J*4(1) (which is from plate 1 - another PCR condition (1ng plasmid)) to be sent for sequencing - obtain 2.5µL plasmids and dilute 1:1 in 2.5µL of Milli-Q. Sent for sequencing using VF2 and VR primers.
J*4(1) (which is from plate 1 - another PCR condition (1ng plasmid)) to be sent for sequencing - obtain 2.5uL plasmids and dilute 1:1 in 2.5uL of Milli-Q. Sent for sequencing using VF2 and VR primers.
If and when the sequences are correct, we will save the corresponding tube as a complete BioBrick (annotating that it has been QuikChanged), digest out the insert, cleanup, PCR the NcoI restriction site in, digest, and finally ligate into pBAD/HisB to make a functional plasmid.
Sequencing Data Received
K#1 confirmed - refer order number 4253587
Gel electrophoresis confirmation of 17/07 digested miniprep products
Plasmids -
pSB1C3: D*, E*
pBAD33: D#
pBAD/HisB: M#, O#
After which, send for sequencing depending on degree of success. Unfortunately the gel ran too far and ‘ladder’ didn’t show up, which suggests that it is actually a mislabeled tube of loading dye. Re-made digests as only 3 ul of original is used. Will run gel again tomorrow with fresh ladder.
Miniprepping of 19/07 overnight cultures

For the rest - miniprep the full volume (see “upgraded” protocol: spin down cells → decant → resuspend in smaller volume before beginning the miniprep; pre-warm elution buffer to 55degC; run the same elution mixture through the column twice for maximum extraction)

ProtoCat 3.0 - Human Practices
Protocol Model Development
Prior to beginning the development of ProtoCat 3.0, we did research on currently used protocol models. We began by     brainstorming with members of our team who had lab experience to get a foundation upon which we could improve. We tested the robustness of this initial model by trying to represent the protocols uploaded to ProtoCat 2.0 with our new model, tweaking and updating it along the way. Once we felt our model could adequately handle the protocols we anticipated in ProtoCat 3.0, we met with our adviser, Dr. Santiago Schnell, and ran our protocol model by him. Taking his feedback, we went back and further refined our model to the one that we use in our current implementation of ProtoCat 3.0.
Standard Protocol Format
Standardization in synthetic biology has gained a lot of traction, such as the BioBrick and Registry of Standardized Biological Parts. However, the procedures used to generate them tend to be diverse in nature, with a bacterial transformation protocol likely requiring different information than a ligation protocol. Online protocol repositories must account for such differences when creating their data models, which will usually require either a simplified model (such as solely text-based) or a more arduous upload process. These different models become a problem when trying to share protocols between the repositories, because the formats that the protocols are stored in are not compatible and require an external conversion tool to get from one format to the other. In order to begin working towards a standardized protocol format format, we reached out to OpenWetWare and Protocols.io, two well known protocol repositories. We have began discussing how we will reconcile our respective protocol models in order to get the best protocol model. The first steps have been taken to build a cooperative relationship and create a standard protocol that will help make protocols even easier to use, test, review, and design."

Welcome to the Stanford team Wiki for iGEM 2009
Stanford iGEM is a student-run, faculty-directed research group at
Stanford University. The objective of our interdisciplinary group is
to design and build novel engineered biological systems using
standardized DNA-based parts to submit to the iGEM (International
Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, held annually at MIT.
We will be competing for the first time in 2009.
Our research draws from the principles of Synthetic Biology, an
emerging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary area that involves
the design and construction of biological systems.
BOO! Robert has 1 day left and wishes to make his mark on the wiki
before he goes! Bwahaha go SiGEM!

(c)Compare the experimental data (197 wildtype worms, yellow bar) with the simulation data (197 worms, ka=0.3, kb=0.2, purple bar). X2= 219.28  degree of freedom is 14, p value is 0.995). (d)Raw counts in experiment (197 wildtype worms, induced by diacetyl)
Conclusion
·In the experiment, the “influence factor” of previous choice-making ka=0.3. It means that if a worm turn left at the first crossing, the possibility of turning left at the second crossing is will be 30%  more than that of turning right.
·The “attraction factor” of diacetyle to worms kb=0.1. The added diacetyl will attract worms toward the side with higher diacetyle concentration.

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," order to prove the function of this receptor in yeast cell, another plasmid with our reporter device, pRS42K-mRFP-CYC1t, was transformed into CEN.PK2-1C, More details about this part of work will be displayed in host website transduction and detection .
The sense device, BBa_2368007 and BBa_2368008, was expressed successfully in the host yeast. Once the receptor can respond the presence of sweeteners, the mRFP will be expressed as output. (Fig. 13)
Fig. 14  A simplified model of the αpheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Following the above, we separately added a list of sweeteners like fructose, sucrose, glucose into the culture to detect the red fluorescence intensity based on whether its regulatory interaction with sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3.
So we selected two sweeteners, fructose and sucrose, for the first testing.
Firstly, we selected a single cell clone of CEN.PK2-1C with the circuits mentioned previously and cultured this clone in SD medium with 2% glucose and corresponding concentration of antibiotic G418 at 30℃ overnight.
After harvesting cells, we centrifuged the cells and added new SD medium with 2% galactose and antibiotic G418 for inducing the expression of T1R2 and T1R3. Incubated at 30℃ for 12 hours.
Then added sweeteners into culture according to Table 1
Table 1.  The sweeteners added for detecting function of the system

After adding sweeteners, we used plate reader to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600, calculated the value of fluorescence intensity/ OD600 as the  mean fluorescence intensity at the single cell level. The mean fluorescence intensity is showed in Fig.15.
Fig. 15 The mean fluorescence intensity of experimental group and control group after 12, 16 hours
As the picture shows, the fructose group and sucrose group established obvious increase compared to control group from 12h to 16h.
The red fluorescence intensity at the single cell level all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners."

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Brad_-_-_TEXT.html,"cense based reporter protein eforRed (Uppsala 2011 BBa_K592012) is expressed. In the [OFF] state the RhlI quorum sensing protein from P. aeruginosa is expressed. The eforRed chromoprotein was chosen as fluorescence based reporters often require complex laboratory equipment to measure expression. Using a chromoprotein allows for the switch from [ON] to [OFF] to be verified by sight alone. The promoter flip also creates expression of the quorum sensing protein RhlI. This allows for a downstream activation of a reporter cell, meaning that the Fim Standby Switch has dual reporting properties. The use of the FimE switch as opposed to FimB (which is reversible) means that even with a low or inconsistent induction signal, the permanent inversion of the 300bp fim promoter region leads to a signal which can be observed. This may have applications in agricultural biosensors where there can be plant uptake of the potential induction compound (reference ). FimE was also chosen because FimB can switch the promoter back and forth, so it is likely to result in about half the plasmids with the promoter in one direction and half in the other over time, resulting in no strong signal either direction. The inactivation of the eforRed chromoprotein following an induction signal visibly displays the [ON] to [OFF] inversion. Expression of this chromoprotein also displays that the [ON] section of the fim switch is working correctly.
Design Stage
To construct the Fim reporter switch 3 separate gBlocks were designed with overlapping adapter regions homologous to the iGEM prefix and suffix to allow for Gibson assembly into the pSB1C3 backbone whilst retaining biobrick compatibility. The individual genes and other components are shown in (Table 1). The 1st gBlock sequence starts with a RBS (B0034) upstream of the fimE ORF (K137007) with no promoter region, this is to allow for other promoters to be cloned in upstream of the part. Downstream of the fimE gene is a double terminator (B0015). All RBS and terminator sequences used are B0034 and B0015 respectively.
Implementation

Characterisation
The fim Standby Switch has two main functions; a visual signal to show that the target compound has been detected and AHL production so that the part can be detected by a reporter cell. To characterise the part these functions are individually tested, in aim to further isolate issues if they occur. To test the detecting function of the"

Collaborations
This year, our program held tight to the ethos of collaborations. In the very beginning stage of brainstorming, we exchanged ideas with Team BITChina2017 about building biosensor in modified pheromone pathway in yeast, and obtained yeast modified by the team. While Team BIT-China2018 worked on their program this year, we reciprocally offered them help in modeling and data processing. Additionally, we cooperated with team Tsinghua in both stages of experiment and human practice, and hosted exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum in joint hands. We sincerely express our gratitude towards Team BIT-China and Team Tsinghua for their help and its profound assistance to our work.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," coli BL21. This orthogonality is due to the promoter specifity of the different polymerases (Davis et al., 1971; McGraw et al., 1985).       We applied this system to enhance a reporter in genetic circuits to make even weak gene expression visible.
At the moment, fluorescent proteins with an emission wavelength within the visible spectra are used to report expression of the gene of interest. Therefore, the CDS of the fluorescent protein is placed downstream of the CDS of the target protein without a terminator or promoter in between. The expression level of the target protein is nearly the same as the expression of the fluorescent protein. The fluorescence of the reporter protein indicates if the gene of interest was translated. However, this system is limited to strong expression, which generate a sufficienly strong fluorescence signal.
Therefore it is impractical for several applications which involve only weak expression. For our project, we needed a reliable and sensitive reporter to detect the expression of the gene of interest on a selection plasmid. A low expression of the target gene is essential for the selection system. No fluorescence was detectable, when the CDS of mRFP was placed downstream of the gene of interest. Through the function of the gene of interest, we knew it was expressed. To address this reporter challenge we built a genetic circuit following the model of an amplifier used in electrical engineering.
Basic amplifiers were previously submitted to the Registry of biological parts e. g. by iGEM Cambridge 2009 . They build a simple circuit using an activator, which increased the transcription of a reporter under control of a second promoter. To explain their system they used the term ""Polymerases per second"" (PoPs). This unit defined as the flow of RNA polymerase molecules over a promoter region per second. The system developed by Cambridge 2009 (Figure 1) could increase the number of PoPs.
Figure 1: Signal strenthening system of iGEM Cambridge 2009 .
To improve this system we decided to use an activator, which translates the reporter DNA and does only induce the translation of the polymerase which then translates the gene of interest. Amplification was achieved by an RNA polymerase, which transcribes the reporter DNA, multiple times and enhances the signal significantly.
Functional Parameters
To design a genetic circuit that amplifies a reporter signal we decided to use an RNA polymerase, orthogonal to the native E. coli RNA polymerase. Therefore, the T3 RNA polymerase previously characterized by iGEM Peking 2010 was deployed. The T3 RNA polymerase is"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  BCA assay will be done on the final elution of the previous affinity purification.  According to Kevin from the Yeate’s lab, a minimum of 2mg/mL of protein is needed for the DLS assay.
Procedures: The standard procedure was followed in the Thermo BCA kit in order to prepare the standard solutions.  All standards were diluted in triton lysis buffer.
Elution 3 was used because it appeared to be the purest.  Upon starting the assay, it was noted that some of the protein was aggregating and precipitating out of solution.  The tube was spun down at max speed for 5 minutes, and the supernatant collected.  The samples ran were the following:
Elution with aggregate, supernatant, 1:10 supernatant, and 1:100 supernatant.
A standard curve was constructed on excel.  Only absorbance readings at about .1 to 1 were used.  Only the original elution showed a measured protein concentration at about 620ug/mL.
Conclusion:  It appears that most of the protein cage is aggregating out of solution.  Perhaps this can be used in order to separate the protein cage in the other two elutions, and resuspend them in a higher volume."

The optimal concentration of Janus is 200μg/ml.
The optimal concentration of antigens (CEA, AFP and CA15-3) is 2.5μg/ml.
The optimal concentration of antibodies is 5μg/ml.
Figure 1. Hydrophobins sJanus show good effects of antibodies fixing. Here we use antibodies with green fluorescence tag as example. The spots with strong fluorescence represent successful binding between capture antibody (probe) and antigen (tumor marker).
Figure 2. Hydrophobins inJanus tend to show weak fluorescence signal. After compared experiments, we discovered that increasing the incubation time helps to improving detecting sensitivity.
Project Achievements
1. We introduced a new method of protein chip substrate modification by using Janus, and verified its feasibility.
2. We confirmed the optimal concentration of antigens and antibodies in the detection of tumor markers, which helps to save materials to the most extent and keep the reliability of the results at the same time.
3. The experiments were conducted with different kinds of antigens and antibodies, ensuring the universality of the tumor detection chip under a certain range.
Process of Optimization
1. In the beginning, due to our inexperience, the concentration of antigens and antibodies was too high, which leads to excessive strong fluorescence signal intensity.
At first we thought it was caused by the improperly operation of microscope, but after literature reviewing and analyzing, we tried lowering the concentration about four times and achieved good results.
Figure 3. Here is the excessive strong fluorescence signal intensity caused by high concentration.
Figure 4. Good results were achieved after lowering the concentration.
2. In mid-stage, many crystallized structures appeared in the protein spot, and hence influenced the image quality and observation results. To solve this problem, we consulted large quantities of data and information, and discovered a similar case arising when solutions of antibodies and antigens were stored for too long, leading to degeneration. So we reformulated all the solutions we need, and crystallization disappeared. From this we learned that reagents should be used right after they were ready. In this case, another possible cause was that we used TBST in the last washing step, which may also lead to crystallization. In the upper course of experiments we used water instead of TBST.

Retrospection of Survey
With a deeper research on treatment methods, the feasibility was verified at experimental level. But it still had a long way to go before it can be applied clinically. With our first survey results and some questions, we went to the hospital again, and conducted another questionnaire survey and interviewed some residents (Figure 9).
Preparation work:
Respondents: patients and doctors with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient of rheumatology department
Sample size: 30 doctors and 80 patients
Procedure:
1. List a questionnaire for patients and doctors (Avoid patients’ and doctors’ personal information).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Contact relevant departments of the hospital.
4. Determine the process and the time.
Figure 9. Go to the hospital for in-depth investigation again
According to our plan, we came to Nanjing First Hospital and Nanjing Gulou Hospital for a questionnaire survey. The majority of patients showed great interests in our innovative therapy and explored the specific way of using this therapy after a conversation with them. Some patients were confident in our treatment and encouraged us to make more efforts in getting this therapy into clinical as soon as possible (Video 1). According to the survey, most of them have suffered from RA for more than 5 years. It was gratifying to note that more than half of the patients said they were willing to try Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy while others showed some uncertainty (Figure 10). But we believe this therapy will be more recognized with more future research.
Figure 10. The personal willingness of patients to try syn-Notch CAR-T cell therapy
Video 1. We have a deep conversation with patient
As for our survey with the doctors, most of the them have worked for more than 5 years (Figure 11), and they believed that the current drug treatment had shortcomings like severe side effects, a high recurrence rate and a chronic medication use (Figure 12), while Syn- Notch CAR Treg cell therapy had a more specific target and may show less side effects (Figure 13), which surpassed the existing treatment. Its safety was also further recognized by healthcare professionals. However, there are many problems remaining to be solved before it can actually applied clinically, such as a limitation on large-scale production, quality control standards, etc.

Runs Before Failure
To characterize the amount of runs the XY-stage can perform before failure, we ran TERRA through a set of 15 trials in which fluid was dispensed into two different wells ten times. These trials were run independently from each other by resetting TERRA in between trials.  In each trial, two outputs were simulated--one outputting at location 45, and the latter outputting at location 90. The experiments allowed us to understand how many loops TERRA would run through before it fails to output into a correct well location, and therefore requires a reset.
Terra averages around 8 runs before it requires a reset. A reset consists of rehoming the device from its starting point, readjusting the tubing, and resetting the plate on the plane.
Speed and Time
A set of 15 trials were run in order to determine the speed of the plate support of the XY-stage. The plate support traveled a distance of 108mm. The time taken to travel was recorded for each trial and then averaged. To calculate the average speed, the distance traveled was divided by the time per run.
The average time taken to transverse the 108 mm was 39.306 seconds. From that, we determined that, with a microstep of 1/4 steps, the XY-stage moves at an average speed of 2.75 mm/sec. The average time taken to travel between wells on a 96 well plate was 3.28 seconds.
Since the time taken to travel is dependent on the distance between the center of each well, we can extrapolate from this data to find the average time taken to travel from well-to-well on multiple types of microtiter plates.

In order to limit waste, the sachet must be dimensioned in order to treat as much water as possible in a single use. The cylinder can be reused with a new sachet, reducing the device cost. Sunwaterlife membranes within the cylinder can be changed when they are clogged. Moreover, ABS is a recyclable plastic.
However, these products are not biodegradable. This prospects should be considered in the future.
→ (4) is partially fulfilled.
Device size
The size of the sachet was defined by the modelling approach. A sachet of 20 mL that contains 1.4 g of microorganisms would allow to treat 1 liter of water in approximately 54 minutes (this time does not include the rehydration phase of the microorganisms). As a proof of concept, we decided to create a prototype that contains 100 mL and treats 5 liters of water in approximately the same time (assuming that the water tank is homogeneous at all points).
In order to best satisfy the demand of a village of 15 families and to reduce waste as much as possible, it will be necessary to optimize the treatment capacity in a single use.
The cylinder must be adjusted to the size of the sachet. It should not be too large for convenient use and have approximately the same size as the sachet. However, it should not be too small either because the diffusion rate of water and small molecules (CAI-1 and AMP) across the Sunwaterlife membranes depends on their total surface.
For the prototype, we chose a cylinder which is 54 mm in diameter and 114 mm in length.
3D modeling of our device  (Solidworks modeling)
Sachet content
To allow long-term storage of the sachets, the microorganisms and the medium will be freeze-dried. When the device will be immersed in water, the lyophilisate will be rehydrated  and the microorganisms will be activated again. However, according to the modeling experiment conducted, the latency phase due to freeze-drying is really long (more than 10 hours for both microorganisms). It will be necessary to optimize this parameter by controlling the amount of microorganisms or their physiological condition before freeze-drying them.
The culture medium should not contain products that are toxic for the environment or humans. According to culture tests, V. harveyi and P. pastoris grow well in LB. This simple"

Since pm/μL value of T4 holin is significantly above 0.04, TE buffers should be added according to the formula below:
Added vol (μL) = [25 x pm/μLPart x μL recovered] - μLrecovered
pm/μLPart For T4 Holin can be calculated:
bp length of the construct = 704,
1 pm/μL= 670 ng/μL, and 1 pm/μLPart = 957 ng/μLPart
And from the given ng/μL value,
52.4ng/μL = 0.054pm/μLPart
Therefore,
Added vol (μL) = [25 x 0.054pm/μLPart x 48μL recovered] - 48μLrecovered =16.8μL
pm/μLPart For pLas can be calculated:
bp length of the construct = 211,
1 pm/ μL= 670 ng/μL, and 1 pm/μLPart = 3190 ng/μLPart
And From the given ng/μL value,
150ng/μL = 0.047pm/μLPart
Therefore,
Added vol (μL) = [25 x 0.047pm/μLPart x 20μLrecovered] - 20μLrecovered =3.5μL

surprise, some participants did finish the circuit with least effort, including a pupil. During this garden party, we’ve seen
more and more Chinese teenagers devoting themselves in the joy of life sciences, and our team will try our best to
make contributions to spreading this joy to the public without any doubt.
Biological Contest in Modeling
   As a good instance in the collaboration between outstanding universities in Guangdong Province, the “Bio-5-Talk” is
a series of activities which really make difference in developing communications among college students in Guangdong.
The highlight during “Bio-5-Talk” is absolutely the Biological Contest in Modeling. This year the annual party attracted
15 teams. By using fruits, styrofoam and other materials which are common in daily life, the participants are asked to
make a fabricated eukaryotic cell by hand. Our team used toothpicks to imitate the cytoskeleton together with plasti-
cine as the organelles, making a patterned and simple eukaryotic cell. We managed to use the cell model to illustrate
the basic process of transcription and translation, together with the knowledge of synbio to the other teams. At the
same time, we surely made some other participants interested in synthetic biology.
Genexplorer
   Even in Biology Festival we used toy electronic components symbolizing the genetic circuits, some participants also
felt confused about synthetic systems and their function in reality because electric circuits also had slight differences
from genetic circuit. Thus we decided to develop a video game in which genetic circuits coming from real projects and
their parts are shown as those in SBOLv.
   Then Genexplorer came into being, in which the player can built a circuit following the order of parts shown in the
game, and all circuits were retrieved from eminent projects in previous competition. Target players of this game is
people who have not ever learned synthetic biology but have interests in it.
   We have promoter this to other iGEM teams, and the public in CCiC and High School Summer Camp, where
the attending students and teams showed great interest in this simple and enjoyable game. With their suggestions, we
developed a hard mode later. For more details or if you want to download this game, please click the link .

2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference CGU X NTHU
On July 17 2017, CGU_Taiwan held 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference!
On that day, 7 Taiwanese teams gather in Chang Gung University and share their projects to each other. The purpose of holding Taiwan Conference is because we want to build up a close connection between teams in Taiwan, thus, provide more opportunities for team brainstorming and collaboration. In this event, we build a large scale pipetman to symbolize our spirit_ to use synthetic biology to change the world.
This one day meet-up event includes brainstorming activities, project presentation and lecture. For the lecture part, we had invited Dr. Wong Chi Huey, the Distinguished Research Fellow from Genomics Research Center, Academia Silica. He shared about his research on Saccharides synthesis and guide us to explore the possibility and future work of synthetic biology. We appreciate for Dr. Wong’s sharing and coming, the speech did broaden the Taiwan iGEMers’ horizons and help us grow.
For the accomplishment of this conference, we would like to appreciate NTHU_Taiwan for collaborating with us and hold this event together. NTHU_Taiwan designed interesting team activities and help everyone know each other as soon as possible through games in the morning of the event. While planning the activity, CGU_Taiwan had also visited NTHU in Hsinchu, hoping through creative talk, we can cooperate well and provide a best conference to Taiwan iGEMers. Lastly, we did it! We appreciate for the collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan.
iGEM and synthetic biology are needed to be promoted, therefore, CGU_Taiwan regards the connection between Taiwanese teams and successfully built it up."

- tRNA specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli For incorporating non-canonical amino acids into a protein, an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair is needed, that does not crossreact with the cognate tRNA/synthetase pairs. This tRNA can be assembled with a variety of synthetases into a plasmid to incorporate ncAA in E. coli in response to an amber stop codon. This tRNA derives from the wild type tyrosyl Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair. It was proven to not crossreact with the cognate E. coli tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA is used together with a tRNA synthetase. It has been proven to work with various synthetases for incorporation of ncAA by iGEM Team Austin Texas 2014

Vanderbilt,2015,Team:Vanderbilt#Project#Nanopore_-_-_TEXT.html," distinguished on the basis of blockade duration[ 12 ].
A great number of refinements have since been made to this method, including the modulation of chamber environment, translocation speed (via rate-limiting motor activity [ 13 ]), and nanopore synthesis. One of the standout products of these efforts is Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ minION, a 500 channel nanopore sequencer that was first distributed to alpha testers in 2014. The device uses a channel / motor protein arrangement (likely MspA and phi-29 polymerase) to generate electrical data from transversing ssNA that is later translated into a sequence. Vanderbilt iGEM has had the incredible opportunity to conduct preliminary testing with the minION, and moving forward we hope to use nanopore sequencing to detect and quantify modified base signatures in mutagenized DNA samples.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," an era that information technology develops rapidly, the interaction between person and person is still very important.  Owing to this, we decide to make a poll and ask them people questions. During this activity, we met different kinds of people, and most of them were curious about our project and its procedure, some of them even asked whether this product will go public or not. 
What impressed us the most is that we met our seniors when he was giving out free hugs. He gave each of us a hug, which is an encouragement to us. The mutual aid like this is the value that we want to put stress on and convey. Although there were some people who didn’t coordinate, instead of feeling upset, we remained optimistic and searched for another subject. In the end, we got nearly a hundred opinions on our project. This not only made our data more detailed, but also gave us the power to move forward.
 
 
We choose Taichung Train Station, National Science Museum, CMP block museum of arts, Taichung City Hall, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, Maple Garden, and National Taichung Theater to make the poll.

S&T month
S&T Month is a tech activity hold by Mingdao annually. In the period time of five weeks, teachers and students trained in Physics, Chemical, Earth science, Biology and iGEM lead the other students to have an inside look into the world of science. 2017 Mingdao Team arranged two days of experiment and one day of a lecture. It is because iGEM still remains unfamiliar to them that the registration is quite enthusiastic. Such an optimistic start it is our campaign on iGEM has.  
The first experiment is plasmid DNA extraction. After explaining the concept of it, we divided them into six groups, and chose a leader from our team members for every group. Most of the students had never used pipette before, which made them tense but eager to try. After all, what we students usually use are always droppers, beakers…and so on. 
  During the experiment day, we showed them our newly-opened-up lab and had them take turn operating at the same time. They all felt it cool and funny to extract the plasmid, and showed more interest in the experiment, electrophoresis, the next day. Not only did they ask questions enthusiastically"

Patrick and I have proposed an smaller dry run for the DIYFest coming up in October. We'll need input from Miles to see if this might be doable, in conjunction with the Harford Hackerspace contingent.
Ryan, Tom and Bernadette discussed the BioSafety Review Board and the questions iGEM has presented us with in this self-audit. Ryan also brought up his recent enrollment in ABSA and invitation to this years conference in Denver at the tail of September, suggesting it may be a perfect opportunity to show our level of commitment to proceeding cautiously and in good measure. He also reminded folks of the Public Presidential Summit on BioEthics in two weeks on the 13th & 14th in Philadelphia, to see if anyone might be interested in going.
We're awaiting permission from CCBC and TU public affairs officials still to find out whether we're clear to have the documentary folks from Germany here at the end of October that will be following us in our last few weeks up to the jamboree at MIT. Another intriguing development in media exposure.
We will continue to schedule Strategy Nights from 8-10 on Mondays at the CCBC lab (room d206) and will have workbench hours in the lab on Mondays from 12 - 5pm, as well as Tuesdays from 1 - 5pm, for those of you whom might be able to join us to work on your technique and get some of this out of the way. With this in mind, we need to keep our workflow in mind to make certain our projects will be at state that can be put away for a few days when we walk out on tuesday afternoon, since Tom's schedule is booked up with active classes throughout the week. We need to keep this in mind in regards to the equipment and supplies we're using as well, since the novices will be playing on off-hours.

Figure 2: A traditional antibody
We find it important to consider the cost, effectiveness and not at least the ethics that are connected to the use of animal cells. The effectiveness of antibodies is high, however, so is the cost. Despite strict control and legislation in Denmark regarding animal conditions, an alternative to laboratory animals will always be preferable. Furthermore  the decade long search for alternatives to animals in research implies that scientists also find the existing method  controversial. Read our page Animal Ethics for more information about this.
Peptide aptamers are molecules consisting of a scaffold protein with a variable loop ( Figure 1 ), which make them perfect in the search for an alternative to traditional antibodies ( Figure 2 ). The variable part can function as the heavy and light chains of an antibody, in which the variable loop functions as the antigen binding region.    By manipulating Escherichia coli into producing peptide aptamers many of the drawbacks by using mammalian cells will be minimized. Read more at The Alternative .

Silver medal criterion Questionaries
• Investigation about genetic engineering
During the Techfest, we did a profound investigation concerning about genetic engineering and public perference between cell-containing diagnosis system and cell-free system.With the development of China, since reform and open, the past forty years has witnessed great improvement of people’s living standard. However,people’s knowledge and ideologies about genetic engineerng develops not as fast as the growth of economy.
Therefore, we designed a detailed and comprehensive investigation about public perception about synthetic biology, genetic engineering and people’s perference between cell-containing diagnosis system and cell-free system. Surveys includes basic knowledge such as “Do you think hybrid rice is transgene plants?” and detailed questionnaire about “what’s your main worry about genetically-modified organism and biological products?”This questionnaire gives us some important considerations and adjustments to our project.
Click here to unfold the detailed information
Questions about basic biological knowledge help us distinguish the target population possessing basic biological knowledge.
The high ratio of correct answer shows their knowledge is convenient for our investigation and their opinions are also relatively referable for us. And then we choose our target population to continue our questionnaires.
The deficiency of concept about Synthetic Biology shows importance and necessity of the Techfest, one of our education and public engagement activities. Therefore, we followed up with a question concerns about the cell-containing system and the cell-free system.
Confusions and worries are expressed through this question. Here, we see the advantage of cell-free system when biological products meet the public concerns.
To confirm the result of our last question, we keep on asking the public for their preference of a new diagnostic device. So, here again, the advantage of the cell-free diagnostic device shows up. Hence, to get a more detailed feedback from this public engagement, we designed 3 more questions in order to understand what is the exact worrying for public.
Results from this survey can be included as 2 points:
1. Public concerns are in line with mainstream opinions in China which is very conservative. We realized it would be a wise choice for us to develop a cell-free diagnostic device.
2."

As a professor from the Faculty of Medicine, most of her thoughts and concerns were about mammals, such as genetic editing of embryos and in vivo experiments. She also underlined the potential risk of biological weapon, whose effect would be hugely disastrous for the whole society.

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," Cotton and certain vegetables sometimes have stand reductions(17).
Control: Bacillus thuringiensis, a widely available caterpillar-killing bacterium,is a very effective control for climbing cutworms as well as for the surface feeders(18).
Lymantria dispar
Spread: It has a range which covers Europe, Africa, and North America(19).
Characteristics:Gypsy moth caterpillars change appearance as they grow.  Young caterpillars are black or brown and about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in length.  As they grow, bumps develop along their backs along with coarse, black hairs.  Each of the 11 sections of a developed caterpillar will have two coloured spots, the first five pairs, blue, and the last six, red.  Mature caterpillars can be as long as 2 ½ inches (6.35 cm)(20).
Damage: It is classified as a pest, and its larvae consume the leaves of over 500 species of trees, shrubs and plants. The gypsy moth is one of the most destructive pests of hardwood trees in the eastern United States.he gypsy moth was considered a nuisance just ten years after their release. It included an account of all the trees being defoliated, caterpillars covering houses and sidewalks and that the caterpillars would rain down upon residents. The first outbreak occurred in 1889. An eradication program was begun in 1890.
Control: Tanglefoot Pest Barrier or Sticky Tree Bands can be placed around tree trunks to help curtail the caterpillars movement into and out of the tree canopy. Apply Bacillus thuringiensis, var. kurstaki or Monterey Garden Insect Spray (Spinosad) to the leaves of trees to kill gypsy moth caterpillars(21).
Statherotis leucaspis Meyrick
Spread: The obliquebanded leafroller (OBLR) is native to and widely distributed throughout temperate North America(22).
Characteristics: hatched larvae have a yellowish green body and a black head and thoracic shield. Mature larvae  are 20 to 25 mm in length and the head and thoracic shield may be either black or various shades of brown(23).
Damage: Leafrollers, the larvae of certain tortricid moths, often feed and pupate within the protection of rolled-up leaves. Several species can cause problems on fruit and ornamental trees in California. The fruittree leafroller, Archips argyrospila, is the most common leafroller pest in landscapes"

Background
1.About WeChat
One of iGEM’s ambitions is to provide a platform where world-wide iGEMers can share their projects, exchange experiment results and promote the fundamental concepts of synthetic Biology. It came to us that if we can combine social network APPs with iGEM community, there will be a great social impact on enormous iGEMers as well as bio-lovers. Therefore, considering the growing demand of iGEM community in China, we chose WeChat, the most popular social network APP with over 600,000,000 users around the world, as the platform of our project.
2.Motivation
We have been dreaming of developing a tool that helps iGEMers save time when conducting experiments, or make the best of their spare time to finish trivial works before the experiments. What if a fantastic idea hit an iGEMer when he/she is waiting at the bus stop, but he/she can’t find the relevant bio-bricks immediately, which leads to the lost of a great idea? What if an iGEMer finds it annoying or troublesome to add prefixes and suffixes for a large amount of bio-bricks? We are here to tackle this issue.
3.WEiGEM1.0
WEiGEM 1.0 is a public platform that includes bio-bricks searching and article pushing service. Users can search for bio-bricks by looking through the category. The article pushing，service contains latest news on advanced science and academic researches, including synthetic biology, life technology and brief introduction on previous iGEM projects.
Project Description
1.Bio-brick searching engine
Brief  Introduction:
Bio-brick plays a crucial role in the field of synthetic biology; hence the core of WEiGEM is bio-brick. We further developed WEiGEM2.0 based on the popular WEiGEM1.0. Through WeChat, we establish a strong connection among iGEMers, mobile phone, and personal computer. Suffered by the low-efficiency bio-brick searching engines, we came up with the idea of developing a newer, more unique and more efficient searching engine based on the large bio-brick database from iGEM website. We picked several important attributions such as functions, types, status, etc. and assembled them in one search page, allowing users to"

Our Approach
Cornell iGEM’s multifaceted approach to tackling bovine mastitis is innovative and unique. In order to facilitate the development of our novel ideas, we have spent each stage of our project visiting and interacting with experts in the field, making decisions carefully with the feedback of current dairy farmers in mind. We approached the project with human-centered design in three stages [1]. First, inspiration. We derived our ideas from what was needed in the mastitis industry. Next, ideation. We sketched out prototypes and brought them to the farmer. And finally, implementation. We created our product. And at this stage, we knew that what we had created would be useful, because it was, in essence, the farmer, who had directed us throughout the process. Check out our continued discussion on cost, safety, and legality here.

[April - May]
QUESTION: What is the biggest problem facing the dairy industry? FINDINGS: There needs to be better methods for detection and prevention of bovine mastitis.
April 28, 2016
ProDAIRY
Cooperstown, NY
We began our journey by speaking with Caroline Potter and Rob Lynch from ProDAIRY , a dairy educational organization in New York. We discovered that cows infected with mastitis have to be taken out of the milking process and are treated with antibiotics in quarantine. Even after a cow is cured, they have to be withheld from milking for several more days until all traces of antibiotics have left the milk. The treatment process and loss of milk is costly and Caroline and Rob emphasized the pervasiveness of bovine mastitis in the dairy industry.

6/19/13
Results from 6/17/2013 - We found that our T1 stock is at a very low titer. We only saw clearage on our spot test at 10^-3. There will have to be a lot done to grow it up to a high titer.
Our agarose test worked very well. There were no visible plaques on 0.8% agarose, and the plaques increased in size down to 0.15% agarose. Our titer was too high, because at 0.075% we got web plates and couldn't accurately measure the diameter of the plaques. We had no trouble getting the agarose to solidify at .075%
On 6/18/2013, we repeated the lower level of the agarose test by testing .15%, .1%, .075%, .055%, .035%, and .015%. We want to know the lowest concentration at which agarose will still solidify and show us visible plaque diameters which we can measure. When we see small mutant plaques at this low level of agarose concentration, we will know that they are larger-than-normal phage.
We also infected a plate with 10uL of 10^-3 T1 phage to see if it made a web, plaques, or cleared.

6/24/13
Today we did a titer on the ""M2"" phage (The second round of mutagenesis)
6/26/13
Results for the M2 titer. Plaques go down to 10^-5 (about 6 plaques) So our concentration is somewhere between 10^-5 and 10^-6.
Today we were going to start mutagenesis again, but it looks like out E.coli needs to be streaked out again, we're planning to start the whole procedure again tomorrow with an overnight culture of e.coli B plus adenine. Once the bacteria is grown we will centrifuge it and resuspend it to a concentration of 10.5x10^8 cells/mL in M9+ medium with the addition of 20 ug of both uracil and adenine as well as the mutagen 5' deoxybromouridine. We will then resuspend the mixture in separate tubes and add 2x 10^9 of our T4 Do stock. Then we'll aerate at 37C until clearing with 1 mL of chloroform.

Experimental Procedure - Silyl-Aniline Synthesis
All steps were carried out under an Argon atmosphere, with flame-dried glassware and with dried and degassed solvents.  p-Bromoaniline (1 eq.), triethylamine (2 eq.) and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (0.1 eq.) were stirred in dichlormethane for 30 min. 1,2-Bis(chlorodimethylsilyl)ethane (1.3 eq) were added within 10 min. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 40 °C. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure an the residue was extracted three times with ether. The ether extract was filtered over dried Celite and the solvent was changed to tetrahydrofurane. The solution was cooled to -78 °C and tert-butyllithium (1.5 eq.) was added within 15 min. After stirring for 2 h at -78 °C chlorodimethylsilane (1.5 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature over night. Ether was added and the mixture was filtered over a mixture of Celite and Alox (1:1). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified via silica column chromatography (EE:PE 1:7) after resting on the silica column for 20 min to deprotect the amino group. The pure product was obtained.
Isolation and purification of synthesized Product
After shaking for 20 hours, the reaction is split in four 2 ml tubes and mixed with 600 µl of ethyl acetate. Vortexing for 30 seconds and centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 7 min leads to phase separation of aqueous and organic layers. The organic layer is taken off and placed in a new glass vial. Two additional washing and separation steps were conducted and organic layer is always taken off. The combined organic solution is then purified via silica column chromatography and analyzed via gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy.
Preparation of whole-cell Biocatalyst
Main culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm and pellet was resuspended in M9-N buffer to a final OD600 of 15. Aliquots were prepared and frozen until further use.

Public Engagement
As a project competing in the foundational advance track, we faced                     difficulties in our efforts to properly communicate our work. We contacted                     Asterios Arampatzis, Team Leader of iGEM Greece 2017, in order to gain some                     insight about the problems they may have met and dealt with, regarding the                     communication of Synthetic Biology and their project to the world. He                     shared with us his experience, stating that synthetic biology is nearly                     absent from our country, as the public has not been properly informed and                     there are not many researchers in the field.
This year, we wanted to make sure that the iGEM Foundation, and synthetic                     biology in general, would come in attention of a larger audience. We aimed                     to inform people of various ages, scientific backgrounds and nationalities                     about this new and exciting, yet relatively unknown in our country,                     scientific field, raise awareness about genetic engineering, discuss about                     the important ethical issues that come up with synthetic biology’s constant                     growth and receive valuable feedback for our project’s application and                     importance to the world.
We organized numerous activities, differentiating our approach depending on                     the audience. In order to familiarize them with synthetic biology we                     presented several iGEM projects from previous years that we believed,                     demonstrate that synthetic biology can prove beneficial in real world                     problems. We, also, wanted to communicate our project, so wee could gain                     some feedback and understand the public’s reception of it.
Finally, taking into consideration public’s feedback, we wanted to address                     the issue of science communication to the public. So, the highlight of                         our                         activities this year was the organization of the “SynBalkans                         Tour”, an                     educational effort in order to broaden the knowledge about synthetic                     biology in the Balkan Region, considering the different cultural and                     scientific background of the audience.
Motivation
The highlight of our public engagement efforts was the                                     organization of the “SynBalkans Tour”, a series of                                     events                                     dedicated to science communication across the Balkan                                     region.                                     Through this tour, our goal was to form a lasting                                         scientific cooperation between institutes in the Balkan Peninsula and                                     provide students with the opportunity to get acquainted                                     with a                                     novel scientific branch, synthetic biology.
Before the event
Before going on tour, we wanted to make sure that we would                                     be                                     able to engage people with different cultural and                                     scientific                                     backgrounds. We came in contact with professors and                                     students                                     from the Department of Balkan Slavic and Oriental                                         Studies,"

Isolation and Characterization of Endophytic Bacteria
Our team isolated and characterized 39 strains of endophytic bacteria harbored in the roots of the wild grass Arrhenatherum elatius and the cultivated bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). These strains were evaluated for resistance to chloramphenicol and streptomycin using the Kirby-Bauer test (Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant). Additionally, strains were tested for ACC utilization by plating on DF-ACC agar plates. We measured strain growth rates, with OD600 10X dilution after 18 hrs incubation at 30°C. Risk group was determined based on classification by 16S amplification and sequencing.

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
August 19, 2017
Newcastle University has an excellent school of Language, Communication and Education Sciences, with loads of fantastic staff working in applied linguistics. I’ve been fortunate enough to speak with Dr Spencer Hazel, a Senior Lecturer in Applied Linguistics & Communication. Dr Hazel had loads of different advice about his experiences of science communication, and made me think about aspects that had never come to my mind!
Science and the Media
I was really eager to speak to Spencer about his British Science Association Media Fellowship. With the support of the British Science Association, Spencer spent a month in 2016 working as a science writer for the Times. By hearing about this first-hand experience of working in science journalism, I learnt about the process involved in publishing a story about science, which I was pretty ignorant to beforehand.
I was surprised to learn that the science department at the Times was made up of only two main people, neither of which has a background specifically in a science based subject. When writing, information is first received in the form of a press release– the key points condensed into a summary. The job of a science journalist is to then turn this into an interesting, engaging story that people want to read! Spencer talked about using a structure that people will follow being key to science communication- make sure your writing answers questions in a logical order… Who did it? What did they do? Why does it matter?
Multimedia Inspiration
Talking with Spencer was also really useful for making me aware off all the different methods we can, and should, use for engaging the public with science- not just written communication. Events such as the British Science Festival are great for more interactive engagement, were people can see how science is impacting their world in a more physical environment. As the Newcastle University iGEM team, made use of this interactive inspiration when we visited the Big Bang fair.
I also really enjoyed seeing a video of Dr Mark Lewney performing a version of Bohemian Rhapsody, with his own lyrics that taught the audience about physics.  By communicating in a fun way, that lots of people can relate to, an audience which may before have been disengaged can be reached.

Figure 21: Activity assay to determine the substrate saturation with ABTS as a substrate. Measurements were done with 616 ng BPUL in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C. ABTS concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM to 5 mM.
Figure 22: Activity assay to determine the substrate saturation with ABTS as a substrate. Measurements were done with 308 ng BPUL in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C. ABTS concentrations ranged from 5 mM to 8 mM. An ABTS concentration of 5 mM was determined as substrate saturation.
Since Regionals: BPUL pH optimum
Figure 23: Microtiter plate of the measurements for pH optimum determination. The more intensive the blue color the more ABTS got oxidized. At pH 5 and pH 4 the darkest colour has been reached.
The pH of the medium containing the enzyme is of high importance for its activity. The pH optima of BPUL are pH 4 and pH 5. This is the result of activity measurements using Britton-Robinson buffer with differently adjusted pHs. BPUL was re-buffered into H2O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2. The range from pH 4 to pH 9 was tested under substrate saturation at 25 °C for 30 minutes. At pH 4 and pH 5 ABTS got oxidized the fastest (see Fig. 23 and Fig. 24). At higher pHs than pH 5, the activity of BPUL was decreased considerably. The resulting Units mg-1 support the observed data (see Fig. 25). At pH 4 and pH 5 BPUL showed a specific enzyme activity of ~37 U mg-1. The higher the pH, the less U mg-1 could be calculated for BPUL. At pH 7 1/3 of the activity decreased, but still BPUL was active at this pH allowing an application of this laccase in a waste water treatment plant where the average pH is a pH of 6.9.

Bioethics
We designed our project in accordance with the ethical principles identified by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010). Our primary motive is public beneficence: to improve global public health by monitoring the safety of drinking water. We have also demonstrated responsible stewardship by considering the environmental implications of our project; the ecological impact of placing our genetically modified strain in water would be minimal because our filtration system will not allow bacteria to escape. S. oneidensis MR-1 is native to North America and poses no known threat to biodiversity or humans; however, before field testing, we would engineer our strains to be auxotrophic. We have spoken directly with Environment Canada representatives who confirmed our recombinant S. oneidensis-based biosensor is easily approvable for field deployment.
In addition, the electrochemical biosensor is an intellectually responsible pursuit: our project cannot foreseeably be used to cause people harm. In the spirit of democratic deliberation, the human practices component of our team seeks to account for others’ ethical concerns about our project. We have begun consulting with local citizens as well as public authorities in order to fully understand the possible impacts of our project. Our proposed system would be easy, cost-effective, and potentially usable on a global scale, demonstrating justice and fairness in its intended implementation. Additionally, the modularity of our biosensing platform allows it to be adapted to the needs of different communities, in order to best serve global populations and environments.

Conversation with Concretos Modernos del Sur
We shared our results with the cement factory. They told us monitoring compounds from pesticides can be really difficult due to the analysis needed and the treatment of the samples. They emphasised that it was imperative to find a new way to detect the presence of these compounds, in order to act upon the problem. Fernando Ochoa and Alejandro Escanero showed us a geomembrane that they use in their constructions, this can be used to delimit the zones that can be potentially polluted by the runoff of pollutants.

Final thoughts
The Journey gave us a real approach to the issue. We got to talk to villagers, experts, workers, and children about this issue. We identified the need to transition to more sustainable models that will be consistent with human rights, in order to ensure a future where agricultural production does not threaten our social, cultural and physical well-being. This requires an innovative way of tracking. With the implementation of our system, E. coding, we could have reached deeper depths and more extreme conditions, in order to obtain reliable results.
We attempt to use E. coding in a environmental application, but E. coding can be so much more than that. An important shift is underway, not only in how we can detect compounds but how we store this information.
Water Samples From The World
We want to thank the teams who shared with us the concentrations of different pollutants in their homes. Our main purpose is to create awareness of the unsafe use of pesticides and exposure to pollutants, in order to build a future where our economic activities do not threaten human rights and the health of vulnerable groups.

From the plates made in step 6, we selected more large and small plaques. We followed the same procedure as step 7 in the selection process, except we only made a -2 dilution. In total, we had 21 plaques that looked really large and 10 plaques that looked really small.
V) Results
2) Applying the mutagen
The OD reading was 0.435A, which indicates there are 2.175E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 2.175E9 bacteria per tube.
3) Cesium Chloride Gradients
The cesium chloride gradient didn't have a visible band. Therefore, we will rely on spot tests of the gradient to determine where the phage are located.
4) Spot Test of Gradient Samples
For the 2nd gradient, which selects for small phage, 11 tubes went to -4, while tubes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 only went to -2. This tells us that our mutant phage are probably in tubes 2-5.
For the 3rd gradient, which selects for large phage, 12 tubes went to -4, while tubes 5, 6, and 7 only went to -2. This tells us that our mutant phage are probably in tubes 10-15.
5) Plating to Check for Plaque Size
These are the plates that we selected plaques from:
6) Plating to Check for Plaque Size 2
These are the plates that we selected plaques from:
7) Checking for Plaque Viability from Step 5
We couldn't tell if plaque size was held constant from the plaques we picked because we had used different types of plates and different concentrations of top agar.
8) Checking for Plaque Viability 2
One small phage plate had considerably larger plaques than wild type phage. Another large phage plate had much smaller plaques than the wild type phage. The plaques were also about the same size as the plaques the phages were picked from, showing that the phage maintained their phenotype of forming large plaques.
T7 Wild type: Average plaque diameter of 0.388cm +/- 0.0997cm

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," goes around the DNA in circles it produces long strands of RNA molecules. Within those long molecules were the repeating small units of microRNA. They coined this method Rolling Circle Transcription (RCT).
Following this discovery, we have figured out we can apply RCT in order to fix the current fundamental issues with biomolecule expression from single DNA templates in the field of droplet microtechnologies. As we are already circularizing DNA molecules in order to perform the MDA reaction in later steps, all that is left to do is to remove the transcription terminator from the catalytic biomolecule library members. Such removal of the terminator highly increases the mRNA concentration from a single template. Therefore, enzymes can then be efficiently synthesized using a single template of DNA.
2. Cells: catalytic biomolecules can also be provided into droplets in the form of cells, which have the DNA library transformed into them (one library variant per cell on average). In turn, the cells may produce the protein of interest. After cells are encapsulated into droplets, cell-specific reagents can lyse the cells. After the cell lysis, an enzyme of interest is released into the droplet together with DNA molecules that encoded it.
Proof of concept
After the esterase mutant DNA library and Substrate Nucleotides are encapsulated together with protein expression reagents the droplets are incubated in order for protein expression to occur.
4. Catalysis of Substrate Conversion
General description
At this stage, each droplet contains produced catalytic biomolecules. These catalytic biomolecules can now act on Substrate Nucleotides. After the chain of catalyzed chemical reactions is over, some of the nucleotides have their substrates removed - they are now Product Nucleotides. Depending on the catalytic biomolecule activity in each droplet, there can be a different amount of product nucleotides depending on the activity of the biomolecule variant.
Proof of concept
In each droplet esterase mutants are synthesized. Depending on their activities, they will remove different amount of substrates from the Substrate Cytidines in different droplets.
Does the design choice of removing substrate  limit the different class of biomolecules we can analyse?
Not at all! CAT-Seq allows to screen biomolecules catalyzing numerous of distinct reactions. Please head to the Substrate Nucleotide design page for more information and examples!

DESCRIPTION
Background Information
This year our team has decided to focus on increasing the speed and overall efficiency of blood coagulation in medium to large sized wounds. Although there are other products currently available in the market to increase the rate of blood coagulation, such as Quikclot (Z-Medica, 2014), or VetiGel (Bloomberg, 2014), our product is significantly different from these. Our product, called “Coagu.coli”, is based on using a component from the snake venom of the Desert Horned Viper (Cerastes cerastes).
Certain components of snake venoms are able to bypass several steps of the blood clotting cascade, therefore increasing the speed of blood clotting (Braud, 2000; Castro, Zingali, Albuquerque, Pujol-Luz, & Rodrigues, 2004).
The component we are utilizing is Cerastotin and this is a serine protease that has thrombin like properties. What sets Cerastotin apart from other serine proteases is that it is easy to express and small enough to be used in our construct. Thrombin is an enzyme that causes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which leads to the formation of a clot (Smith, 1980; Wolberg, 2007). By using Cerastotin in our construct, we are therefore able to greatly increase the efficiency and speed of blood coagulation.
Our product would be applied by a syringe containing our construct followed by a bandage for sealing it in place, and could be used in a variety of situations. Because our product would be produced in E.Coli, it would be highly affordable as a great amount can be expressed in a short period of time. The military, hospitals, and the average person would find our product invaluable. Coagu.coli has the power to prevent death by severe blood loss by giving a person enough time to receive further medical attention.
