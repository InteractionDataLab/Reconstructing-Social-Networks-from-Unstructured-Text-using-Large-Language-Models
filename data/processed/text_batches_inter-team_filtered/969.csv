A3 - A8: 0.1 Starting Sample Dilutions for Positive Controls (in triplicate per culture, 6 total dilutions)
B3 - B8: 0.1 Starting Samples Dilutions for Negative Controls (in triplicate per culture, 6 total dilutions)
Each well should have 200 μL.
Step 2: Dilution Series Instructions
We made the following serial dilutions for the triplicate Starting Samples you prepared in Step 1. We should have 12 total Starting Samples - 6 for your Positive Controls and 6 for your Negative Controls.
For each Starting Sample :
3 LB Agar + Cam plates (36 total) is needed.
Prepare three 2.0 mL tubes (36 total) with 1900 μL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 1, 2, and 3.
Prepare two 1.5 mL tubes (24 total) with 900 μL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 4 and 5.
Label each tube for each Starting Sample.
Pipet 100 μL of Starting Culture into Dilution 1. Discard tip. Do not pipette up and down.
Vortex tube for 5-10 secs.
Repeat Step 5 for each dilution through to Dilution 5.
Aseptically spead plate 100 μL on LB + Cam plates for Dilutions 3, 4, and 5.
Incubate at 37°C overnight and count colonies after 18-20 hours of growth.
Step 3: CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions
Based on the assumption that 1 bacterial cell gives rise to 1 colony, colony forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture can be calculated as follows:
Count the colonies on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies.
Multiple the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate.
Results and Discussion
OD600 reference point
The four replicates of LUDOX and ddH2O give reproducible results. We therefore obtain OD600/Abs600=3,679.
Particle Standard Curve
To obtain better results, we did not take the most concentrated point into account.                       On both linear and log scale, we observe that the values form a straight line.                       Discrepancies between the replicates can be explained by the fact that the light beam of the Tecan machine does not always pass by the same point of each well. Beside, we observed water vapor on the well plate cap,"

“Imagine a world where natural rubber is produced by gene manipulated bacteria that can facilitate the polymerization of rubber. Perhaps inside silos that can be placed underground  or in environments unusable for agriculture.”
- iGEM SDU 2013
The new and bright future.
Bacterial growth is limited only by its micro-environment. They do not need to grow on certain natural grounds with a distinct climate, but can easily be grown in industrial facilities. Scaling the production system from the wet lab of the university grounds to a production plant poses challenges, but looking beyond these, possibilities appear.
The newly established innovative production plants will not require a vast amount of time before production can commence. Bacteria only needs a matter of hours before they are able to produce, in contrast to the 7 years of maturation of the rubber tree. Furthermore , they will not need the vast areas required for plantations. The facilities can be placed on infertile land, saving the rainforest and liberating arable lands suitable for high-yielding agriculture.
It is easy to imagine a system where the rubber bacteria can feed on leftovers from earlier batches of standard LB medium."

Project
The aim of this proyect is to engineer a bio-digital clock as a proof-of-concept project dealing with the integration of biological and electronic circuits. We plan to modify the circadian clock Kai protein system of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus1 by hooking it to the AHL-producing half of the Lux quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischerii. The sensing portion of the Lux system will reside in modified Shewanella oneidensis, engineered to produce changes in its electrical resistance in response to changing levels of AHL using this species's control of cytochrome production2. Both the circadian clock of S. elongatus and the electrical regulation of S. oneidensis have been worked on separately by previous iGEM teams, however, we shall improve on them by incorporating feedback control systems to reduce their response time and noise, including an enzyme that degrades AHL that activates when the system is “turned off” . Finally, another key component of our project is the design and construction of the eletcronic hardware necessary to measure S. oneidensis's changes in electrical conductance and act as an interface between this biological circuit and any electronic circuit it is to be coupled with, in this example, a digital clock.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#test#max#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate, fuelled by sunlight. For E. Coli , on the contrary, you needs to grow sugar crops, harvest them, and extract the glucose as a carbon source to grow. Taking the whole process into consideration, cyanobacteria will yield more fumarate per CO 2 . Exploring other options such as these could provide an efficient and possibly cost-effective way to produce the fumarate that would lower methane emissions in cattle.
Conclusions
From this pleasant collaboration, we can conclude that adding fumarate to cattle feed remains a promising strategy to reduce methane emissions, although some hurdles have yet to be taken. Some studies report conflicting results about the effect of the addition of fumarate to cattle feed on methane production. Thereby, the absence of oxygen in cattle rumen opposes challenges for the growth of photoautotrophic organisms and oxidative growth of heterotrophic organisms.
On top of that, the exact yields of the strains developed by iGEM team Amsterdam and the proposed E. Coli mutant in this paper have yet to be defined. Nevertheless, as shown by the UNL iGEM team, methane emissions pose an enormous problem to our world, that need interdisciplinary teams to come up with out of the box-solutions such as these.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," this is mind, George went back to Hornsey UTI clinic to speak with Dr. Sheela Swamy and Professor Malone-Lee, the consultant clinician as well as the principal investigator of the laboratory associated with the clinic. He gave the following data in terms of the percentage of patients’ infections caused by hospital equipment:
10-20% have been catheterised
~50% are postoperative
>70% are at the clinic with an infection that began soon after a hospital visit, which suggests that infection is likely to have been caused by hospital equipment
The Professor’s feedback on our project was extremely positive. “Biofilms have a profound effect on antibiotic resistance and so bacteria that can penetrate through biofilms strikes me as a very sensible project direction.”
Dr. Sheela Swamy, Hornsey UTI clinic, said:
“We get through so many buckets of antibiotics here, if your product could prevent infections or reduce our reliance on those antibiotics that is hugely appealing as a practitioner.”
“It will be really great if we actually have bacteria engineered to achieve biofilm and cellular penetration and a bactericidal effect will be a total seller. That may be the answer to the Chronic UTI if we can get it to work.”
The doctors at the UTI clinic left us with a few points to bear in mind as we are currently focused on only killing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
The bladder biome is complex with many culturable and nonculturable pathogens. What role each of these have and what concentration they need to be in to cause UTI symptoms is unknown.
Uropathogens listed in literature are not the only organisms responsible for UTI as they are also present in normal controls yet don't cause symptoms.
Bacteria are opportunistic and a skin commensal if in the bladder can cause symptoms, and we have had many women with pyuric UTIs even though they only grew a Staphylococcus so you may have to try develop something that works on a wide spectrum of bacteria.
Increasing Awareness
In an attempt to improve the general public's understanding of Synthetic Biology, we used a variety of approaches. We thought we could help certain members of audience, who represent the 6% of pessimists we found in an earlier survey, to fully understand the concepts of genetic engineering, and realise the incredible gains that can be made from projects like ours in the field of synthetic biology.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2"

--------------------------------------------------
Came in today to find that all transformations were successful!  All four plates had yeast colonies, which appeared red to the naked eye.  This might be good, except that one cannot determine at the present time whether the red appearance stems from the production of mCherry or from another biochemical process (Richard Bennett mentioned that the W303 strain natrually turns red in the absence of adenine).  If the former, this would be bad, as it would indicate an issue with either our media, our strain, or leakiness in our promoters.  Looked at plates under fluorescent microscope.  Note that there is a distinction between the number of visible colonies in brightfield and those seen in either yellow or green filter (for RFP and YFP, respectively).  RFP and YFP fluorescence was observed for the null repressor (Z0411).  For this part, one would expect to see YFP because it is under control of a constitutively active promoter.  The YFP fluorescence was significantly less pronounced for the activators, which is also according to expectations.  Should remember to take pictures of the fluorescence later in the week.  However, note that there was significant red fluorescence in all colonies, which is against our expectations seeing as the plates had a fair amount of methionine"

With these experiments we have been able to demonstrate that both FRED and OSCAR are functional and can work on their respective applications even in the context of a large scale!  By listening to professionals and bringing an informed design to our project we have been able to provide systems with real world applications.  FRED can detect compounds in tailings ponds and we have been able to scale up and optimize OSCAR through our bioreactor and flux balance analysis work.  Additionally, we have connected our projects together by providing a double kill switch system with both an auxotroph and inducible exonuclease system that increases the production of hydrocarbons in OSCAR!  With these systems in place and a clear concept of the value of what our project has to offer, we look forward to seeing what the future holds for FRED and OSCAR!

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html," lambda phage injects its genome into the host cell. In the environment of the host, the linear DNA circularizes at the so called cos sites: these are 12 bp complementary overhangs at the ends of the genome.
As temperate phages, lambda phages are able to undergo either a lytic or a lysogenic cycle. When undergoing a lysogenic cycle, the phage integrates its genome into the host genome and stays there as a stable prophage. In this state it will be replicated passively with the host genome. It will not lyse the cell and multiply without an external trigger – for example if the host cell is stressed by DNA damage.  If carrying out a lytic cycle, the lambda phage also injects its genome into the host cell. This will then be replicated autonomously, viral proteins will be produced, first for the  formation of new phage particles, which are formed via self-assembly, and second for the lysis of the host cell, upon which the newly produced phages are released.  The lambda phage has a very complex regulatory network that controls which cycle to carry out.
The default mode of this network is the lytic growth. This is carried out in three steps: 1. After the injection of the genome, transcription starts from the promoters pL and pR. This early transcription has two products - the regulators N and cro - and is attenuated at the terminators tL1 and tR1. Cro acts as a weak repressor for the pL and pR promoters, allows little but steady transcription from these promoters and thereby facilitates the lytic state (because cII concentrations are kept low – see below). N is an antiterminator that enables the RNA polymerase to overcome the tL1 and tR1 terminators and to read the DNA up to the sib and the tR2 terminator, respectively.  2. With the help of N, the delayed early genes are transcribed. The products are the lysogenic regulators cII and cIII as well as the lytic DNA replication functions O and P and the late gene regulator Q.  (N is critical for the switch to the lytic state: cells carrying N on a plasmid and thereby expressing it strongly allow a very effective lytic mode of the phage – they from clear plaques!) 3. An accumulation of Q makes the RNA polymerase resistant to the tR’ terminator and thereby allows expression of the late genes, which are essential for the lytic cycle. They encode for the viral coat proteins and for l"

Safety
""With great power comes great responsibility!"" - Voltaire
The role of a synthetic biologist involves the analysis of the biosafety of the systems designed. Biosafety is the prevention of an accidental or unintentional exposure to pathogens, and to analyze this it is useful to evaluate the risk involved in the project which can be expressed as “Risk= Hazard x Probability”. Source: iGEM, 2013: Safety form Resources. (Link)
Hazard
To evaluate the potential hazardousness of our project, we started by looking at the components of the system. Our main chassis, E.coli K12 MG1655 is a non-pathogen E.coli strain. Source: NIH GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH INVOLVING RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULES. 2013. (Link) Further more, it is weakened and thereby not able to  survive in case of leakage. We have also been working with the Odor Free chassis E.coli YYC912, which is a  modified strain, not able to produce indole. This strain is non-pathogen as well. Source: Genportal, 2006. (Link) Our parts, both basic parts and devices, are all taken from  risk group 1 organisms and therefore do not contain nor mimic any virulence factors. This"

This is an efficient and relatively cheap methods that fits our goal. However, the traditional method needs to be improve if applied in our project.
Improvement required
Figure  6.4.2 The dissolved air flotation process
Actual chemicals is sometime used.
In traditional air floatation, chemicals are frequently use to coagulate the cells. Extensive cell damage and release of intracellular components can occur during floc storage and recycling, downstream of the flocculation process (Sun et al., 2013).
At first, we are afraid that this might cause the salt releasing. However, it will not be a problem as long as release of particles doesn’t occur in the flotation process itself. Further information or lab data needs to be gather in order to verify.
Figure  6.4.3 Visual appearance PCC 6803's rising ability.
Initially mixed cultures of PCC 6803 left under ambient laboratory light (8 6 2 mM) for 24 h (n = 3).
If it does cause trouble, the improvement that chemicals bring to this process should not be considered. Instead, different from usual cell-water separation, the cell species in our project is single, Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC6803. The ability of PCC 6803 to rise to the surface of an open container ,as figure 6.4.3 shows, suggests that flotation strategies can merge with air dissolved flotation well and replace the efficiency the chemical coagulation brings.
Utilization of the bio-mass
The main difference of our project and normal desalination process is the bio-mass. As we discussed in HP- cell-water separation, we are considering stabilizing the cells to make the after process easier. Yet, we also look for a way to make use of cyanobacteria when it is only for single use.
In fact, the utilizing of cyanobacteria has been studied long time before. In 1990s, Japan has already successfully utilized all components of the cyanobacteria, producing 120~180 ton fertilizers and provided profit that cover 30% of its utilizing fees (Hailin,2008). Now, this area includes biofuels, foods and feeds, and fertilizer. The most recent utilizing methods start to focus on extracting important natural components from the cells. The after use of cyanobacteria can be well connected to those area. Even though we are not sure if this may bring other sub products which may raise safety concerns or not, this"

Primary pollutants can further damage by interacting with the environment, such as acid rains and smog, the greenhouse effect and the high ozone levels in the air we breathe (Radovič, 2006).
Figure 3: The amount of toxicity factories and such buildings, using fossil fuels cause. Retrieved from: http://www.eqmagpro.com/china-seen-reaching-peak-carbon-emissions-by-2030-study/
Acid rains introduce plentiful problems for humans, nature and artifacts (EPA). In humans, the NOx and SO2x gases cause or exacerbate respiratory diseases such asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia all of which can be deadly (EPA, 2016). Its harm to nature is through it seeping into the soil to dissolve its nutrients, eroding it (EPA, 2016). Furthermore, it can release aluminum, which prevents trees from getting water (EPA, 2016). Such weakening conditions for trees make them vulnerable to various infections and infestations of insects, damaging forests which compensate some of the harm made by fossil fuels (EPA; EIA, 2016).
Greenhouse gas emissions accelerate global warming by releasing a gas covering the atmosphere are mostly sourced by fossil fuels' combustion in the U.S. (US EPA, 2016). All but agricultural greenhouse gases (which accounted for just 9% of it) were caused by fossil fuels (US EPA, 2016).
Lakes and streams get their share of damage from fossil fuels too (EPA, 2016). Conventionally at a pH of near 6.5, such bodies of water house a colorful variety of aquatic wildlife including phytoplankton, mayflies, rainbow trout, frogs, crayfish and many more (EPA, 2016).
Buildings and objects also get harmed by acidic rains too (EPA, 2016). Acidity in rain water corrode the paint and stone on them; wearing them out, vanishing their value and beauty (EPA, 2016).

FP Reporter
This construct codes for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the lac promoter, which has the catabolite activator protein (CAP) binding site, and the lacI gene under constitutive expression. This reporter is a modified version of BBa_K611016, where we replaced the arabinose-induced promoter of the lacI gene with a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23106). As a result, induction with arabinose is no longer necessary for lacI expression, and we also believe that this constitutive promoter will lead to more consistent expression levels of lacI. For our project, The titratable expression of GFP serves as an indirect reporter for the strength of protein-protein interactions in the Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two-Hybrid (BACTH) system.

IPTG Induced CRIPSRi
>>>>Design
After we clarified the correlation between lacI dosage and its induction efficiency, we furthered the experiments by adding CRISPRi to the system. Instead of sfGFP, the IPTG induction devices with different levels of lacI generator is now going to produce a gRNA that targets the promotor of a constitutive sfGFP generator ( BBa_K2558206 , BBa_K2558207 , BBa_K2558208 ). By adding IPTG, we can induce the transcription of gRNA. Binding with constantly expressed dCas9, gRNA is going to inhibit the expression of sfGFP. We will be able to observe how this process can operate under different levels of lacI expression.
>>>>Results
Figure.5. The effect of varied lacI-LVA ( BBa_C0011 ) promotor strength on IPTG induction of CRISPRi.
The Y axis values are fluorescence per OD600 standardized with fluorescence per OD600 value of each test group at Time=0, IPTG=0 M. The promotors we used are from the Anderson collection: BBa_J23110 for medium expression (orange), BBa_J23114 for weak expression (blue).
In this experiment, the expression of sfGFP was inhibited by IPTG induced CRISPRi system. (Figure.5) Without CRISPRi the Fluorescence/OD600 increased steadily. With medium lacI expression, the addition of IPTG caused the fluorescence intensity to decrease at three hours after addition. With different IPTG concentration the final sfGFP fluorescence intensity remained approximately the same, which is consistent with previous IPTG induction results. However, with weak lacI expression, sfGFP expression was inhibited from the beginning. With the direct IPTG induction experiment we performed before, we hypothesize that with the weak Anderson promotor, basal gRNA expression will be above the threshold that is required for suppressing the sfGFP expression.[1]

equation (27):
<img src = ""
"" height=""45px"" class = ""math"" />
In the case a0 ≧ a× r2, the reaction that occurred is reaction 0.
Now we can run the Gillespie algorithm by following the next steps.(tMAX is the finish time of the simulation.)
1.Initialize the system at t = 0 with initial numbers of molecules for each spices, n0,… ,ns
2.For each j = 0,1,…,r, calculate aj(n) based on the current state n using (20)
3.Calculate the exit rate a(n) = Σ_{j=0}^{r} a</sub>j</sub>(n).
4.Compute a sample tau of the time until the next time using (26)
5.Update the time t = t +τ
6.Compute a sample j of the reaction index using (27)
7.Update the state n according to the reaction j.
8.If t < tMAX, return to Step 2
Stochastic rate constant can be determined by the parameters we used in the deterministic model (if we modeled the reaction in the deterministic model) . If there are a lot of reactant molecules, stochastic simulations have to show similar results as those of deterministic simulations. For this reason, stochastic rate constant, c, can be calculated from the chemical reaction rate constant, k. See [10] if you want to know the deriving process. Here we just write the result.
For a unimolecular reaction, c numerically equals to k, whereas for a bimolecular reaction, c equals to k/NAV if the species of the reactant molecules are different, or 2k/NAV  if they are the same.V is the volume of the system and NA is the Avogadro's constant.
However, these results should not be taken to imply that the mathematical forms of the propensity functions are just heuristic extrapolations. The propensity functions are grounded in molecular physics, and the formulas of deterministic chemical kinetics are approximate consequences of the formulas of stochastic chemical kinetics, not the other way around.
The Gillespie algorithm is so clear and useful that it is often used. However, this algorithm is not suitable for describing transcriptions and translations because they are very slow and complex reactions involving many kinds of reactant molecules.

SEPTEMBER
It was very tight for us to complete the system  testing work, but we overcame it at last with some volunteers in lower grades.  And we edited our subsequent wet lab work into mainly three sections:  Detecting, Recycling and Flocculating(as a benchmark for ourselves about future  application). In addition to continue testing our constructed system, we also  completed the parts shipping this month. We submitted four unique parts.

Besides, thanks to our web designer, our logo and slogan were born on the end of this month, followed by our self-designed long-sleeved shirts.
OCTOBER
Time’s fleeting. On the basis of seven months work, we are finally able to do the subsequent work. This month, we were busy creating and sharing the description of our team's project using the iGEM wiki. And just like the progress from a script to a movie, our wiki changed from one edition to another.
Creating poster was another big job in this month so that we would be prepared to communicate our project with others in a very concise, yet engaging manner just like the official website of iGEM required.
This will be our debute in the iGEM competition, also in the Giant Jamboree. We absolutely expect our best performance in Boston. So the last job is to get fully prepared for the presentation in the Giant Jamboree . We employ our spare time for practicing our oral English. We wish to present our project to all of you and most importantly, to share our conceptions for a better future.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#modeling Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"(3) When pH is around 5.0, p-asr promoter is induced and leads production of Flp, which starts to change the direction of J23119 to alkali production. However, J23119 will not activate downstream functional gene when being inverted, thus, the inverting process causes a time lapse in alkali production. Meanwhile, although the concentration of J23119 toward acid production is decreasing, there are still parts of J23119 functioning. Accordingly, pH will tend to decrease slightly.
(4) When pH is lower than 5.0, after the time lapse, alkali production is activated, and production of Flp is led by P-asr promoter.
(5) When pH returns to the range of 5.0 to 7.0, p-asr promoter is repressed, and J23119 keeps conducting acid production.
(6) When pH increases and reaches around 7.0, p-atp2 is induced again, and the system will go through a time lapse similar to step (3). pH level keeps raising higher than 7.0.
(7) When pH is higher than 7.0, after time lapse in step (6), acid production is activated again, while production of Cre is controlled by P-atp2 promoter. The latter processes are similar to step (1).
Basing on processes above, the reaction equations are described as followed:

Our results show that with the application of Cre/Flp regulation circuit, pH Controller could achieve automatic switch in acid and alkali devices and stabilize environmental pH level. (Fig.8)

Collaborations
This year, our program held tight to the ethos of collaborations. In the very beginning stage of brainstorming, we exchanged ideas with Team BITChina2017 about building biosensor in modified pheromone pathway in yeast, and obtained yeast modified by the team. While Team BIT-China2018 worked on their program this year, we reciprocally offered them help in modeling and data processing. Additionally, we cooperated with team Tsinghua in both stages of experiment and human practice, and hosted exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum in joint hands. We sincerely express our gratitude towards Team BIT-China and Team Tsinghua for their help and its profound assistance to our work.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," factors, so that some essential factors, like amino acids, are present and the chlamydia can use them for their own life cycle.
Daniel C.:
There is not much research on this question?
Dr. Meyer:
Some papers indicate some of these mechanisms, but I think that there will be much more in the future, because we have much more possibilities to analyse these mechanisms. There was a big shift for the research when the Chlamydia trachomatis genome was completely sequenced, it happened in 1998 and it was one of the first genomes, that was completely sequenced. And at that time it was known that the genome contains roughly one thousand different genes and a lot of the genes only have numbers. And it is now the big challenge to analyze what is the function of these genes and how do they interact. 1000 seems like a low number, but itˋs a lot to analyse.
Daniel C.:
Should the awareness of Chlamydia trachomatis be higher in Germany?
Dr. Meyer:
Of course the awareness should be higher. Even among physicians it is still not known everywhere that chlamydia can cause chronic infections and may also be responsible for infertility, for example. And among the general population even young people are not aware of chlamydia. Maybe it has improved a little bit, there are some activities in that direction, but most of the young people going to school, just in the age of 16-20 years don´t know what chlamydia are and what they are doing. Maybe you know the picture in an American STD clinic at the entrance, with a flower and it says: “chlamydia is NOT a tropical flower”.
Daniel C.:
[...] Do you have any tips to be safe from chlamydial infections?
Dr. Meyer:
If you consider chlamydia infections in Europe you have to consider urogenital tract infections and chlamydia are transmitted by sexual contact. So you may say: If you donˋt have any sex, you will not become infected. There are some religious groups that follow this idea, but it is actually not possible to do that for everybody, so the other way is using condoms, that is an effective way of prevention, if condoms are not used the only way is to participate in the screening programs and to regularly test for chlamydia. If chlamydia are detected you can treat them. It is important to treat all partners in parallel or there will be re-infection. So awareness is a very important point. If"

HEK-293T cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292, PKM297)       and light induced SEAP as reporter (PKM084). Single wells were covered with a photo mask       to prevent cell from light exposure using a photo mask for a QR code (made by iGEM Team Aachen 2014).       24 hours after illumination with blue light a SEAP assay was performed leading to colour       changing of wells containing SEAP.

Now a Biobrick can be transformed into a vector v, each component of which represents the value of a property. To meet the two expectations above, we model the measurement as:
where F[i](x) are functions to map each property into interval [0,1] (called mapper) and w[i](v) are preset parameters to balance each component (called balancers).
Mappers simply normalize the properties into bounded real number. For properties with different types, their mappers also differ a lot. You may refer to our source code listed at the bottom of this page to read the detailed implementation of each mapper.
You may notice that balancers are designed as functions instead of constants. This is because some fields may have inner connections, and with such design, it is easier to control whether to skip a field or not, simply by setting its balancer to zero. Take uses as an example. uses is one of the properties to describe the popularity of a part, and is weighed highly in our system. However, during researching we found that for parts with certain types (such as Cell or Measurement), only a small fraction (less than 5%) of them have meaningful uses values, making the evaluated quality of them extremely low. To solve this, we changed the balancer of uses from a constant to a function depending on the type of the part. It defused the imbalance to some extent.
Some properties are relatively static compared with others, such as those from the main data source, and it's a waste of resources to evaluate their mappers repeatedly. Thus, we will precalculate these fields and cache the values every time after the main data source is updated. With the assistance of MyISAM database engine and a series of extra optimizations, the quality measurements of 39311 parts can be accomplished in about 2 seconds (tested on production server).
Among the properties we selected, some of them are subjective, such as `watches`, `stars` or `rate_score`, representing the feedbacks from Biohub Forum users. As mentioned above, such data can be easily counterfeited. A malicious user may"

Sumbawagen,2014,Team:Sumbawagen#humanpractice overview_-_-_TEXT.html," distinguish between genuine and fake honey, a tool used to measure the levels of glucose in honey, until any product that can be produced made from honey. We hope this activity could expand the knowledge and society pride of Sumbawa honey. We also hope that our project will make people aware of the importance of maintaining the natural resource and pride of this region. When the awareness is growing, we believe the existence of honey as the pride of Sumbawa could be maintained.
Based on the survey’s results, majority of the respondents state that there is no device used to measure the concentration of glucose in honey and 91% of respondents stated that they want to use the application to measure the concentration of glucose in honey if the application exist. In addition, they explain that Sumbawa honey as one of the Sumbawa’s icons has became very popular in Indonesia, it is very important to maintain the existence of Sumbawa honey. According to National Standard of Indonesia, honey quality determined based on the quantity of glucose level in the honey. The honey control quality on farmer level was done based on the physical appearance which is not suitable with the industrial standard. Laboratory based on chemical analysis giving the best result measurement but either time or money consuming, it also gives difficulties for the farmer to use. We conclude that ECONEY project we were working on would be very helpful if applied in the society, especially for people who work as producer and distributor of Sumbawa honey. By calibrating the color of E Coli medium using android based mobile phone to measure the level of glucose in Sumbawa honey, ECONEY is expected to become a simple quality control for Sumbawa honey.

All these interactions greatly contribute to the stability and the prevention of self-dimerization.  The correct amino acid sequence of the coil pair IAAL E3 and IAAL K3, which we have implemented in our experiments is stated in table 1[2]. We chose this pair because we wanted to have a reasonably short coil with only 3 heptad repeats to avoid interference with the quaternary structure of the capsid proteins.

GFP with the E-coil
Figure 4: protein folding prediction of GFP (green) with a His-tag (blue) fused to a coiled coil (purple) ( BBa_K883705 )
In an effort to reduce the amount of laboratory work it was decided to fuse the different capsid proteins of the VLPs with the K-coil only. We designed experiments to add the K-coil to capsid proteins of the Turnip yellows virus ( TuYV ), the Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ( CCMV ) and to Hepatitis B ( Hepatitis B ) by fusion PCR (for more information see project pages). Possible ligands and other proteins of interest are fused with the E-coil. In this way the GFP - E-coil construct for example is of universal use with either of the 3 different viruses . The GFP E-coil construct was created by a two-step PCR to add the E-coil to a GFP template (taken from the parts registry). The detailed experimental approach can be found in the following methods section.
Methods
We designed three primers to obtain the desired construct in 2 subsequent PCR reactions. The E-coil is fused to the N-terminus of the GFP protein additionally we placed a histidine-tag on the C-terminus.

Our project envisions genetically modified organisms in the scope of food production. In Germany genetic engineering especially in the realm of food production is a highly sensitive topic. The following video adequately summarizes the current situation in Germany using the example of BASF's decision to move their Plant Science headquarters from Limburgerhof, Germany, to Raleigh, North Carolina (USA) [1] .
More information on the development and on the current situation in Germany can be found in the References section.
Considering the general rejection of genetic engineering and keeping in mind that Germany has a long tradition of brewing beer under the German purity law it is even more important to inform the general public about genetic engineering, synthetic biology and our project. While the general public broadly opposes genetic engineering, the scientific community tries to emphasizes the potential benefits of the technology. In a 2008 lecture Nobel Prize-Winner Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard made clear: ""Germany has so far failed to sufficiently accept that applying genetic engineering in plant breeding offers an as yet not fully tapped potential for organic farming, improved environmental protection, the conservation of biodiversity and health. Plants that are resistant towards moths, fungal infestation, viruses and nematodes need not be sprayed. Plants that are better adapted to unfavourable growth conditions, saline soil and karst and arid regions can thus be"

ROSE family
ROSE RNATS were found in numerous alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria. All known ROSE elements control the expression of small heat shock genes. ROSE-type structures are composed of two, three or four individual hairpins. The 5ʹ-most hairpins remain stable under heat shock conditions, but the 3ʹ-most hairpin that pairs with the SD sequence is only stable at low temperatures. Temperature-induced local melting in this hairpin exposes the SD sequence, facilitating ribosome binding. The SD region is occluded at 30 °C, partial melting occurs at 37 °C, whereas an increase to 42 °C facilitates the mRNA–ribosome interaction owing to full liberation of the SD and AUG start codon. This type feeds our needs. It may not initiate translation at a certain temperature completely, but the level of expression increase alone with the temperature increasing.
Four U family
Figure 7:the structre of Four U RNATS
Another family of RNATs is a stretch of four uridines that pairs with AGGA in the SD sequence. FourU elements exist in the 5ʹ UTRs of several heat shock and virulence genes. It has two distinct hairpins. The first hairpin is heat stable, however the second hairpin is temperature sensitive, which hide the SD region through the fourU. The formation of the ternary translation initiation complex occurs at high (45 °C) but not at low (30 °C) temperatures.
Synthetic RNA thermometers
Obvious, RNA thermometers provide us superb genetic tools to induce or repress gene expression. However, most natural RNA thermometers are relatively large. They fold into rather complex secondary structures and have been suggested to undergo gradual conformational changes in response to changes in temperature. Therefore, we want to construct smaller and more convenient synthetic RNA thermometers to achieve the goal of hierarchy Heat-resistant regulation. Under the following principle we construct a series of synthetic RNA thermometers.
Stem stability can be influenced by (i) changes in the size and/or GC content of a perfectly matched stem and (ii) introduction of mismatches at different positions.
Figure 8: The structures of Synthetic RNA thermometers simulated using mFold
Based on literature, we know that it’s a practical and effective way to improve E.coli’s heat resistant ability by importing exogenous HSPs into it. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins induced by heat shock, the most prominent members of this group are a class of functionally related proteins named"

SECOND plasmid designation:
The same principle as the FIRST, change the reporter gene into amilCP, splice it with partial smt locus by SOE PCR, insert the product (BRP) by double digestion(BamH I & EcoR I) and ligation, insert another partial smt locus by double digestion(BssH II & Nsi I) and ligation.
THIRD plasmid designation:
PACYC184 backbone has lower copy number than pHY300PLK. We presume it’s more suitable for the expression. BCP will be inserted by single enzyme digestion with Sac II and ligation with ligation kit. Meanwhile OPA will be inserted by using the Xba I site.
FOURTH plasmid designation:
Similarly, BRP will be inserted by single enzyme digestion with Sac II and ligation with ligation kit. Meanwhile OPA will be inserted by using the Xba I site.
FIFTH plasmid designation:
This plasmid is designed for function (b). In order to combine the detection and recycling, we wish the reconstructed bacteria could form CdS nanocrystal constantly at the presence of Cd2+ and S2-. So we added a strong constitutive promoter CP25 in front of CDS7, whose product is a short peptide that can bind to CdS and induce the formation of nanocrystal as well as make it more biocompatible. And the upstream of the constitutive promoter is the flocculation gene, which is expected to be responsible for the flocculation of the bacteria, and it is under the control of T7 promoter, which is already on the selected vector.
Future Application
Via successful application of module 1 and module 2 above, we achieved the goal that our engineering bacteria displayed the presence of Cd2+ and synthetized nanocrystals. However, there is another problem coming, the 2nd pollution committed by bacterium themselves spreading limits its future application and conceals the function of module 2. In our opinion, the rapid flocculation of our engineering bacteria is viable in avoiding this bottleneck and helpful in collecting the solid contaminant. As reported, flocculating systems are capable to increase the flocculent activity of the bacteria, a flocculation gene was tentatively adopted in our next work. In this section, our host bacteria containing a flocculation gene cloned from ''Bacillus sp.'' F2 was presented and detected. In total"

Property Rights:  What is the best way to share information to ensure that the field progresses rapidly, that opportunities to contribute are distributed fairly, and that contributors to the field are fairly compensated?  Is it ethical to have a patent on life?
Governance:  What is the best way to implement policy that governs the field of synthetic biology?  Is there a need for outside oversight or is self-governance sufficient?  What challenges would arise if governing policy varied from country to country?
Mankind and Nature:  What roles should humans play in manipulating nature?  Who should decide to what extent manipulation of life is acceptable?
Public Perception and Involvement:  Public involvement often is a deciding factor in funding and regulation.  How should synthetic biology disseminate knowledge to the public and hear and address public concerns?
Efforts have been made to foster discussion about these areas and various measures to address them have been suggested (Maurer et al., 2006; Garfinkel et al., 2007).  As synthetic biology is still in its youth, actions taken now and continued efforts to address these concerns in the future will enable the field to progress with minimal hindrance.  “Procrastination bears a risk. A productive dialogue may become more difficult as synthetic biology evolves and stakeholders become divided in their opinions about benefits and risks (Rejeski, 2009a).”  As the iGEM jamboree is the largest gathering related to synthetic biology in the world, we propose that initiative taken here will have a significant impact on the world.  The “current and future leaders of the field” are participating in these gatherings (2009.igem.org/About).

iGEM and Education
Broader Education of iGEM Participants
Establishing governing policy for synthetic biology is complex and difficult to address (Rodemeyer, 2009).  Problems can arise from limited jurisdiction of a governing body (Marchant & Pope, 2009) or the expense and cumbersome nature of monitoring activity (Rodemeyer, 2009) among other difficulties.  Whatever policy is decided upon, the ultimate difficulty comes in enforcing the policy.
In preparation for the Synthetic Biology 2.0 conference in 2006, Laurie Zoloth addressing “ethics training” stated:
What is needed is a lab culture which is strong enough and decent enough to teach and model impeccably honest moral science citizenship in the as yet small academic field of synthetic biology… Ethics education cannot"

The Test
HIV testing is at the forefront of the discussion concerning health interventions in Sub Saharan Africa. Without robust, accurate, affordable, and precise rapid diagnostic tools, many countries in the region cannot provide effective care with limited resources available. We can’t treat what we can’t diagnose. Enter the Grffithsin lectin powered HIV rapid diagnostic test.  The limitations of interventions dealing with HIV begin with a lack of data surrounding who is infected. Rapid diagnostic tests are sorely needed in that area because of a profound, “difficulty in accurately measuring HIV rates” [1]. With our thermostability project aimed at encouraging the development of a rapid diagnostic test, we tried to encourage a lateral flow assay with the specificity and precision to reliably diagnose HIV without seroconversion. The rapid diagnostic test would wholly address the need for accurate measurement of HIV rates by providing a cheaper alternative to current forms of testing that are able to diagnose people between ten and fourteen days after exposure. It would also be an exciting piece of technology to screen blood for transfusions [2]. The question now is not can the lectin Grffithsin identify HIV, but how do we get it to those who need it most. Testing and counseling is a huge issue for Sub-Saharan Africa and the diagnostic test must be designed to be conducive not only to the testing, but also the counseling. Hence traditional health practitioners must be able to use the technology.
Traditional Health Practitioners
Traditional health practitioners are the first line of care for about 70% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa [3]. Any health intervention must go through them to be effective in that area. Traditional Health practitioners and orthodox health practitioners do not always agree, So it was extremely important to our team that the test be similarly designed to something that the traditional health practitioners are technically familiar with and culturally tolerant of"

1. uptake rate of TCDD in our plant.
2. Interaction between the soil and the TCDD.
3. Solubility of TCDD.
4. volatility of TCDD.
5. Level of contamination in specific areas (Alon).
c. Nimrod pointed out that the uptake might be relevant only for a very short distance from the root (The rhizosphere), and this property might be problematic while taking our solution to the environment.  Although this property is shared with Heavy metals which has similar practical implementation.
We concluded that we should aim for a tool that will be able to understand the spread TCDD in a given soil and it's uptake while looking at time and space variables. In order to make that tool we need to assume information about the root system and about its flow in the soil.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," operon of Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1 which enables a resistance for chromium VI and superoxide. For our sensor we used the CrVI dependent repressor chrB which was introduced by team BIT 2013 ( BBa_K1058007 ),  and optimized this sequence for the use in E. coli . The repressor protein becomes deactivated by the binding of Cr6+-ions The associated chromium responsive promoter is chrP (introduced by BIT 2013) ( BBa_K1058007 ). For output we used sfGFP and a 5’UTR untranslated region in front of sfGFP to optimize the expression of the reporter protein and increase its fluorescence (see figure 2).
Our sensor for chromium detection consists of ChrB the repressor and the chromate specific promoter ChrP. The promoter is regulated by ChrB, which binds Cr6+-ions. Behind the promoter is a sfGFP for detection of a fluorescence signal.
Figure 2: The concept of our in vivo chromium sensor ( BBa_K1758313 ), which consists of the repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter ( BBa_K1758310 )and the operator and promoter sequence of the chromium inducible promoter. An untranslated region in front of the sfGFP, which is used for detection, enhances its expression ( BBa_K1758312 )
In vivo we could show that the addition of different concentrations of chromium has different effects to transcription of sfGFP.
Figure 3: Time course of the induction of a chromium biosensor with sfGFP for different chromium concentrations in vivo. The data are measured with BioLector and normalized on OD600. Error bars represent the standard deviation of two biological replicates.
Figure 4: Fluorescence levels at three different stages of cultivation. Shown are levels after 60 minutes, 150 minutes and 650 minutes. Error bars represent the standard deviation of two biological replicates.
We tested our in vivo chromium sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene, to test the functionality of the system. Moreover we tested different chromium concentrations. The kinetic of our sensors response to different chromium concentrations is shown in figure 3. The first 30 hours show a strong increase in fluorescence. After that the increase in fluorescence is slower. For better visualization the kinetics of figure 3 are represented as bars in figure 4. A fluorescence level difference for 60 min, 150 min and 650 min is represented.
Our data lead to the conclusion that in a cell-based system it is possible to detect chromium. In contrast to our"

What is a Biosensor?
Biosensors can be thought of as any device which is capable of sensing an analyte (e.g. a molecule or compound) or certain condition (e.g. pH or temperature) through the use of a biological component (Turner, 2013). One example of this would be a canary in a coal mine, where in the presence of carbon monoxide, the canary dies. A perhaps less morbid and more advanced biosensor example are those which have been developed by synthetic biologists. All organisms use native biosensing devices to monitor molecules of interest and initiate cell responses. For example, maintenance of cell homeostasis requires the sensitive detection and subsequent regulation of many molecules, such as metals, fatty acids and hydrogen peroxide (Rensing & Grass, 2003, Zhang & Rock, 2009 and Marinho et al., 2014). Two-component systems are common biosensing systems in bacteria. These systems allow bacteria to respond to extracellular signals by the phosphorylation of a sensor kinase in the presence of a target molecule, which subsequently phosphorylates further response regulator proteins. These response regulators can alter cell behaviour through protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, or RNA binding (Gao et al., 2007). In recent years, there has been a substantial increase the number biosensors produced using synthetic biology methods. Synthetic biology involves the application of engineering principles to the manipulation of biological systems. Biosensors constructed using these methods adapt the native cellular biosensing processes discussed previously, such as protein or RNA binding, and use these interactions to induce transcription of a"

Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several key components: members of the public and trained scientists, collaborative discussion, and a topic closely related to genomic editing. The Museum of Life and Science has, over the many years it has been open, built a substantial network with the community and local scientists and thus can be an important asset in attracting a diversity of opinion to the forum. Duke, likewise, has a network with many biotechnology firms which can not only bring a unique business perspective of genomic editing, but also draw new community members (especially Duke students) more interested in hearing about the latest developments on the technologies. Combining our resources, we should be able to attract a diverse crowd and create a successful discussion.

The Danish branch of DAKA refines waste streams from the feedstock industry (such as meat and agricultural industry), turning it into products such as fertilizers, animal feed and biodiesel. The biodiesel production is based on animal tallow and fats from the Danish meat industry. The glycerol derived from this production has a high salt content and a particularly low pH and therefore requires several purification steps before it can be used in the chemical industry. By adding NaOH and raising the pH to 6 we were able to make Y. Lipolytica grow fairly well in spite of the relatively high salt levels as seen in Figure 14 (Personal communication).

First Generation Glycerol (Perstorp and Emmelev)
Perstop has two biodiesel production facilities, one located in Sweden and one in Norway. They produce high quality glycerin, that is sold as a component for chemical production. This has a purity of 95-100% the remainder of mostly water (Personal communication). This byproduct is also a great substrate for Y. Lipolytica as seen in Figure 16.

Emmelev A/S is a local oil mill, first generation biodiesel plant and a glycerin destillor located on the second biggest island in Denmark, Fyn. The glycerin is distilled to 80% purity and sold to the chemical industry (Personal communication). This is fairly high quality and there are no components that inhibit the growth of Y.

Peking,2013,Team:Peking#Project#Plugins_-_-_TEXT.html," the detection limit (the concentration of inducer at which an output three times the basal single is generated) of 3-methyl-benzaldehyde from 100 μM to 1 μM. Similarly, the detection limit of 3-chloro-benzaldehyde was decreased more than 1 order of magnitude (Fig. 6c). In addition, dose-response curves for 3-methyl-benzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate were also collected (Fig. 6d). The almost identical lines for 3-methyl-benzoate and 3-chloro-benzoate showed that adding Adaptor XylC does not significantly influence the original characteristics of the biosensor.
When further equipped with XylB, the biosensor was expected to obtain the ability to detect benzyl alcohol and its derivatives which cannot be detected directly by either biosensor XylS or XylS equipped with XylC.
Different expression levels of Adaptor XylB and a set of culturing modes were tried respectively to optimize the performance of Adaptor XylB. They were listed in Table 1:
Then biosensor XylS was added to the supernatant of the processed media. 12h later, fluorescence intensity of biosensor XylS was collected by Flow Cytometer. The first three methods failed because biosensor XylS had problem growing in the processed M9 minimal media for some unidentified reasons. However, the last three methods worked, manifested by the apparent response of biosensor XylS equipped with two Adaptors XylB and XylC to benzyl alcohol (BAL) and 2-methylbenzyl alcohol (2-MeBAL), which were not sensed by biosensor XylS (Fig. 7).

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," once activated, produces its protein product x at rate α. If x is degraded at rate γ, then we can use the following differential equation to track the concentration of protein x over time:
Figure 1: A simple kinetic model tracking the changing concentration of protein x over time.
Gene circuit component images adapted from Newcastle iGEM 2010; protein images adapted from Cameron and Collins 2014 [7].
We solve the above differential equation to obtain the following function, which gives the protein concentration at a given time t after activation of X:
Figure 2: Concentration of protein x as a function of time; the solution to the differential equation in Figure 1.
We are able to graph this function and determine that the steady state concentration for x is equal to production rate over degradation rate. Finally, defining т1/2 as the time it takes for x to reach half its steady-state concentration, we find the following:
Figure 3: We find that т1/2 is a function of γ, the degradation rate for protein x.
The above expression reveals that in this model, it is not only sufficient but also necessary to tune the degradation rate γ in order to control the gene expression speed (represented here as т1/2). This property remains true for more complex circuit architectures like feedforward loops, provided that the steady-state concentration is held constant [5].
Thus in order to create a plug-and-play style system to control gene expression speed, we developed and characterized a suite of BioBrick parts which allow for simple, modular and predictable changes to the gene expression speed of arbitrary proteins via protein degradation.
Orthogonal Degradation Tags
When we created our gene expression control system, we wanted to make sure that it was both usable across a variety of biological systems and circuits, and easily accessible to other iGEM teams. To this end, we chose to use the Mesoplasma florum Lon (mf-Lon) protease system which was characterized by Gur and Sauer in 2008 [6] and developed into a modular suite of genetic parts by Cameron and Collins in 2014 [7]. This system consists of of a AAA+ protease and its associated protein degradation tags (pdt), which operate in a mechanistically similar manner to the E. Coli endogenous protease ClpXP and its associated ssrA tags. However, unlike ClpXP and ssrA tags, mf-Lon and pdts are completely orthogonal to the endogenous protein degradation systems in E. coli. Using this orthogonal degradation system helps eliminate cross-talk between our system and endogenous E."

Presented at the YSB1.0 meeting
We presented at the very first Young Synthetic Biologists meeting at the Wellcome Trust. YSB1.0 was designed as an extension of the UK iGEM team meetup that has been organised in previous years. We had a great time and loved sharing our ideas, networking and having fun with the rest of the UK iGEM community. As an additional bonus, Randy Rettberg, one of the co-founders and current president of the iGEM foundation gave us an inspirational talk.

From left to right: Sisi Fan (Imperial College), Iain Bower (Imperial College),Paul-Enguerrand Fady (St. Pauls), Margarita Kopniczky (Imperial College), Freddie Wilkinson (St. Pauls), and Guy Kirkpatrick (St. Pauls).
We met the team from St.Paul's School when we went to the Young Synthetic Biology event. We were impressed by their project of the previous year and got chatting to them. As school students they were keen to see some University Labs and discuss their project further so we invited them for a tour of the facilities at Imperial. We hope the tour was enjoyable and that the tips we gave them come in useful in their entry this year.
Yale: PLA-degradation
As soon as we found out Yale iGEM team was synthesizing poly lactic acid(PLA) this year, we contacted them and sent them our PLA degradation parts to test on their product. We did this to further characterise the part and see if Biobricks behave the same on both sides of the Atlantic! When Yale optimises PLA production, they will send some of their product to break down. Breaking down PLA is a second biological bioplastic recycling system we are working on, capable of producing the monomers required to chemically resynthesise it.
UCL: Beta-Amyloid Degradation
When we heard UCL's project was to degrade Beta-Amyloid plaques we were interested to see the results as degrading a substrate has a lot in common with our project. Beta-Amyloid is a component of Amyloid Plaques which are a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which UCL iGEM is targeting this year.It turns out that proteinase K is not only a good way to break PLA down, but also to degrade amyloid plaques.

We observe a large band in PAL2(US) around the 70 kDa band, which corresponds to the 78 kDa expected height for PAL2. This band is not visible in PAL2(SB), suggesting the protein did not come to (as high) expression in the Stanford Brown strain. For EGII, the second wash is clean, suggesting most non-specific binding proteins have been washed from the beads. The elution fractions however contain multiple bands. EGII has an expected molecular weight of 44 kDa, but the bands on the gel show a larger sized protein. Hence we decided to perform an anti-His Western blot to detect the presence of a His-tagged protein.
The same protein samples were used for another SDS-PAGE gel (15%) and followed by a Western blot which was kindly performed by Dr. Aditya Iyer according to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UMabJpKOg9ukW-qTmK0ZssQxaB19ZL_LgqrKfKlBn-U/edit . In this case, also a sample of the insoluble pellet fraction was loaded to see if there was any EGII presence (EGII(P)). The other samples are the same as described above.
Western blot EGII. Order of the samples: ladder, EGII(P), EGII, SF, FT, W1, (empty lane), W2, EF1, EF2. The ladder on this blot is Page Ruler Plus, so lowest band of the ladder upwards: 10, 15, 25, 35, 55, 70, 100  kDa.
This shows that the detected His-tagged protein bands are between 35 and 55 kDa, which corresponds with the expected 44 kDa for EGII.
The EGII elution fractions and the PAL2 cell lysates were further used in enzyme activity assays.

We measured the value of Fluorescence/OD without AHL stimulation by microplate reader to show the leakages of different lux pR mutants, as lux pR promotor is not supposed to be activated without AHL. Meanwhile, we also regard the value of Fluorescence/OD with 10-10 M AHL stimulation to observe the sensitivity and expression intensity of different lux pR mutants. Experiment data is shown in the figures below. (Figure.1)
Figure.1. Leakage and 10-10 M AHL stimulation of lux pR promotor and its mutations.
The fluorescence strengths and OD values are measured by microplate reader respectively at 510 nm and 600 nm wavelength. Plasmids with lux pR promotor and its mutants are transferred into E.coli DH5α. A The bacteria were treated without AHL inducing. High (Fluorescence/OD) ratio indicates strong leakage of promotor. Among all the strains, lux pR promotor has the strongest leakage and the largest error bar as well. B The bacteria were treated with 10-10 M AHL induction. High (Fluorescence/OD) ratio indicates high expression intensity. Mutation 5 has almost the same expression intensity as the wild type lux pR promotor.
It is observed that high expression intensity is accompanied by high level of leakage in lux pR promotors. Wild type lux pR represented with black strand in the figures has the highest level of both leakage and intensity. The next three are Mutant 5 (G-36T), Mutant 6 (G-36C), Mutant 9 (T-35G). Mutant 5 has almost the same intensity as wild type, but the leakage is significantly smaller. Mutant 6 and Mutant 9 have a little bit less leakage and medium intensity. We also did the experiment with 10-9 M and 10-8 M AHL, all of the promotors show high expression levels and therefore unable to compare. (Data not shown)

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#testwsq_-_-_TEXT.html," the system. As for visibility and operability, cell surface-expressed GFP as a model of extracellular signal molecule is a better choice. Therefore, we want to replace the excellular domain of synNotch with Lag16, a kind of antigen of GFP. Similar parts  have been used in previous project ( iGEM 2017 Fudan ). We received the plasmids with the gene of cell surface-expressed GFP and synNotch from iGEM 2018 Fudan team. But the intracellular domain of synNotch is tTA, a kind of activation factor. Since synNotch was applied to the transformation of cells, the intracellular domain has been replaced by transcription activator factors such as GAL - VP64 and tTA [2]. However, promoters are not completely non-expressed until they are activated, and they often have background expression. Moreover, we hope to make some changes to the intracellular domain of synNotch, trying to replace the intracellular domain with non-traditional transcriptional activator factor to broaden the selection and application of synNotch intracellular domain. So we construct the part of Anti-GFP-mnotch-TEV protease-NLS( BBa_K2557000 )
We found that the previous team iGEM 2017 Oxfrd modified tetR by replacing the domain between tetR DNA binding domain and regulatory core domain with TEV enzyme cleavage site, so that tetR with TEV cleavage site ( BBa_K2557050 ) will be destroyed in the presence of TEV, losing the function of repressing promoter after tetO( BBa_K2557038 ) sequence and opening up the expression of downstream genes.
According to the idea of iGEM 2017 Oxford, we replaced the intracellular domain of synNotch with TEV and repeated the function verification of synNotch to explore whether replacing intracellular domain with TEV will affect the function of synNotch.

A fun quiz called bioathlon was also organized which included prizes for the top 3 entries. iGEM Team IIT Delhi was awarded the 1st runner up prize in the ‘Best stall in Tryst 2015’ category.
Open House (April 2015)
Open house is an annual event in IIT Delhi which aims to promote and increase awareness about new technologies specifically for school children. iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and encourage school students to develop a greater interest in Biology and Biotechnology. We also gave a basic introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM with the hope that it might motivate some of them to enrol as the first high school team to participate in iGEM from India.
Surveys (August 2015)
iGEM Team IIT Delhi conducted some surveys to get an idea of the level of awareness among the citizens of Delhi, and getting an insight into the basic health and mental issues faced by the people by virtue of living in the most polluted city in the world. This was done in Central Park in Connaught Place, New Delhi and Munirka village. This was a really eye opening experience as we realised that the basic level of awareness is very low among the common people of the city. The details of the surveys have been enclosed in a separate document.

Such an A-to-I editing can be achieved through the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme family, which mediates endogenous A-to-I modification on mRNA by hydrolytic deamination.
Human has two ADAR orthologues, ADAR1, which targets repetitive regions and ADAR2 which targets non-repetitive coding regions (Tan. et. al., 2017). The latter is a great candidate for targeted A-to-I editing on mRNA. However, as ADAR proteins have preferred motifs on their editing target, a hyperactive mutant of ADAR2 (ADAR2DD), which has its glutamic acid at position 488 replaced by a glutamine (E488Q) (Kuttan. et. al., 2012), is used in our experiment. It has looser target stringency and a higher level of on-target activities.
 RNA-Targeting Cas13 Proteins
After the choice of our catalytic domain, we now need to choose an RNA-targeting partner. Previous literature has attempted to engineer ADAR to directly target with RNA guides (Montiel-González, 2016), and such a hybridization-based recognition does not guarantee high specificity and high editing efficiency. Hence, we decided to use a protein partner to assist the target recognition. The recently profiled and characterized Cas13 protein family is our choice.
Cas13 proteins are a family of type IV CRISPR-associated RNA-guided ribonucleases (RNase), which mediate precisely guided mRNA cleavage. These proteins have two higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding (HEPN) and RNase domains, and prefer but do not require protospacer flanking sites (PFS) (Cox. et. al., 2017). As they are guided by a single guide RNA to target RNA sequences, their programmable nature allows for targeting specific sites on mRNA and their catalytically inactive versions by mutating conserved catalytic residues in the HEPN domains, dCas13, are then good candidates to fuse with our ADAR proteins to perform site-specific A-to-I editing on mRNA.
 Our Two Choices
We identified two families of Cas13 proteins to investigate, namely the Cas13b and the Cas13d family. For Cas13b, Feng et. al. (2017) have demonstrated its consistently robust knockdown of mRNA in mammalian cell and engineered a dCas13b-ADAR2DD fusion protein"

1 Promoter - PyeaR
1.1 How does it work?
1.2 Why did we choose it?
1.3 Background
Having considered several, the promoter we decided to use was PyeaR (BBa_216005), submitted by Edinburgh in 2009. It is around this BioBrick that the entire project hinges, as it ensures a signal is only produced in the presence of Nitrates or Nitrites
How does it work?
NsrR action is lifted by Nitric Oxide, allowing transcription
A number of proteins interact with PyeaR in the cell, determining whether the genes behind it are expressed, but the most important is NsrR.
NsrR is a regulatory protein that blocks the transcription of a number of operons in E. coli, including those under the control of PyeaR. Under normal conditions NsrR binds to PyeaR preventing the transcription of any genes downstream of this promoter.
When Nitrates or Nitrites enter the cell they are converted to Nitric Oxide, which binds to NsrR causing it to dissociate from the PyeaR. As a result the promoter is no longer blocked and any genes downstream of PyeaR are then expressed - in our case the GFP reporter.
Why did we choose it?
There are several different"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Recombinant_-_-_TEXT.html,"iges which make them more stable to environmental stress. The disulfide formation is possible for the secreted proteins as the oxidizing extracellular conditions facilitate the bridge formation. On the other hand there is a selection pressure for secreted proteins not to contain exposed cysteine residues that are not involved in the formation of disulfide bridges. Such free cysteine residues would lead to aggregation of proteins which would probably hamper their activity. Therefore secreted enzymes generally only contain a smaller amount of cysteine residues.
Thus it is important to find out whether the used laccase BPUL is a secreted enzyme as this would increase the chance to express it in a functional form on the extracellular part of our moss. To solve this question we did an alignment of the laccase BioBrick and the closest related solved structure. The structure contains disulfide bridges for example Cys229-Cys322. The comparison of the position of these residues within the amino acid sequence alignment shows that these residues are conserved and it can thus be assumed that the laccase BioBrick we used also contains disulfide bridges that have to be formed under oxidizing conditions and will increase the stability of our effector protein.
We thus used 10 mM of potassium ferrocyanide which is a milde oxidization reagent subsequent to the cell disruption and did not use any 2-mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent during the protein purification.

As with all other effector proteins we performed at first an analytical preparation in a 2 L LB-media scale in order to learn about the protein and then up-scaled the production to 6 x 2 L of LB media. The production was carried out cytoplasmatically in E. coli BL21. The culture was grown to OD 0.8 and then induced using 5 mM of arabinose and the protein production was carried out for 5 hours. Cell disruption was performed using ultrasonic sound and subsequently the cell lysate was dialyzed against 1 x SA-Buffer that contained additional 5 mM of the milde oxidation reagent potassium ferrocyanide in order to form"

Background
Background
In the past several decades, in the biological engineering industry, we use the engineering microbe to produce what we expect. To meet our diverse needs, the microbe should be transformed with various exogenous genes, and the most popular vector for this job is the plasmid. There are many advantages of the plasmid vector, such as the convenience and its high transforming efficiency, but there are still many problems in the process of using the plasmid vector, one of which is the plasmid-loss,  the most common and serious problem. Imagine that we transform a vital gene into the microbe in our biological lab, only to find that the plasmid with the gene get lost after generations. Things like that always upset and trouble the scientists, not to mention the industrial factories. [State the problem]
To figure out the possible reasons of the loss and find out a feasible solution, the mechanism should be understood. According to the research, the plasmid stability can be divided into plasmid structural stability and the plasmid segregational stability [1]. The former is because of the genetic mutation in the plasmid and the latter is because of random distribution of the plasmid during the cell division. Once the plasmid is unstable, there will goes the problem called plasmid-loss. Actually, in the industrial fermentation processes, the problem of plasmid segregational stability is more common, so our project focuses on the segregational instability phenomenon. After an unequal distribution, the cells divide into two groups, one with high plasmid concentration and the other with low concentration. Since the high plasmid concentration in microbe leads to low growth effect and high production rate while low concentration will lead to high growth effect and low production rate, the low concentration ones consume more but produce less. We label these black sheep as ‘slackers’. [How the problem goes]
For many years, researchers come up with various ideas to prevent the birth of these ‘slackers’. The most widely used way is antibiotics control, which will kill the ‘slacker’ whose plasmid doesn’t integrate the antibiotics resistance gene. Thus, adding antibiotics will kill the ones without enough plasmids. But this way complicates the industry procedure and results in high cost. There is"

Each plaque was picked with a pipet tip and dipped into 50uL of LB.
The picked plaques were plated. Specifically, 0.5mL of E coli B was infected with 20uL of collected plaque sample (in LB) for approximately 15 minutes before they were plated along with 6 mL of x6 top agar. This step was repeated after no bacteria or phage plaques showed up the first time.

The OD reading was 0.435A, which indicates there are 2.175E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 2.175E9 bacteria per tube.

Plating of selected aliquots
Selected plaques are circled and numbered. Small plaques/big phage (S1-S12) are located on the left picture, while the big plaques/small phage (B1-B12) are located on the right picture.
Plating of selected plaques
This step was repeated twice. On both tries, no plaque or bacteria showed up for the samples. However, wild type plating showed normal/expected results. Most likely, picking plaques with pipet tips and dipping it into LB created stock too concentrated that all of the bacteria was lysed during incubation.
VI) Conclusion
The CsCl gradient in this round of mutagenesis is not optimal for two reasons:
1) Contamination between layers was obvious during the collection process.
2) No definitive way of relating aliquot to each gradient due to randomly collecting certain volume of phage CsCl suspension.
Despite these setbacks we still saw a certain variance in phage plaque sizes. Although the characterization process, in which we meant to verify whether or not the phenotype is stable, did not work so well, we are optimistic about the direction we are going.

The use of the piston is the most important step. Indeed, it enables to replace the centrifugation and also to reduce the extraction time. The piston needs to have exactly the same diameter than the column. It is inserted in the column and pushed to exert a pressure on the mix, allowing the liquid to pass through the silica.

NanoDrop measures have been done, giving the following results :

Finally, extracting genomic DNA without centrifugation is possible. The concentration is higher when the elution is done with the TE buffer. This concentration range allows the pursuit of the experience.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," to ethical reflexion.
Among the large field of synthetic biology, the IGEM competition invites young scientists, future researchers to interdisciplinary experimentation.  Heterogeneous teams, focus on freedom, innovation and motivation can lead teams to perform that disciplinary “insider/outsider” team standing. The specifications of the competition encourage to this reflexive position. In other word, the point is how exploration and experimentation in the way to build up an IGEM project can lead teams to that critical reflexion. Freedom and experimentation, encouraged by the structure of the competition, make the ethical reflexion both relevant and accessible to the teams' mind.
If we go ahead with our inquiry, crossing several institutional or disciplinary structures which promote a critical standpoint and ethical reflexion, we have to examine our own structure of participation in the competition : our team. We can find two “original” explanations to that reflexivity of the team. The Parisian team is build by volunteers to the “IGEM call” made by the Center for Research and Interdisciplinary [1] not only because of the student's membership of a certain university.  Therefore, the team is hybrid both socially and disciplinarily. Students come from high school or undergraduated programs, and differences in disciplines and specializations are large and various. At first, we had to make an effort to understand each other's different backgrounds. In the course of the project development, that “different regard” of the members was transformed, becoming a “shared regard” by building up our project and knowledge, in the process of building a team.
These differences between members, understood as a wealth, were already in the mind of the researchers of the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity. The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) was founded in 2005 at the Medical University of Paris Descartes and defines itself as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. New ways of teaching and learning are daily practices at the CRI, for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers. The originality of the collaborative, non-hierarchical interactions between students and teachers can be found in the autonomy of the student (they collectively choose the content of the classes) but also in the main research's themes and perspectives. The CRI “call for participation” to IGEM has to be understood in that perspective of giving to students critical tools, understood as a wealth in the scientific approach.
Several effects and new questions will rise of that interdisciplinarity, reflexivity and critical perspectives. What are the effects of"

Full Description Layman Description Elevator Pitch
The Problem
Humans have been pumping carbon dioxide into the air at an increasing rate ever since the coal-powered steam engine was invented in the 1750s [13]. In 2017 alone, humans released ~32.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [12]. The increased rate of carbon dioxide entering our atmosphere (ranging in the gigatons per year) has led to a number of environmental effects that have direct impacts on human health and safety [13].
Figure 1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [13]
Introducing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification
The increasing levels of carbon dioxide have numerous detrimental effects on the environment. Firstly, by trapping heat causes increases in global temperatures. These temperatures then power more intense weather events and melt ice reserves. Secondly, the ocean absorbs some of the excess carbon dioxide, leading to increasing acidity. Specifically, humans have caused oceans to become 30% more acidic since the Industrial Revolution [17], damaging coral reefs and other marine habitats in the process.
Unfortunately, the rate at which carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere by human pollution far exceeds the rate that it is absorbed by plants and other carbon sinks (natural sources that capture carbon dioxide), as evidenced by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere [14]. According to many climate models, climate change is already irreversible [15]. A large percentage of the carbon dioxide that we are pumping into the atmosphere will likely remain for millenia, continuously trapping heat, unless we figure out a way to capture emissions faster than we produce them.
Current Solutions Just Not Good Enough
Even if humankind stops emitting carbon dioxide today and uses only renewable energy, the effects of carbon dioxide will still exist for thousands of years.
Currently, the best carbon capture technology costs $94 to $232 per ton of carbon dioxide captured [11]. In order for the world to go carbon neutral (not even carbon sink), ~37 billion tons of carbon dioxide would need to be sunk each year [12]. The cost of sinking that much carbon (at a modest estimate) would cost ~3.5 trillion dollars per year. Unless a major and highly coordinated global government action is taken, it will never be economically feasible"

Result
The strategy for the function testing of engineered CEN.PK2-1C stains △far1 +△sst2, △sst and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 were divided into the following parts;
(1). Test of the inhibitive effects on the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C whose cellular period can be stopped at the G1 stage by  α factor.
(2). Expression and identification of Pfus+RFP+cyc1t+PRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2.
Zone of inhibition
Plan and method
The growth of CEN.PK2-1C can be inhibited by α factor, we want to  test the function of △sst2, △far1+△sst2 and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 by comparing with CEN.PK2-1C .
(1) Explore the influence of the growth of each strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
(2) Observe the growth situation of these strains and compare the differences among them. Analyze the functions of these strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
Results and discussion
(1) The strain CEN.PK2-1C stops growing at the phase G1 due to the effects of the α factor and zone of inhibition appears in the solid plate medium.
Fig.1 inhibition zone of CEN.PK2-1C
(2) The strain △sst2 is more sensitive to α factor. Meanwhile the larger zone of inhibition will appear when the concentration of α factor increased.
Fig.2 inhibition zone of △sst2
(3)The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and these strains will still keep growing under the effects"

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO STEP
Troubling the world for years, cancer has long been a major threat to people's health. The rapidly developing cell therapy has proved its potential for cancer treatment, but all of the current biosensors, from CAR to SynNotch, lack either programmability or orthogonality, which could significantly restrict its clinical application.
We provide our own solution to the problem, the Synthetic Transducer Engineering Platform (STEP). Consisting of two transmembrane chains with ligand receptor on the extracellular domain and protease/transcription factor pair on the intracellular domain, it can achieve high modularity as well as orthogonality in both upstream and downstream. Through our experiments and models, we've successfully proved the reliability and tunability of STEP, and are trying to find the best condition for its real application.
By using STEP in clinical researches and practices, treatment best suited for cancer patients can be developed. With further researches and optimisation, we believe it will reveal its full potential.

Protocol Graphs Thought Project
Ideally, we should have a protocol graph that would be a generic form of managing an arbitrary combination of protocols.
The protocol graph should contain vertices, which are either operands or protocols/operations.
The graph should also connect operands to protocols.
Given access to a library of protocol specifications, one should be able to give an expression or an explicit protocol graph for parsing purposes.
One should be able to use PuppetShow (see powerpoint) to create an implicit protocol graph.
One should be able to reconfigure protocol graphs for optimization, etc.
Questions
How do we want to construct this graph?
Does the user input an expression?
Should we have an interactive GUI to help user create custom protocol graphs?
Generate several protocol graphs with Avi's help along with some predefined BioCoder protocols
examine Puppeteer code to see if the core commands need modification to cater to Avi's needs
brainstorm Protocol Graph/PuppetShow ideas in correlation with BioCoder paper and relevant thoughts
Database Thought Project
use Hibernate Connection Library?
makes sense if I'm using Clotho, otherwise I just add the appropriate JAR file
use POJO objects to structure classes in compatible format
use MySQL database/table to play around with inserting database entries and querying records
The Day-to-Day
[6/8/2011]
PS Scripter GUI as of 6/8/2011
Finally got the plugin to properly load off of the Clotho dashboard.  It runs as a JEditorPane with (I assume; has yet to be verified) Python-syntax-highlighting.  Next up is finding a way to properly integrate a ""run"" method for parsing/executing Python scripts made within this GUI.
Got a bare-bones menu-bar working.  It doesn't have any functioning implementations, yet.  However I'm going to stop here until I can figure out how to parse Python and run it from the GUI window.
[6/9/2011]
I started looking into incorporating the Jython library/software package to assist with compiling Python scripts, etc.  However, as per Swapnil's advice, instead I shifted to just trying to run the Python scripts directly off of a native Python installation.  This makes sense since one would currently need to have Python installed to work with Puppeteer, so executing/compiling the Python scripts/code should work.
Right now I am trying to properly code the runtime-execution of python to parse some sample code within a test file that I placed within the App directory.  My thoughts for future development involves saving the written code to a temp file"

Final Test
Verify the function of monitoring antioxidants in                         real time
Our engineered yeast should finally have the function of monitoring antioxidants in real time.                         To demonstrate this, we integrated the two subsystems together into ∆yca1 yeast and had series                         of tests on it, in which the increasing of ROS in yeast can be effectively captured by our                         roGFP2-Orp1 protein.
In order to regulate endogenous ROS, we replaced yeast endogenous YNO1 promotor with a                         galactose-inducible promotor, GAL1-GAL10. We then constructed the plasmid                         pESC-TEF1p-roGFP2-Orp1-CYC1t, a shuttle vector marked with trp1. Cellular redox status were                         monitored by measuring the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized                         state). Cells were cultured in SD medium supplemented with 1% galactose at 30℃, during which                         GAL1-GAL10 promotor was induced when galactose added. It suggests that overexpression of yno1 gene will increase cells ROS level and decline the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm and 405 nm,                         which means there are more ROS in our modified strain.
As the results showing, our output subsystem can reflect the accumulation of endogenous ROS                         caused by regulator subsystem.
Fig.1 Intracellular ROS accumulation.
The red curve indicates the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized                         state) of engineered yeast which overexpressed Yno1 and constructed the plasmid                         pESC-TEF1p-roGFP2-Orp1-CYC1t. And the blue curve indicates the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm                         (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized state) of engineered yeast"

However, the next day the colonies appeared fuzzy and resembled fungal growth, so we were doubtful whether we were able to transform spores.

We also left eight more tubes of dried spores (without the addition of water and DNA) and left these at room temperature to ensure they were as dry as possible.
Week 25: October 13 - October 17
Transforming with B. subtilis spores
Since the previous trial of spore transformation was doubtful due to the likely presence of fungal growth, we attempted transformation again. This time, we tried transforming with spores that were left to dry for several days and spread them on plain agar and spectinomycin plates. We left the plates at room temperature and saw no growth the next day. We then placed them in the 37°C incubator and the next day we saw growth on the plain plates and limited growth on the spectinomycin plates. Since the plates for the previous trial were checked after several days, we think more time might be required for the colonies to grow on the spectinomycin plates. As of now though, transformation with spores was unsuccessful.
Figure 32:Transformation of dried spores that had xylose added to the bacteria during the initial inoculation. Colonies grew on the plain agar plate (left), while there was no growth on the spectinomycin plate (right). More time might be required for colonies to grow on the spectinomycin plate but as of now, transformation of spores was unsuccessful.
