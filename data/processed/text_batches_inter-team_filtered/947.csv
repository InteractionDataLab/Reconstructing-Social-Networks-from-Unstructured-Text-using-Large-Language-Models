The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

By utilizing these pH-sensitive promoters with different reporters and transforming them into multiple organisms in kombucha, the visualization of the microbes and their location in kombucha would be possible (Lee, et al., 2015). This will serve as a stepping stone into further understanding how the microbiome of kombucha changes as it brews as well as determining organism concentration specific times during the brewing process.

Gellan Gum
Figure 1: Our plate protocol developed from multiple references and trial and error. The bacteria are first inoculated into rich media for cell multiplication over a span 24 hours before being inoculated with a 1 to 10 dilution into Gellan-production minimal media to maximize the concentration of Gellan in the culture. After 48-96 hours, the culture is then autoclaved or microwaved. Immediately after sterilization, concentrated, sterilized media is added and the plates are poured before the Gellan can solidify. After 5-10 minutes, the plates can be streaked with microbes and placed in an incubator. Credit: Jenna McGuffey
The do-it-yourself (DIY) movement is focused on making science more accessible to the public. Because many consumers brew their own kombucha, we have developed a set of DIY instructions that would allow an average person to analyze their home-brew and identify their kombucha’s species outside of a lab setting. This procedure is possible because of Gellan Gum, produced by the halobacterium Sphingomonas pauci-mobilis.

Experimental Help to BNDS-China
BNDS-China aims to soften the hard water. To achieve this goal, they decided to synthesize the E. coli backbone with ciaX that enable the bacteria to absorb Ca++. Same with us, they are a first-year high school team. Due to the limitation of their high school lab, we provided them with the access of our lab at Institution of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We did the PCR amplification of ciaX for them and provided the reagents needed for digestion and joining of DNA, including Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase, PCR purification kit, gel purification kit, plasmid extraction kit, and restriction enzyme for Xba I, Xho I, EcorI and Pst I. We provided the relevant laboratory apparatus as well. In addition, we guided them through the usage of some of the reagents and instruments and sent them some pBS1c3 parts and pGEX-KG expression vectors for them to later clone the target gene to the expression vector and construct parts."

Went to visit Leanne Yohemas (Senior Communications Leader – Dept. of Science) – she said she can put up iGEM on the UC twitter and Bio Sci newsletter if we write up an article. She even volunteered to edit and review our articles. We’re thinking of giving her our rough draft in the first week of august.  She said she’s willing to be our mentor for promoting iGEM. She also gave us the contact info of the Bio SCI newsletter’s journalist and for the leader/VP of Research in Action (newsletter). Lastly , she gave us the contact info of the person who we should approach for contacts of UC Alumni for funding purposes!! This person is from Development- from the Faculty of Science.  I’ll contact her tonight!

Variety of things to do
so what am I doing today?
Fixing the Synthetic Kingdom video. Technical problems plagued my blog post and thus, took forever to do. Apparently, it also has no sound so I have to find a way to fix that tonight. I think the problem is on youtube's end of things.
Acting as an EXTERIOR decorator for the Synthetic Kingdom. The purpose of this is to make look nicer and not retina-burning ugly. People would feel better exploring it and it would provide more incentive to stay there and see all it has to offer.
Building a new Endoplasmic Reticulum for my cell. I spied on iGEM Washington's Second Life stuff and found a better way to build it (they stole it from somewhere! tsk tsk).
Trying to read and take notes on another ethics paper because the meeting will be coming up soon. Also, I wanted to look into the Ethics Approval to see if we can interview people without breaking the law.

Second, the lack of Zn causes the taste disorder, but on the other hand, excessive quantity of Zn is needed to cause symptoms of poisoning. So we considered that the dangers from Zn had almost nothing.
Now, experiments are conducted in consideration of safety, but the pollution from chemical materials may happen in the following cases:
In the case that…
the polyethylene tanks to put the waste liquors into crack
waste liquors attach to tubes, tips, and the water to wash with something
disasters like earthquake happen (especially in Japan)
someone who do not know about our experiment touches chemical reagents in the same laboratory
desks or doors are touched unconsciously by the hands which have touched danger materials
the dangers or characteristics about chemical reagents such as the contents of kits are not understood
To reduce the dangers in these cases, the following things are conducted in practice:
the polyethylene tanks to put the waste liquors into crack
→To prevent the waste liquors from flowing out to balcony or overflowing due to the rainwater, we set the trays under the tanks and store in covered containers.
waste liquors attach to tubes, tips, and the water to wash with something
→The resources polluted from waste liquors are collected in the prescribed position.
disasters like earthquake happen (especially in Japan)
→If rivers flood, the first floor can be submerged under the water, so laboratories are usually equipped on the first floor. If disposal facilities are destroyed, there is no help for it.
Next, to reduce the dangers in these case, the following things are considered to be effective:

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," In response to inductive long days Flowering Locus T protein (i.e. phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) acts in the shoot apex to induce target meristem identity genes such as APETALA1 (AP1) (Notaguchi, Daimon, Abe & Araki, 2009) and initiates floral morphogenesis. Bearing that in mind, we propose to regulate FT transcriptional rate in order to help improving the current agriculture.
However, a modular and standard system was designed in order to reach all users’ necessities. Circuit’s modularity allows to select easily the light-regulated cellular process by changing the output module. Therefore, we are able to induce almost any response on plant (e.g. flowering induction, climate conditions protection, organoleptic features enhancement). Essentially, we could easily personalize any desired element to provide the maximum possible control over the plant.
LIGHT APPLICATION SITE
Since white light presents all visible wavelengths, controlling system activation/inactivation becomes almost impossible. We resolved this issue by plant root-specific promoter so optogenetic circuit can be activated when roots (which do not need light and are usually in dark conditions) are illuminated by red/far red light. This strategy guarantees almost a total root-specific regulated transcription, preventing interferences in circuit signaling and making our system more accurate, safe and efficient.
TRANSPORT FROM ROOTS
Since our genetic circuit will be activated in roots, proteins of the desired regulated element will be only synthesized there. Unfortunately, many proteins are not capable to transport themselves to other parts of the plant so, a systemic movement strategy along the plant becomes necessary to fulfil is metabolic role.
One of the main strategy that is still being developed is the use of mRNAs as long-distance signaling molecules because of its ability to deliver a signal in its non-functional form (Spiegelman, Golan & Wolf, 2013). Therefore, the translation of the desired element occurs specifically at the target site. Nevertheless, long-distance movement of transcripts precise much more control and to date, the complete understanding of the molecular machine underlying the mRNA trafficking has not clearly been reported to provide a definitive proof for this notion. For instance, it has been shown that protein CmPP16 from Cucurbita maxima possess properties similar to those of viral movement proteins. However it might not behave similar in other species (Xoconostle-Cázares, 1999). Equally with AtABCG14, critical for cytokinin translocation (Ko et al., 2014)
Despite that, there are recent evidence of different molecules that can act as"

Overview
In this country profile, information about of synthetic biology in Japan has been compiled from on-line sources. Searches were conducted only in English media. This country profile contains information about different aspects of synthetic biology in Japan, including regulation, perception, and organization.
Synthetic biology in Japan is somewhat artificially underrepresented because very few researchers identify their work as related to synthetic biology. Most researchers instead classify their work using more established terms, such as ‘systems biology’.  This also could be related to very few people in Japan recognizing the term “synthetic biology” (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011). Nonetheless, Japan is one of the leading Asian countries in synthetic biology. It is the Asian country with the most entries on the SynBio map (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). Also, Japanese universities have regularly participated and gained high achievements in the iGEM competition.
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,""). It is a good tool for comparing the growth of synthetic biology around the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Japan is a leading Asian country in synthetic biology. It has a total of 22 entries. Synthetic biology research is focused in or near the capital, Tokyo. Around half of the entries (13) are from this region. Other regions listed in the map include: Kyoto (5), Osaka (1), Sapporo (2), and Nagoya (1) (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is notable that in comparison with China and South Korea, Japan has more private companies participating in synthetic biology research. In fact, one third of"

2) Receptors presenting an extracellular avidin variant.
These avidin derivates, by design, allow the functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor. Two different variants were used here: The so-called enhanced monomeric avidin, a single subunit avidin that is able to bind biotin as a monomer, and a ""single-chain avidin"", which resembles the naturally occuring avidin tetramer, but has the subunits being connected via polypeptide linkers. By linking the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the adjacent monomer the whole tetravalent avidin has only one N- and one C-terminus and can thus be fused to a type-I membrane protein for surface presentation.
Both receptor types generally serve the same purpose: By interacting with the complementary component in the printing reservoir, cells are being cross-linked due to the polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules to polyvalent biotinylated proteins.
The general, modularized design of our membrane proteins (which we did for prokaryotic cells such as E. coli and eukaryotic cells such as HEK cells) is generally comparable (see Fig. 1). In both cases the expression of the membrane protein is controlled by a promoter and secretion into the endoplasmic reticulum or the periplasmic space is enabled by a appropriate signal peptide. Following the signal peptide the functional extracellular domain (biotinylated or with biotin-binding properties) is fused as a protein fusion in RFC [25] by an antibody binding site that can be used in experiments do quantify the surface presentation of the synthetic membrane protein. The membrane insertion is in eukaryotes enabled by using a simple single-span transmembrane domain and in prokaryotes by using a bacterial autotransporter that integrates into the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. By using this modular design, which is even cross-kingdom functional, we enabled future teams to present various protein domains on the surface of bacteria and mammalian cells and successfully generated cells to test our inventive bioprinting approach.
Prediction of signal peptide functionality
For determining a signal peptide suitable for our construct, we tested a total of three signal peptides - one taken from the parts registry, and two designed by ourselves.

Spreading the word
Raising public awareness to the field of synthetic biology is important, and as scientists in the field it is our responsibility. We held several lectures, organized hands on activities at different schools, and gained media attention.  We also spread the word of our work (and of synthetic biology in general) to our fellow scientists and students through the university newspapers and by speaking at gatherings.
University outreach
As a part of the outreach at the university, we gave the inaugural presentation to the student group Biovidenskabelig formidling på SDU, ”Bioscientific dissemination at SDU”. The presentation centered on our project and what it means to be a part of the iGEM competition. The group is open to all students associated to the institute of biochemistry and molecular biology. After our presentation, we received feedback, which improved our presentation skills for the jamboree in Lyon and Boston. Additionally, we answered the slew of interested questions about the iGEM competition and our research.

This promoter is completely inactive in 'E. coli' strains lacking a T7 RNA polymerase such as TOP10 or DH10beta bute inducible in strains carrying the T7 RNA polymerase under a lacI repressible promoter such as DE3 strains. This enables the use of the same backbone for cloning and over expression. Using 3A assembly a translational active part can be cloned from an RBS and a coding part in one step while maintaining the full flexibility of standard BioBrick assembly. These new RFC 10 conform backbones eliminate one cloning step needed for the expression and thus the characterization of a newly BioBricked protein.

David replied to 3M, they sent me back an email with useful info. I forwarded to everyone:
Temperature and pressure depends on system:
250F and 40 psi for their small single well sealer - 1 second so the liner doesn’t warp.
However, multiple well sealer needs 300F, 50 psi
=> May need a few trials to decide the parameters
They can create a crude prototype to give us some idea of usability
If making it ourselves, they recommend a sequence of steps:
coat adhesive onto the liner, laminate the membrane to the liner through a low pressure nip roller and lastly heat seal the backing to the lamination (on the membrane side) by placing the materials to be sealed onto a well type receiving fixture with silicone sealing gaskets and using a platen type seal plate above.
Our membranes are the most permeable. The main difference is the thickness between the 2. The thicker one (9716) will have a slower transmission rate. If nothing works, they’ll help us pick out another one.
Meeting with Dr. UT Sundararaj about manufacturing:
He went over the project with us and said gel media might be safer when being punctured but diffusion might be compromised. However, he said at equilibrium everything should be the same.
He approved our materials for the patch. He told us to consider the materials’ solubility parameters to make sure they are compatible and nothing will dissolve into each other when heated. EVA and polyethylene are fine. We might want to check hexane/heptane in the silicone adhesive and EVA though, but it should be fine.
http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/burke/solpar/solpar2.html  If delta is >+-2 it should be okay.
He recommended using thermoforming for our mouse patches. The general idea is to make a wood “mold”, heat our backing layer up, put it on, vacuum so it forms a reservoir, pour the media in, put the membrane on top, and then heat seal everything together. A flat iron for hair or something might work. It’s also a good idea to apply heat on both sides.
Thus, we need to get in touch with the machine shop ASAP

HZAU-China,2015,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling#_-_-_TEXT.html," delay to three parameters:
Then we code in MATLAB, and the simulation result is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Simulation result of dual-feedback oscillator.
Parameters
Parameters play an important role in simulating, which would determine the behaviors of the system. In our modeling part, parameters in quorum-sensing e-oscillator are from parameter part of Original Full Model by Tsinghua-A iGEM 2011 and the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits” by Arthur Prindle et al. And parameters used in dual-feedback e-oscillator are based on the paper “A fast, robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillator” and parameter table in HUST-China iGEM 2013 . Although these previous work give us some experience, we still adjust some parameters more reasonable in terms of our system and some experimental tests.
Regulation to oscillator--light control system
In order to establish the connection between genetic oscillator in E.coli and e-oscillator in computer, we adopt light as the medium and bond. A light control system is employed in our project as the wetlab mentioned (Figure 3). Therefore, we can change the expression level of the gene behind the ompc promoter through different light intensity.
Figure 3. Light control system.(Tabor J J, et al,2009)
Based on the paper of Jeffrey J. Tabor(2009), we get the transfer function between light intensity and expression rate:
where
is the expression rate, the fit parameter is K=0.0017
,
,
are the maximum and minimum expression level,  L is the intensity of light (
).
In our project, the expression of lacI behind the ompc promoter will change with the light intensity. So we add it to the DDEs model of dual-feedback oscillator,
and modify the procedure in MATLAB.
Coupling
Virtual-virtual coupling
Based on the experimental result, we select the dual-feedback oscillator to finish the modulating and coupling process. First, we will finish the virtual-virtual coupling. So different initial values of parameters are set to the simulation to form two e-oscillators which are of the same properties.
Then how could they adjust to each other and be strongly coupled or synchronized? We think about the dynamic equilibrium of wolf and rabbit. If the number of wolves increases rapidly, lots of rabbits would be eaten and the number would reduce. Faced with the decrease of prey, the quantity of wolves would also cut down. On the contrary, rabbits would multiply with fewer natural predators. Cycling like these, wolf and"

Synthetic graphite
- Synthetic Graphite normally has a high electrical conductivity than the natural ones.
- the process involves turning amorphous carbon into crystal under extremely high temperature.
- no evidence shows that carbon(element) can be either iuput or output of bacterial metabolism.
- therefore, we can pass this topic (Text by Nina)
Anti-venom
- traditional way of anti-venom production:
1. injecting venom or detoxified venom into a horse (tiny amount, multiple times)
2. after the antigen growing period, contract the horse blood plasma
3. use stomach digestive enzyme to breakdown the anti-venom protein into smaller globin
4. use (NH4)2SO4 to salt out the globin (purification) [1]
- oxides like K2MnO4 can neutralise venom by denaturing the polypeptide chains
- complex ligase like AuCl2 can denature venom by binding with them, when preventing venom entering the tissues [2]
-immune system has a stronger response to venom [3]. When the mast cells are stimulated, they release histamine. Histamine can subside the venom
- histamine producing bacteria: found in tuna; 18 types of bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens and other anaerobic bacteria
- to conclude:
1. decide the working mechanism (toxicology) of a specific type of venom: does it attack neurons? brain cells? cardiovascular system? respiratory system?
2. does it react with histamine?
3. bacterial production of histamine

While the start of Synthetic Biology is the sequenced data from databases, if there are some new species whose genetic information is unknown, how can we continue the synthesis? Therefore, we decided to expand the definition and add modules  of Synthetic Biology... more
Evolution of Synthetic Biology
Overture（IGS and Bioinformatics）
In 1977 Sanger and colleagues introduced the ""dideoxy"" chain-termination method for sequencing DNA molecules, also known as the ""Sanger method"".This was a major breakthrough and allowed long stretches of DNA to be rapidly and accurately sequenced. It earned him his second Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1980, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg.The new method was used by Sanger and colleagues to sequence human mitochondrial DNA (16,569 base pairs) and bacteriophage λ (48,502 base pairs).The dideoxy method was eventually used to sequence the entire human genome.
As the accumulation of sequence data, databases formed, which announced the birth of the bioinformatics.
In short, the bioinformatics is the harbinger of the Synthetic-Biology’s emergence.
Sonata（NGS and Synthetic Biology）
In short, the First GS has some fatal drawbacks such as high cost and low throughput. This is why it was replaced by NGS, such as 454, Solexa, Hiseq, etc.  The NGS has distinct effects on cost-reduction and time-saving with high accuracy. For instance, it took only one week to finish the human genome project by NGS, while the time using by First GS is 3 years.
As more and more species were sequenced, the size of genomic data is enlarged. As is known, the sequence of species is the major prerequisite of the SB. So the conclusion is drawn that the emergence of the NGS indicated the naissance of SB.

The field of synthetic biology and gene technology is often dealt with in the media and in many cases, it does not receive in publicity that recommends the inventions and applications concerning this field of science. This might also be due to the fact that the knowledge about the functioning of general methods is not well understood among the public.
Regarding the most recent public dispute in Germany on the introduction of the TTIP (“ Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership ”) between the U.S. and the EU, possible consequences were discussed in the media as well as in public. One of them being the import of genetically modified organisms in food that is provided by companies in the U.S., the discussions that arose were led rather emotionally.
On October 10th, we therefore invited 40 pupils in their final high-school grade from the Robert-Bosch-Gymnasium Wendlingen to our institute, in order to introduce this often discussed topic to them. Our intention was to convey the theoretical as well as the practical background of synthetic biology by presenting our iGEM project, and performing daily used gene technology methods together with them.
We performed an experiment to prove the existence of the cry1A(b)-gene that codes for a delta-endotoxin in the genome of GM-corn. These cry-toxins are pore-forming toxins that are produced by Bacillus thuringiensis. Their incorporation in the genome when cultivating the corn helps perish a corn parasite, the European corn borer, because of their insecticidal effects.
The day started with an introduction to our iGEM project and the achievements in synthetic biology that made it possible. Furthermore, we talked about the implications of genetically modified corn,"
SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour61_-_-_TEXT.html," and use cellulose as a carbon source.
We thought about many other potentials of Edible coli. It would be great to design a bacteria that expresses different amounts of the individual amino acids and fats, which would be regulated individually and  customized to the need of the consumer. To get an even more nourishing product Edible coli might also  produce vitamins and minerals.
Furthermore, the bacteria might have a safety mechanism which kills the cell if it escapes to the  environment. For that reason, knockout bacteria might be used. When all ribozymes are knocked out and  only incorporated in the plasmid, the bacteria will die when it loses its plasmid. This is also a good way to  select without the use of antibiotics.
Eating bacteria has been the major ethical issue during our design and development of Edible coli. This led us to the idea of transferring our system into another organism, like for example yeast that  is accepted as food, although it is a living organism. Unfortunately yeast does not include all amino acid  pathways, which makes it difficult to transform all essential enzymes.
In addition, it might be a good idea to transfer our system into eukaryotic cells and study the growth and  morphology of the cells over time, to see if the system is toxic or if it has any influence on the cells at all.

Public Engagement
We have contacted many people involved in research, mental health charities and artists who could be interested in our project. Today we got a lot of feedback. We want to use their input to start off our public engagement part of the project. It is starting to take shape...
Interlab Study
The cultures for the interlab study grew (yeah!) and we inoculated them to liquid cultures and let them grow over night.
Mind the Gut: Promoters
We transformed cells with our promoters (Gad-A+RBS, Gad-A and PyeAr) in chloramphenicol resistance.
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We have done ligation and transformation of both gel extracted- and PCR amplified- TPH1 with PSB1C3 carrying expression cassette. In order to maximize the chances of success, we have carried each step according to long protocols, including dephosphorylation of backbone and heat inactivation of both restriction enzymes and T4 ligase. Because of that, we have only managed to finish with the transformation by the end of the day!
Friday 17th
Mind the Gut: Promoters
The cultures we transformed with our own promoters grew and we now need to check whether some have actually taken up the promoters or whether they just self-ligated. So we miniprepped them and wished them a nice weekend!
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We have repeated the mini preps and diagnostic digestions of TPH1 in PSB1A3, but no success again! :( What happened to our inserts?
Entrepreneurship
We had an end of week talk and shared some ideas about the entrepreneurship part of our project finding out more about regulations to consider in the retail of probiotics some of which seem a bit strange to us, so far...

BU/MIT Team Meet Up at Wellesley
We don't normally have to come into the lab on Saturdays, but today it was necessary so we could meet up with BU and MIT. We started the day with tours of the HCI Lab and Wellesley's Science Center and then got to business listening to short presentations everyone had prepared. Since there are no biologists in the HCI lab, presenting to us was a good opportunity for the BU and MIT teams to check if their presentations and projects were understandable to a less knowledgeable audience. Similarly, the Wellesley team got a chance to see if our interactive exhibit and digital interpretation of synthetic biology stayed true to its roots. I think everyone came away from this meetup with some important things to think about (one of the things we have to look at is making interactions more intuitive) and look forward to seeing what comes of it.
Lily's Notebook
NEGEM
We headed to Boston University today for our first official NEGEM meeting. I will admit it was a little nerve racking to be in a room full of biology-focused science students, after all that is what the iGEM competition is about. It was a bit intimidating hearing a lot of the presentations before us because of our lab’s computer science background and limited exposure to biology prior to this summer. However the twenty minute Q&A helped with understand much more than I want to admit.I thought that because we were doing the “community track” we wouldn’t have anything to contribute to these other students. After we presented our project I felt so much more at ease. People came up to us and asked questions and seemed to be genuinely interested in what we were doing. A lot of people commended us on doing something different and thought it was really cool. After all the presentations and question periods, we broke into groups to discuss these worksheets to help us engage each other about our opinions and research and it was really nice hearing from so many different people and their different lab experiences across universities.
BU/MIT meetup
Today we had the Boston University and MIT’s iGEM teams come to our lab today to collaborate and share our iGEM presentations and work. I had a lot of fun getting to know the students from other schools. We got to use them as test subjects or rather perform user studies on them as they tried our our iGEM multi-touch program and also helped test other projects going on in the lab. This meetup was our lab’s first time showing it and having our project"
TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"Model 3) During that time, further cataract damage may take place. The suggested order of treatment should be: start with GSR eyedrops until full prevention is in effect, the use 25HC eyedrops to reverse any existing cataract. Finally, stop 25HC eyedrop use, while continuing GSR eyedrops. (Model 1)
To speed up the time for full prevention to take place, a two eyedrop approach to quickly deliver sufficient GSR should be used. (Model 4)
Treatment
We use the results from our previous models, and apply them to treatment. The process is almost the exact same as that of Prevention. The only difference is that our treatment protein, CH25H, reverses cataract damage (Griffiths 2016). We find the exact concentration of CH25H to reverse a cataract of a given LOCS score. The delivery models are unchanged, with the exception that the concentration of protein delivery will be different.
We use the results of Model 1 to calculate the LOCS equivalent crystallin damage we need to reverse (“negative crystallin damage”). Then we use experimental results to calculate the concentration of CH25H needed to reverse the cataract. We do not use Model 3, as this is a one-time treatment. After applying the results of Model 4, we can find the final concentration needed in CH25H eyedrops.
We propose eyedrops with 0.8 mg/mL CH25H. The number of drops needed for treatment depends on a patient's current LOCS score, and is calculated in the software tool below.

Then, we investigated whether our protein was able to catalyze the biosilification reaction. To do that, we drew inspiration for the 2011 Minnesota iGEM team and their work about Si4 to evaluate the silification process. First, we used a source of silicic acid, the tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), which is an inactive form of silicic acid. By activating it in acidic conditions, we released the free silicic acid (Fig. 9A). After incubation with or without our fusion protein, we determined the quantity of free silicic acid by a spectrophotometric method, since biosilification process consumes silicic acid to form silica (Fig. 9B). We clearly observed a precipitation into the test tube, instead of the negative control (Fig. 10A). By quantifying it by molybdate assay using a standard curve (Fig. 10B), we deduced the corresponding mass of silicic acid left after silification: 33 µg. Before silification, the concentration was 208 µg/ml. The fusion protein led to the production of 175 µg of silica after 2 hours. Therefore, the silification yield after two hours is up to 84% with the C2 protein whereas the yield without the protein is 0% (Fig. 10C). We concluded that our protein worked.

(B) Standard curve of molybdate assay for determination of free silicic acid. (C) Determination of free silicic acid concentration by molybdate assay. (D) Silification efficiency, calculated from C.
Taken together, our results suggest that our fusion protein is able to bind to cellulose and to catalyze biosilification.

At this point we would like to express our gratitude towards everyone who helped us realize our project over the course of this summer.
General and project support
First of all, we want to thank our primary PIs, Prof. Andreas Burkovski , chair of Microbiology and Prof. Julien Bachmann , chair of Chemistry of thin film materials . Both also helped with fundraising by checking our application forms while also recommending our team to scientific foundations. Prof. Bachmann also helped with managing our finances.
We are also grateful that Prof. Yves Muller, chair of structural biology, provided their pET28a(+) vector.
Lab support
The laboratories and equipment, Prof. Andreas Burkovski gave us access to were used for cloning and protein expression/purification. Here we also want to thank PhD Ranata Stavracakis Peixoto for her patience and availability for all kinds of questions. Thank you for sharing room 01.585 as well as your working experience with the microorganisms we used. Other staff member who  introduced us to various methods and to the routines in the chair of Microbiology were: Susanne Gastiger , PhD Lisa Bäumer , Jens Möller , Laura Grebenstein , Dulanthi Weerasekera , and Patrik Blenk . Special thanks to PhD Gerald Seidel for checking our safety forms and giving extensive safety briefings before we started our Lab work.
Many thanks to IDT for the free synthesis of our sequences.
Prof. Bachmann's laboratories were used for various analysis experiments of our protein constructs. Much appreciated is the help of: MSc Pascal Büttner for communication with the chair, ALD, DC sputtering and ellipsometry, PhD Ignacio Mínguez Bacho and PhD Sebastian Bochmann for SEM.

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," a digital lab notebook. The digital communication in place, we also set up strategies for actual face-to-face communication.
In the first phase of the project, concerned primarily with planning and raising funds, fortnightly team leader meetings would allow for the debates needed to propel an idea towards its realization, while the day-to-day work took place in the subteams. Later, when the project was at full speed and everyone was working on very specific tasks, we replaced the team leader meetings by a “diagnost-x co-working” – every Tuesday and Thursday night, we would work at the same time in the laboratories, offices and even in the kitchen of Prof. Schuelkes facilities. These co-workings ensured many questions could be solved at the same time, not requiring everyone to follow each and every problem. You can find out about the detailed work of the Science Team here . The Entrepreneur Team shows its work here , and the results of the Collaborations and Public Relations Teams can be found here and here . In order not to omit a part of work without which this project could not have existed, we lay open our funding strategy below.
Fundraising: How we financed one year of diagnost-x
The basic principles of our project can be divided into three aspects:
Humanitarian Aid
Establishment of new technology
Encouraging young scientists
All of these aspects are of interest for different technological as well as charitable institutions.
We approached these institutions by presenting on the one hand the global challenge of T.solium infection and on the other hand the opportunities that go along with the toehold switch technology. In this respect, we aimed to show potential sponsors and promoters how this technology could revolutionize field diagnostics – and to present the advantages of a team consisting of young, motivated scientists who are not yet primed to think inside their silos.
By this approach, we were able to convince different institutions to sponsor different aspects of our project. Whereas corporates of the biotechnological sector supported us with equipment, finance and consulting corporates were convinced of our team structure, and would support our participation in the iGEM competition. Institutional funding would often be given for international collaborations such as our project with India, or our participation in the Cystinet conference.

RHIT,2016,Team:RHIT#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," with a fragment containing the BB prefix and suffix flanked with 40 base pairs of homology to the vector on both sides.
BBa_K2077001: pSB413-GPD: RFC 10 Compatible HIS3-selectable S. cerevisiae Expression Vector
Overview
This is a RFC10 standard yeast expression vector adapted from the widely used plasmid pSB413-GPD. The MCS of p413-GPD was replaced with the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix and an illegal PstI restriction site near the HIS3 promoter of p413-GPD was removed. In the resultant plasmid, pSB413-GPD (5828 bp), the BioBrick prefix and suffix is situated between the strong constitutive yeast GPD promoter (TDH3) and CYC1 terminator allowing for facile cloning and expression of translational units in yeast. Standard VF2 and VR primer binding sites are included and M13 primer binding sites bracket the promoter and terminator. The plasmid has a ColE1 origin and ampicillin resistance for replication in E. coli. It also contains a yeast CEN/ARS and HIS3-selectable marker to provide high fidelity maintenance and low copy number in S. cerevisiae.
Design
Just like in p416-GPD p413-GPD has an illegal PstI restriction site just outside of its selectable marker, HIS3.  Unlike p416-GPD, however, this vector does not have and sbfI site surrounding its PstI site.
To remove the PstI site we decide to cut out a large chunk of the vector using its NheI and NsiI restriction sites and designed a replacement fragement with 30 base pairs of homology to the rest of the vector on both ends.  We used a single nucleatide substitution to remove the PstI site from the replacement fragment.  After following the NEBuilder protocol we successfully removed the PstI site resulting in the following sequence.
'
We also needed to replace the MCS in pSB413-GPD with the RFC 10 standard prefix and suffix.  We removed the MCS in p413-GPD by cutting the XbaI and XhoI and running a NEBuilder assembly with a fragment containing the BB prefix and suffix flanked with 40 base pairs of homology to the vector on both sides."

Figure 20: Shows the doubling time of the two bacterial strains: Top10 (white bars) and Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec (black bars). Each bacterial strain was cultivated in LB, 2xYT and TB.
In Figure 20 it can be seen that Top10/pSB1C3 grows slower than Top10 in all of the three tested media. Students t-test with 95% confidence determines p values lower than 0.0002 for the difference in doubling time in each of the three types of media. Growth of the same strains in TB and LB had similar doubling times. The maximum growth rate was twice as large in 2xYT as compared with the other media.

Figure 20: Shows the doubling time of the two bacterial strains: Top10 (white bars) and Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec (black bars). Each bacterial strain was cultivated in LB, 2xYT and TB.
Figure 21: Shows OD_600 of Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec after 20 hours of growth in the three different types of media.
As seen in Figure 21 Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec reached an OD that is twice as high when grown in 2xYT as compared to growth in LB. For growth in TB Top10/pSB1C3-panK+sec reached an OD that is four times as high, as compared to growth in LB. Based on students t-test these results are also significant with p values lower than 0.0001. Despite the faster growth in 2xYT the final amount of cells is significantly larger for growth in TB media, indicating that this media is more suitable for production of PHB.
To sum it up 2xYT is optimal for rapid growth of bacteria but the bacteria also reaches steady state faster suggesting that the bacteria depletes the media and therefore stops replicating, whereas LB media and TB media has slower doubling time. In both figure 19 and figure 21 it is apparent that TB provides the highest concentration of cells, which is desirable for production of PHB. Although TB media is the media where the bacteria grow at the slowest rate, it is also the media that produces most bacteria over time and therefore it is expected that this is the media that would be able to give the highest yield of PHB. which is why TB media was chosen for further experiments.
In conclusion, we created a PHB promoter/R"

We are SCUT Champion Park. Our team spirit is efficient and happy. In order to show the spirit and personality of our team, our designers have designed our own Team Identity.
Team Flag
The middle is our team logo. Our logo is a distortion of tetracycline, and combined with the first letter of our school name’s    abbreviation.
The color of home flag is the same blue as South China University of Technology's school badge, on behalf of passion and brave. The color of away flag is white which represents the exploring spirit of academic research.
Team Uniform
Our team uniform is a white long sleeve. The front logo combines the tetracycline and school English initials S, not only showing the scientific nature of biochemical research, but also highlighting the school name. The color, the same as our school’s badge, reflects the characteristics of calm. The back pattern is made of fluorescent material, passing out the modern sense.
Bookmark
The front of the bookmark is the abbreviation of South China University of Technology as a design element. These four letters combined with biological chemical elements. The color, including red, yellow and blue, is lively, generous and full of vitality. The team logo is on the opposite side making the bookmarks highly conspicuous.
Visual Identity
Our logo is derived from the molecular formula of tetracycline which is the main element of our experiment.Draw it out to a single regular hexagon as a creative element. The structure of this arrangement of hexagon is called a honeycomb structure. This structure reflects the feasibility and effectiveness of our research.

Our survey reached 50 people, 37% of which were between the ages of 40-65. The rest of the sample population included various age groups, each of which made up less than 37% of all responses.
The following pie chart represents the level of education of our participants:
Most of our respondents (69.7%) were not on an iGEM team, but the remaining 30.3% were on iGEM teams (particularly NYU Abu Dhabi, INSA-UPS_France, Groningen, and Greece). Stony Brook University helped gather many of our non-iGEM survey respondents. Out of all our respondents, 60.5% had a post-graduate degree (with 76.9% of this subset having a degree in Natural/Social/Physical Sciences.)
Patient feedback on receiving treatments
When we asked about the willingness of taking a treatment for any illness, 93% of the respondents said they would be willing to take some sort of a medication to treat an illness they may have. The other 7% opted to not take a medication; this could be due to a variety of reasons, such as perceived efficacy of available treatments for the illness, accessibility of the treatment, cost of the treatment and potential side effects of the treatment.
When we asked patients to select (all that apply) what types of treatment they would use for a life-threatening illness (like cancer), most patients, 97.7% agreed to using an oral medication. The second most popular choice was a topical medication, at 83.7% . The types of treatments mentioned in the survey include oral medications, topical medications, injections, surgery and intravenous shots.
We broke this question down by formulating a question for each type of treatment method, specifically asking the respondent to rank how willing he/she is to take the treatment method to remedy a life-threatening illness on a scale of 1 to 5 (1=least willing/not comfortable using) and 5=most willing/comfortable using). The questions were limited to the aforementioned types of treatments. Out of those types, oral medication received the highest percentage of 5s (76.5% ), whereas surgery received the lowest percentage ( 23.3% ). Although surgery may arguably be the most effective method compared to the rest that were mentioned, it is not a very comfortable procedure to undergo. We deduced that surgery therefore was not such a popular choice as oral medication because of the issue of comfort, but other factors may play into this result as well.

Cell targeting
Context
After the tissue vector action, comes the cell  vector , this one is a modified bacteriophage which has the ability to infect eukaryotic cells. Lambda phage, because of its high capacity of cloning and a capsid structure adapted to a concentrated presence of exogenous proteins, is a good candidate to design an eukaryotic tissue vector . The penton base originally from the adenovirus capsid appears as a promising candidate for Lambda phage targeting. Indeed, it is endowed of several functions like the cell receptors link, the viral particles internalisation and the release of the capsid by the endosome.
Objective
Our objectives are to design a cell vector of Lambda phage type recombined with a penton base from the adenovirus 5 fused by its D protein . The tissue vector should be able to integer the cell, go out of the endosome, transport its DNA to the nucleus of the cell and finally to transcript its therapeutic genes .

1. For non-coding Biobrick parts this prefix must be placed 5' upstream of       the part:
GAATTC GCGGCCGC T TCTAGA G
2. For BioBrick parts coding for proteins, the following sequence should be placed 5' upstream of the start codon (ATG) of the coding region:
GAATTC GCGGCCGC T TCTAG
Should have appropriate terminating sequence
All parts containing start codons other than ATG must be changed to       possess ATG as the start codon.  Though not mandatory, it is highly recommended, that all coding regions terminate with in-frame TAATAA       stop codons, replacing other stop codons (TGA, TAG) if needed.
To ensure that the biological part conforms to these standards, researchers have to carry out multiple checks and modifications, some of which include:
Checking for presence of illegal and avoidable restriction sites in the part.
Modification of part sequence to replace illegal and avoidable restriction sites, depending on chassis organism.
Addition of suitable prefix according to standards described above.
Addition of suitable suffix according to standards described above.
BBrickIt: The one-stop solution to your BioBricking needs
Based on our own experience and a survey that we conducted with iGEM 2018 teams (results can be found here ) we found that one has to alternate between different programmes to achieve all requirements to construct a BioBrick.
We found ourselves alternating between different programmes such NEB Cutter, various codon optimization tools and the iGEM Parts Registry. Although this process is repetitive and tedious (more so when creating/submitting many parts), it also is very important for the sequence that is generated to be free of errors, the chances of which increases when done manually.
We sought to create an open source online tool which would enable users to check, modify and validate their parts according to the RFC 10 standard, all in a single programme thereby making the entire process simpler, faster and error-free. We believe that this tool will be particularly helpful to first-time iGEM participants.

Yao made compliments on our attention we had paid to relevant laws and regulations and he answered the questions we were concerned about. He made us realize when we formulated and enforced the laws, we should take the complex commercial benefit and the national overall background into account. We found out the contradiction of innovation and strict control. When China encourages “Mass entrepreneurship and innovation”, the law may not keep pace with the innovation of the new medicines. Therefore, we hope to draw the attention of departments concerned by summarizing these questions and suggestions.  Finally, Yao emphasized, no matter how much benefit were involved, we should always put the right of life in top priority. Behind the laws and regulations, living lives were what our projects were truly facing.

Dr. Li Ye Associate Professor, Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy Fudan University
How is a laboratory project transformed into industrialization? Prof. Ye has been dedicated to the research of tumor immunotherapy drugs, owning multiple patents, and has been involved in many enterprise technology development projects. We come to Zhangjiang pharmaceutical valley, which is not only the location of the school of pharmacy, but also the base of biomedical science and technology industry gathering a large number of pharmaceutical companies. Ye introduced the current limitations of CAR-T therapy, and proposed that if our cell therapy could be universal, it would greatly reduce the cost of treatment. She made us realize that safety and targeting are two sides of tumor immunotherapy. Therefore, in the later experiment purpose and implementation, we not only improved the work efficiency of STEP system, but also strengthened the attention to security. In addition, Ye stressed that a new drug cannot be popularized by a single medical or scientific institution and must be industrialized. Therefore, we went to Shanghai Pharmaceutical R&D Collaborative Innovation Center to participate in the Open Day for consultation services on new drug development.

What kind of role do the hospitals and patients play? Li’s experience is quite unique. As an expert in medical disputes for decades, he now works on the management in the biggest private hospital of Shanghai after serving the army as a surgeon. Professionally, he analyzed the application prospects of a new medicine from three aspects for us: clinical doctor, hospital management and patient. In terms of our wondering that whether a clinical trial would cause any medical disputes in China, Li admitted that the lack of effective communication between doctors and patients is what to blame for. Clinical trials should never be permitted without informed consent, concerning its high"

Meetup at Huazhong Agricultural University
On 23rd and 24th of August, we participated in a sharing conference established by Huazhong Agricultural University. Zhou Yu, Qin Zhen, Rong Hui and Zhang Qiuhao from our team went to Wuhan and met up with students from Peking University, Sun Yat-Sen University, Wuhan University and some other universities. We gave a presentation about our project and also got to know what other teams were busy with. An internet-based group was set up for further discussion. Another team from Wuhan focuses on the fatty acid as well, thus our two teams shared experience for a mutual progress. Although some of the team’s project is quite different from ours, their experience about problems solving is still valuable to us.
Internship in Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, CAS
In late August, 3 members of our team, Zhou Yu, Rao Bing and Zhu Ruichi, went to Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology for the function test of the plasmids we built. They conducted a few experiments there including extracting fatty acids and examine the species of fatty acids under the guidance of the PhD students there. One of the significant experiment they did there was they applied fermenter to cultivate a huge amount of E.coli for more quantity of fatty acids.
Small-scale Industrialization
After the experiments in Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Zhou Yu went to the factory in Qingdao with our project. He tried to apply what we studied to practice. The technician taught him some experience on fermentation. At the same time, he also learned something from the industry and managed to apply to our project. Huge fermenters were used for fermentation in a large scale.

Updated Chip Design
The CODA article produced zinc fingers that bound a GNN or TNN F2 with either a ANN, GNN, or TNN F3. These results lead us to the following distribution of three types of zinc finger backbones (Zif268, similar but not equal to Zif268, and dissimilar to Zif268) across our 6 target DNA sequences. With 55,000 spaces on our chip, each of the 6 target DNA sequences is allotted 9,150 spaces with 100 spaces set aside for control zinc fingers from CODA and OPEN. Note that the values in the table below represent the number of helices inserted into each type of backbone.

N.B.: The chip will only be holding our F1 zinc fingers- the F2 and F3 will be on a separate plasmid that we must make ourselves
To Do: The distribution of helices to each backbone set/target sequence needs to be finalized. For example, the program can generate a set of helices for the Zif268 backbone to be applied to the colorblindness target sequence, but should the same set or a completely different helix set be applied to the Zif268 backbones for the familial hypercholesterolemia target sequences?
If we want to test the effect of the backbone, would need to keep the helices constant-- but we could do this within a single target, to keep all other variables constant
Finishing the generator
We finished and finalized the program that generates zinc finger sequences. The following changes were made today:
We incorporated the data from Persikov's database into out generator.

The confirmed construct was transfected into two mammalian cells, HEK293FT and HepG2 cell lines. GFP signal of the construct was compared with pEGF-N1 plasmid that contains constitutive CMV promoter. However, no GFP signal could be detected.
Since FABP1 promoter contained illegal restriction sites for BioBrick submission, we conducted multi site-directed mutagenesis to elimitate EcoRI and PstI from the coding sequence. (see Mutagenesis protocol 1,2 and 3 ).
The FABP1 promoter was to be characterized by over-expression of EGFP reporter in the presence of high fatty acid concentration in the medium1. However, no EGFP signal could be detected.
After several attempts of site-mutagenesis of promoter in FABP1 – EGFP – BBa_J176171 construct, we found that the plasmid degrades at a high temperature. We tested heat sensitivity of the plasmid BBa_J176171 and found that the plasmid degrades at denaturation step (95 °C) of polymerase chain reaction. Then, we took an alternative experiment by cloning FABP1 promoter into pBlueScript KS(+). Due to time constrain, two mutagenesis attempts were taken but both of them were not successful.

We planned to clone  PPAR-alpha promoter from human genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We designed three sets of primers in upstream and downstream of promoter sequence, for different polymerases and referencing on Pineda Torra team’s experiment2. In addition, polymerase chain reaction was conducted at different temperatures, primer concentrations and buffers. However, none of the primers could successfully clone the PPAR-alpha promoter.

Esterification & Extraction
Esterification and Extraction
Outline:
We are proposing to accumulate free fatty acids in Neurospora         crassa in order to produce a usable fuel. Our plan is to     convert these fatty acids into biodiesel by esterifying them     with methanol and using an acid catalyst. The reaction proceeds     in the following manner:
Our procedure uses methanolic-HCL directly on the cell      mass in order to esterify the fatty acids in the fungus. A      by-product of the reaction is water so we make sure to use      dry samples to push the reaction more towards completion.      The direct esterification method was chosen because it is      a simple method and has been shown to be more efficient an      extraction/esterification method then lipid extraction and      then esterification of the free lipid2,3. We separated the      newly created methyl esters from the reaction by adding water      and hexane, the biodiesel will go into the top hexane layer.
Base catalyzed esterification is another method of      esterification and generally requires a lower reaction      temperature and less reaction time, however this was not a good      option for our project because base catalysis does not esterifiy      free fatty acids, the very lipid we are accumulating3.
Another part of our project went into designing a theoretical      plant for large scale production of biodiesel. The following      is a schematic of what the plant would look like
The design is intended to recycle as much reagent as      possible, mainly by removing hexane through negative pressure,      and distilling off methanol. The methanol distillation is also      important so that that toxin is removed from the water before      it is returned back to the water supply.
Overall this project looks at what is necessary to produce      a renewable fuel source on a low cost food-stock.
Results:
N. crassa was grown on three different substrates; Potato-glucose medium, solid paper mill sludge with glucose and fertilizer, and wheat straw with glucose. The purpose was to look for differences in fatty acid metabolism based on these substrates. Cultures were grown for five days and samples were used for Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis using both mass spectrometry (MS) to determine which fatty acids are present, and Flame Ionization detector (FID) GC to"

G.B. Ermentrout, and L. Edelstein-Keshet. Cellular Automata Approaches to Biological Modeling. Journal of Theoretical Biology,160(1):97-133, January 1993
. From a synthetic biology point of view, this connection between a formal, algorithmical mathematical model and similar expression observed in living cells poses the interesting question of whether this behavior can be syntheticallly implemented within living cells, thereby making them generate controllable patterns.
The approach that synthetic biology propagates, designing modular genetic components and combining these to comprise more complex genetic systems, is particularly fit to tackle a problem of this kind since in the workings of cellular automata we can roughly distinguish the following abillities that cells should posess: to switch between a discrete number of states, to communicate information about their state to their neighbors and to interpret and act upon information received from their neighbors. Within the synthetic biology framework these functionalities can be independently designed and subsequently combined to display total system behavior.
Conway's Game of Life
The particular cellular automaton which we aim to design is ‘Conway’s Game of Life’,        one of the best known and most extensively studied cellular automata. It was proposed by mathematician        John Conway [6]
Martin Gardner. Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway’s new solitaire game “Life”. Scientific American 223:120-123, October 1970.
in 1970 as a simplification of previous research by von Neumann [1]. In Conway’s Game of Life        cells exist and interact on a two-dimensional grid. Two states are distinguished, in the game’s language         these states are termed ‘alive’ or ‘dead’, and cells can switch between these two states depending on         their number of live neighbors: if either more than three or less than three of a cells neighbors are         alive, that cell switches to the dead state. If exactly three of a cells neighbors are alive, that cell         switches to the live state. We use a slight, but not uncommon, simplification of the original ruleset, where having two alive neighbors would imply that a cell remains in its current state. The terminology stems from the idea that, defined as above, the game can be used to simulate ‘real life’ processes where living entities tend to die in overcrowded regions whereas also they are not able to survive on their own.

PARTS OVERVIEW
CU LATER PARTS OVERVIEW
For our project we are using parts primarily serving the function of capturing ions, holding on to them and precipitating out of solution.
This includes usage of parts taken from:
the T4 bacteriophage
Cup1 from Yeast
CutA from E. coli
elastin-like polymers (ELPs).
The regulators we are using are:
an inducible promoter induced by IPTG(BBa_I712074)
a medium-strong ribosomal-binding site(BBa_J61100)
and a double terminator(BBa_B0014)"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," easy and quick to use, but also so that it will be completely safe for the person using it as well as the environment it will be used in. We incorporated safety into our design in a number of ways. First of all, we decided to use an in-vitro system. Although we are engineering our bacteria to contain our genes of interest, we are using purified proteins from the bacteria in our actual test. This not only allows us to make use of a small, test strip that is able to be stored for long periods of time, but it ensures that our genetically modified bacteria will not be released into the environment no matter what happens to the strip system. This will allow for easier disposal of the strips as well as increased safety for the user.
Figure 2. Design of test strip for our system
Our next safety concern was surrounding the functionality of the prototype. Although we would not be using any actual bacteria in it, it was important to have something in the strip that would allow for a positive control, similar to what we see for pregnancy tests. In that system, one blue line appears in the test window in order to tell you that the test is working as it is supposed to, a sort of 'positive control' for the flow of the liquid and for the reagents. In order for our system to achieve similar reliability, we need the same thing. For our strip, the best way to ensure that our test is working the way we expect it to would be to have an actual positive control. In our system this would obviously need to be the shiga toxin gene, in order to verify in each test that our TALEs are binding as expected. Now this poses a problem for us. Not only is this not something that we could amplify from the genome ourselves or get synthesized by a company, but it is not something that we would really want to drench our strips in to sell to users. As such, we needed to find a safe way to do this. So we went and consulted with Dr. Glen Armstrong, a researcher at the University of Calgary who studies pathogenic E. coli.
Dr. Armstong had a number of suggestions for us in terms of refining our TALE binding sequences. He advised us to consider looking for multiple strains of E. coli, essentially creating a multiplexed system. To that end, he helped us to restructure our system to incorporate two different target sequences, as we had initially planned on using only one target sequence for the TALEs. This would allow us to detect a greater breadth in the strains of E. coli that we can detect. "

Improved Part – BBa_K2868028
4xCBD Fusion Protein Expression System T7 promoter, a salI cut-site, then a start codon then a Flag, Lumio, 6x polyhistidine tag, followed by BBacillus circulans chitin binding domain, flexible linker, S. griseus chitin chitin binding domain, then another linker, followed by Bacillus circulans chitin binding domain, flexible linker, S. griseus chitin binding domain, stop codon, a bglII cut-site, and finally t7 terminator.
This composite part contains all the biological DNA machinery to constitutively express the fusion protein 4xCBD when functional T7 DNA polymerase is inside the cell with the plasmid carrying the composite part. The fusion protein is four chitin binding domains fused together with flexible linkers. Our rationale was that four chitin binding domains would allow each protein to bind strongly to chitin than a single chitin binding domain alone, and also allow for the linking of two different chitin surfaces when pressed together with this protein acting as a glue in between them. This is an improvement upon the basic part BBa_T2028, which is a single B. circulans chitin-binding domain. Our fusion protein includes two BBa_T2028 B.circulans chitin binding domains, and an additional two chitin binding domains from S. griseus. We diversified the chitin binding domains to allow for easier DNA printing of our part. This whole linked structure also incorporates a 6x polyhistidine tag for the purification of the protein product.
We were able to successfully express this construct in the BL21 derivative E. coli cell line T7 Express from New England Biolabs, purify this protein using Ni-NTA spin columns for his-tagged protein purification, and test it as a bioadhesive on mycelium (as the fungal cell wall incorporates chitin) and cardboard substrates. Although it actually bonded cardboard together slightly stronger than it bonded mycelium together, it"

We met in Berlin for playing Volleyball and they invited our team to take part in a workshop with the Boston Consulting group, that we gladly accepted.
In return we helped them to get the vector pSB1C3, with which they have had troubles.

Tools
During our project we made extensive use of Gibson Assembly to manufacture our parts, and have submitted an RFC to the BioBricks Foundation to help future teams make best use of this technique.
Along with this, we also constructed a number of tools to assist the synthetic biologists of the future:
Gibthon Construct Designer allows the user to enter a series of BioBrick or GenBank IDs in a specific order and computes the appropriate primers for Gibson Assembly .
BioBrick → GenBank allows parts from the registry to be downloaded in .gb format, making them compatible with a wide range of biological software.
The Ligation Calculator is a small calculator to help you work out the proportions to use for ligation in BioBrick assembly without having to worry about units.
The E.glometer is a cheap, easily built, piece of electronics for measuring bioluminescence.  It allows scientists without access to expensive plate readers to measure bacterial light output and has potential applications in quantitative biosensors .

Currently Wet-lab members are working on several proteins that according to previous research have been pointed out to have a positive effect on repigmentation of vitiligo affected skin areas. The idea behind why we chose the biomolecules of interest is presented under the section planning on our wiki homepage.  In this section we try to explain a simple interaction network of the specific genes coding the biomolecules. The goal is to give a clear picture of how the genes interact with other potential genes in a way that could result a restroring of the affected skin color.
As a starting point, we began with the article Strömberg S et al. (2008) . In this paper they identified some 859 genes as differentially regulated genes in pigment skin cells called melanocytes. These genes can be classified in several groups based on their possible cellular role (Strömberg et al. 2008). These groups are:
Developing melanocytes
Melanin synthesis (melanogenesis) and transport of melanosomes to keratinocytes
Cell adhesion
Antigen presenting
In fig. 1, a summarized regulatory network of some candidate genes are illustated. We intentionally chose to present interactions that have currently been investigated in order to support our study.
Figure 2 Regulators and transcription-factor binding sites on the MITF promoter. Levy et al., 2006
out of those genes, it seemed that MITF is one of the most regulated and regulating genes in vitiligo disease. This was the first block of the map. . The MITF promoter is targeted by several transcription factors that are important in neural-crest development and signaling. Transcription factors implicated in the regulation of the MITF promoter include PAX3, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), SOX10, LEF1 (also known as TCF), one cut domain 2 (ONECUT-2) and MITF itself, Fig. 2 (Levy et al., 2006). It also regulates both"

This gel indicates that the restricted product hasn't been lost as the OBP2A gene fragment can be seen as a distinct band at 500 bp. A re-ligation of OBP2A into the pSB1C3 backbone will now occur.

Figure 4: Presequence Digest of pSB1C3-OBP2A. All seven plasmid purifications of the overnight cultures done on the 26/6 were digested to see if they contained the OBP2A insert. It is clear from the gel that all but sample 3 contain the insert for OBP2A as they all have faint bands at 500 bp's which corresponds to the size of OBP2A. It also appears that sample 5 contains the highest concentration, so that will be the sample that is sent for sequencing.

Figure 5: Presequence digest of pUT18-OBP2A To determine if any samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that of the  5 samples that were digested only two are show to have the OBP2A insert, therefore sample 2 will be sent for sequencing.

Figure 6: Amplification of OBP2A for insertion into pT25 vector . This is the PCR product from the amplification of OBP2A for cloning into pT25. The gel indicates OBP2A has been amplified successfully since the observed band corresponds to the expected size of 100 bp.

Figure 7: Presequence Digest of pT25-OBP2A In order to determine if any of the samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that samples 5, 6 and 7 may have inserts in them as they each have two distinct bands, one of which corresponds to the 100 bp size for the OBP2A for pT25. As a result all three samples will be sent for sequencing.

Human Practices
Introduction
Through targeted practices, we were able to gain thorough insights for each specific aspect of our project as it evolved. The flowchart summarises the integration of our human practices during the whole project. We chose to prioritise our contacts to address information not covered by the published literature, obtain the most up to date and relevant facts, and develop a understanding of the future directions of our project. We also aimed to maintain a sustained dialogue with the experts we approached as our ideas progressed during the project, to help us gain more specific and useful information that is outlined on this page.
Wet Lab
Professor Maike Bublitz
Professor Bublitz of the University of Oxford researches the molecular mechanisms of protein transport. We contacted her to obtain advice on the optimisation of our protein purification protocols and designing in vitro TEV protease assays to more accurately represent our cell free system was invaluable to our wet lab. Unfortunately, due to complications in the wet lab  we were unable to purify the required proteins the first time round and could not repeat the protocols because of time constraints. However, her advice remains highly relevant for the characterisation of our parts in a cell-free environment, which is something we hope to pick up on in the future.
Dr Miguel Hernan Vicco
Dr Vicco is a researcher at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Argentina currently working on immuno-endocrine parameters marking the course of Chagas disease, and on vaccine development against Trypanosoma cruzi. We approached him for information about cruzipain as a biomarker. He explained the potential difficulties of low specificity, sensitivity and undefined concentration associated with using cruzipain as an antigenic biomarker in his work.  However, since our project involves the detection of the protease activity of cruzipain, the usual problems of a low antigen"

Description
Every one of us is creating, storing and transmitting lots of data every     day. Text messages, emails, online clouds are only a few examples.     Since 2002 the amount of digitally stored data has exceeded the     amount of data stored on analog media. By now less than 6 % of the     world’s data is still analog [1] .
It is not surprising that data breaches orchestrated by hackers     are on the rise as well. Financial and legal records, military and     government documents, these are examples of important information     that must be preserved for a long time, but could cause great     damage in the wrong hands. Moreover, the Dutch National Cyber     Security Center revealed that it is us citizens who are most likely to be    attacked by cybercrime. We have become a civilization dependent on     information, and this information must be stored somewhere. As a     result, we are faced with two problems: where do we store all of     our data, and how do we keep it safe?
In addition to the low safety of digital and analog data storage, they     require a large amount of resources like storage space and     electricity. Data is stored in huge data centers as can be seen in Figure 1. In 2015, 416.2 TWh were used for storage of digital     data 3 costing 41 billion USD. This is higher than the annual     power consumption of the entire UK [2] , and is responsible for     approximately 2% of global greenhouse emissions, rivaling the     airline industry [4] . In 2015 about 2,500,000 TB of new data were     produced per day [1] . While the densest storage medium in use has a     capacity of 10 GB/mm³, data up to a density of up to 109 GB/ mm³     can be stored in DNA [5] . It is furthermore expected that the     demand for silicon, which is required for flash memory, is to exceed     silicon supply by 2040 [6] .

2.  Your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
If used for large-scale alkanes production, our project would not raise any safety issues, for the organism we are using this year is Escherichia coli which is of limited danger to the environment, and we have taken safety measures to ensure that the device we make would not increase bacterial survival in the case of accidental release.
If our method of producing alkanes became widely available, it would be more friendly to the environment compared with traditional chemical methods in that we use renewable carbohydrate as raw materials and waste disposal is largely reduced. Therefore, there wouldn't be any risks to the public and the environment.
3. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?
As a compulsive curriculum, the entire laboratory personnel have taken the class about laboratory safety before conducting an experiment. Besides, we all pass the test of our university about how to ensure the safety of laboratory. In safety training, we acquire the knowledge of how to deal with the dangerous situation, how to face the leakage of toxic reagents, how to cope with the contaminated biological materials and how to manipulate the laboratory apparatus properly.
In addition to avoiding the risk of accidents, we also learn and comply with the relevant laws and regulations in order to keep both safety and security. Through participating regular fire drills and speech about safety, security awareness of us is rising all the time.
4 .Under what biosafety provisions do you work?
This is te institution biosafety guideline: https://2012.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Safety We have a Peiyang Biological Control Committee that scrutinize our project looking for potential dangers and offered advice about laboratory facilities for a safer environment. This help us to ensure the biosafety of our project, and we are very pleased to have this committee's supervision on our plans.

Pierre Dillard
Pierre is currently in his ninth semester at the ESBS. Previously he has done two years in CPGE BCPST where he received a good education in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. In the ESBS he specialized himself in synthetic biology because he think that this field can be the future of the biology. iGEM was a seducing project for him because of the intellectual challenge and the team work. To see the evolves of the project all summer long was very grateful. He enjoys also all the new skills acquired during this work.
Raphaël Doineau
Raphael is just like the other in his ninth semester at the ESBS. Originally from a math physics and chemistry curriculum he chose the ESBS for his international orientation and the synthetic biology approach of biotechnology. In order to obtain further biological background knowledge and skills, he decided to interrupt his curriculum to perform two six months internships in two different labs before continuing ESBS and joining the iGEM team.
Renaud Renault
Also known as Reno carré (Reno square) he tends to be famous for his experiments on the lack of sleep on himself. As some of his fellows, he is in the third year of ESBS, after having intensively studied Maths, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and even more for 2 years in Classe Prépa. Since that time, he has  been a MATLAB freak, coding some cool stuff you can see on his youtube channel (for instance http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm0qQlzh0hw ) and earns his living (sushis are quite expensive) by doing clinical trials. He got interested in Synthetic Biology quite early, and more especially with the iGEM competition. He originally got the idea of engineering a controllable protease which was the basis of our project and is really glad that others were as excited and motivated about it as him.
Sebastien Pigeot
Sébastien decided to study biology after obtaining his A level. He studied for two years in a special school combining half practical courses and half theoretical courses. After completing those two years he decided to travel and did a Bachelor in Science at the Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. Finally, he returned to France to Strasbourg and joined the ESBS (Ecole Supérieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg). He discovered a tri-national school with a great"

5. Thank you!
From the 24th to the 26th of July 2018, the first ever iGEM EurAsian Meetup took place in Shenzhen, Peoples’ Republic of China. We collaborated with our high-school buddy team BGIC-Global to organize this important meetup. 24 teams from all over Asia and Europe joined us in Shenzhen, with a live stream available for those who could not be there in person. We focused on teams getting to know each other, raising each others projects to a higher level trough practice and feedback sessions and creating a better understanding of each other by presenting a bioethicial viewpoint from both continents. We hope to have contributed in a significant way to intercontinental scientific and cultural exchange in the iGEM community by establishing meaningful collaborations between teams from Europe and Asia.
1. First Day
We kicked off the meetup with a strong focus on science and plenty of opportunities to get to know each other. After inspiring welcoming words from Dr. Doris Yang, vice-dean of BGI College, Dr. Yue (Chantal) Shen and Dr. Ying Gu gave an interesting talk on their work as Chief and Senior R&D Director at the Synthesis and Gene Editing Platform of the China National Gene Bank. We introduced the buddy system; playing matchmaker and pairing  teams up based on their project contents and specific needs. They met each other in a short break and then combined their shared knowledge and skills to compete in the collaboration quiz. With everyone a group of new friends richer, we went into the after-iGEM presentation by Ms. Hong Chen, who explained to us all opportunities for continuing iGEM after October. Then we set out to practice for the Giant Jamboree with the project presentations. Each team had prepared a 10 minute version of their final presentation, which they presented to half of the group. They received 10 minutes of feedback and questions from not only experienced supervisors, but also from very engaged fellow iGEMers. We were very happy and proud to see such great participation.
“I got so many wonderful suggestions and saw so many wonderful presentations!”

Question: Can S. elongatus grow in ATCC:BG-11 mixed medium? Can it grow during induction (+150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM IPTG) as it should in our final co-culture?
Background:S. elongatus can grow in BG-11 but B. subtilis cannot, regardless of 30 mM sucrose supplementation. Therefore it was hypothesize that it might be able to grow on ATCC:BG-11 medium (later confirmed when the medium is supplemented with 30mM sucrose). Here, we test whether S. elongatus can grow in ATCC:BG-11 medium at different salt concentrations.
Experiment: S. elongatus was inoculated from BGH5 plates containing 10μg/ml chloramphenicol. In the series without antibiotics, S. elongatus was inoculated from plates without chloramphenicol. Experiments were done in 150mL baffled flasks in a total of 50mL ATCC:BG-11 medium with 10μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cultures were induced 3 days later, with 0.1mM IPTG and addition of different salt concentrations (0mM, 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM and 300mM) and incubated in a light chamber at 30°C while shaking at 250rpm. OD at 730 was measured twice a day for 5 days.
Result: CscB permease transformed S. elongatus grew at a slower rate compared to WT regardless of chloramphenicol addition, suggesting that rerouting carbon reflux through cscB, and not selective pressure, was the major inhibitor of growth rate (Fig. 13). This was confirmed by omitting IPTG at 300mM NaCl (we originally wanted to do this at 150mM  NaCl because sucrose export was higher at this concentration than 300mM, however, these samples were lost) (Fig. 14). We observe a full rescue from growth impairment, confirming the IPTG inducible cscB gene to be at fault.
Taken together, these data show that both the wild type S. elongatus and the cscB permease strain have the ability to grow in ATCC:BG-11 medium. However, the cscB gene is being induced too strongly. In the future, one might consider using a weaker promoter to sustain the culture during cscB induction"

Our financial research
A big thank you to all the teams that answered our questions and helped us to assemble our financial analyses of iGEM Expenditure. It really means a lot to us.
Previous teams
Although these teams are not present in this year's competition, they were very helpful to us and we feel the gratitude to consider them our collaborators.
The 2015 USP-Brazil iGEM team gave us really useful advice and mentoring, even long before we even started our project. A lot o skype calls with them lead us up the way of synthetic biology and iGEM itself.
The 2015 UFMG team also helped us cement most of our basis needed to develop our project. Even tough they are not taking part in the 2016 competition, we participated in their anual Synthetic Biology Summer Course, in which they covered much information about the competition and project itself. It even had a experimental project included. Not to mention how much light the shined upon us with information, tons of helpful and insightful classes and talks were absolutely vital for what we have achieved today."

""The activity of alkylhydroperoxide reductase (Ahp) is so high that, although H2O2 is formed endogenously inside aerobic E. coli at a rate of about 15 μM/s, the steady-state concentration does not exceed 20 nM.""
""When these higher doses of H2O2 saturate Ahp, the H2O2 concentration rises beyond the 0.1 μM threshold for OxyR activation (48, 58). Catalase is strongly induced, and it becomes the primary scavenging enzyme. The katG-encoded catalase of E. coli exhibits a high Km, so it is not saturated by even millimolar doses of H2O2 (60). Importantly, because catalase dismutates H2O2, its turnover rate is not restricted by the availability of reducing equivalents.""
Superoxide:
""Exponentially growing E. coli contains about 20 μM dimeric cytoplasmic SOD. Given that the rate of O2− formation is approximately 5 μM/s in these cells, the outcome is that the steady-state level of O2− is restricted to approximately 0.1 nM (53).""

vectors
We modified six plant vectors to be compatible with BioBrick Standard 21. We successfully cloned several parts into the expression series vectors V9 (BBa_K382002) and V10 (BBa_K382003), transformed the plasmids into Agrobacterium, and grew colonies that showed proper antibiotic resistance.
open series   click to enlarge
The open series vectors are designed for general insertion of a construct. We modified the vectors pORE O1 and pORE O2. pORE O1 confers plant resistance to glufosinate , and pORE O2 confers plant resistance to kanamycin , to be used in transformant selection.
reporter series   click to enlarge
The reporter series vectors contain a reporter on the trailing end of the multiple cloning site such that expression of the reporter follows that of the inserted construct. We modified the vectors pORE R1 and pORE R3. pORE R1 contains the gusA reporter, and pORE R3 the smgfp reporter. Both vectors confer plant resistance to kanamycin.
expression series   click to enlarge
The expression series vectors contain a promoter preceding the multiple cloning site such that the inserted construct can be easily expressed through activation of the contained promoter. We modified the vectors pORE E3 and pORE E4. Both vectors contain the ENTCUP2 promoter. V9 (pORE E3) confers plant resistance to glufosinate, and V10 (pORE E4) confers plant resistance to kanamycin
