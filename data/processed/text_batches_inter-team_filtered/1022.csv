1) DNA mini-preps were prepared from the transformants 2) DNA mini-preps were cut with EcoRI enzyme to check for the presence of the plasmid (and DNA); agarose gel was prepared for DNA electrophoresis after cutting. 3) Results from cutting showed no presence of the sensor. Troubleshooting: was the plate number correct? Was procedure performed correct? by:Maria, Will, Marta

Tried to determine what was wrong with the red sensor that failed to appear in the gel. We definitely had the correct plate and well. We checked the seqeunce of the part and found that the sequence given does not match any given in BLAST. We suspect either that part of the plasmid was added to the distribution/registry or that the plasmid contains an illegal EcoR1 site, but are re-transforming cells just in case there was an experimental error. Due to failure of the previous transformation competent cells were retransformed with the two plasmids, as before. Two Chloramphenicol spread plates for each plasmid were made one  of each pair containing"

Recapitulation
The process of recapitulations took individual microbes, isolated from kombucha, and recombined these to reform kombucha. This process is essential to create a designer beverage: the microbes that have been taken from kombucha and genetically engineered must be able to be put back together to remake kombucha. The process of recapitulation was repeated multiple times in triplicate. Each trial tested a different growing condition or different combinations of microbes for regenerating kombucha.
The first trials of recapitulations tested the tea media being used to compare the tea that at-home brewers used to see if this would support the microbial growth of isolates (Christensen, 2015). The next trials performed used strictly the microbes isolated from kombucha, the problem with this approach is that not all microbes that occur in kombucha can be isolated away from the symbiotic they exist in, and further they cannot grow on a solid agar plate (Imperial, 2014). Using the previous research on kombucha found in scientific literature, as well as our findings in lab, the most prominent microbes that help to create kombucha were attained (either by isolation from kombucha or by purchasing from a scientific database) to be used in future recapitulations (Dufresne, 1999 and Marsh, 2013).
After having the essential kombucha microbes, the next set of recapitulations tested what ratios these microbes needed to be in when placed in tea media so they could properly form a SCOBY and recreate kombucha. This process involved multiple trial and error results, but eventually the results included below were found.
Figure 1: Shows samples from a series of completed recapitulation trials. A negative control triplicate set contained only tea media and experienced no microbial growth after 16 days. The positive control was inoculated with"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

If side effects can be minimized, patients will received an utmost degree of relief.
Good curative effect and little side effect for the gene mutational patients are consistent with the advantages of our molecular target drugs, which is very practical and meets the real demands of patients. The biggest problem of our targeted drugs, currently, is actually about the price, since they cannot be covered in the medical insurance system and there is no policy support. In this way, for some ordinary wage-earning-class families, the medical expenses would be a big problem for them. The cost of the new therapies can be prohibitive, thus the patients shrink back at the sight of the price.
Molecular targeted drugs of our team have little side effects, can be taken orally, and are of good therapeutic effect for specific gene mutational patients. Would you be willing to try it if it was put into clinical practice?
Figure 11.
The reasons would be shown at the next question.
Your main concern with the new drug is …?
Figure 12.
Survey results on attitude towards the new drug showed that, only 14.52% holds absolute negative attitude to new drugs, and most of the patients and their families think it as acceptable, although 43.55% said they will make decisions in specific circumstances, and the cost, the curative effect, genetic testing are all the factors that need to be taken into account.
Consistent with the question 5, we could easily find that, with more than half respondents expressing this concern, the largest concern of patients and their families was that new drugs lack longstanding clinical cases. High charge was also one of the main concerns of patients. This showed that there is still much room for improvement and perfection of medical insurance system in China.
Besides, some patients still had doubts about the specific efficacy of new drugs, worrying they cannot receive fine curative effect even after paying high fee. However, 41.94% patients said they were very willing to try, and believed that the new technology should be well developed and progressed to better fight against cancer--even if the price is expensive, it is still worthy to try.
Summary
Our findings are compatible with our initial assumptions. In addition, after interviewing with the patients face to face, we also learned more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"

A control group without mir155 was not set up so the modeling effect was not apparent (FImE conversion effect is reflected in the concentration of GFP which is decided by the presence or absence of mir155). In addition to improving the above problems, this model also reflects the following characteristics: The model is basically consistent with the general experimental fluorescence / OD curve, performs well in terms of time fit. The model is basically consistent with the general experimental fluorescence / OD curve, performs well in terms of time fit. The model can be used to determine the concentration of mir155 by signal intensity under certain conditions and to achieve semi-quantitative measurement in the presence of high concentration of mir155 (the effect of miRNA on the system decreases with increasing concentration), It can be obtained with the confidence of the results within 200min (signal to noise ratio 3.9), the signal to noise ratio will rise to 8 with the rise of time.

Trehalose Testing Assay
Rationale
We want to monitor real time rate of production of trehalose per cell. To do this, we need two pieces of information. Firstly, we need to monitor cell growth to know the approximate cell count. This can be done by OD to obtain cell count. Secondly, we need to know the rate of production of trehalose. This can be obtained from performing the trehalose assay at regular time intervals of 30 minutes. From the second piece of information, we can plot a graph of trehalose concentration against time. The gradient of this graph would give us the total activity of cells. Dividing this by the number of cells will give us activity per cell per unit time. This should resemble a hill function.
We can also perform the above mentioned two steps for different concentration of HSL. This will also allow us to characterise our biobrick.
Method
1) After activation of the CRP sensitive promoter, take samples at regular intervals.
Take 0.5ml sample from the culture and perform OD(600) to get cell count. Make sure OD is within linear portion of cell growth.
Take another 1ml sample and lyse using a sonicator (pulsed sonication, in an ice bath to reduce heating.)
Measure trehalose content using the trehlose method shown below:
Trehalose assay
Take samples at 30 minute time intervals, until a constant level of trehalose is reached.
Plot the increase in trehalose concentration against time. This will allow characterisation of the trehalose output with POPs input.
Functionality of the trehalose can be determined by the trehalose functionality assay.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," 4 dry work:
Most of these model systems will rely on the very basic equations outlined above, with extensions to add levels of complexity, such as the transport of arabinose into a cell.
Basic Phage Activators
The first step is to take a look at the preliminary data to try to find appropriate parameters. An overall aim for the modelling of this system is to refine the model to each component and attempt to predict how different combinations of components will behave. The data collection separates the promoter and activator by use of both RFP and GFP reporters.
The basic model for the relationship between input concentration and GFP output rate of production is a Hill Function. The aim is to characterise each activator-promoter system and fit it to this basic model:
The three parameters we require are the maximum output rate, the dissociation or binding constant and the hill coefficient.
Having studied the behaviour of the actual phage activator systems we discovered that each construct 'switched on' at different input levels; they have different effective binding constants. This gives us the behaviour required for a threshold system without much further development.
Investigating the Model
Before data was available we changed parameters to investigate the effects and to check that our programs were working as expected. Week 6, in particular Tuesday, summarises this work.
Extended Systems
Despite the ability of the activator systems to switch on at different levels, before this was apparent an exercise in modelling different methods of achieving such a system was carried out. There were three proposed mechanisms for such a system. All are based on the presence of both a repressor and an activator of some form.
1. Repressor and Activator bind at different sites, but transcription only occurs if the activator is bound alone.
2. The repressor and activator bind at different sites but the binding of one prevents binding of the other (by blocking the site for example).
These assume that the repressor and activator are both transcription factors. In effect, these are bistable switches.
3. The activator (input of some form) prevents the production of a repressor that is otherwise continually expressed in the cell.
Looking at the effects of changing parameters was carried out during weeks 6 and 7.
Modelling Basics
In order to model the kinetics of gene transcription and translation, the approach taken is similar to that in enzyme kinetics. The transcription factors bind reversibly to the relevant site on the DNA and depending upon the particular case, transcription is promoted or repressed.
The steps of working out the input function (which describes the rate of transcription as a function of the inducer"

In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters, feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless. Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence of our model.

Human Practices Overview
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.
Engaging Experts: GMOs, food, water, drought, and salinity affect much of humanity. Such a far-reaching project required discussions with professionals, ethicists, farmers, and more. Click here to check out our site visit and click here to read interviews from professionals who assisted our endeavors.
Responsibility: Developing our science requires responsibility, listening to the farmers, and hearing public concerns. We spoke with hundreds of community members through surveys, discovering their fears and investigating mitigation of public disapproval of GMOs. Click here to learn more about our surveys.
Public Engagement: iGEM values and goals led us to reaching out, holding public meetings, and creating a video explaining our project and its importance. Click here to learn more about our public engagement.
Education: The next generation of scientists must be interested. We held science days at museums and libraries, allowing children to learn more about our project, plants, and synthetic biology. Click here to learn more about how we educated the community.
Collaborations: We collaborated with many teams throughout the course of the project, creating exchanges of information, ideas, and time. We participated in meetups, provided ideas for Human Practices, and even had troubleshooting sessions. Click here to learn more about our collaborations."

Trouble we meet in project
At the beginning of 2018 SZU-China team, we had a brainstorming to decide our topic. We carried out three topics which were all close to daily lives and we didn’t know which to choose.
What we did for project
To strengthen the communication between iGEM and the public, we designed an applet named biocompany and post our ideas there. It’s a platform for the public to engage in the iGEM.
How would the project be
With the comments that people gave in Biocompany, we finally decided our project, cockroach terminator. For more details about our applet, please read our applet part.
Trouble we meet in project
When we were designing our experiment, we still knew little about iGEM and many aspects of our project needed improved. We also wanted know what other teams were going on.
What we did for project
To gather suggestions and seek cooperation opportunities from each team, we held an iGEM South China Regional Conference. To take the essence from other teams, we also attended 5th CCIC and IGEM"

Calculation and Derivation of the Protein Expression Amount Model in Three States
Overview
Three problems came up while we start calculating: what sequences to input, which method to use and how cogent the result will be. As for sequence, we input the both the SD and the protein coding sequence.
Our goal is to calculate the total ΔG of each reaction and then predict the amount of protein expressed. There are several softwares dealing with DNA or RNA base-pairing progress, such as NUPACK, RBS-Calculator, and Vienna RNA etc. After comparison, we decide to use RBS-Calculator.
Due to the complication of translation progress and our lack of insight in this issue, the results of our modeling can’t be very precise. But at least it should have the precision of order of magnitude.

Slovenia_HS,2015,Team:Slovenia HS#TeamSlovenia HS Lab Safety Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists. Biotechnologists worked under the supervision of The National Institute of  Chemistry while synthetic biologists worked under the supervision of The Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology. We also held regular team meetings during which we  organized our teamwork and exchanged our results and experience.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different mediums to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different mediums again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantitatively characterize the interaction between our peptide and copper [21]. All binding parameters for the test were within the specifications determined by the manufacturer. We used 10 mM, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer for testing because it does not cause metal ion interference, and has a stable pKa over a wide temperature and pH range. Experiments were conducted at pH 5.5 to prevent copper precipitation, and pre-made copper stock solutions of known concentration were used.
Peptides were prepared for ITC by dissolving lyophilized protein (powder) in MES buffer, and ITC experiments were run at 25°C and set to deliver 20, 0.5 – 1 µL injections of Cu at 150 second intervals. The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell, and interactions were measured. Raw data were corrected by subtracting the heats of dilution, and collected data were fit with a one-site binding model using the Origin-7™ software.
2.7 Prototype and Phen Green Assay for Bulk Adsorption
To test the peptides, strips of pure mycelium from the species Ganoderma lucidum were incubated in purified CBD-2xHHTC protein (suspended in 6 mL of 10 mM pH 5.5 MES buffer, with a fusion protein concentration of 0.45 mM) that had been cleaved with DTT on a flatbed shaker for 72 hours. These pieces were then cut into uniform 1 cm2 squares (assuming chitin assumes an approximately regular distribution, as this is difficult to control for and testing with RFP-CBD led us to believe this was the case). As a control, we also incubated untreated mycelium in 10 mM pH 5.5 MES buffer for the same time period. We then prepared a Cu stock solution in MES, and the Cu concentration in our starting solution was 325 (+/-25) µM. Three environments/types of trials were run: one with the treated mycelium filter, one with untreated mycelium, and one with just the Cu solution and no mycelial material. These took place in 6 mL of the Cu stock solution in sterile 15 mL falcon tubes on a flatbed shaker. All experiments were run in triplicate, for a total of 9 trials. Two hundred μL samples"

Lab:  I helped Jeremy set up sequencing for LuxPQ-B-R-LuxOU-B in AK for colony 12. We used colony 12 because the restriction digest from yesterday worked perfectly for that colony (correct size and no random fragments) (please refer to attachment). Since last time we only got one colony from transforming Cl lambda couple days ago and the restriction digest we ran yesterday showed multiple bands, we couldn’t judge the size of Cl lambda properly. Therefore, today we decided to transform Cl lambda again into competent cells. Since the inverter plasmid is resistant to Kan, we made more Kan agar plates and then transformed the Cl lambda and let them grow over night.  We also made overnight cultures of the Cl lambda. We’ll isolate the plasmids tomorrow. Then in the afternoon, if we see single colonies on our overnight plates, we ‘ll do restriction digest again to confirm that the Cl lambda is actually there in our plasmids.

Adding life to the Synthetic Kingdom
Today was spent on working on the synthetic kingdom. Difficulty was encountered because moving the giant eukaryotic cell was harder than it should've been. The organelles kept wanting to move to their original places because of the scripts involved so I had to stop all of them and delete them. I will reintroduce them once I have found a suitable place for the cell. We had 3 new ""births"" today, which increased the population of the bacteria! Squid were added as well as jellyfish and coral. I feel that this is important because of the relation of each to quorum sensing, GFP and RFP respectively so we can show that some genes from animals can be added to E.coli (pretend that is italicized). Also it looks cool. I am attempting to also pretty up the place so it will be more vibrant and full of life. This is going to be carried out by designing underwater plants and adding rocks as well for a more natural look. This will be carried out tomorrow.

All cultures were cultivated for 24 hours at 37 °C. A) Shows a drop on a LB agar plate supplemented with 10 % sucrose. B) Shows a drop on a LB agar plate without sucrose. A clear difference can be observed between the two drops. In presence of sucrose, E. coli BL21(DE3) BBa_K2201017 grew much weaker and did not turn red. Without sucrose, the cells grew much better and turned red. C) The same difference in growth and color could be observed in liquid cultures.
Further Pretests
The antibiotics kanamycin and chloramphenicol were not added to the recovery media to achieve better growth conditions for the cells right after the heat shock transformation. We investigated the growth conditions for E. coli BL21(DE3) concerning the concentration of chloramphenicol. A lower concentration of chloramphenicol would decrease the stress of the cells during their cultivation since there is already a huge metabolic stress when using a two-plasmid system. So, we grew the native E. coli BL21(DE3) in liquid LB media supplemented with different chloramphenicol concentrations as a pretest shown in Figure 8.

How to quantify channel capacity of gene regulatory networks?
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y}"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations. More polymers does, after some point, decrease the amount of coacervates. This may sound very counterintuitive, but as you can see for example in Figure 3, taking the system to be at point P and increasing the volume fraction of polymers $\phi$ will have the system move out of the coacervate region.
Figure 3: Increasing the polymer volume fraction moves the system out of the coacervate region. Imagine the system to be at point P in parameter space, and now increase the polymer volume fraction by adding polymers of the same charge density. This brings the system to point Q, which lies out of the coacervate region, meaning that the system will no longer form coacervates.
Adding more polyelectrolytes to a solution thus does not mean that the system will move further in the coacervate region, but out of it. In fact, having too many polymers will cause coacervates to disappear! We can prove this by showing that $\sigma(\phi)$ only has one single minimum in the region $0 <\phi<1$. First note that the minima of $\sigma$ are given by $$\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \phi}=0$$ Taking this derivative and equating it to zero gives the equation $$\phi^2+\left(\frac{N+2}{N-1}\right)\phi-\left(\frac{1}{N-1}\right)=0$$ Of which the exact analytical solutions are given by $$\phi=- \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N+2\pm\sqrt{N^2+8N}}{N-1}$$ As we expect $N \gg 2$, we can say $N\approx N+2 \approx N-1$ we can approximate our result as $$\phi \approx \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2}{N}}-\frac{1}{2}$$ Because by definition $\phi$ cannot be negative, the only physically relevant solution, we define the critical concentration $\phi_c$ to be $$\phi_c=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2}{N}}-\frac{1}{2}$$ Note that $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}[\phi_c]=0$, meaning that as the polymer size increases, the lower the critical polymer volume fraction is required to have coacervation (for a fixed charge density). At the same time it proves that there is"

It was an extremely interesting and fruitful work, because the novel entities of the synthetic biology present new philosophical challenges, which are really difficult to deal with. The cooperation between philosophy and biology students in this compact course enabled a unique deepening in the heart of these relevant problems.
On this weekend we also had a special lecture called ‘Semantic Fallacies in the Synthetic Biology’ (ger. ‘Semantische Fehlschlüße in der Synthetischen Biologie’), where, besides a philosophical introduction in the synthetic biology, a number of common speech bias regarding the products of this new field were presented. On the whole, the compact course was an intensive working weekend, which transformed a usual university seminar into a really special interdisciplinary event.
Books we worked with:
Kant I (2009 [1790]): Kritik der Urteilskraft. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.M. (eng. Critique of Judgement)
Jonas H (1997): Das Prinzip Leben. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.M. (eng. The Phenomenon of Life. Towards a Philosophical Biology)

2.4 Open house presentation
On the 6th of July we opened the doors of our lab to visitors! Firstly, we introduced our visitors in the field of synthetic biology and presented our iGEM-project. We explained them our aims, showed the facilities and also partial results. Afterwards, we even had some time to discuss about the social implications, possibilities and risks of synthetic biology. In addition, they were invited to stay in the lab and to observe our work. All of the visitors were really open to the field of synthetic biology and showed interest regarding our work.

Human Practices
-To spread LIFESCIENCE throughout the world
Introduction
This year,iGEM Kyoto carried out activities to enrich people's knowledge on biotechnology because in 2010 we  and other iGEM teams in Japan carried out an attitude survey towards genetically modifying and genetically engineering . From this survey, we concluded that it is important to enrich the people's knowledge on biotechnology when we want public people to accept biotechnology more. Therefore, we carried out these activities as below.
Life Science Seminar in High School
Poster session at the school festival
The 3rd international symposium on liberal arts and general education in Kyoto University
International Student Seminar
Join ""START""
We had been carrying out these activities shown above in order to spread the basic ideas of biotechnology. However, we thought that there might be other reasons towards the fact that people are not positive to the achievements of them. Therefore, in order to determine the factors, we conducted a questionnaire.
Methods
How to conduct questionnaire survey
In the beginning of this questionnaire, we asked answerers about their sex, country, age, religion, and profession. And, we investigated how these elements influence the answers of this questionnaire about gene modification. We conducted this survey to Japanese and non-japanese people. The countries where we conducted the questionnaire is listed below.
U.S.A.: Stanford, Davis/ Germany: Goettingen/ Japan: Kyoto, Nara, Shiga, Okinawa/
※How to confirm significant differences
Chi-square test: To test statistically the difference between the expected frequency with the measured frequency.If calculated probability (p-value) is less than 0.05, significance is confirmed statistically.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," of antibiotics. The expression of RFP in this case would mean that MRSA are present. This direct method of detection could shorten the test to 3-4hrs in length. However, this may lead to false positive results, as it is possible for other bacteria to release AIP as well, activating the StaphiScope.
3.3 TECHNICALITY OF THE STAPHISCOPE S. AUREUS DETECTION TOOL
The primary design of the construct consisted of AIP sensor infrastructure BBa_I746101 + BBa_I746104, permeability device BBa_I746201, amplifier, and reporter. Amplifier would have been selected from BBa_K2743xx series based on the investigations by the modeling team. Red fluorescent protein gene BBa_E1010 from BioBrick I13507 will be used as reporter. Please refer to Figure 1 below for more information.
Figure 1: Primary design of StaphiScope project, incorporating sensor, amplifier and reporter of AIP.
An additional design involved the addition of a generator part. This would have allowed E.coli to produce its own AIP, as a means for testing the response without worrying about permeability into the periplasm.  This design was completed but could not  be tested due to time constrains. As well, no amplifier was added in the final construct. Below is a discussion of the major components of StaphiScope.
3.3.1 COMPONENT #1: FEP A PERMEABILITY DEVICE
As S. aureus releases AIP in order to initiate any kind of quorum sensing, it is important that Escherichia coli will be able to receive and properly identify this signal. As E. coli is a gram-negative bacterium (contains an additional outer membrane), an issue arises of AIP not being able to get through this extra layer. This is why the iGEM team was forced to use FepA as part of the plasmid construct. FepA is an outer membrane permeability device, which will allow for AIP (the quorum sensing signaling molecule which will come from S. aureus) to get through the outer membrane of the gram-negative E. coli. The permeability device comes with its own promoter, on which we will rely for optimal expression.
3.3.2 COMPONENT #2: AIP SENSOR
It is important that AIP does indeed make it past the outer membrane of E. coli, as this is crucial to turning on the sensor and reporter functions of the StaphiScope. The AIP sensor function will"

Furthering the dialogue with the public about synthetic biology
To learn about other potential applications of our project, we interviewed cattle farmers about their awareness of cow’s methane contribution and their environmental practices. With our information, we prepared and distributed a brochure that informed animal farmers how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also reached out to the public at farmer’s markets and gauged their support on topics like GMO’s and global warming. We discussed our project and the relevant environmental issues. Finally, to garner interest for iGEM and synthetic biology, we engaged future scientists at different points in their careers by performing activities with kids at a Building with Biology event in Baltimore, introducing synthetic biology to local high schoolers, and leading activities for college students at a STEM expo at the University of Maryland.
Building with Biology: Port Discovery
July 30th, 2016
We volunteered at the Building with Biology Event held at Port Discovery in Baltimore, MD to raise awareness about synthetic biology among children 8 and up. We manned six tables with different activities involving synthetic biology, which are described in more depth below.
Super Organism!
At this station, visitors were introduced to two catastrophic situations that they needed to solve using their imaginations: 1) Their friend fell off of a skyscraper, and 2) Their friend caused a massive oil spill in the ocean. To tackle the first problem, kids designed a superhero that could shoot spiderwebs or fly to ultimately catch their friend. For the second problem, kids designed a super bacteria that could clean the ocean by detecting, degrading, or digesting oil. This activity served as a introduction of the possibilites of synthetic biology and genetic engineering.
Kit of Parts
Visitors would learn about the concept of BioBricks and versatility of engineering cells to solve global issues. They used a cell model made of wooden poles and color-coded parts that fit on the poles. Each color had a different function like red for production and blue for sensing. A visitor would pick a challenge card with an area of research on it ranging from making synthetic blood to treating malaria. Then she would make a cell that would solve the problem using a solution description on the back of the card.
Bio Bistro
Eat it? Think about it? No way? Visitors were introduced to a variety of engineered foods, both currently available and in development,"

Plasmid Construction
All DNA parts applied in these experiments came from the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The new BioBrick part, PompC-cheZ (BBa_K1412010) was formed by ligating the pre-existing parts, PompC (BBa_R0082) and cheZ (BBa_K629003). The E.Z.N.A.TM Plasmid Mini Kit I (200) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to extract plasmid DNA. BioBrick parts were digested with restriction enzymes, EcoRI, Xba I,"
British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," on the modelling and the other computational aspects of microbiology and immunology. I also want to connect with other scientists in UBC and get to know UBC faculty and students.
What inspires you:
I am very inspired by the scientists that combine their information on different fields and solve big problems. I like the fact that by looking from different perspectives or approaching a problem in an entirely new way, it is possible to derive solutions- solutions that wouldn't possibly be solved  with the cumulative knowledge on one specific field. This makes me think that there is no challenge or problem that cannot be solved.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to create cures and drugs for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases by not only using laboratory skills but also computer generated modeling.
Hobbies:
I appreciate every aspect of music. I like improving my classical music skills and participate in classical music activities such as performing Beethoven's 9th with Vancouver Symphony Orchestra as a member of UBC Choral Union. I also like spending time on Youtube and finding out news/improvements around the globe.

Safety
When planning our project and writing our code we were considered the following safety and security issues: data safety, identity theft, malicious software, collection of personal data by Google, and biosecurity during parts and device design. We would not have started our project if Google would not have announced that the wave technology will become open source. According to the wave federation protocol everyone can host his own wave server and control access and security issues. The nature of the open source will ensure that no hidden malicious code is distributed and that updates can be controlled by the community. Our wave approach automatically provides remote storage and at the same time the user can save a local copy. This redundancy ensures data safety.
We hope that a future wave robot testing for pathogenic parts and assemblies will help to increase biosafety of synthetic laboratory work.

Initiator Binding Test
Test initiator binding only.
Bind, then elute, then analyze on e-gel.
Test four conditions:
Init only
Init + beads, then elute
Init + A + B
Init + term.
1 uL of 5 uM initiator used, 1 uL of 5 uM terminator.
50 ng of each other fragments.
The same protocol as 6/19/2015 was used, with the following modifications.
initial binding time was increased to 45 minutes.
Washes were performed using 100 uL of solution.
Results
After elution, we visualized the constructs on 1% e-gel.
Nothing showed up on the gel, although we expect the initiator in condition 1 to appear.
Possibly due to mistakes made during sample preparation.
BsaI Digestion
Set up 2x 50 uL reactions for each MaSp monomer.
Digested ~5 ug of each MaSp plasmid using 4 uL of BsaI.
Incubated 2 hours at 50 C, then heat for 20 minutes at 65 C.
Visualized results on 1.5% gel, using 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 BsaI digestion of MaSp plasmids. The desired product is 102 bp in size.
We excised the bands for purification tomorrow.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#pr_-_-_TEXT.html," search for a rational GRN that can sense the input signal, realize the switch function and show adaptation to copy number. Besides, GRN consists of different kinds of regulatory motifs that may play an important role in functioning. We are also motivated to search for certain motifs which contribute to adaptation. Why are we interested ? Cells with different mir-21 amount response differently towards the input signal and their response may represent state-switch. Therefore, cells of 2 different types can be distinguished according to their response. So an adaptive and robust network topology can be regarded as a sensitive switch and a simple sorter, which is really exciting. In addition, possible functional motifs and its mechanism are also fun.
Project design
What makes an ideal network? An ideal functional network is expected to express output protein at a different intensity according to the different number of input microRNA. So the network should maintain step-like input-output character to realize state-switch. Besides, adaptation to DNA template variation requires the output of ideal network to be saturated along with the increase of copy number.
How to search for an optimal network ? We described our regulation reactions based on Michealis-Menten Equation and Hill Equation and constructed all possible three-node network topologies (around 20,000 networks) via ODE matrix equation sets. Then we iterated the regulation process. During the thorough investigation of every network’s character under steady state, we finished mass amount of calculation and analysis with the help of High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC). High-low Ratio and Interim Slope are main indexes for input-output character, and networks’ ability of saturation is considered as the key index for adaptation. How to verify our results? In order to guarantee the correctness of our results, we simulated the output expression with probability model. We firstly assumed that copy number follows Poisson distribution and studied the Overlap between the output distribution. Then a Bimodal Gaussian distribution is introduced to make comparisons on Overlap of output distribution. The value of both Overlap is rather low when ideal networks are adopted. So we have verified our optimal results to be efficient under distribution by further simulation. Besides, we transferred the corresponding functional networks (screened from simulation) and contrast unfunctional network into Hela cells in wet lab. The output intensity has clearly increased with functional networks and the trend of saturation to copy number is more obvious with functional network than with unfunctional one. The experiment results generally accord with our modeling expectation of the optimal network structure. Why are we interested ? The biological networks are complex, but growing evidence shows that some core topology structures are capable of robustly executing functions, which are known as motifs. And"

The AFM solutions in the control dishes (not containing bacteria) were tinted a light blue, indicating that some of the cupric ions might have diffused through the solid media and into the liquid media.
In the cases of the hybrid dishes containing bacteria, the greatest etching occurred in the cases where there was more AFM (liquid media). This is likely due to the fact that the increased amount of ferric ions in solution supported greater cell growth, which in turn spurred on faster etching.
In the cases of the dishes that did not contain bacteria, except for one case (copper piece 7.2), the etching remained fairly consistent, regardless of the amount of liquid media in the petri dishes.
September 23 - September 29
Pennies were painted on with nail polish to form the letters 'C' and/or 'U,' placed a flask with liquid media and A. ferooxidans and left to shake over several days. They were then taken out and the nail polish was removed from them using acetone to reveal still-shiny patches of copper underneath the areas not exposed to the liquid media. These pennies were made in anticipation of the Maker Faire at the New York Hall of Science in Queens as proof of concept and as souvenirs for people who stopped by our table.

Carrying on an Aachen tradition
Go to Hardware
Last year, the iGEM Team Aachen was invited to the annual MakerFaire in Hannover to exhibit their DIY measurement devices. This year, we went to the MakerFaire to demonstrate the first prototype of our self made small scale biorector to more than 5500 visitors per day. Thanks a lot to Carsten from the iGEM Team Braunschweig 2014 and to the Stratum Hackerspace for sharing their exhibition booth with us!

Before going to the MakerFaire, we stopped by at the iGEM Team Bielefeld. While having coffee and cake, each team presented their project followed by a little discussion and receiving feedback. We were fortunate to get valuable ideas concerning using our pumps in microfluidics. As a consequence, we adjusted the design of our devices and focused on a modular system to support this, and other possible fields of application.

Teach the teacher
Fascination has no age
The best part about the MakerFaire was when children at the age of twelve were fascinated by the bioreactor and tried their best to understand the working principles behind every part. But also adults were affected by our presented hardware. A number of teachers asked us if they could take pictures of us and our work for teaching purposes. One teacher from a private school was even interested in buying our bioreactor.
Together we worked out a possible teaching concept that unites different classes:  Assembly of the bioreactor in a science class, analysis of the software in the computer science class and using"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU#Medal Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," achieve both “digital” and “analog” expression patterns using standardized biological parts.
In addition to a dCas9- VPR supplied by our lab, we created a collection of parts that could achieve “digital” expression. These involved a set of genome-orthogonal and mutually-orthogonal guide RNAs, and 1X gRNA-operator minimal reporters. We demonstrated that at least 4 of these expression pairs functioned as expected, with minimal basal expression (-gRNA) and high activated expression (+gRNA). We also proved that these can regulate expression of different genes by testing gene activation in four different fluorescent proteins. The results from this work can be found here under digtial. We prove that we could develop a digital library.
We then created a collection of parts that could extend the “digital” expression to achieve “analog” expression. We paired our set of gRNAs and multimerized or mutated the gRNA-operator minimal reporters to respectively increase or decrease relative expression. We demonstrated that at least 14 of these expression pairs functioned as expected, offering a range of intermediate expression levels. The results from this work can be found here under analog. We prove we could expand expression of our digital library.
Finally, we integrated our digital and analog expression parts into genetic circuits to demonstrate conditional digital and analog expression. Specifically, we used established recombinase-based circuits, the backbone of which was provided by our lab, and inserted the gRNA expression vectors between recombination sites to conditionally express different gRNAs. These gRNAs would then bind to their paired operators and could subsequently turn gene activity to specified levels, using different reporters from our digital and analog construct repositories.
For digital outputs, we developed several types of circuits. These include an AND gate, a NOR gate, an XNOR gate, as well as an array of Line Decoder. The data from these experiments can be found here under circuits. With these circuit we proved that our Gemini Library can be used to produce a variety of digital behaviors.
For analog outputs, we attempted an experiment in which by altering the logical state of our circuit, it would result in a change in the expression of GFP with some degree of predictability. The results of this experiment can be seen here under circuits. We prove that we can, relatively, predictable develop analog responses with our Library."

Longjing Pan and Yuxian Zhang carried out a variety of questionnaires to survey the current situation of treating straw and citizen’s attitude toward clean energy. To make our project more practical, they interact with expert in Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to learn more information about agricultural waste and bioenergy. They also interviewed synthetic biology expert, Dr. Junbiao Dai to optimize our pathway.
Public Engagement：
Yuxian Zhang and Changyu Li organized a large event of Education of Public Engagement called “Gene go”, interacting with more than 300 families in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. They are also making effort in high school students, inspiring their interest in synthetic biology. There are other team members designed some product such as “Gene Card” online programed by Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang, Crazy Lab designed by Yinsong Xu and Plasmid Rubik made by Longjing Pan. Collaboration and meet-up is in the charge of Yuxian Zhang and Jianzhe Yang to combine universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," or any foreign equivalent identified through patent family searches. Its not a quick and easy job!
Team DISCO
Which patents should we be looking at to figure out whether we are infringing or not?
Len Mancini
– If I were you, I’d consider all the insulins on the market, taking a particular focus on Single Chain Insulins. We already know that the human insulin hormone itself is off patent, but you may want to check that subsequent patents on methods of manufacture or particular formulations or compositions weren’t granted and are still active today. Checking process patents in general, especially for your Bacillus expression system, would be important too. Patents for processes and advanced compositions are generally patented by the original owners as a way to extend the monopoly over their product.
Team DISCO
We definitely need to design our insulin after we check all of the relevant patents for single chain insulins. Expression systems and methodology should then follow. How long would it take, and about how much would it cost for your firm to investigate this for us?
Len Mancini
Investigating whether a product is  able to marketed legally is a very time intense process invoving muliple searches and months of analysis. The whole process genrally is conducted over multiple years  (to account for the patent black spot – 18 months in which applications remained unpublished) and cost over $100,000 if many aspect of the product need to be cleared.
Team DISCO
Ah, that’s a lot of money and time!
Edwina Wang
Hey, also don't forget there are also different types of insulin and we need them for different things - so their actual physiological effect is really important. I’ve used both before but am currently using short acting only with my insulin pump.
Team DISCO
Wow, that’s so helpful! Since you can’t have the same insulin being short AND long acting, its good to aim to create an insulin that’s one or the other. Ruby will be able to do some cool modelling to predict whether our Winsulin will be short-acting or long-acting so we can see which areas would most benefit from our insulin.
Ultimately, we have two insulin products. Our first insulin, Human Insulin, will be exactly the same as the one we produce in our human beta cells. Our other insulin, our newly designed insulin Winsulin, will have the same A and B chains as Human Insulin, but contains a smaller, 12 amino acid length C peptide linker.
From our predictive modelling, we predict the Winsulin will be a short acting insulin. We also believe that"

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"_1$ can be calculated as $$k_1 \varpropto e^{-\beta \cdot \Delta G_{total1}}$$ We make the formula into an equation: $$k_1 = k_1^{'} e^{-\beta \cdot \Delta G_{total1}}$$ Where $\beta$ is the Boltzmann constant, which is $0.45 \pm 0.05 mol/kcal $, $k_1^{'}$ is the coefficient of the Gibbs free energy function.
The $\Delta G_{total1}$ is the total binding free energy between the ribosome and $5’$ UTR, and can be calculated as follows: $$\Delta G_{total1} =\sum_i \Delta G_i$$ Where $\sum_i \Delta G_i$ means the Gibbs free energy from the different sites interacting with each other, including the free energy of mRNA-rRNA complex, the non-coding sequence between the coding sequence, the free energy of the ribosome-mRNA complex and the free energy of tRNA-ribosome complex.
The free energy above can be calculated by Nucleic Acid Package which is a software for nucleic acid structure and free energy design. Thus, the five parts of free energy can be calculated by the software.
For the calculation of transcription rate $k_2$, we add related factors into $k_2$ as follows to describe the influence of hairpin structure: $$k_2 \varpropto e^{-\beta \Delta G_{total2}}+r_{reinit}$$ Similarly, we make the formula above as an equation: $$ k_2 =k_2^{'}[ e^{-\beta \Delta G_{total2}}+r_{reinit}]$$ Where $k_2^{'}$ is the coefficient of the Gribbs free energy function and the hairpin influence function. And it is easy to calculate $\Delta G_{total2}$ due to the formula above: $$\Delta G_{total2} =\sum_i \Delta G_i$$
As for $r_{reinit}$, the downstream gene is likely to be expressed in a high level because the distance of two genes are short while the downstream gene is also more likely to be terminated because of the more complex hairpin structure it has. So $r_{reinit}$ can be calculated as follows: $$r_{reinit}=k_{dis} \cdot k_{com} e^{-\beta \Delta G_{total2}}$$ Where $\Delta G_{total2} =\sum_i \Delta"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," are remarkably high due to the low water exchange rate, low biodiversity and the physiological stress induced by brackish water conditions. Therefore, the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly susceptible to hazardous pharmaceutical substances [14].
One of the main substances that contributes to pharmaceutical pollution and in its implications in the Baltic Sea ecosystem is the antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). SMX has been detected to be one of the most prevalent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) not only in WWTPs’ effluent streams but in rivers located in the Baltic Sea region too, as presented in Figure 2 [14].
Figure 2. The top 20 pharmaceuticals measured in highest concentrations in river water samples in the Baltic Sea region [14].
It has been found that SMX may alter the catabolic function of bacteria comprising marine biofilms by altering their carbon source utilization (15). Changes on the transcriptional profile of genes associated to cell envelope and outer membrane were observed, as well as changes of genes involved in replication when freshwater biofilms were exposed to SMX concentrations as low as 1.94 nmol/L (16).
SMX has even been detected in flounders (Platichus flesus) inhabiting the Baltic Sea in concentrations exceeding 50 μg/kg, meaning that SMX can even move up in the food chain (14).
Additionally, SMX contributes to the rising problem of antibiotic resistance when it is released in the aquatic environment. It has been shown that resistance to SMX alone is one of the most common single antibiotic resistances and remarkably, is associated with the main cross-resistant profiles. Consequently, it becomes apparent that SMX except for its ecotoxicological effects also drives antibiotic resistance by its presence in aquatic environments (17).
Given that the removal rates of SMX in WWTPs are inadequate to substantially prevent or limit its release in the aquatic environment of the Baltic Sea, SMX’s occurrence in the region will continue to persist. In support to this conclusion comes the fact that the biggest WWTP in Sweden, Henriksdal, located in Stockholm, removes 48% to 73% of SMX existing in the influent (18). As Sofia Andersson, a process development engineer in Henriksdal WWTP stated when we visited the facilities in Stockholm: “Pharmaceuticals, in general, are not degraded in a WWTP, they go either to the effluent water or the sludge’’ (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). A statement aligned with the monitoring data on the removal rates of SMX.

Overview
Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the general microbial fuel cell functional principle, showing the flow of charged species during operation.
A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is utilized for power generation through the conversion of organic and inorganic substrates by microorganisms. A fuel cell generally consists of two units, the anode and cathode compartment. These are separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). The microorganisms, acting as biocatalysts, release electrons during metabolic reactions and transfer them to the anode of the fuel cell. The protons being freed up during this process are transferred to the cathode compartment through the PEM. The electrons pass through an external load circuit to the cathode. In the cathode chamber, these electrons and protons reduce an electron acceptor. Thus, an electric current is generated. The most important property of such a system is the bacteria's ability to transfer electrons to the anode. There are lots of other aspects to consider though, all of which are vital for the successful operation of a fuel cell.
Most existing projects rely on using mixed cultures of different types of bacteria in the anode compartment. However, in most cases these systems are not very well characterized. Often it is not even known which species are part of these cultures. This makes it almost impossible to improve the system by directed genetic engineering. Applying such a black box system outside of a laboratory might also"
UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," by dividing activity by the microgram of enzyme used for the assay. Each enzyme was assayed with 100 uM NADH and 100 uM crotonyl-CoA. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, no enzyme. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control and plotted on a log scale. Two biological replicates of each enzyme was used.
S. aureus FabI showed no activity even though the enzyme has been previously characterized [11][12]. We later found out we didn’t see activity because S. aureus FabI is NADPH dependent rather than NADH dependent! Notwithstanding, NADPH is significantly more expensive than NADH[24], so instead of accommodating for S. aureus FabI, we decided to remove it from the FabI team.
3. Triclosan Inhibition Screening:
We were down to the ""Fab 5"". Since Chalew et al showed the levels of triclosan leaving Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) was up to 9 nanomolar [18], so we wanted to measure enzyme inhibition using a nanomolar level of triclosan. Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.
Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control activities. Percent inhibition was calculated by:
( (uninhibited activity - inhibited activity) / uninhibited activity ) * 100
The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme. Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi! Interestingly, with P. tricornutum, a marine diatom, which have been shown to be sensitive towards triclosan [29] we were unable to see triclosan inhibition, which suggests there is a different biological mechanism of action for triclosan inhibition. However"

The visit turned out to be one of the greatest experienced in this whole iGEM edition. It is wonderful to see how the kids were amazed by what you can do with science and motivated to continue looking for more experiments. Actually, the third graders will be organizing their own science fair in their English Class.
But what made us really happy were all the great feedback and comments they gave us through the survey:
“Loved the science class” (Renata, 1st grade)
“Loved the class. You should be professional scientists” (Carmen, 3rd grade)
“The class was really cool. Loved it! I hope you win the competition” (Saide, 6th grade).
Alfonso Hernandez Irigoyen Elementary School
For the same purposes, we visited the Alfonso Hernandez Irigoyen elementary school following the same dynamic that we used in the Hamilton.
The Principal of the elementary school was very kind in giving us an hour to work with the children of three groups: one of 2nd grande, one of 4th  and one of 6th. We worked from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. As we mentioned, the dynamic was the same: 2nd graders worked with the sand filter; 4th graders worked with the explosive volcano; and children of 6th grade, with the Formation of Geodes. On the other hand, six of us went to the school dividing into pairs for us to work effectively with each group.
We arrived early in the morning to the institution with all the materials prepared since the day before. As soon as the kids saw us, they started jumping and yelling with excitement as they had already been told what they were going to be doing with us. The first hour and a half we worked with one group from third grade and two of sixth. We started by giving a little presentation of the iGEM, little theoric and friendly information about the science behind the experiments. Then we set to work. All children participated in the development of their experiments. In the end, we applied a satisfaction survey to 6th graders as well as the teachers in each group.
At the end of the day we could conclude that the experiments we prepared did like and motivated the children, as expected. We received excellent grades and positive comments from children and teachers.

BioJunior is an event organized at Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona (PRBB), where students at their last years of high school education come to visit the facilities in the PRBB and assist several talks, and all this with the aim of arousing scientific interest within young people.
Our team prepared a talk that travels through the history of synthetic biology with outstanding examples developed by groups and students from around the world. Our aim was to introduce the synthetic biology to them, as it is not a well-known field of knowledge in our country, and motivate them to continue studying science. We also did not lose the opportunity to introduce them our own project, always cheering them to be enterprising and never give up their ideas and thoughts. At the end of the talk, we also had a lot of fun listening to their opinions and proposals for improving our probiotic.

The Spain iGEM Meeting
On August 19-21 the three equips of iGem in Spain (Sevilla, Valencia and Barcelona), got together in the lovely city of Valencia. It was a wonderful opportunity to share experiences and receive feedback on the respective projects, but also to get to know the dynamics and organization of other teams. After a long walk in the unforgiven summer sun of Valencia, visiting the magnificent old town and the university campus, we still had some energy to start a collaboration with the team of Sevilla, which has evolved in a fruitful revision on the computational modelling efforts of both teams.  We left Valencia with our heads stuffed with information and with some unexpected insights into our project, and we strongly hope that the other teams had as a productive meeting as us.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Modeling Conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html," The model checks this through an iterative process were it examines the separation distance between recipients and donors/transconjugants. Once this distance is less than 2r the receiver colony is turned into a transconjugant.
Conjugation modeling
A large number of simulations were done for various parameter values. The animations below show the creation of transconjugants at low and high values of gr and λ. Higher values of λ lead to more transconjugants since the colonies are closer together and higher values of gr lead to more transconjugants since the colonies come into contact sooner. Due to the assumption of instantaneous conjugation this model will tend to overestimate conjugation events. The magnitude of this overestimation is lower for smaller intensities (λ).
Parameters used:
gr = 30 μm/hr
λ = 5.76 CFU/mm2 (Nd = 10000)

6. Writing International iGEM Protocols with iGEM 2016 team METU HS Ankara
iGEM 2016 team METU HS Ankara asked our team to write International iGEM Protocols as a collaboration this year, and we decided to translate them into Japanese.
Since they are basic protocols, we can’t make any successful experiments without them . We are sure that their activities will be able to help other iGEM teams. We are so grateful to be able to help in such activities.

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the WashU iGEM team, master of all the sciences, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they were busy making competent cells.
The WashU iGEM team is proud to have a diverse set of backgrounds and interests, including hailing from seven different states and Iowa (which is less of a state and more of an extended field of corn). We participate in activities ranging from building Rube Goldberg machines to teaching freshmen chemistry to putting on plays in a basement. Some of our team believes that ""gif"" is pronounced ""jif"", while others hold firm that the ""g"" is pronounced like the ""g"" in ""gradient PCR"". By bringing together this ragtag group of science-lovers, we have formed an impressive group of researchers who enjoy working with each other almost as much as they enjoy lab work. After all, the only bonds stronger than the bonds of chemistry are the bonds of friendship <3

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

2. Introduction
The principle of the experiment is to measure fluorescence of the media in which injectisome expressing E. coli have been grown for different time periods (0, 3 and 6 days) at 16 ℃. The experiment was conducted to investigate whether the injectisome leaks and quantify the degree of leakiness
3. Method
We used the plate reader SpectraMax M5 to measure the flourescence of the supernatant after different time periods. We also did Western Blots in order to detect presence of unfolded protein (that wouldn't be detected by the flourescence).
Experimental overview
1) Grow bacteria
2) Induce the bacteria with IPTG and arabinose to get expression of the injectisome and reporter protein
4) Take samples at different time intervals
5) Measure fluorescence of the media (supernatant) and pellet
6) Perform a western blot to detect non-folded proteins
Strains
For the experiment a variety of different strains were used. We have use ""I"", ""S"", ""C"" to describe the different strains.
'I+/-' corresponds to presence or absence injectisome (control strain vs. strain that is induced to express the injectisome).
'C+/-' corresponds to whether the chaperone (the CesF-CesT chaperone cassette) is present or not
'S+/-' corresponds to presence or absence of T3SS protein signal tag ( in our experiment the N-terminal Map20).
For example strain I+S+C- have all components present, except the chaperones.
IPTG is used to induce the expression of the injectisome.
Arabinose is used to induce the expression of reporter proteins (e.g. mCherry or GFP)
In our experiment we examined the following strains:

Introduction: Egg membrane experiment
The final product of PharMARSy would be a device that allows for growth of bacteria in one chamber and secretion of pure protein into another. Chambers would be divided by a biomimetic membrane, which should allow for bacteria to ""dock""on it and use injectosome for secretion, yet it should also be robust to prevent bacteria from crossing across to other chamber. Having bacteria residues or living bacteria in collection chamber would be very dangerous for patient (could result in sepsis) if no additional purification steps are implemented.

Together with IIT Delhi we were increasing each other’s Social Media impact, jointly built up an RNA isolation and purification pipeline in India and helped each other with circling samples and research equipment between India, Germany and the US.
How everything came into existence:
In the beginning of 2017 Berlin diagnostX launched their Facebook Page. Back then the team did not even know whether they would ever participate in the iGEM competition. They were a group of students lacking funding and a laboratory, but were planning on building a diagnostic test for Taenia Solium. They wanted to do so within the framework of the iGEM competition. Since social media is an important factor to gain financial support, Noa from Berlin diagnostX contacted iGEM IIT Delhi to ask whether they would be willing to share each others posts to gain more followers and increase the reach of our posts. This small-scale collaboration worked promoting each other on social media. This initial collaboration laid the foundation for our extensive collaboration – because without this pre-existing contact, Berlin diagnostX may not have skyped with iGEM IIT Delhi before travelling to India.
A first Gasp of transcontinental research
Later in 2017 Henrik and Dimi of Team diagnostX flew to India to establish new research cooperations. Because their journey would lead them through Delhi they contacted iGEM IIT to visit their lab and exchange research ideas. Throughout a first skype call with Kshitij and Tarun, all got along so well, that the idea emerged to jointly build a pipeline, that would allow local PCR and RNA isolation of/on lysed, non-infectious S1-security level samples, that Berlin diagnostX planned to acquire from India.
With that in mind Berlin diagnostX tried to order some RNA isolation kits and PCR reagents to the lab of iGEM IIT but it turned out that multinational companies like NEB, ThermoFisher and QI"

Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in [5] ). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested in vivo. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well [6] and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters [7] and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements [8] , but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength [9] , [10] .
In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several ""domains"". The core promoter is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in [11] ). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as ""enhancers"" and ""silencers"". A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity [5] .

Figure 1: The method of RA-PCR. The combination of oligos added to the PCR reaction determines the specificity and strengths of the synthesized promoters. If knowing the response elements for the transcription factors of a pathway, any promoter can be assembled by this method.
We have developed a standard method (termed ""Random Assembly PCR / RA-PCR"") for the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It"
British_Columbia,2013,Team:British Columbia#Notebook#Caffeine_-_-_TEXT.html," decision to combine the three available (from the kit) caffeine biosynthesis genes and Biobrick them behind a promoter and ribosome-binding site (RBS). We included a bacterial ribosome-binding site in each of the forward primers to allow transcription when each gene is also Biobricked individually. This round of PCR reactions was named ""PCR 2.""
PCR 2 would ideally yield the following products:
Part H: ---XbaI---gene H---SpeI---NcoI---
Part J: ---NcoI---XbaI---gene J---SpeI---BamHI---
Part L: ---BamHI---XbaI---gene L---SpeI---
Individually and ligated together, these products could be digested by XbaI and SpeI and inserted into a Biobrick vector cut with X and S.

PCR 1: Attempt #3 on part 17H
Experimentor : Grace Yi
Aim : To design and order primers to ""stitch"" the caffeine genes together
Results : PCR 1 was re-tried for part H, this time with the addition of DMSO. This was done in duplicate, to be able to compare the Phusion HF and GC buffers. PCR was successful, with bands seen at 1100 bases for both reactions. It appeared using either buffer would yield the same results, so we combined the two products and decided to use the HF buffer for consistency.

Restriction Digest with XbaI and SpeI
Experimentor : Liz Geum
Aim : To digest 17H, 17J, and 17L with XbaI and SpeI
Results : About 300 ng of today's PCR 1 product was cut with XbaI and SpeI. A larger amount (500 ng) of PCR 1 product for parts J and L (from July 11) were cut again with XbaI and SpeI, as a gel of the previous digest products showed very faint bands at the size of the insert.

Optimizing PCR 2
Experimentor : Grace Yi, Liz Geum
Aim : to optimize PCR 2 with stitching primers
Results : 3% DMSO and 59°C annealing temperature were optimal conditions for PCR 2. All three genes showed amplification at 1kb.

We struggled trying to communicate the molecular approach of our project, and what exactly our project is doing on the sub-cellular level. We decided to use Virtual Reality (VR) with science to communicate molecular biology by showing the viewer first hand what's happening inside the cell. This was a challenge but it succeeded and we created an innovative learning tool to engage the public and professionals with our project. To read more about our molecular VR experience click here . To learn about the public events at which this was displayed please click the links for the UEA Open Day and the Norwich Science Festival . The response has been overwhelming and we are really proud of what we managed to achieve.
Demonstrate your work
To simulate the electrical input that would come from a renewable source of energy a battery was used to pass a set current through our electrochemical cell. Electrons from this battery were fed into our transformed Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain containing our hydrogenase overexpression construct. The decrease in current in our strain overexpressing the enzymes indicates more of the electricity is being converted to hydrogen by the hydrogenase enzymes. For more information please click here .

What policies are in place in developing countries such as Ethiopia regarding synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms? Do you think there is a need for a multi-diagnostic test that provides a distinct diagnosis between malaria and diseases that present similar symptoms? In developing countries such as Ethiopia, what level of government involvement is present in the healthcare system? Is there a positive mindset regarding these initiatives of distribution of diagnostics and is there a potential for subsidization?
Throughout the week we also started working on the presentation for Geneva Conference. We started by creating an outline of important points that we want to mention in the presentation. We also started considering the possible format of the presentation and the 2 choices were a power point or a video.
Week 12: July 21st - July 25th
This week we continued working on the presentation for Geneva conference. This week Policies and Practices sub-team also presented their work to the rest of the team. We used the presentation prepared for Geneva conference because it summarized what we have done and it was a chance for us to get feedback on the presentation from the rest of the team.
This week additionally we decided to work on our human practices interviews and set up times with our three experts on Malaria misdiagnosis to ensure that we have a variety of perspectives to help us with informed design.  Having the perspectives of qualified individuals that have worked in this industry all over the world will help us make choices to accurately represent any challenges we may face within our device.  Everyone was very helpful and forwarded details of their research and additional resources that will help us locate the information that will assist with informed design.  This assistance ensures that our project is authentic with real application in the developing world and that we will make the appropriate design considerations.

This week 4 representatives from our team went to Geneva for Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention. More information on our trip can be found here .  Attending the Biological Toxin and Weapon Convention gave the four representatives from our team the opportunity to showcase the iGEM competition on an international stage - and show the individuals responsible for influencing and creating policy the level of synthetic biology research and competition that occurs at the undergraduate level.  This level of publicity for the iGEM foundation was noted by several Non-Governmental Organizations and guests of the meeting and appreciated by country delegations.  Aspects of the convention such as the poster presentation allowed the four individuals to network and communicate ideas with individuals such as the FBI and other university researchers that"

We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

Transformants containing the 3A assembled hph selection marker were screened for the correct inserts by cPCR with the verification primers, VF2 and VR. 5 Colonies were chosen from each of the CaMV promoter containing transformants and 8 colonies were chosen from the pGpdA containin transformants, due to higher background (estimated by amount of RFP-expressing cells). A one-taq PCR amplification were then performed and the products run on a gel:
Based on the gel none of the screened mutants contained the right insert, which should be about 3200 bp, though g34 seem to containg some sort of additional assembly. Thus, this should be investigated.
