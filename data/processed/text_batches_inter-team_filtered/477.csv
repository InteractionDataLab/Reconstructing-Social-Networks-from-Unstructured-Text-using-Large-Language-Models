Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#SravantiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," import the other files from G-nome surfer, it should go more smoothly.
Week 3: June 3-7
Monday:
Today, we traveled as a team to Boston University to meet with their iGEM team and to learn more about synthetic biology. We built upon our knowledge from Friday’s BioBuilder workshop at MIT and learned specifics about how plasmids are created and details about the transcription and translation processes. It was nice to learn from other students, and to see how they view synthetic biology and the iGEM competition from a wetlab standpoint. In the afternoon, we worked on coding in Eugene, which is a computer language built specifically for designing synthetic biology devices. As a programmer, I appreciated the close correlation between Eugene and Java, but I also see the challenges for synthetic biologists who may not be familiar with programming in C or Java. It was also valuable to work through specific Eugene circuits with BU team members - seeing how they use parts, properties, and rules provided good insight for our team to start brainstorming for the Eugene DeSyne project.
Tuesday:
We also spent today at Boston University collaborating with their iGEM team. Today, we learned about ideas for their iGEM projects and presented our ideas as well. The nature of their projects was very different from ours; even so, their work related to ours in several ways. They are looking to expand and characterize the MoClo library as well as identifying different optimizations of genetic circuits, and we are trying to provide a search engine tool for synthetic biologists to find the optimal genetic circuit with given constraints. Through the past couple days, I’ve seen that we could have the same goal, but approach that goal in two very different ways based on either wetlab or computational techniques. It was also helpful to gain feedback from the BU team with our project ideas so far. Learning about what they value in synthetic biology tools and what they find most useful will be invaluable when coming up with prototypes for our projects in the coming days.
Wednesday:
Today was my first day on the Eugene DeSyne team, as I moved from the Tabula project. Using the feedback from BU as well as a few ideas that the lab came up with previously, we came up with a couple of prototype designs for Eugene DeSyne, which will act as a search tool for synthetic biologists to search for genetic devices and refine their searches based on specified parameters, such as rules that include/exclude genes, specify the order of parts, etc. The first design we came up with used multiple panels that mimicked the workflow of Eugene but without actually writing code."

MARS Tutorial Videos
Summary
In this section you will find our Microfluidics 101 video tutorials. These videos take you through the basics of fabricating and using MARS microfluidic chips. Each is a fully narrated, step-by-step guide teaching you how to mill, make PDMS, and more! For those who prefer reading, each video is accompanied by an in-depth, printable written protocol.
This branch of MARS was validated by our iGEM poll. When we reached out to teams regarding what educational materials they would find useful, one of the highest voted tools were video tutorials with 73.8% of responses indicating video tutorials would help them start using microfluidics. This idea was also pitched to various microfluidic manufacturing companies who advised us on specific elements to include. For example, including written content in the form of protocols was suggested in order to provide a written guide to be carried into laboratory settings or referred to when offline. The inclusion of our “Cleaning” video was inspired by Black Hole Lab’s emphasis on proper cleaning and storage of their chips during training seminars for lab technicians.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", Abbie, Amandeep and Kamil were able to start to work on meeting some deadlines (such as the proposal for the CRISPR grant and safety forms). Amandeep, Chinyere and Neythen were thinking about developing an app and started to do some basic brainstorming of ideas.
July
Monday 4th July - Meetings
Some of the team members met to attend a skype meeting with the Paris team at 11am. We wanted to start to collaborate with the igem teams (uptown funk music video). We also had a meeting with the UCL staff members who are related to sutton trust year 12 summer school - we will be collaborating with them! We discussed our project with them and came up with some great activities with the students. Michelle started making the introduction of team members video for our youtube video. We were discussing some fun ways we could get attention such that we can raise awareness of synthetic biology and iGEM.
.
Tuesday 5th July - Meetings
day 1 of labs: Abbie and Kuba were in the labs starting the transformation. The other team members were in a meeting with our supervisors, where we had a discussion about the biobricks that still needed to be ordered, . Amandeep started making the infographic, which was posted onto social media to introduce our project to the wider community.
Wednesday 6th July - Meetings
Abbie was at the designers, finalising the logo. Some of the team members are thinking about the entrepreneur side of our project whilst other team members were making lesson plans for the sessions with the younger generation.We were also able to post the infographic onto social media (which got alot of attention) as well as introducing our logo.
Thursday 7th July - Meetings
Kuba, , Dale, Michelle, Kamil and Amandeep were attending a meeting with New England Biologics about how they can sponsor us and provide us with some tools in the labs. This was extremely useful! The team members then met up to discuss what we need todo for today, some team members were interested in starting labs (for our project) today, whilst other team members worked on developing the lesson plans for the outreach activities we have planned next week! Other team members were also researching and building our business canvas

The GFP, double terminator, and strongest RBS parts were reovernighted to be reminiprepped and digested tomorrow
Wednesday
Mike and Lajja prepared the miniprepped DNA from monday’s overnights(pgad/lysis part and ECphy) for sequencing
The lab discovered that our plan of attack for the RBS/CP problem was wrong; the part we were using had RFP and an RBS and a CP in it
We will now digest the backbone (that has a CP/RBS/RFP in it) with S and P to get rid of the RFP and open up a slot for us to insert our part.
Then we will digest the part we want inserted with X and P. Finally, we will ligate the CP/RBS backbone part with the part we want inserted to make a CP/RBS/Part construct
We chose to follow two parallel routes:
1.) Digest/Gel extract/Ligate/Transform
2.) Digest/Ligate/Transform
Digested Ligated and transformed:
EC Phy(E/P) + KanaBB(E/P) ---> on kan
Citro Phy (X/P) + wCP(S/P) ----> on amp
Citro Phy (X/P) + mCP(S/P) ----> on amp
Citro Phy (X/P) + nsCP(S/P) ----> on amp
For route 1 the CP/RBS backbone part was gel extracted and eluted, making sure no RFP part could religate into the backbone.
For route 2 the CP/RBS backbone part was not gel extracted so some RFP can religate; however,"
St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#ethics#DissoiLogoi_-_-_TEXT.html," his patents, the techniques and practices required to actively develop Synthetic Biology would be closed to all but those under the operation of Venter and his mass academic and commercial umbrella. While it is undeniable that Venter has clear scientific motives for all his work, he is also all too aware of the huge commercial value that his field holds. ExxonMobil generated profits of $19 billion in what was an economically unstable 2009, of which $196 million was committed to charitable causes [10], [11]. Surely then one of the main spinoffs of Venter’s work will be to further increase the profitability of a company whose primary motivation is to generate money for its own benefit. Any potential medical advance would presumably follow the same pattern and so the world-changing drugs and treatments promised would become commercially controlled and inaccessible to those who really need them. In the race to decode the human genome, Venter’s company Celera filed 6,500 patents for whole or partial human genes [12]. At that time the patents were not granted, much to the relief if the scientific community.
However, in 2010 it was revealed that “around a quarter of the genes in the human genome” now have patents associated with them owned by a variety of companies [12]. The possible implications of this are alarming. Surely allowing Venter to continue on his current path would be similarly dangerous for the future of not only science but of the human race.
An issue of safety
A raft of safety concerns exist surrounding Synthetic Biology. The potential for malicious use in the creation of a new generation of purpose-built biological weapons is among the most prominent. This is a very real concern. In 2002 a team of researchers mail-ordered sequences of synthetic DNA and were then able to create a working version of the deadly poliovirus [13]. Since then the team say they have gone through the process six more times, with each attempt proving successful faster and more easily as technology, driven by Synthetic Biology develops and becomes more efficient [14]. Had the “experiment” been performed by less respectable scientists the ramifications could have been catastrophic. And this is not a one-off case either. Similar achievement include the recreation of the extinct Spanish Flu in 1997 and a journalist paid for the synthesis of a fragment of DNA of the virus responsible for the smallpox disease which a sufficiently well-read group of scientists could have turned into a world-wide pandemic in just a few weeks [15]. Synthetic Biology is the medium which facilitates this kind of phenomenon. The major upshot of this is that the world superpowers become ever more aware of the threat posed to them by biot"

Note: Some colonies grow which may not be transformed. It is therefore useful to include a fluorescent protein marker.
Characterization of endophytic isolates
Optical Density (OD) at 600nm as measure of growth rate
Overnight cultures in 6 mL LB were inoculated from colonies on solid media and grown for 24 hours at 30°C. These cultures were then diluted to a standard  OD and a plastic inoculation loop was used to inoculate a second 6 mL LB culture. After 24 hours at 30°C, The 1/10 diluted OD was measured.
Susceptibility
Cultures grown overnight at 30°C in 6 mL LB were streaked to form a lawn on MH plates. Sterile paper disks were soaked in either 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol  or came pre-treated with streptomycin. The disks were placed on the streaked plates are incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. The radius of clearance was measured are  compared to standards.
ACC utilization
Overnight cultures of isolates were streaked onto DF-ACC agar without  MoO3 to prevent nitrogen acquisition via fixation. After 2 days on these plates, presence or absence of growth was recorded.
Sequencing
The 16S region of the bacterial isolates was amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27F and 1492R. Polymerases Q5, Phusion, or Taq were used for amplification. PCR products were processed for sequencing via reaction with Exonuclease I and Antarctic Phosphat"

This summer, I have been responsible for the designing and performing of our experiments. Previous experience has helped me a lot ，however iGEM let me realized that there are still much to learn. Although final year in high school is very busy， I still immensely enjoyed preparing for this year's iGEM and hope we can get a good result ！—Eloise⁄(⁄ ⁄ ⁄ω⁄ ⁄ ⁄)⁄
Hi everyone!
I am Shan Jiang, this is my first year attending the iGEM competition. I am involved in almost every aspect of our team this year. As a fresh man I don't know how I became a team leader, maybe it’s like a famous poem‘I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country to the life and death, irrespective of the personal will and world.' Actually I am a better soccer player than a biologist →_→ .
Hi everyone! My name is Yueyi Xu, I am a member of SIAT-SCIE. I am in charge of some wet lab work and Human Practice job. I’m interested in biology and chemistry. Since I joined the iGEM group in SCIE, I’ve learned a lot of skills such as to research data, create ideas, cooperate and communicate with other members. Above all, I have learned a lot and experienced the excitements that exclusive for iGEMers.
Hi everyone!
I am Yixuan Zhao.For my role in our team, I am the Human Practice group leader and a member of lab group. Thanks to this incredible experience in iGEM competition,I've had the chance to communicate and cooperate with friends who are also interested by biology. If you have any questions upon the Human Practice part of our team please contact me via our official email without hesitation. Looking forward to meet you at the Giant Jamboree:).
Hi everyone! the
‘one that never went into wet lab’
, the
‘leader in name only’
, the
‘programmer mastermind’
and the mathematical modeler is a most peculiar creature that works in the dark with various DNA design and mathematical software.His endeavor of using math to precisely model biological information is indeed admirable, although the yield was negligible.

Work Environments Used to Handle Biological Materials
When handling biological materials in our lab open benches and a laminar flow hood are used. Some materials are handled in different work environments, for example DNA gels containing GelRed/Ethidium Bromide are only used in designated areas.
Disposal of Waste
Biological waste is disposed of in a yellow biohazard. When full, the bin collected and then sent to be disposed of appropriately along with the biological waste bins from the other laboratories in the institute. Sharps are placed into a sharps bin and when full also collected and disposed of appropriately. Liquid waste is poured into a waste bottle. Once full, it is then autoclaved before being disposed of in the appropriate method.
Personal Protective Equipment
In our lab, lab coats, enclosed shoes, safety glasses and gloves are worn at all times.
Safety Training
UNSW has a compulsory policy of safety training before being induced into a lab. The topics covered in this training included: using equipment in the lab, hazards and risks, safe work procedures, details of emergency procedures and health and safety online training modules including ergonomic training and OHS awareness. With equipment not in the lab such as the autoclave and the nanodrop, an induction was completed on how to use the equipment safely. To be granted after-hours access to the lab and the equipment, further online training modules were completed including after-hours lab safety and campus safety, as well as general risks in the UNSW school of Biotechnology and Biomolecular sciences.

Marburg,2015,Team:Marburg#Minicells_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid, every strain could be brought to the production of minicells by a simple transformation.
To achieve all the described future goals, further experiments have to be conducted. Most of these experiments were planed but haven’t been achieved so far. The first step is to use FACS with a cell sorter to get a 100% separation of minicells from cells containing chromosomes. This needs to be ensured so that our further analytics are not contaminated by non-minicells. Our facility will get a cell sorter soon, which will allow us to proceed with this improved purification. The next step is to analyze the metabolic activity of the minicells using metabolic approaches. For the first proof, we are going to test if we can observe glycolysis in the minicells. Furthermore, we are going to test if we can induce whole metabolic pathways e.g. the one for β-carotene in the purified minicells. If these tests are successful, we can use the minicells even for the production for growth inhibiting products as no cell proliferation is needed within the minicells.
Background
Bacterial minicells are produced by asymmetric cell division, which is caused by a knock out of the MinCDE-system. Naturally, this system regulates symmetric cell division [Jivrajani et al. 2013]. The Min-proteins bind to the cell poles and oscillate between them. MinC functions as inhibitor for FtsZ, which forms the Z-ring and ultimately initiates division of the cell. This symmetric division ensures that each cell gets a copy of the chromosome and all other cell components and thus, is able to live on its own. If this system is disturbed, cell division occurs randomly leading to the formation of minicells.
Figure 11: Normal functional min-system
As only a MinC knock down is needed to get minicells, we looked for a simple and modular solution. The knock down of gene expression through a small regulatory RNA (sRNA) system was already shown in iGEM by the Team Paris Bettencourt 2013 which was a great success for knock downs of target genes and was based on the Na et al. 2013 publication. The sRNA is processed by the Hfq protein and then, can bind to the mRNA where it induces its degradation and stops the protein biosynthesis. Our system was designed according to the guidelines of the paper: a sRNA that binds with 24 bp to the MinC mRNA (Figure 11).

Glycerol stocks of yeast parts
Innoculate cultures of transformed yeasties.
Test #1 on parts Z0267, Z0277, and Z0415
--------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately it appears that two of the yeast cultures did not grow.  These are the ZifA + ZifA reporter strain and also the null + Gli1R reporter.  The second one is more sever, given that it was intended for use today.  It is likely that the colony was simply missed during innoculation due to its small size.  Decided to use Gli1A + Gli1A reporter instead.  This is simply a test run of our protocol.
Took out of incubator around 9:45 am.  Diluted by adding 150 uL of each culture to 5 mL of fresh media.  Note that this is simply to get them back into log phase, so that it may not be important to make sure that the cell concentrations are identical for all three.
Put into incbuator again at 10:18 am.  Took them out around 1:31 pm.  Observed some apparent growth, but not a significant amount.
OD measurements: GliR had a range between 0.004 and 0.011.  For five measurements (repeated measurements from two samples), it had an average of 0.0074.  Put 100 uL of these cells directly into each well devoted towards testing the Gli1 repressor.
For W3031_a, the range was between 0.012 and 0.030.  For five measurements (repeated measurements from two samples), it had an average of 0.0202.  Diluted these cells to match the concentration of the Gli1R cells.  Added 2.5 mL of this culture to 4.3 mL fresh culture.  Then added 100 uL of this mixture to each well devoted to testing W303.  For wells that contain media alone, we added an additional 100 uL of the respective media in each well.
First plate reading done at 3:15 pm.  Second reading done at 4:18 pm.  Final reading taken around 5:07 pm.  Discovered some interesting patterns in fluorescence.  Saved all plate reader results in the Plate Reader folder on the iGEM computer.  However"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can't bind anymore to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated. Although the TetR-system is known to be a tight promoter system there is always a certain background expression with most promoters. If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide, the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli). When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane. After the integration into the outer membrane, the protein cargo is transported through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is presented on the bacterial surface. We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.

The in-depth Communication of LZU&SZU iGEM
Due to Lanzhou University(LZU) has a very good experience in cancer research, and LZU iGEM debuted in Asia Division in 2013, with the《Twinkle Medicine Hunter of Cancer 》 obtained a good achievement,and because the project of SZU iGEM is on cancer research this year,we reached cooperation agreement. Part of the experimental verification results of our project was LZU iGEM helping us design and verify.
The entries of LZU iGEM This year is about environmental protection,and just last year,Exactly right the project we did last year related environmental protection,called 《Alkaline Cellulase Dream Factory》.
Last year is SZU first time to participate in iGEM,and we won the gold medal.Therefore,LZU iGEM is very interested in and confident of us,and we communicated online.For their projects,we provided constructive suggestions on the model and helped them to design a part of the model.
Therefore,in order to further in-depth exchanges with us and thank-us-for-help,LZU iGEM traveled long distances from Lanzhou to Shenzhen on August 19, 2015.In the course of communication,we have reached a consensus,and hope that our two school teams can work together for a long time to achieve win-win.
We help LZU_China to build a part of the model:
During the period of LZU-China conduct this project, a tough problem occurred that the mu-circuit needs both a huge voltage difference and a stable voltage so that it needs to eliminate interference from supply voltage. Only with a steady reliable device can they work out a stable millivolt level voltage. Therefore, this question confused them for a long time but eventually accomplished their voltage stabilizing circuit with the help of us. We provided this voltage stabilizing circuit.

Considering that the core tool of our project is rooted in foundational synthetic biology principles, we decided that we would focus on different disciplines as they intersect within the field of synthetic biology. Our first initiative was a podcast series, Synversations, where each episode was intended to address a discipline (ex. Arts, business, ethics, engineering)  that could make significant contributions to the field synthetic biology. Furthermore, we organised an Iconathon workshop in order to engage both artists and researchers in a collaborative initiative to meet the need for better scientific icons. Additionally, we designed a trivalent workshop for high school students, encompassing bioinformatics, bioethics, and genetics. The aim to not only inspire the them to engage with synthetic biology in an academic setting, but to also educate them as members of the public about the diversity of opportunities and possibilities that the field can offer.
Part II: The Future of Gene Editing is Lit
Employing LacILOV & Anti-CRISPR to Regulate Gene Editing
The CRISPR-Cas9 technology holds tremendous promise for human gene therapy. The technology has already been applied to various human diseases, from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to the congenital heart disorder that results from a mutation in MYBPC3. However, despite the potential of these initial studies, off-targeting editing remains a concern, particularly during different phases of the cell cycle. This is often exacerbated by the relative efficiency of the error-prone Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) pathway over Homology-Directed Repair (HDR), which are both activated upon Cas9’s creation of a double-stranded break in DNA. If the technology is to be employed in the clinic for human gene therapy in the future, a dramatic improvement in our control of Cas9 is desperately needed. To address this problem, we designed a switch for the sgRNA of the CRISPR-Cas9 system using one of the recently discovered anti-CRISPR proteins, AcrIIA4.
This anti-CRISPR protein is encoded by the Listeria monocytogenes phage that inhibits Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 by binding to the Cas9 endonuclease:sgRNA complex. This prevents Cas9 from binding DNA. The design of the CRISPR switch is similar to the design of our basic switch, with a few additions:
An sgRNA expressed from the Ptrc-2 promoter, therefore placed under the regulation of LacILOV
The AcrIIA4 expressed from the BBa_R0051 promoter,"

JC:  To insert PDC/ADH genes into the σ70 constitutive promoter plasmid, 0.5ug of σ70/pSB1A3 (2190bp) was digested with SpeI and PstI and 0.5ug of PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 (5124bp) was digested with XbaI and PstI.  These digestions cut out the red fluorescent protein (rfp) tag on pSB1A3 (rfp=885bp) to aid in colony selection.  Digestions were run on a 1% agarose gel, and bands obtained confirmed PDC/ADH (3054bp), pSB1C3 (2070bp), σ70/pSB1A3 (2190), and rfp (885bp).  Incomplete digestion of PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was apparent for sample #8, so the sample was re-digested before ligation.

Tina Su
Currently a sophomore Chemistry major, Tina is interested in just about everything. Her passion for learning has allowed her to be one of two people who span both the wetlab and drylab. Her dependability in interjecting with at least one question has allowed us to lovingly nickname her the 'Random Question Generator.' Tina brings lots of hard work and dedication to the team, the same of which can be seen in her hobbies, such as running three miles a day. The team really needs her ability to be thorough while managing her >20 credits and researching for CUGEM, and not just because nobody else is small enough to be the subject in analogies involving the size of our Pelican bioreactor encasement. Tina is incredibly caring and friendly, but if you still need something to talk about, simply mention yogurt. Or bread. Or Feynman.

Manny Valdez
There was once a chemical engineer who feared no machine.
His name was Manny Valdez, and he frequently dominated Pita Pit.
On iGEM, he is our tank.
When you need to bring in the big guns.
When you need to break out the machines.
When you need to CAD the **** outta some Septimus.
You call Manny Valdez.
He rumored to have DJ prowess on par with deadmau5.
Lydia Wang
Lydia is a unique specimen in the Cornell iGEM team. Not only is she one of the rare electrical engineers that have been ensnared by iGEM, but she also has shown an incredible skillset in the electronics lab. These include the ability to communicate to electronics and defy the laws of physics. When she is not busy trying to move batteries in Phillips 228, she is often seen showing off her magnificent rowing skills for the dragon boat team"

COMMUNICATION
Introduction Analysis Audiences Goals Key messages Tactics and Inputs Planning Budget and evaluation Recommendations
Recommendations
The reason why we set up a communication plan was that in our opinion communication to the public about our work is very important and during iGEM competition we experienced a perfect example of the complexity in communication.
A journalist visited our team in order to write an article about the iGEM competition and our project. We agreed that we as iGEM team would review the article before it would be published. In our opinion the article which this journalist wrote, was not objectively written and we couldn't agree on what message this article sent to the reader. Despite this the journalist decided to publish this article.
This is one of the major complications with communication to the public. The one who is actually informing the public, the journalist, is not completely familiar with the scientific details and he or she does not have the same insights as the scientist who is working on the subject. This creates a complication, because the journalist is not well informed about the subject and he or she can not inform the reader objectively and may not deliver the right message to the reader. This is exactly the reason why we find it important that scientists themselves are involved in informing the public, they know the details, have the knowledge, and are aware of the possibilities and impossibilities of subjects which they are working on. By shortening the communicating track these complexities could be avoided.
Our recommendation to the next iGEM teams:
Contribute to the the public perception of Synthetic Biology. Participation of an iGEM team to the iGEM competition is partially possible by public resources (a lot of universities over the world are funded by public money from governments).
Pay attention to the message that you as a team want to send to the outside world about your project and divide this message carefully.
Use our communication plan as an example and improve upon it.

Side (left) and bottom (right) views of Mtd monomer in yellow with variable repeat region highlighted in purple.
It is important to mention that the screening methods will vary depending on the nature of the desired target – a different setup can be used to screen for binding against free-floating proteins than proteins fixed to a surface.  A pre-clear (negative selection) step may be necessary if a pre-specified target will be bound to beads or a defined matrix. For example, if beads are to be loaded with the desired target, the sample should first be run through the beads alone as a control. The flow-through can then be collected and used in the final screen. There are multiple approaches we can take to test binding of our library to E. coli and determine which screening method is most efficient. These include applying our sample over a lawn of E. coli, into a liquid culture solution, or to a target-immobilized bound to a scaffold

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," so all we really had to do was substitute in our new input file. While Laura edited her python code, I went ahead and ran OptKnock for triple reaction knockouts.
- Experiments From Jul 30
Knockouts did not have expected Results
J_exp33
After running our python code for both double and triple reaction knockouts, we found that none of the proposed knockouts from our OptKnock code were coupled with reduced flavodoxin. In other words, every knockout had the same max biomass and ATP level as our original nitrogen fixation model- i.e. without any knockouts. The only useful piece of information we drew from our outputs was that several reactions involved in pyruvate metabolism were included in the suggested knockouts. This would confirm some of our previous suggestions on increasing reduced flavodoxin production by manipulating pyruvate metabolism in the cell.
- Experiments From Jul 31
Summary for Website
J_exp35
While Laura resolved these issues in her code, I began our modeling summary for the website. Laura and I felt that an introduction, associated methods, formulation, and results section were appropriate. Because Laura is still working on her python code, I decided to cover the first two sections and my results from the metabolite exchange reactions.

Fixed another Bug
J_exp36
8/3­ Laura regenerated outputs for her double­gene knockout code, but inconsistencies were still popping up in our data when we manually tested knockouts coupled with flavodoxin. We were finding that for non­infeasible knockouts, the maximum biomass, ATP, and reduced flavodoxin values were completely off from those in the iteration outputs. We finally were able to figure out that the code was coupling each gene with itself, resulting in several infeasible outputs. However, instead of skipping over these knockouts, the code outputted the previous set of output values, resulting in mismatched data. We resolved this issue but removing duplicate genes in our code.

Work on Website Summary
J_exp37
Following our meeting with iGem, Laura and I finalized our travels grants and began working on the modeling summary for our wiki page. We wanted to draw attention specifically to what genome­scale modeling is and what we’re hoping to accomplish using methods such as FBA (navigating potential genetic interventions to optimize cofactors of nitrogen­fixing in E. coli). Because most of our results were inconclusive, we wanted to focus on our discoveries with pyruvate metabolism, and how we can promote the"

SSHS-Shenzhen
This year, we made a long-term collaboration with SSHS-Shenzhen. Our team members helped them build a team and gave them advice on the experiment, safety, and more details of the competition. We also gave them instruction in modeling. In return, they did a closed beta test of our application and mini program on WeChat in order to make our application and mini program better.
SMS_Shenzhen
In summer, we shared our laboratories with SMS_Shenzhen, and guided them to do some foundational molecular biology experiments, like electrophoresis as well as transformation. We also gave them a hand on their Interlab. We gave them instruction on reading the protocol and provided them for some equipment. As a reward for what we did, they provided us with detailed research about chitin.
GreatBay_China
This year, we invited a high school iGEM team, GreatBay_China to our campus for a 2018 iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting held by our team. We shared not only the experience of holding a meeting but some new ideas of human practice. Additionally, we provided them with a laboratory for their Interlab.
SIAT-SCIE
We shared the reagent and experimental equipment with each other, like a kit board, centrifuge, autoclave as well. Besides, we shared our experience of Interlab as well as parts of data from Interlab. After they finished the Interlab, they shared some of the plasmids to us for our experiment. They also help us promote our Mini Program by posting their story on it and giving us some suggestions on program design.

KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#HumanPractices#PublicEngagement_-_-_TEXT.html," went over some actual studies in synthetic biology, which includes PROP-Z, recombinant luminescent bacteria and efficient biofuel production. There were students in the lower grades present, and some of them seemed to have trouble keeping up during this part, so we tried to simplify the details, focus on key concepts and use metaphors to help them understand. This seemed to help, but we still received numerous questions during and after this part.
Exercise session began with each student setting an objective, such as a heat-sensing bacterial thermometer or edible antibiotics. We then explained how to use KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and did a pathway-searching exercise with some simple metabolites. After that, we showed them the RSBP (Registry of Standard Biological Parts) that iGEM supports, and encouraged students to look for genes that are needed for their synthetic organisms. Both exercises were done via smartphones, and although their small screens proved somewhat of a problem when reading pathways and so on, they worked surprisingly well, and the students were quick and eager to catch up. However, some were disappointed at the limited choices on the current part list, which led to a discussion on the future of synthetic biology and its visions.
There was a Q&A session between each part of the mentoring, and the students had quite a number of questions. Many were about our high school days, and our studies in college. But others were about synthetic biology, such as the differences between synthetic biology and genetic engineering. A lot of students were also interested in iGEM, and were impressed by college undergraduates and even high school students participating in actual research projects.
Overall, this session was a valuable opportunity for not only the high school students but also for us, too. The students got to learn about the unknown but prominent field of synthetic biology, and hear about the everyday life of a science lab. We were able to see how little ordinary students knew about synthetic biology, and improve our educational methods and material. Although synthetic biology still has a long way to go, it is bound to reach its goal someday.

1. Aim
A restriction digest is the division of DNA in a  specific area by the help of restriction enzymes. The aim afterwards could be to analyze and characterize (restriction maps) the DNA, to compare it to others or to clone it into e.g. a vector. Previous to the restriction, the DNA has to be isolated (see protocol miniprep).
2. Test digest - What for?
In a test digest the cleavage products are analyzed to verify that the used DNA has e.g. taken in a specific fragment. Only few of the DNA is digested, because the uncut DNA will be used in further steps. The whole DNA strand is often too long to analyze, therefore:
targeted cuts between specific base sequences
cleavage fragments small enough to run on gel
segregation and analysis by gel electrophoresis
→ always with a control: uncut plasmid (see protocol gel electrophoresis) In a preparative digest normally 1 U enzyme digests 1 µg DNA in one hour.
3. Preparative digest - What for?
In a preparative digest the entire available DNA is digested, because the cleavage products are used in further steps. The cut DNA can be extracted from a gel.  It is important that as much DNA as possible is digested. Therefore 0,2 - 0,4 µl enzyme per µg DNA are applied and the reaction should run for ~2h.
4. Procedure
exemplary pipetting scheme:
component
volume
DNA (typically 200 - 500 ng)
1 µl
10x buffer
1 µl
H2O
7,6 µl
enzyme 1
0,1 µl
enzyme 2
0,1 µl
final volume
10 µl
If more than one reaction is done, it is convenient to prepare a master mix containing everything except for the DNA (!). This saves time and tips and keeps you from having to pipet very small volumes (e.g. 0,1 µl).
It is also possible to use more than two or just one restriction enzyme per reaction. They just need to have the same buffer preferences. Volumes have to be adjusted to the number of enzymes.

08-10-2010 Maya P2 lab
100 ul of the O/N cultures originating from pIGR03 and pIGR04 were mixed with 3 ml of top agar and plated on LB plates with Amp. On top of the agar I added a small disc with 5 ul of mitomycin and a disc with 5 ul of water as a control. Ideally mitomycin should induce phage induction and thereby initiate expression of the antirepressor. The antirepressor should then de-repress the repressor allowing expression of GFP.

Did transformations of the ligations made yesterday and plated these out on the right antibiotic plates. pBADZ1/2 were plated on the four different plates described yesterday. Hopefully we will see red colonies tomorrow.
Did a PCR in parallel with the T-group where we used miniprep 4, 6, 11 and 16 (from october 2nd) and two of the T-group minipreps (which are known to give bands). It will be exciting to see if we can't make a PCR or we have just been unlucky.
07-10-2010 Maya - Still Depressor group
Yesterday I just did some restreaks of the transformations I made 05-10-2010. Today I had a look at these, and it was very obvious that the pIGR01 (G1+GFP) construct in the 421 (WT) strain looked really sick. This is most likely because the pR promoter is too strong and we get too much GFP expression. We thought that the repressor, which is naturally in the salmonella, would repress the pR promoter, but this was not the case.
The other constructs seemed okay.
I had a look at some of the strains in the microscope in order to see whether they expressed GFP. These were:
pIGR02 (G2+GFP) in 421 (WT)
pIGR02 (G2+GFP) in 413
D: pIGR03 (GR1) in 421 (WT)
C expressed a lot of GFP measured at 14 ms. It was very clear that the cells were not doing too good:-)
B expressed 30% less GFP (says Flemming). We would have expected the repressor from the Salmonella prophages to shut down expression from the pR promoter more efficiently.
D hardly expressed any GFP. This was both good and bad. Good because it indicates that"

Plates from the UiOslo iGEM teams characterization of our biobrick.
There were significant differences between the number of colonies formed in plates with cells and medium                 that were preincubated with 20 mM arabinose and plates with cells and medium that were preincubated with                 20 mM glucose.                 All plates containing Arabinose (MP6 inducer) had a higher number of colonies than the plates containing                 Glucose (MP6 repressor).
MP6 induces mutations in the control plasmid pLA230, which originally contains a non-functional                 Ampicillin resistance gene due to one point mutation. If the point mutation is reversed, this leads                 to the cells gaining Ampicillin resistance. When grown on agra plates with Ampicillin, only cells that                 got this point mutation reversed will be able to grow. The number of colonies on the plates, is therefore                 an indirect measure of the mutation activity of MP6.
The results from the UiOslo iGEM team therefore confirmed that the biobrick works as expectated:                 it has a high mutational activity if induced by arabinose, and a lower mutatinal activity if repressed                 by glucose. Their results also confirmed that our biobrick can be used in E. coli Top10, which is a                 different strain than we used. The numbers of colonies in the UiOslo teams experiments were of a higher                 range than in our experiment, making it more difficult to count. This might be due to small procedural                 differences, or it may indicate that the protocol for the test needs to be adjusted when using a different                 strain than E. coli DH5α.
Thank you!
We want to thank team UiOslo for the collaboration and a wonderful time at the ""Mini Jamboree"".                 We are looking forward to meet again at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

1.Overview
Recent researches show that 4S pathway（a four-step enzymatic pathway that converts DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) and sulfate） has a great significance in biological desulfurization. Mechanisms related to the 4S pathway have been broadly studied. In our project, we tried to study the pathway with mathematical theories and modeling. Based on the model of E.coli lac operon system in which lactose is used as an inducer, we derived the optimal proportions of Dsz-enzymes and the most accurate induced concentration of IPTG. Also, we calculated the best proportion between water and oil in the reactors, which effectively optimizes the system.
We analyzed the major parts of this pathway respectively, such as using Michaelis-Menten equation and substrate inhibition equation to analyze catalytic process of enzymes, as well as using differential equations(ODE) to analyze the concentration variations of different components in the system during the catalysis. We also established relevant models to fit images, building up a three-dimensional sense of understanding.
2. Enzymes’ proportional model in 4S Pathway
The procedure of 4S Pathway:
2.1 Theory Part
As the picture above illustrates, there are totally 4 enzymes participating in the 4S pathway. Through the pathway the C-S bonds in the DBTs are cleaved. After 4 steps of oxidation, the sulfur elements are converted into sulfate or sulfite, thereby dissolving in water and being removed. Meanwhile DBT is oxidized to HBP and remains in the oil phase, without degrading the hydrocarbons, which means the calorific value won’t be reduced. This is the process of 4s pathway biodesulfurization.
However, the lacking in durability of catalytic activity in the 4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot"

Salvation Army Boys & Girls Club
For one of our outreach activities, the members of the iGEM team visited the Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club. Here we had the pleasure of meeting with many bright and curious boys and girls. The day began with meeting all these potential scientists and introducing our team and the agenda for our meetup.
Our basic idea was to spark interest and enthusiasm, helping them learn the importance of science in our daily life and why it is important to the community. The meetup began with the team explaining our 2017 iGEM project in a very simple and elementary format for the kids to relate. After the explanation the team gave an elaborate breakdown of how our project can be explained and be understood in a more hands-on manner using Legos. The Legos were used for the sole purpose of explaining how various BioBricks are integrated into our project.
The activity was wrapped up with a quick Q&A session between the students and our team. We asked the kids about whether the activity helped them understand synthetic biology and if they would be interested in science as a career. We closed on a positive note, reinforcing their love of science by handing out fruit snacks and thanking them for their time and patience.
NGM/W
Over the summer members of our iGEM team had an opportunity to meet with a few students from Next Generation Men and Women. NGM/W is a nonprofit Organization established to provide underrepresented students with professional exposure, leadership development, community service and personal support. Through our partnership with the group, we take on the responsibility of exposing the students to a day as a synthetic biologist. On our day, the students got to run through a typical lab day. We started off the day by autoclaving trash and loading the dishwasher with dishes. Then, we went to check on our tobacco plants; this involved testing the water level, adding food, and turning on the sun lamps in the lab. Once, the plants were taken care of; the students got to run PCR samples on a gel. While the gel ran the students got to see how to purify GFP from E.coli using hydrophobic interaction chromatography, so the students got to see GFP fluorescence. They thought this was cool, so we scored some points there! This process lasted long enough for the gel to run, and the students then got to image the gel and take a picture. This was the last bit of lab work, so we cleaned up and went to lunch. The day ended with"

Collaborations
1. USTC
USTC and BIT focus on measurement this year and we face the same difficulty so that we set up the collaboration for dealing with the problem. We are really glad that we can have collaborations in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling.
Process
Both of teams took part in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July and both of us are interested in each other’s projects. In the middle of August, USTC attended the Conference of China iGEMer Committee in PKU (Beijing, China) and we had a chance to communicate the details of our collaborations face to face. In this meeting, we determine that we can cooperate in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling. After that, we assist each other by internet and make some progresses. Ultimately, USTC help BIT to build a more perfect modeling and BIT assist USTC accomplish the experiment of bacteria freeze-drying. Because both of us had demand for hardware, we all put forward some comments and advice for each other to make a better hardware.
Details
The Experiment of Bacteria Freeze-drying
Purpose
We all hope the ideal product could apply to reality. The method of bacterial powder help the idea come true result from following features:
1) Portative: it will be easier for hardware, like detecting device which is made by BIT or CACCI which is made by USTC, to carry bacteria.
2) Easy-to-store: the condition for storing bacterial powder is simple to achieve, that makes it convenient for users to use the product.
3) Recoverable: the bacteria will recover within normal water solution so that it will not bring extra burden to the users.
Protocol
1) Strain
Reserve it at -20℃.
2) Preparation of culture medium
Prepare: tryptone 5g, yeast extract 5g, NaCl 30g, glycerol 3g, Na2HPO4·12H2O 12.5g, KH2PO4 1g, and add distilled water 1L ;then split the liquid in different test tubes,"

Our construct before insertion of the dRBS
The dRBS will be inserted between Sac1 and Pst1
pFTV carrying a variant GFP. The dRBS will be inserted between sites Sac1 and Pst1.
Insertion of the dRBS
The spacer which had held a place for the dRBS is cut out by the enzymes Sac1 and Pst1
dRBS is flanked by restriction sites Sac1 and Pst1 and is manufactured by annealing two compliementary oligos that contain the dRBS.
The Ribosome Binding Site
The degenerate ribosome binding site (dRBS) is a sequence that contains a ribosome binding site library. Using software developed by the Salis Lab, we calculated the range of translation initiation (TIR) that would be expected for this sequence, from 0.5-157,000 au.
Check out the cool software that allowed us to accomplish this.
The dRBS sequence is the location where the ribosome binds, and a higher TIR will allow more ribosomes to bind to the mRNA. It was essential to measure the performance of our synthetic GFPs over a wide range of TIR in order to see if expression plateaued at high TIR, indicating that translation elongation was the rate limiting step, or whether it climbed along with TIR, indicating that elongation had been made sufficiently more efficient as to avoid any plateau.
The sequence carries five degenerate letters. Four of these specify one of two possible bases, while the other specifies one of three. Because of this, there are 2*2*2*2*3 = 48 possible sequences in our dRBS.
Graph showing the sequences in our library and their calculated TIR
Each number on the x axis corresponds to one of the sequences out of the total 48. TIR is graphed on the y axis.

The meeting began with the introduction of iGEM competition, then followed respectively by the presentation of NAU’s iGEM project “Spring Healer” and our project “Bio-compass 2.0”. It ended with a lecture given by Doctor Wang, who is the tutor of SYSU iGEM team. Firstly, he elaborated the required qualities to be a scientist and then he made a full presentation about SYSU’s iGEM project of this year. This lively meeting went smoothly in that night, through which many students in our university are getting to know more about iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
Science day
On the 18th of September, we presented a stall at our university as part of our scientific promotion event. This was a great chance to reach out and engage with the public and communicate science to the public.
we had created posters about synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and our topic. On that day, we got into conversation with many people and informed them about problems with our project. We also explained what synthetic biology is and where you can find products from genetically engineered organisms in everyday life. To evoke enthusiasm for science in college students, we offered them several small experiments of making organic batteries of different fruits. In the meantime, we sold some milk tea to raise funds. The feedback is that they like our experiments as well as our milk tea, which was overwhelmingly positive! Click here!
Social Media
We realized that the way to reach the most people would be by social media. So this year, in order to have the maximum possible public outreach on the topic of Bio-compass, we decided to use different media  to promote our project and raise public awareness of synthetic biology. We have done a lot of work on them, which includes Sina Weibo, WeChat and Facebook. We post our progress of the project on our fan page periodically and introduce the knowledge of synthetic biology on these Internet platforms.
Our efforts proved fruitful, as we have reached 1,028 in Sina Weibo, and many teams from home abroad have also paid attention to our project.
Flashing video
We made a quick flashing video with JSNU team, which shows our energy and passion. In this way of collaboration, we are like a big family working together to let more people knowing iGEM competition. If you want to watch it, Click here!

WPI-Worcester,2015,Team:WPI-Worcester#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," plate, staining the wells with crystal violet after the incubation period, and solubilizing the crystal violet in acetic acid to quantify biofilm formation colorimetrically. We were interested in what effect the localization of the AFP had on its efficacy, and so each AFP was created in two forms, one native and one with an N-terminal BclA tag, which anchored it to the cell surface. Due to time constraints and difficulties with the cloning process not all AFPs were created in both forms; some exist only in the tagged or native form.
Improved Characterization of ZeAFP
ZeAFP is an antifreeze protein from Zoarces elongatus. We tested BBa_K652004 , created by the Yale 2011 iGEM team, using the promoter J23119 in our freeze survival and biofilm assays. We also created the theoretical coding part BBa_K1809021 for the region of BBa_K652004 which codes for ZeAFP and generated the part BBa_K1809022 using the promoter J23119 and ZeAFP. Our assay data can be found below.

Improved Characterization of BclA
We created eleven AFP parts N-terminally tagged with BclA to localize them to the cell surface. BclA was taken from BBa_K1423005 , created by the WPI 2014 team, and in our assays YFP was replaced with the respective AFPs. The BclA tagged parts were tested in our freeze survival and biofilm inhibition assays. Due to time constraints we were unable to test all BclA tagged parts in both assays. A list of the tagged AFPs, as well as our assay data, can be found below.

Integrated Human Practices
During the conceptualization of our project, we contacted several experienced researches and leading persons in the industry. Provided information was especially helpful for the construction of the selection system. Several important advices were collected by contacting experts on various fields per email. Unfortunately, most of the contacted persons did not respond. For the identification of the optimal mutagenesis system for plasmids in our project, we contacted Manel Camps , who is the leading expert on this topic. To get in contact with additional experts from project associated field, we attended the CeBiTec Symposium about medical bioinformatics.
Different approaches were applied to communicate synthetic biology and our project efficiently to the public. One example is our participation in the post card action initiated by the team from Düsseldorf. We identified critical issues within the process during our participation in an industrial meet-up, the NRW day , the pupils academy and the discussion with an anthropologist. To optimize our presentation skills we started an evolution-based project. Lectures were given in front of high school students and the communication of information was tested afterwards. Through several iterations, we were able to increase the transferred knowledge about synthetic biology and our project significantly.

The basic conjecture underlying HDMR is that the component functions arising in typical real problems are likely to exhibit only low order l cooperativity among the input variables such that the significant terms in the HDMR expansion are expected to satisfy the relation: <math>l<<n</math> for <math>n>>l</math> . An HDMR expansion to second order
<math>f(x)=f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})</math>
often provides a satisfactory description of <math>f(x)</math> for many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. How to determine HDMR component functions? Practical formulations of the HDMR component functions determine whether we can carry out this algorithm. Theoretically, a component function
<math>f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})</math>
is obtained by minimizing the functional,
<math>\min_{f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il}}\int_{\Omega}\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u) [f(u)-f_{0}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(u_{i})-\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(u_{i}, u_{j})-...- \sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il})]^{2}du</math>
under a suitable specified orhogonality condition which guarantees that all the component functions are determined step by step. Here,<math>\hat{x}=(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{n}}</math> , <math>\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},"

Publication Number: US 20150228815 A1
Description: Provides a specific solar cell apparatus with an upper surface with convex shaped discrete microlenses.
The surface is covered with a plurality of convex-shaped microlenses. Our microlens arrays are concave formed.
Publication Number: US 8759665 B2
Description: Provides a specific solar cell apparatus with microlenses and a method of manufacturing this apparatus.
While the concept of increasing the efficiency of the solar cell is the same, the production method is completely different. Furthermore, for our product a microlens array is used, instead of separate microlenses.
There are also many microlens array production methods patented. However, these are all chemical production methods. There is no patent that describes environmentally friendly produced microlens arrays, produced by genetically modified E. coli. This makes the BioLens MLA a novel and non-obvious product that is in our opinion fully patentable.
The patent application
We have developed a unique method to produce microlenses or in particularly microlens arrays. There are several patenting strategies, possible patentable subject matter is further explained below:
The E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein. This protein can be used to make polysilicate out of silicic acid.
The production method for the microlens with E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein.
The production method for the specific microlens arrays with the help of the E. coli strain that is genetically engineered to produce membrane fused silicatein.
The second option has our preference at the moment. Patenting of genetic strains appears to be difficult in practice. For example, modifications of the strain or the use of an insert from different organisms makes it sometimes already possible to get around the patent. Partly, this can be prevented by only patenting a part of the E. coli strain. For example only patent the round cells covered with polysilicate. This will make it more difficult to change it and get around the patent. However, the iGEM registry can also complicate the patenting process. This is an open source database with all the strains. When we patent our microlens, instead of solely the microlens array, we can protect our intellectual property more easily. The reason to patent the microlens instead of the microlens array is because this gives us the possibility to use the patent for the production of different applications in the future.
We will patent our product"

Allow the flasks to cool to room temperature (or cool under running water)
Step 3) Inoculate the flasks by pouring in the 10 ml of the overnight culture from the falcon tube into each to make up to 100ml.
Step 4) Place in the incubator at 37 °C with shaking
Grow to an OD600 of approximately 0.5. The culture turbidity should look roughly like this
After removing from the incubator, chill both flasks in an ice bath for 15 minutes
Transfer from the 2 flasks into prechilled falcon tubes.
When done the 2 flasks should fill 4 falcon tubes completely.
Harvest by 20 minutes at 5000 rpm in the JOUAN centrifuge. A pellet should form in the bottom of the tube.
Pour off the supernatant from each tube, taking care not to dislodge the pellet.
Resuspend the pellet by adding 5 ml ice-cold water to each falcon tube and pipette mixing.
Mix the 4 x 5ml resuspended cultures into a single falcon tube. (This saves repeating all the steps for each tube)
Wash the cells by pelleting and resuspending 3 times:
3 times: Pelleting by 12 minutes centrifugation at 5000 rpm. (Use a counter balancing tube.) Then resuspend the pellet in 45 ml of ice-water
Finally resuspend the cells in ice-cold water to a final concentration of approximately 2 x 10^11 cells/ml. (This is usually just a drop or 2-3ml of liquid)

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

A day with Italian highschool students
On August 27th, we were invited to talk to 100 highschool students from all over Italy that were spending one week at the University of Trento. The students were selected among the best students in Italy. We spent an afternoon with them to introduce them to synthetic biology. Daniele and Caterina from the 2012 and 2013 Trento iGEM teams came with us to tell them more about their iGEM experience. We took the opportunity not only to talk about our project, but also to tell them about our Human Practice. We presented our vision on energy consumption and we talked on how we can all make a difference. Lets hope that after our talk at least a few of them will not leave their phone charger plugged overnight!
Interview with an expert
We interviewed Michele Del Fabro, a civil engineer from Verona that works on the development of solutions for energy resources.
Talking about alternative energy, which are the most exploited in Italy?
The most used alternative sources of energy are solar panels and hydropower. In Italy, however, we are not well placed in the field of alternative sources, especially if we consider the technologies available. The social will is there, but unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge about opportunities of alternative sources such as the wind.
Can alternative energy solutions be reached by small consumers or only by large consumers?
Yes and no. The most sophisticated applications are expensive. There is a middle class of alternative sources. Fundings for alternative energy sources are available, but they are not advantageous. In Italy there are state taxes for producing electricity on your own (i.e. with solar panel). This discourages the consumer to produce energy independently. In other places, such as Denmark, they granted to private citizens big incentives if they produce energy with wind turbines.
From our analysis it seemed that Europe focuses on the redevelopment of buildings, while other countries aim only on new buildings, why? What is your opinion?
In Italy there is the myth of the “eternal home”: houses are never redone but they are rather refurbished. It is ok to preserve some ancient building that stand as a historical memory, but when a house is too old and inefficient there is no reason why it should be kept. In fact, the houses were quickly built after the World War Two, without caring about thermal aspects and leading to a high-energy consumer structure. In other countries money is invested for the realization of new houses, promoting the industrial potential. It may not look like it, but rebuild a house in many cases is cheaper than just keeping an"

Application
Our system for phosphorus removal is designed to be modular in order to work efficiently and effectively in many different environments. In our operons, promoters can be switched and new genes can be added to our E. coli in order to alter the expression levels of our proteins or to solve additional problems related to specific application.  We envision that our E. coli would be especially useful in several applications, such as methane digesters, tile drainage systems, wastewater treatment plants, home bioreactors, and even a floating phosphorus collector unit.
Methane Digesters
[1]
In anaerobic methane digesters, acidogenic bacteria convert organic material in cow manure to volatile fatty acids, which are later broken down into acetic acid and hydrogen gas. Methanogenic bacteria then consume acetic acid and hydrogen gas to produce methane gas and carbon dioxide. [2]
[3]
The methane gas is then collected for use as bioenergy. An effluent containing most of the nutrients in manure passes through the digester and is collected for use in fields. During this process bacteria do not consume phosphorus. While a small amount of phosphorus settles to the bottom of the digester, the rest of the phosphorus is in the effluent. Another major nutrient for crop, nitrogen, is also present in the effluent, although some of the organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium. Some of the ammonium is released as ammonia gas, and the rest of the ammonia will be incorporated into the soil, where microorganisms convert it to nitrite and then nitrate, the form in which most plants uptake nitrogen.[4]
Still, most of the nutrient content from the manure stays in the effluent. This is a problem because when cow manure is used as fertilizer, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient. Excess phosphorus then accumulates on the soil"
UNebraska-Lincoln,2018,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to lure the emerald ash borer.  Many of these attractive compounds are present in a natural tree oil called Manuka oil,  and for this reason this oil was often incorporated into EAB traps (Abell et al., 2015).  These compounds are also known to be found in Phoebe oil in different proportions (Khrimian et. al, 2011).  The six attractive compounds in these oils are α-cubebene, α-copaene, 7-epi-sesquithujene, trans-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene (α-caryophyllene),  and eremophilene. Of these, it is thought that 7-epi-sesquithujene and eremophilene are the most attractive (Crook, 2010).  It was discovered that purchasing either of these oils was very costly, in addition to the number of suppliers being sparse.
7-epi-Sesquithujene:
EAB Traps:
7-epi-Sesquithujene is a bicyclic sesquiterpene isolated from phoebe oil, an essential oil of the Brazilian walnut tree, Phoebe porosa.  It is also produced by stressed ash trees and has been shown to elicit strong electrophysiological responses on emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, antennae (Khrimian et. al, 2011).  Research shows that sesquiterpenes can successfully be synthesized by both E. coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae through the enzyme 7-epi-sesquithujene synthase (TPS4-B73).  This biosynthesis requires the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (Köllner et al, 2004).  This chemical can be produced in E. coli by engineering the mevalonate pathway found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some enzymes from E. coli itself (Martin et. al, 2003). By implementing this pathway and the TPS4-B73 gene, E. coli can independently produce desirable levels of synthesis. After successful synthesis, 7-epi-sesquithujene  can be purified, further analyzed, and used in emerald ash borer traps.
Our Approach:
There are a scarce number of approaches in dealing with emerald ash borer infestations. The current methods deal primarily with chemical treatment of ash trees within the vicinity of"

Since people are still trying to figure out a sustainable solution to the energy issue, temporarily one of the feasible ideas is to use the power of the market where carbon emission is controlled by the invisible hand of the free market. Due to the reason, the energy exchange platform was established. However, to realize the ultimate goal to solve the energy issue as well as prevent the heavy pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuel, Dr. Chen viewed the development of technology as the only way to achieve that. As he added, some of the policies were designed to encourage the industrial companies to conduct self-dependent technological innovation by increasing the cost of using those old polluting manufacture methods. In another words, Enterprises were encouraged to take actions to weed out outdated manufacturing techniques. Meanwhile, supportive policy to assist technological innovations was established as well, including some tax benefits.
Then, delegate from our iGEM team briefly introduced our energy conversion project. Ms. Huang and Dr. Chen were surprised by our newly-designed platform. They greatly praised our desire to contribute to the energy issue as well as the persistence in scientific research. Ms. Yu said, indeed our society as well as the government very much looked forward to the technology breakthroughs like ours to serve the energy issue. Lots of encouragement policies had been set up to encourage project both financially and politically. They suggested us to do a brief background search, and apply to some of the supportive programs to further develop and modify our system. From the authority aspect, they were pretty sure that we would get many privileges and supports in developing the project, when we step further.
Finally, a free discussion was held where our team members further exchanged ideas and thoughts with two guests. Future collaborations are very likely to occur when our technology become more mature and are put into real life use.

Propagation of iGEM - iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI)
Aiming at spreading the iGEM as well as contributing to the local community, ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI) was found in 2016, along with the establishment of the first ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech University. The iDPI at ShanghaiTech is set up to encourage every iGEM team to dedicate themselves not only into scientific researches, but also social practices. Sciences and technologies are used to serve people and the society; therefore the awareness to contribute to the social interests is of equal importance with the research explorations.

C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the DH5a genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ for the four simulations (Figure 11). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.
Figure 11: False-positive probability of crRNAs on different bacterial targets.E. Coli DH5α and B. Subtilis. The probability of false-positive output for crRNA1-3 on E. Coli DH5α and crRNA 4 on B. Subtilis. (off-target genomes) is significantly lower than for the targeted genome, because there are multiple on-target sites.
We conclude that the design of the crRNAs is reliable as only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method, but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs"

OmpA itself is a major protein that can be found in the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. It will signal and facilitate E. coli to secrete enzyme more efficiently, in this case, laccase.
 
Figure 1. Average fold change of enzyme secretion of E. coli using OmpA.
 
Figure 1 shows that the average secretion efficiency of E. coli using OmpA can be increased by 3% during the first hour of incubation, and the fold changes by 2.11 within the first 20 hours [3]. Here, fold change indicates the relative values of the yields or secretion efficiencies of constructs from OmpA Sp divided by native Sp [3].
Since we want to try to put the OmpA sequence before the laccase sequence, We try to collaborate the data obtained from Figure 1 with the available characterization result of the laccase we are using on the iGEM Registry for BBa_K863006 [4].
 
Figure 2. Comparison of activity expectation of BBa_K863005 with (orange) and without (blue) OmpA with ABTS as the substrate.
 
Figure 2 denotes the estimated activity with ABTS as substrate. Here, the measurement of 308 ng ECOL (BBa_K863005) was done in pH 5 at 25° C (Bielefeld, 2012). The 8mM concentration of ABTS was assigned to be substrate saturated. The bars on the right indicates the assessed amount of oxidized ABTS when ECOL is ligated with OmpA.
This figure helps our team to be aware of the overall impact of OmpA to the secretion of the laccase enzyme.

The forward and reverse primers sets that were used are 001 & 002 and 005 & 006 and 007 & 008 respectively. Two times 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol . However, one of the sets of 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures uses HF buffer and Phusion Polymerase, while the other set of 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures uses Q5 buffer and Q5 Polymerase.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," noticed that some models predict negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the governing equations were correct. We believe this was due to the stiffness of the system, for some reactions occur 7 magnitudes faster than others. When using a different technique, say stiffness switching, the simulation takes a very long time while progresses little, reaching maximum iteration step sets as 10^6. Fortunately the negative concentrations predicted were only of magnitude of 10^(-30) micro molar, such that it doesn't effect the result much. To fix the issue completely, however, may take more time by simplifying the governing equations.
Currently luciferase was modelled in luminescence output while β-galactosidase and horseradish peroxidase was modelled in color metric output. To make a proper comparison we wish to model the luminescence of horseradish peroxidase too. Even though the unit of measurement of luminescence and color metric output were in arbitrary units, we wish to obtain good insights in the shape of their response curve to select the one best suited for our needs.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
To add information about mass balance to the reaction scheme of chemiluminescence of horseradish peroxidase we used a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). That is, in addition to differential equations governing the rate of change, because of the chemical equilibrium between species, algebraic equations constraining the relation between them are also included. Mathematica complained about the system being over determined even if no initial condition was given. In fact the form this DAEs has is not solvable by Mathematica.
The workaround for this problem I have found was to reduce everything to the fundamentals. So instead of equilibrium expressed as system of algebraic relations, I broke them into two reactions with rate constants large enough to be fast still obey the proportionality required by the equilibrium constant.
Maya 2012 couldn't open the Ferritin file created in Maya 2014. So I switched to Maya 2014 and now everything works fine.

To help prepare the experiments I spent time studying experimental design and analysis techniques, with focus on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and factorial design.

Additional Work
Microfluidic technology, also known as Lab on a chip , requires only a small amount of sample and reagents and automates the reaction compared to traditional laboratories. In recent years, more and more iGEM teams have chosen to use microfluidic chips to make portable low-cost hardware[3].
However, the size, weight and cost of these instruments are often limited by liquid drive modules. The common liquid driving methods for microfluidic chips are peristaltic pump, air pump and vacuum pump. These pumps need to be connected to large external devices, making the instrument too bulky and unsuitable for promotion. In order to optimize the liquid driving method of the microfluidic chip, at the beginning of the project setting, we proposed two solutions through brainstorming, namely electromagnetic driving based on electromagnet and driving method of integrated peristaltic pump. We have completed the preliminary design and parameter exploration of the chip under the two schemes, hoping to bring some help to the team that might use the microfluidic chip.
Fig.7 Two o optimized liquid drive methods.(a)Electromagnetic drive;(b)Integrated peristaltic pump.
Electromagnetic drive
3.1 Driving principle:
The electromagnet is placed on the top of each chamber on the chip. When the electromagnet is energized, the magnetic film layer under the chamber is electromagnetically attracted upward. The liquid in the chip can be driven by controlling the three-phase peristalsis of the magnetic film layer. [4]
3.2 Structural design:

When building the plasmid kit in E. coli, a model organism, electroporation was a convenient avenue for transforming plasmids into the host. However, electroporation protocols can vary for different bacteria species, and many may have no protocol developed for them at all. Rather than assuming the burden of developing one, researchers frequently rely on conjugation. This is the transfer of a plasmid from one species of bacteria to the other, which commonly happens in nature. We electroporated a GFP-expressing assembly plasmid (BHR 902) from our kit into a strain of E. coli, called a Mu-free donor, that is a DAP auxotroph. This means DAP has to be added to the growth media for the bacteria to survive. We then grew these bacteria along with S. marcescens at different ratios. Samples from the dual cultures were then grown on media without DAP and with antibiotic, selecting for only S. marcescens. The S. marcescens that did grow on the media contained the plasmid, expressing the green fluorescence and the antibiotic resistance gene.
The results of the conjugation are shown in Figure 7. Although the green coloring of S. marcescens with the BHR kit plasmid (top) under UV light (right) is not as strong as some of the controls, the bacteria is clearly expressing the green phenotype, which it does not naturally have. Figure 7 contains bacteria that was streaked onto media without additional nutrients, which was then picked and re-streaked to ensure that no nutrients or colonies without plasmids remained. The first round of selective plating killed off the colonies of MFD E. coli cells because the plates lacked the extra nutrients needed for their growth, so they were not included in the pictures above. Since the untransformed S. marcescens and Top 10 E. coli did not have the antibiotic resistance the plasmids coded for, they died on the media because it contained KAN antibiotic. The control plasmid contained a GFP and KAN resistance as well. However, it appears to have allowed the MFD strain to survive on the selective media"

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Background#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html," disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) with an unique rate and efficiency compared to other BPA degrading organisms. This strain, called Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1, is able to completely decompose 120 mg BPA L-1 in about 6 h while other strains need days of cultivation (e.g. Sphingomonas strain BP-7 isolated by Sakai et al. (2007) ).
The full bisphenol A degradation pathway which is found in nature is shown in Figure 1 (taken from KEGG database). BPA is metabolized to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4'-hydroxyacetophenone and 4-hydroxybenzoate which can be used by some bacteria as a carbon source. These and other metabolites of the BPA degradation pathway can be found in the supernatant of cultivations of S. bisphenolicum AO1 containing BPA. Furthermore, this bacteria can grow on BPA as the only a carbon source ( Sasaki et al., 2005a ).
Figure 1: Bisphenol A degradation pathway as found in nature (picture from KEGG database ).
Bisphenol A is mainly hydroxylated into the products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol by some kind of oxidoreductase dependent on NADH or NADPH. In S. bisphenolicum AO1, a total of three genes were identified that are responsible for this BPA hydroxylation: a cytochrome P450 (CYP, bisdB), a ferredoxin (Fd, bisdA) and a ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (FNR) ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). Common class I electron transport systems for bacterial cytochrome P450 consist of these three enzymes mentioned above, mostly using a ferredoxin with a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster ( Hannemann et al., 2007 ). In addition, class V electron transport systems were found in bacteria, composed of a ferredoxin-cytochrome P450 fusion protein and a NAD(P)H-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. In these systems, the ferredoxin is fused to the N-terminus of the cytochrome P450 via a linker region ( Hannemann et"

Conclusion
We believe that the STIR protocol, or at least an adaptation of it – like in the case of Imperial College 2016 – should be implemented by all iGEM teams. We employed the protocol as an entire team, which has helped us to focus our attention on societal dimensions by a multitude of starting points that represented the backgrounds of our team members. In particular, we believe that iGEM teams should have a designated humanist that can identify opportunities or decisions within the project. Human practices is an essential area of any iGEM research project, as it defines how our project will work in the real world and how it is going to affect and be affected by it. Therefore, we believe human practices should be devolved just as much attention and consideration as any other section of the project. Human practices can be challenging, but if devolved enough consideration, the project will largely benefit from it.

After 3 h of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is also  rife with concerns regarding ethics, safety, and governance.
Synthetic biology also spotlights issues of intellectual property, sharing, and innovation  (Oye & Wellhausen, 2010). Ideally, intellectual property would provide incentives that  effectively promote innovation, align those incentives with social utility, and promote socially  equitable cost burden and distribution of the products of innovation. in the form of patents
The Problem
Patent protection is unlikely to harness the potential of synthetic biology. When  intellectual property was constitutionally established in the United States as a method  for “promoting the progress of the useful arts,” the nature of foreseeable innovation was very  different from today’s innovative landscape. Whereas inventions were almost exclusively  macro-scale mechanical contraptions, the range of contemporary technologies that have been  shoehorned into the patent framework now includes innovations ranging from business strategies  to software to self-replicating biomolecular machines. Software code, for example, which can be  thought of as a machine made of language, is extremely difficult to justify as either copyrightable  or patentable and ends up protected under both systems, an outcome scholars widely regard as  harmful to innovative outcomes (Rai & Boyle, 2007). Biotechnology is another field whose  nature has defied the conceptual limits of legal constructs formulated. It has been noted that  synthetic biology represents a “perfect storm” of characteristics of software and biotechnology  that will render existing intellectual property frameworks harmfully obsolete (Rai and Boyle,  2007). Some have gone as far as to claim that status quo patenting practices may snuff out  synthetic biology altogether (“How to kill synthetic biology,” 2006).
Patent-driven innovative outcomes synthetic biology can expect can be observed in  other contexts. When tested empirically over the past 150 years, stronger patent protection was  actually associated with lower rates of patenting (Lerner, 2002, cited in Torrance, 2010). When  tested using interactive computer simulations, not only is a patent system significantly worse at  promoting innovation than a pure commons in terms of innovation rate, productivity, and social  utility, but a commons coexisting with a patent system is statistically no better than a pure patent  system (Torrance & Tomlinson, 2009). Psychological insights into the process of innovation are  also becoming increasingly messy, indicating that many seemingly irrelevant factors ranging  from the height of the ceiling to environmental stimuli influencing dream incubation have strong  effects on innovative output (e.g. Kraft, 2005; Anthes, "

Its is also important to clearly inform about the possiblilities and more important about the unpossiblities, to avoid any panic. There should also be attention for the possible side effects.

Is the registry realy open source? Everybody can see the data, but is everybody also able to get BioBricks from teh registry? Are companies for instance allowed to apply the registry for BioBricks? Joomla(CSM software) for instance is open source software and everyone can use it? Should it be the same with Biobricks?
Is the registry realy open source? This is a bit unclear to us, we don't know if it is possible for companies to apply the registry for BioBricks. It is also not clear to us if research groups from an university which is not joining the iGEM competition are able to apply fot BioBricks. We will contact the iGEM HQ about this issue. Althought in our opinion it shouldn't be a problem to use Biobricks for commercial purperses, but from this a lot of other question will arise like: Who should get the financial benefits? Who has the intellectuel property right? What if a company or researcher alters a BioBrick and want to patent it? Should BioBricks be patented? This are very interessting question which should be answerd in the next years by the scientific community. In case the HQ profides us answers to the above mentioned questions we will share it with you.

The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.
In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour in the tourist center of"

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Glycogen#Synthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"a_K1585311 (B0034.glgB) was synthesized with a similar design. Due to DNA synthesis limitation, the gene was divided into two gBlocks with overhangs to each other. The pSB1C3 backbone was amplified with a forward primer that binds on the suffix and a reverse primer that binds the RFC10 prefix. Therefore, all parts were cloned with overhangs to the next part and were assembled by CPEC assembly.
The third BioBrick BBa_K1585312 (B0034.glgC) is based on a construct designed by team Edinburgh in 2008 (BBa_K118016). The glgC has a point mutation which increases activity in the absence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and lowers the affinity to the inhibitor AMP. [1] We wanted to combine glgC with B0034 because previously it was only available with a strong but uncharacterized RBS (BBa_J15001). This task should be realized by B0034 Insertion Mutagenesis , a method to combine B0034 with every RFC10 BioBrick. This approach, however, failed and we finally moved glgC into the suffix of BBa_B0034 (B0034 in pSB1A2) using restriction enzymes. Afterwards, we transferred BBa_K1585310 (B0034.glgC) from pSB1A2 to the shipping plasmid pSB1C3 using CPEC.
