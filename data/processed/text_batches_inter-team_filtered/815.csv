In this action we didn’t take the growth of bacteria into account. From the diagrams, we can figure out that as ATc added increase, the concentration of GSDMD will also rise. Results are shown below (Figures 8, 9, 10.):

With this software, one can adjust all the parameters needed in the equations above and                     attain the diagrams which indicates the relations between concentration of GSDMD and time,                     concentration tetR and time and the maximum value of GSDMD and the initial concentration of ATc.                     The                     program will also generate a function describing the relationship between the maximum concentration                     of                     GSDMD and the concentration of ATc. With the help of this program, members in wet lab group can                     conveniently decide how much ATc should be added into cultivation environment according to their                     requirements (Figures 11, 12). Be advised that users must multiply the CFU number, bacteria cell volume and diluted ratio to the data obtained from this app to gain a final result.

Significance
The model of ATc induced circuit is very common and well-known to biology researchers. The                     common-known significance to this model is that it can demonstrate the relationship between                     concentration of target gene and concentration of inducer added, which can instruct the researchers                     modulate their circuit precisely. In our project, this model will tell the members in wet lab group                     that how much GSDMD will be expressed under a certain concentration of ATc in the Salmonella community formed in the tumor cell.                     Another significance for this model is that, the response time is very short and the response                     speed is extremely fast. We anticipate that just minutes are needed to induce the fluorescence.                     This phenomenon is also verified in our experiment. In less than 10 minutes, fluorescence can be                     detected under fluorescence microscope.                     Especially, a remarkable significance to our project is that it’s a self-destructive system, which                     means, without any further operation, the process of induction can be self-terminated.

OTHER collaborations(not all): bifurcation analysis of the toggle switch
In the simulation of the design-a (see figure above), their modeler Junhui Peng told us that he was confused by a phenomenon: if the promoter P-lasbox strength excess a critical value, no matter how much AHL molecules are produced by lasI (in silicon), the toggle switch just stay in one state and can’t leap to the other.
We conducted a survey to this phenomenon , trying to figure out the mechanism of it.
But the network of the their origial design is a little bit complex to analyze , so we first tried a much simplied model of the toggle switch. We believe that a good work start from the simple thing.
With the help of Professor Haiyan Liu, our team’s mathematical student Hui Li developed an algorithm to analyse the effects of parameters to the phasespace of the toggle swtich. Later, Hui Li speeded up her algorithm.
We first worked out the nullclines of the toggle switch system, with a symmetric toggle switch equation, we get a figure as below.
There are three cross sections ,or three steady state, two of them are stable steady state and one of them unstable, as indicated by the vector fields.
From the vector field we can interpret an important mechanism, after the inducer is added to the system for long enough time, even the induder is removed from the system, the system still stay in the induced state and wouldn’t come back to the orginal one . See the figure above, The state space of this system is divided into two regions, each with an “attracting center”, once the system enters an arbitray state in one region, it will defininitely be “attracted” to the stable steady state of that region.
The task of the inducer is to change the state point of the system, moving it from the orginal region to the oppisite region.
Then we devise a way to move the two nullclines by variating the parameters, trying to separate the two nullclines with less cross sections.
Below is a figure of critical parameter values, the bifurcation point.At this critical point, there are only two cross-sections , ie two equlibrium state.
If we variate the parameter more, as illustrated as below, there is exactly one equlibrium state, indicating that no matter what the initial condition is, the system will be draged to it’s mono-steady state of one side on and the other side of the toggle switch down.

Commercialization
At this time, the increase in cases of MRSA and CA-MRSA infections places a high demand on a novel product for treatment without relying solely on developing new antibiotics. Interest in research for novel antibiotics has only recently increased, but the treatment of MRSA and CA-MRSA infections still relies on the use of antibiotics (Liu et al 2011). Our hope is that if our product were to be commercialized and approved for sale, it would be sufficient to treat MRSA and CA-MRSA infections when used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics. So far our system have demonstrated promising results in lab settings; but in order for this system to be developed into a treatment option, there are many questions that need to be answered. Over the course of our project, our HP team focused on addressing the following two questions.
Our first question is how do we turn our bacterial system into the scaled up commercial product, Staphylocide? What special considerations need to be addressed wth regards to the development of this product?
With these questions in mind, we spoke to Dr. Marianna Foldvari from School of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo regarding the product design of Staphylocide. Dr. Marianna Foldvari provided key input that guided us in our research approach, and in our considerations for topical medication ingredients. Our consultation with her allowed us to develop our product design to a greater depth.  Furthermore, we used the exposure to address components of drug development. For example by adopting Dr. Foldvari’s considerations regarding the shelf-life of a drug, we are better informed in our process of determining the ingredients of our ideal topical medication. Although the expertise needed to integrate our lab design’s machinery with compatible drug components was limited, Dr. Foldvari’s contributions have been significant and valuable to our product.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," drug. These examples and further promising ideas were implemented on previous iGEM-competitions. [2] [3] [4]
The idea of combining the outcome of several iGEM competitions to construct complex synthetic biological systems falls at the last hurdle - the fact, that each team uses a different principle how to access and functionally connect the respectively used biobricks. For example, it is a major challenge to create a system that uses several sensoring BioBricks from different iGEM-teams which in turn regulates reportering BioBricks from various teams. In order to combine and fully take advantage of these promising projects, our vision is to develop an adapter that allows interconnecting arbitrary biobricks on a functional level. Such a system easily allows to setup sensor-reporter circuits and interconnect them to complete biological chips... A further step towards artificial cells.
Read more
Generally speaking, the above adapter has to meet the following requirements:
Universality
The adapter has to be compatible to as many BioBricks as possible. This objective will guarantee that a large number of BioBricks can be connected.
Scalability
Once the basic design of the system is established, the construction of the system is supposed to be automated in silico. This way it will be possible to create an adapter connecting a large amount of BioBricks.
Biological orthogonality
Interference with cellular components has to be as low as possible in order to avoid unwanted and perturbing side effects.
Logic
The adapter is supposed to not only associate different BioBricks, but to functionally connect BioBricks in a precisely determined manner (including operations such as AND/OR/NOT).
Several biological logic units, devices and circuits have been developed so far [5] , but to our knowledge, none was shown to meet all requirements listed above.
Close
Implementation
To functionally connect BioBricks, there are several possibilities including genetic switches, riboswitches and direct protein-protein interactions. We investigated several hypothetically principles, and decided to focus our practical work on the development of a RNA-RNA interaction-based switch. These switches are capable of changing between two states, a state of antitermination and termination, and make use of highly-specific RNA-RNA interaction. In principle such a switch can fulfill all requirements mentioned previously. The following text clarifies how these switches work in detail.
How to connect BioBricks
Our adapter is a system, that activates or disables BioBricks (output BioBricks) in response to the presence of other Biobricks (input Biobricks). Our approach uses"

General part design using RFC[10] & RFC[25]
All of our BioBricks were assembled according to the RFC[10] or RFC[25] standard. For all basic parts the RFC[10] standard was used. Because the RFC[10] scar codes for a stop codon this assembly standard does not allow the generation of fusion proteins. Therefore all fusion proteins were assembled by RFC[25] standard. Thus all RFC[10] and RFC[25] digestion sites were eliminated from the BioBricks either directly when planing the genesynthesis or by quick-change PCR. Only one of the BioBricks which we supply for the community could not be freed from all digestion sites, because one part of the BioBrick

Project Outline
Our ultimate goal is to build a ‘smart’ glyoxylate shunt that burns extra fatty acid when there is energy surplus. To achieve this, we would have to first build the shunt itself in mammalian cells. The shunt comprises two bacterial glyoxylate enzymes, isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB). Tagged with a localization signal peptide, they could be directed to the mitochondria and act on the citric acid cycle, eventually increasing fatty acid uptake. The two enzymes would be initially driven by constitutive promoters (CMV and EF-1alpha promoters), placing the shunt in a constantly “ON” state and burning calories regardless of the energy profile. To improve this, we are developing fatty acid responsive promoters, which, when used to regulate the glyoxylate enzymes, should dispense energy only when it is in excess.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

Goal:
InterLab - transformation of plasmids into competent cells
Verification of succsesful insertion of anti-luxS in pgRNA(2)
Procedure:
InterLab – Transformation of plasmids to competent cells
There has been a mistake of numbering the plates with plasmids provided by iGEM HQ. Therefore, we did not get any cell colonies from the previous two transformations…
The plasmids (1.5 μL) from the right wells were transformed to competent cells by following the transformation protocol from day – 02. July. 2018, after resuspension of the plasmids in the wells.
Cell density:
The cell cultures with pgRNA(2) (probably with anti-luxS), inoculated from day 10 – 04. July. 2018, were diluted 10 times by following the same dilution procedure from day 6 – 27. June. 2018. The cells were incubated with shaker for 1h before measuring at OD 600.
Plasmid isolation:
The plasmids from the two cell cultures were isolated after the same mini-prep protocol from day 3 – 22. June. 2018. The concentration and the purity of the isolated plasmids were measured by Nanodrop.
Restriction digest and gel elecrophoresis:
Insertion of anti-luxS gene was verified after the protocol of restriction digest and gel electrophoresis (see the protocols from day 3 – 22. June. 2018). The restriction enzyme PstI was chosen, and the expected length of the plasmid fragments are 490 bp and 2094 bp.
Note! PstI has a cut site at the anti-luxS gene in the plasmid.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#BiobrickConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html," to take the psb1C3 plasmid, add a constitutively expressed LacI gene, and a lac promoter and rbs immediately before the cut sites. This way, a toxic protein can be well controlled. In fact, while we are designing this for toxic proteins, it could have uses in general protein production. Previous attempts for using the lac promoter on a high copy plasmid have failed leaky expression) due to the lack of the LacI protein produced in the genome. This new plasmid design remedies this, and will be accomplished by Gibson assembly.

Analyzed the data, and found out that the growth rate and the amino acid (Tyr) concentration has a correlation as follows:
Figure 4. cell growth-rate at different Tyr concentrations
Figure 5. Log scale of cell growth-rate at different Tyr concentrations
It was found that the cells depleted the nutrient quickly at low Tyr concentration, and for future experiments it is suggested to use lower initial cell concentrations to extend the time of its exponential growth phase. Also, the wild type has almost the exact growth rate as the autotroph when the the Try concentration is exceptionally high (0.01 M).

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html,"-living organisms by ""[the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing [of an] autopoietic unity is inseparable, and this constitutes their specific type of organization"" (Maturana, Varela 1987). Consequently, the products of synthetic biology would not been self-caused, but organized externally by humans. Consequently, following this train of thought, scientists will never succeed in producing an autopoietic system synthetically. The human as manufacturer of the genome states himself as the creator of the organism. The postulated unit of producer and product can never be succeeded. The organism remains heteronomous by the determination of the genome by man.
This logical problem with the autopoiesis-theory in synthetic biology leads to restricted and modified applicability of the theory. Thus, the following discussion will concentrate on the definition of life first illustrated and includes the autopoiesis theory in restricted form, as this will gain importance in synthetic biology for future developments.
After consideration of the machine concept and definitions of life it is evident that the organisms named ""living machine"" are by no means machines but living organisms. Today synthetically engineered organisms satisfy the minimum requirements of reproduction, metabolism and evolution. The term ""machine"" emphasizes the intended machine-like function. The organisms are alive but perform a machine-related purpose.
The claim of the synthetic biology is to create living organisms, which act simultaneously as a machine. The synthetic biology changes the definitions of living organisms and aims to abolish the separation between life and machine. It follows that the discussion with this term is not regarding the definition, but rather an ontological problem.
The term suggests a utilization of life with the pure focus on the control and goals of the humans.
On the one hand the term ""living machine"" generates an ethical problem, for the reason that it reduces living organisms to their purpose and implies a total control of created existence. Man breeds and keeps animals for the purpose of procuring food, which includes utilization and control of these creatures. There is an analogy to the organisms of the synthetic biology, however in synthetic biology humans appear as self-creators. Synthetic biology aims the creation of new organisms, in which the structures and properties are artificially defined by man whereas breeding and keeping animals is still subordinated through evolution.
On the other hand, ""living machine"" belies the fact that, due to a lack of understanding any intervention in the genome can indeed provide the desired functionality, but might also have not foreseeable effects. A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is"

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," water correctly.
Waste product detection in water is based on the activities of the company. For pharmaceutical companies, the raw materials to produce the drugs are tested, not the drug itself as this is carefully filtered out of the water. Pharmaceutical water pollution is mostly caused by hospital waste water, which commonly contain: solvents, Iodide, Bromide, volatile aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals.
Currently, most assays are based on mass spectrometry, specified on the contaminant. These techniques show results within 24 hours.
It would be a great advantage that some biosensors are able to detect various compounds in wastewater. This way, the efficiency of the water purification and the concentration of contaminants can be measured at the source.
Applied
Shift the focus of measuring the presence of drugs to the presence of drugs residues.
Integrate the matter of difficulties of water sampling into the end product.
It will be an advantage if our end product can measure multiple compounds or groups of compounds at the same time.

21/08/2018 About Gert-Jan Euverink
Prof. dr. Gert-Jan Euverink is Professor of the Faculty of Science and Engineering from the University of Groningen, where he was a supervisor of the winning iGEM team Groningen several years ago. Furthermore, he is deputy scientific director of Wetsus, Centre for sustainable Water Technology in Leeuwarden.
Insights
On existing biosensors:
A biosensor used currently at Wetsus is the lux system. This system utilizes an E.coli-based luciferase assay, which will emit light when a carcinogen is present.
Other biosensors are fish and daphnia, which rely on the behaviour of these organisms, resulting in a lot of false positives.
On our project:
Difficulties: docking molecules in an active site is rather difficult, multiple techniques can be used to tackle the problems
Random mutagenesis
These techniques require a lot of time or luck.
Dictyostelium bacteria have a stronger chemotaxis-mediated swarming effect than E. coli.
On the safety of our product:
When using this kind of biosensor, materials can be easily disinfected. Cleaning-up the water after the measurements might be harder, because you have to be certain all bacteria are eliminated.
Applied
Acquiring info about Dictyostelium bacteria to make sure the organism with the highest potential is used in our system.
Focussing on effective ways of sterilization and cleaning of the water used by the biosensor.

Hardware: Firing The Gene Gun
We wanted to check the validity of the gun’s design by testing if it could generate pressure pulses which would penetrate a plant cell wall. This was done using onion epidermal tissue, as the tissue layers are only one cell thick so would be the easiest to observe any penetration on microscope imaging.
For bombardment, we prepared the macrocarriers as described in the gun assembly protocol, steps 14-15 . We then used simple agar TAP plates we had spare in the lab (approximately 1cm thick), and cut 2x1cm strips of brown onion epidermis to place on the plates.
Figure 1: We initially coloured the plates purple as we thought this would make imaging the onion epidermis easier to observe, but it was not necessary
Figure 2
Figure 3
We then pipetted 150mg of M10 tungsten microparticles, prepared according to our wetlab biolistics protocol, onto each macrocarrier. A fresh 16g CO2 cartridge lasted for around 20 bombardments, ranging from 130-155 psi (though the efficiency of this improved significantly once we became more experienced at pressurising the gun and wasted less CO2).
On inspecting the bombarded onion samples under the microscope, we found evidence of holes in the onion tissue. This suggests these pressures could be suitable for biolistics on plant cells, as the tungsten microparticles were capable of penetrating plant cell walls so should penetrate cells for biolistic transformation.
Our next step in developing the gene gun would be experiment with lower pressures, to find the most efficient pressure pulse for penetration of cells. In the future, we also aim to prove the gun’s use in carrying out chloroplast transformations, by attempting  transformation of chlamydomonas samples.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," throughput we will use a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader for our growth kinetics and indigoidine production measurement.  In a first test run we measure the OD at the wavelengths 400 nm, 530 nm, 590 nm and 800 nm every 5 minutes. The liquid cultures in this case are:
TOP10 negative control
TOP10 + pRB22
TOP10 + pRB3
MG1655 + pRB3
By this we get an impression how we can detect and quantify both the total indigoidine production per well and the indigoidine production in relation to the cell density. The measurement properties can be seen in the following figure.

Quantitative Assay
Measurement
This week we go for a first big measurement with our engineered indigoidine synthetases. The following figure is a scheme of our 96 well plate for the first measurement. We used one plate to grow positive (i.e. indigoidine producing) E. coli TOP10 transformants from an agar plate in liquid culture for 30 hours at 37 °C. We prepared a second 96 well plate with 180 ul media and the respective antibiotics an inoculated with 20 ul of the liquid culture from the first plate.
The second plate was observed in our Tecan plate reader. This time we measured the absorbance from 400 nm to 800 nm in 2 nm steps and 25 reads for every well. This configuration unfortunately leads to the problem that the reader takes a long time for each measurement and we get huge time intervals between each measurement. Therefore we stopped the measurement after aboout 12 hours and changed the configuration. For the next 15 hours we used an interval of 10 nm and used 25 reads per well, so we are able to get a higher resolution on the time scale.
The following table shows the loading scheme of our 96 well plate in this run.

     In an effort to fight pollution through the process of bioremediation, our team proposes to develop bacteria that will be highly effective in degrading Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) with a long term goal of being able to help clean Lake Hartwell, a major recreational area for people of all ages in the upstate of South Carolina. To accomplish this, we have adapted and expanded the model constructed by the 2011 UT Tokyo team. The focus of their project was to engineer a division of bacteria that would increase the efficiency of bioremediation in any given environment. Their two-component system is comprised of a cell assembling and a cell arrest system. Within the parameters of the cell assembling system, their employed mechanism was to use chemoattraction to increase the density of bacteria at a desired location. To accomplish this, aspartate was used as a natural chemoattractant, and its production was induced by the presence of the substrate. The cell arrest system, a secondary extension of system one, is used to maintain a high density of bacteria once they have reached the desired location since it is likely that the concentration of bacteria will dissipate as the substrate is degraded. This system operates by “arresting” or prohibiting the rotation of the flagellum by regulation of the cheZ gene and thereby decreasing cell motility. Following a few key modifications, such as a change in promoters, this system will be adjusted to work perfectly for our project.
 
     As part of the goal of this project to degrade PCB’s, we have found need for a biosurfactant. Such a compound would serve to emulsify the hydrophobic PCB’s and make them available to the degrading microbes. At first, it was thought that cloning the genes necessary for biosurfactant production into the swarming microbes would be too inefficient and that a natural biosurfactant-producing microbe would need to be part of the system. However further research showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces rhamnolipids, a class of glycolipid often regarded as among the best of bacterial-produced surfactants. It was also determined that the genes necessary for this rhamnolipid production could potentially be isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli. In addition, several strains of"

All in all, the evening was a giant success! We are very happy, that we could reach so many people so efficiently while being able to bring such a cozy and relaxed atmosphere to a science-themed evening.
See us performing in German:
Radio speech
On July the 7th, we had a guest appearance in the university-radio. Two of us represented our project and iGEM. By answering a lot of questions from the radio host, we were able to explain our idea and what we are doing in the lab to create a new therapy against cancer.
With this we wanted to acquaint the listeners about synthetic biology and make clear that it can open new opportunities in therapeutic options. Another aspect was to familiarize our project „OPTOPTOSIS“.
Bayerischer Rundfunk
The German television station “Bayerischer Rundfunk” asked us to present our project for television. Obviously, we happily agreed and arranged a meeting.
Four students from our team presented some essential methods used at the laboratory and answered detailed questions about us and our project. For us, it was a bit unfamiliar but nevertheless really interesting to act in front of a camera.
We had a lot of fun with the television crew and are excited to see ourselves at the television show “alpha-campus Magazin” at the end of October.
School lectures
To bring our project closer to the coming generations of young scientists, we held lectures at schools.We presented our project in the “Stiftisches Humanistisches Gymnasium Mönchengladbach” and in the “Math.Nat”, which is a grammar school specialized in science.
We tried to explain our project to students who are not extensively informed about synthetic biology. Our goal was to fight prejudices about genetically engineered organisms. We held a discussion about the benefits as well as possible risks of our project.
The students were very interested in future developments. A few were even looking forward to participating in their own iGEM project when going to university and asked if they might be mentored by us.
Participation in a Science-Slam
As the first iGEM-Team of Düsseldorf, we participated in the „Heine Slam“, which is held yearly at the Heinrich-Heine-University. Every year, students from all faculties of the university compete with each other.
As soon as we heard about it, we knew it would be a great chance to promote our project even across the borders of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, so we signed up and were very enthusiastic about it.
Soon, we came together at a sunny summer day to"

③ The reduction of riboflavin is related to the reducing state of OM c-Cyts heme center which is also the terminal of EET pathway. Due to the electrons brought by NADH or NADPH from respiration, we argue that the process of riboflavin reduction into Sq is coupled with NADH from respiration process.
Based on the assumptions above, we believe the respiration of OM riboflavin has something to do with its concentration and NADH production rate. According to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction, we use multi-substrates Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the whole process:

As can be seen from the simulation results, when the initial inoculation amount Shewanella is 0.1 g/L, it's growth time in anaerobic  MFC is approximately 10 hours. The output voltage of the battery is gradually stabilizing after 20 hours, and the voltage drops after 70 hours due to the mass death of Shewanella.Although specific values are different, the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results in the trends of voltage.

We also hope to perform a complete economic and environmental analysis of our project to see how feasible it would be in real life and to assess the impact it could have.
Lastly, we need to ensure that our parts do not have common restriction sites within them so they can be used properly in the standard BioBrick format. We hope to create and characterize a part family and to end up with a series of BioBrick standard parts to submit to the Parts Registry.
What We Have Done So Far:
We have outlined a plan for the engineering of the PET degradation circuit and we ordered a synthesized sequence for cutinase. We asked for separate strains of E. coli from Yale and Barcelona.
We learned basic lab protocols, such as ligation, transformation, and digestion and we have worked on the Wiki.
We have done extensive research on past attempts to degrade PET and other plastics. We even visited our local landfill to talk about current issues with waste degradation, such as control over concentrations of methane.
Two of our members (Nick and Mattan) attended the Biomedical Engineering Entrepreneurship Academy to be better informed about the economic implications of our project, and what companies might be looking for in terms of a completed product.
Lastly, we’ve had team bonding, over sushi buffets, ice cream sandwiches and laughs.

Software tools for iGEMers : BioBrick/Project Search & Tutorials
We developed new search and educational tools to assist iGEM teams. For many teams, the majority of team members are new-comers. Our primary goal therefore is to aid these beginners get used to iGEM earlier to make project initiation swift.  All of our tools are web-based and have user-friendly interfaces enabling users to gain quick access to needed information.  Our project consists of the following four tools.
“BioBrick Search” improves convenience in searching BioBrick parts by a sophisticated interface and an ordering algorithm taking into acount the parts' frequency of use. With “Past Project Search” , you can run a keyword search for all past projects and access past teams' presentation material easily. “BioBrick Puzzle” and “Gene Network Game” are educational games intended for beginners to acquire knowledge about BioBricks and gene networks, which aides them to plan their projects and conduct experiments.

Modular Regulatory Toolkit using Protein Sequestration
Introduction
Bistable switches for gene expression, or ""toggle switches"" are ubiquitous in the design of synthetic expression pathways (8,9,14,18). Current designs for bistable switches frequently exhibit errors in their functioning due to promoter leakiness or basal regulatory noise (8,9). The purpose of this project is to develop a series of regulatory transistors based on protein sequestration that are highly robust, eliminate basal production noise and can be used to produce a tunable toolkit for modular gene expression. These designed circuits would be composed of both leucine zippers Fos and Jun, and synthetic dominant negatives thereof.
Problems caused by the use of present toggle switches include a lack of tunability in regards to the rate of expression of either state, and a lack of consistence in gene expression due to noise (5,8,9). The proposed design would produce a transistor circuit that would be tunable (1) , highly robust (1,12,13), and capable of multistable or oscillatory functionality (7,8) as well as ultrasensitivity(1,2). The model circuit would consist of synthetic variants of basic leucine zippers c-fos and c-jun, and the dominant negative of these constructs, modified from A-fos (12), which would function to regulate gene expression according to a titration model, thereby eliminating the problems caused by cellular noise and basal regulator production. As a part of this project we would further attempt to characterize a broader variety of synthetic leucine zippers in order to generate a modular toolkit for the construction of similar transistor and amplifier devices.
Leucine Zippers
Basic Leucine Zippers (bZIPs) c-Fos and c-Jun are very well characterized, as their function in eukaryotes as growth regulators and protooncogenes is the subject of much discussion (4,11,12,13,15). Their functioning as"

Human Practices
Human practises encompasses the social ethical and legal considerations of our work. We imagined how our particular project might impact on peoples lives as well as thinking about the wider issues of the way we practise our science and share our findings. To help publicise our conclusions we produced a short video summarising the arguments for openness in research.
Futures
Bioluminescent drinks of the future?
We spent a day early in the project imagining how engineered artificial bioluminescence might be used in the future. This workshop, led by Daisy Ginsberg from the Royal College of Arts, made us think about where research into bioluminescence might one day bring us. How would omnipresent bioluminescence affect the way we perceive light in our living environment? Will engineered bioluminescence find its way into consumer products or remain in highly specialised applications and novelty items? Bioluminescent light has a broad spectrum and is emitted volumetrically. How can we use these different qualities of light compared to conventional sources for art, design and architecture?
We split the team into three groups, each of which went on to explore their own ideas about the future of bioluminescence:
The first group considered the impact of bacterial lighting at home. If ‘E.colights’ became available for household use how would they be received? What issues would have to be addressed for this to happen? We also considered the markets for other domestic products that might arise as a result and made a mock advert for ‘"

iGEM High School 2012
As part of our Human Approach, we took on the task to promote the iGEM High School competition on our university’s high school campuses. Back in February, we sent e-mails to the Science Division directors informing them about iGEM and offering to help them should they want to participate. Although three of the five schools expressed interest, only Silvia Bernat Sarret, science director from Eugenio Garza Sada High School Campus (PEGS), decided to go ahead with the project. The others were concerned about the lack of time and some thought that their student’s level was not up to the task.
Chemistry teacher Nelly Margarita Martínez (who also teaches an Introduction to Biotechnology class) was selected as the head instructor. The project was offered through announcements in all relevant classes. We had the fortune that PEGS has an advanced biology program (aimed as a sort of pre-med high school) and that some of those students became involved, forming the core of the group. Ironically, no one from the Introduction to Biotechnology class chose to join.
After the round of announcements, the first meeting with the students was held on a Friday, March 16th. Fourteen showed up, nearly half of them from 6th semester. With the project description deadline looming near, the first order of business was to give them an introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology in order for them to brainstorm ideas for their goal. Some came up with anti-freeze proteins, others with microbial electrogeneration; there was enthusiasm about those ideas, but time and difficulty had to be taken into consideration. We proposed to them that a simple enzymatic process could be doable with both temporal and technical constraints. After some candidates were discussed, the final selection was the dye Tyrian purple.
The team went on to research the enzymatic pathway of the production of Tyrian purple in the mollusk from where it is extracted, the importance of the dye and the availability of an organic synthesis process. Through the next couple of weeks we helped them sort out the information they were getting and to structure a plan. The result can be found in their website (https://2012hs.igem.org/Team:PrepaTec_GarzaSadaMx).
Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get in touch with the researchers to obtain the genetic constructs they"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Lysis and purification of PCquad Y will be done today.
Procedures:
-Lysis protocol:
1.  Obtain the frozen cell pellet, keep on ice.  Cell pellet was 0.095
2. To the frozen cell pellet, add lysis buffer to a ratio of 1:10 grams of cell pellet to mL of lysis buffer.
3. Incubate 5 minutes on ice.
4. Vortex vigorously for 20 seconds, incubate on ice for 5 minutes.  A pipette can be used to carefully re-suspend the pellet if vortexing is insufficient.  At this point, the DNA seemed to precipitate and the solution was very viscous.  2uL of DNase was added and the tube was incubated for 20-25minutes until it was clear.
5. Repeat Step 4 two to four times, until the pellet is sufficiently broken"

IGEM LUND 2017
This team had the wonderful project of creating a biosensor detecting micro plastics in water. This project is based on the creation of an AND-Gate (see the picture ). with phthalates and organic pollutants as input, and a protractor as output. The system is activated in the presence of IPTG.
This project is indeed very interesting because it involves biosensing using logic gates but the number of components it can detect is very small.
Thanks to our PETalk system, we could easily and significantly increase the number of detectable components via a wider variety of receivers connected to a large number of communicating doors. This would expand the field of bio pollutants to clean up.
EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
In France, the general public and even first year bachelors students of biology seem to associate Biology to the observation of flora and fauna. We tried to speak to a large target audience, including people who had been previously introduced to the synthetic biology and those who hadn’t. Our aim was to popularize synthetic biology and its various applications. Click here to see our Education and Public Engagement projects.
INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
During our Human Practices research, we quickly realised two things. First, there is a real and pressing need for new bacterial communication systems for researchers. According to this assessment, we have investigated in detail what kind of communication system would fit the most to current research needs and interests. Second, the general public has limited knowledge about biology, which makes it really hard for them to understand a foundational advance project such as ours. Therefore, we decided to make great efforts in educating people about biology and synthetic biology.
Choosing the communication system
Bacteria communicate through quorum sensing (QS) systems that can be classified into two kinds based on the signalling molecule used: small molecule (AHL) based QS and peptide based QS [5]. When we met Jérôme Bonnet, he explained to us that it would be very useful to characterise a number of different orthogonal communication molecules. Since peptides are easier to engineer than small molecules, we decided to focus on a peptide based QS. After we had engineered the system for our chassis of choice (E. coli), we expected to be able to generate several variants of it through directed evolution.
In addition, our communication system had to be as orthogonal as possible to avoid crosstalk with other variants of this communication system as well as with other natural communication systems inside the cell. Therefore, we found the “Arbitrium"

and
tell the browser that there will be a table, whereas all text between
and
will be in one paragraph. Consequently, a complete webpage is build by just stringing together several tags.
It should be noted that every webpage is to be placed between a  and a  tag. Within this html-tag, there has to be one <head> … </head> that holds some invisible information about the webpage (e.g. the title of the page, the author, fonts and font-sizes, information for search robots such as Google, …). After the head-section, the body-section is declared (<body> … </body>). This is where all visible content of the page is specified (e.g. tables, paragraphs and text, images, flash content, …).
Another important aspect concerning tags are so-called attributes. Attributes represent options that can be applied to certain tags. Attributes are places inside the opening brackets of a tag. For example,

set the width of the border of this table to 1 pixel.
In  order to learn more about HTML or to just look up some tags or attributes, many tutorials exist on the web. A small collection is available in the Wikipedia reference list .

Below this area on the left, the large content area will be positioned. To the right of the content will be a narrow vertical range, where you can add optional extras, such as a countdown to the jamboree, a visitor counter or some art work etc.
B HTML code for this table
Another important aspect is how to apply this table layout to the wiki page. In general, a wiki software allows the user to create different pages and to add content to these pages. To view such a wiki page using a browser, the MediaWiki software has to generates the corresponding HTML page every time a page is requested. For this purpose, the MediaWiki software is supplied with a HTML framework holding the typical wiki interface and places the content of the requested page into a container within the HTML framework. So when a wiki page is edited, the only part that is actually changed lies within the container of this HTML framework. It is important to note, that in the case of the iGEM wiki this HTML framework cannot be modified. In other words, the layout and design has to be entered into the textbox on every edit page"

Project!
We have choosen the project, which is ""Mechanical work""! You can read more on our blog. This page will be updated soon.
Summary may 30th 2010
Planning of our research, before our trip to Paris 1. Membrane proteins + stimuli 2. PilG + PilH (the pili creating/degrading genes) + check out the E. coli’s pili-generating system. 3. Pili’s in general + receptorproteins. The groups must research the general mechanisms, and figure out which biobricks already exist, and which must be created (lowest priority). Post about in on Wave, and create a piece of text (abstract-like) which, in easy terms, explains your discoveries, so that the other groups easily can access and read up on it. The groups must individually meet once a week, before Paris. Perhaps a 2 hour meeting, where everyone gets updated on each other’s subject? We will not be researching beads yet, as (we hope) FLiNT (Center for Fundamental Living Technology) already knows a lot on this subject. We are not creating any definitive lab-groups yet, as we aren’t sure of how many lab groups is needed for this summer project.
After Paris
Having Biobricks sequenced, and gaining labskills.
When must the final system be “thought through”?
iGEM itself has a deadline, where we must hand in our project description which says august, and therefore decided to have our own internal deadline at the start of august.
Calendar
People must be aware of when they are going away on a holiday.
Name
There will be poll on our Wave, regarding the final name of our project. Proposals are welcome. The one, who brings the winning name, gets to have a yellow coat (Tour de France is going on, which is having a bit influence on us). Logo-competition: Draw your idea of a mE.chanic (or something of the likes), and win an E. Cola and a dotted coat.
Coats
There’s talk about coats, sponsored by IDA, perhaps for free, or perhaps partially for free. Naturally, we will have a red, green and a dotted coat. (Sheila has the info, regarding this).
Driving to Paris
People driving the cars will be: Car 7 Mike Sheila

Wire of Biological Computer……
W
hen it comes to electronic computers, we need wire, it is not only because it connect every part together, what is more, wire makes up the electronic path making electric current available, it can also provide energy. Then, as for biological computers，what is the role of ‘wire’?
F
irstly, biological computers are based on organism, a large number of them make up it，the computers do not need them provide energy obviously, because they can make it by themselves, then, the biological computers` wire must mainly convey information.
A
ctually, we have found that cells can communicate with each other, they have their own language, they make chemical words, and they can also recognize these words, turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison, and that is called quorum sensing. So, we think if these chemical words maybe can act as our wire, when the computers are switched on, some cells release some specific protein or something else, and the protein will combine with the receptor in the surface of another group cells, next step then will begin. And things like that. Those specific molecules play very important role, they have different specificity that can only be recognized by next part rather than all of the parts, so that all work will be carried out in order.

E
xcept for the solid connection of each part described before, we are glad to put forward another a new concept-Bio Wi-Fi. Since the communication between every single individual usually needs chemicals as medium, building connection with solid or liquid circumstance seems to be certain. But we still want future iGEM teams to accomplish this ‘impossible’ part to make the bio-computer realistic. As we all know, without a wireless communication system, the computer is not integrated.

I joined the UCLA iGEM team to explore new scientific frontiers and tackle challenges with a team of passionate, inspiring, and awesome individuals! My independent research focuses on profiling the transcriptional networks that regulate the kinetics of cellular reprogramming from a differentiated to a stem cell-state. I am fascinated by the subtle genetic and epigenetic changes that program enigmatic organs and complex cellular processes -- as well as the events that can disrupt them and lead to disease.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox allows a direct analysis of the success of the in vitro transcription in real-time. In an advanced set up, this system can be extended by DNA template encoding for the RNA of interest (ROI) and a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Both fragments are inserted between the promotor and the Malachite Green Aptamer. Inducing the hammerhead ribozyme allows cleavage during the in vitro transcription. Hereby two RNA fragments emerge, the ROI and the hammerhead ribozyme fused to Malachite Green Aptamer (HHR-MGA). Using such setup, the emitted fluorescence of the HHR-MGA will be independent on the applied ROI. Thus the fluorescence induced by the Malachite Green Aptamer can be applied to compare efficiencies of different RNAs at the same time.
The combination of two aptamers that are able to turn on fluorescence by binding to DFHBI or malachite green provide us the possibility to monitor simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis during in vitro transcription in real-time (Fig. 2). The application of the JAWS software generates us the best ATP-aptamer to identify even small changes during RNA synthesis.
To validate the JAWS-generated aptamers as well as to show the functionality of the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system we will apply different bacteriophage RNA polymerases (T7, Sp6, T3) that are commonly used. In addition inhibitors (Heparin) of polymerases as well as the effect of different buffer compositions will be analyzed by our approach.
RNA-Spinach2-Template preparation
Spinach2-DNA templates for in vitro transcription were amplified by extension-PCR and purified using Quiaquick PCR Purification Kit or ethanol precipitation. in vitro transcription was performed in presence of 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 1 mM spermidine, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton-X100, 4 mM each NTP, 10 mM DTT, 5 % DMSO and 0.1 mg/mL T7 RNA Polymerase. DNA was removed by 1 U/ µL DNase I digest. RNA was purified by denaturing PAGE and eluted in 0.3 M NaOAc pH 5.5. RNA was isopropanol precipitated and concentration determined by NanoDrop measurements.

""The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends."" - Friedrich Nietzsche
The universe, probably exists thanks to the lack of perfectionism. In my opinion, being successful in life is, first of all, looking at all the possibilities around us and giving a chance to the serendipity, as most of the great scientists did. Science is an infinity of possibilities and our aim must be to catch all of them and take what we want, whatever the cost is. Never get tired!
Why iGEM ? This project was for me an opportunity to do serious things with humor and funny things with serious. I knew science and its problems, humans and their problems but I also found solutions and friendship. For me iGEM was one of the best ways to know my limits and to prove to myself that I can exceed them.

""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift... that's why they call it present"" - Kung Fu Panda - Chinese proverb
I love this quote because it’s how I perceive life : enjoy the moment, enjoy being with your family and your friends, take pleasure of little things life has to offer. I’m a great optimistic and I’m proud of it !
Why iGEM ? I saw in iGEM a huge opportunity to participate to a great adventure. Take part of a team and work together on an concret project. Bring together our different skills to turn a scientific project into a human adventure.

""Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."" - Steve Jobs
Some would say I am naive. I probably am, but it enables me to think about what other people don't. Am I idealistic? For sure, and I believe this is why I never give up and I could dedicate my life to finding innovative solutions to widespread issues.
Why iGEM ?  iGEM is a great opportunity to meet people from different areas in order to bear a major project. Sharing knowledge, dealing with science in depth, carrying out our own project are numerous reasons why I would recommend iGEM to any curious and open-minded students.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the introduction of the pantothenate kinase BioBrick. By introducing a PHB secretion system into an E. coli strain, we can possibly achieve a continuous production of PHB from the existing plastic producing BioBricks. Our system has already left us with enough PHB to 3D print a part of a human jaw. The secretion system we introduce, use phasin as a transportermolecule for the secretion of PHB. Phasin binds to PHAs, which creates the possibility of its use when working with other types of biodegradable PHA polyesters in bacteria Hanisch, J., et al. (2006). ""The Ralstonia eutropha H16 phasin PhaP1 is targeted to intracellular triacylglycerol inclusions in Rhodococcus opacus PD630 and Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, and provides an anchor to target other proteins."" Microbiology 152(Pt 11): 3271-3280. . For further information about PHB, read here .
In the field of science, scientific reproduction is one of the most important aspects when confirming a hypothesis or theory. iGEM follows this specific scientific virtue by making it a part of both the bronze and gold criteria: the demands imply working with other team’s work. We took it further trying to reproduce parts of earlier iGEM team’s work: the 2015 UCLA team , the 2012 Tokyo Tech team , the 2013 Imperial College London and the 2015 Standford Brown team .

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modeling#Stochastic_-_-_TEXT.html,". When the region is oriented from right to the left, 'sigA promoter in the invertible region is also turned to right and expresses Gfp, when its way is not blocked by XlyR bound to xylA promoter.
Hence Gfp and Rfp concentrations can be used as an indication of cell fate decisions and other downstream genes can be added to the left or right sides of the switch to trigger those decisions.
This circuit is controlled by IPTG and Xylose. As a third control, Arabinose can also be used. The orientation of the invertable region highly effects the outcome of this circuit and the direction is changed by Hin protein. By doing so, its expression is also affected and this situation also adds to the stochasticity. In our design, Hin proteins are tagged with the modified version of ssrA degradation tag which requires SspB adaptor protein to target Hin proteins for the degradation by ClpXP system. Hence by controllling the expression of SspB by arabinose (via araE promoter controlled by AraR), concentration of Hin can be controlled. Where necessary just a pulse of Hin can be created.
For more information about the design of the switch: Team:Newcastle/Stochasticity
Simulations
In the diagrams below X-Axis shows IPTG and Y-Axis shows Xylose concentration. IPTG and Xylose concentrations are changed between 0 and 9000nM. Three sets of model outputs were created for 0nM, 1000nM and 10000nM of arabinose. The first column shows Gfp concentrations and the second column shows Rfp concentrations.
Gfp Concentration
Rfp Concentration
Arabinose=0nM
Arabinose=1000nM

Single Runs
Models can also be run with specific values of IPTG, Xylose and Arabinose.
We assumed that 60nM of Hin would be enough to invert the invertible segment with HixC sites. At every 60nM increase of Hin concentration, we flipped the region by 40% chance. Flips can be noticed from the diagram below for the expression of Hin mRNA.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Background#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html," development has persistent effects ( Richter et al., 2007 ).
Bisphenol A acts as endocrine disruptor, because it mimics the natural hormone estrogen and may thus induce negative health effects. It can bind in vivo and in vitro to estrogen receptors (ER) which leads to alterations in several levels of tissues and cells. The consequences are changes in estrogen-targeted cells in such as the brain and the mammary glands. In addition, BPA acts on non-classical targets like bones, cardiovascular tissue, pancreas, adipose tissue and the immune system ( Vandenberg et al., 2009 ). There is also evidence indicating an anti-tyroid hormone effect ( Richter et al., 2007 ). A study of the BPA concentration in urine shows a significant relationship to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and liver-enzyme abnormalities in adults ( Lang et al., 2008 ).
Another estrogenic effect of BPA is the disruption of pancreas ß-cells, resulting in an insulin resistance. Furthermore, it leads to an increase in glucose transporter GLUT4 and thus to glucose uptake in cells ( Richter et al., 2007 ). BPA can also have an effect on the immune system, dependending on the time of exposure, as it affects the estrogen receptor that is expressed by lymphocytes dependent on age and gender ( Richter et al., 2007 ).
Moreover, studies provide evidence that indicate an effect on male and female reproductive tracts. In males, it has an impact on sperm production, testosterone secretion and on reproductive structures (e.g. the prostate). These effects can already be observed under admission of low BPA doses. The effect on the adult male reproductive tract has adverse consequences for the testicular function. In the long run, this can lead to infertility. In case of females, alterations in the development of the mammary glands and their structure could be determined which might be a reason for cancer development ( Richter et al., 2007 ).
Bisphenol A degradation
Many naturally occurring bacteria can degrade xenobiotic substances such as phenolic compounds or endocrine disruptors. In soil samples, taken from contaminated soil to find organisms that degrade such substances, Sphingomonas species were extraordinarily often isolated ( Stolz, 2009 ). In 2005, Sasaki et al. isolated a soil bacterium from the Sphingomonas genus which is able to degrade the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) with an unique rate and efficiency compared to other BPA degrading organisms. This strain, called S"

Dry Lab Overview
Dr Michael Baron introduced us to GitHub and its basic commands. On Thursday we travelled to Oxford for the UK iGEM Meetup organised by SynBio UK. We learned about other team’s project and planned collaborations based on our strengths and weaknesses. Hearing a member of Imperial’s 2014 team Aqualose was particularly inspiring as their project is relevant to ours and proved to be successful. Through different workshops in safety and project planning we developed our idea further.
Wet Lab Overview
This week Catherine, Jacopo G and Stefanie started working on the InterLab study. We finished the calibrations and prepared reagents for the following week.
Week 13 (July 16 - July 20)
Dry Lab Overview
We met with Dr Chris Barnes for a modelling crash course. He explained how we can use our knowledge of kinetics to model reactions. Our modelling team started weekly meetings with him. We also discussed different applications of spider silk apart from metal filtration. Endocrine disruptors contaminating water is another problem we decided to tackle.
Wet Lab Overview
We transformed the constructs for the absorbance and fluorescence measurements. As our negative control failed to transform, the Westminster iGEM team was kind enough to give us a plate of their transformed colonies.
Week 14 (July 23 - July 27)
Dry Lab Overview
We created a Gantt chart to plan a few weeks ahead. Eurofins became our sponsor, their sequencing services will be crucial to our lab work.
Wet Lab Overview
After finishing the last Interlab experiment, we analysed the data and submitted it. The Interlab study proved to be a valuable experience as we practiced important techniques and became familiar with the lab. While we are waiting for our constructs to arrive we started preparing the iGEM standard backbones for our experiments.

There were 4 PCR tubes, with SLO1 containing HSP 1 with forward, SLO2 containing HSP 1 with reverse, SLO3 containing HSP 3 with forward and SLO$ containing HSP 3 with reverse.
7/10/14:  We mini prepped the HSP+input backbone colonies 1 and 2, from our 50mL inoculation. It was poured into a 50mL conical tube, spun down at 3900 for 15 minutes, discarded the supernatant, resuspended the pellet in 25mL PBS, split into four 25mL conical tubes with approximately 5mL in each. Then the protocol ""Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge"" was followed for all of them. .Each was eluted with 50uL and nanodropped. The results were, colony 1: 3.2ng/uL or 7.5ng/uL, and for colony 2: 8.2ng/uL or 12.6ng/uL. We nanodropped twice, the first time before vortexing and the second time after vortexin. Dionne noticed that the 260/280 was very high so this may mean we had too much DNA so that could explain the low yields.   We put tips into boxes.  We cleaned some Qiagen mini prep columns.   We spun down all of the primers we got for 10 mins on max speed, then we resuspended them with 1 X TE buffer.

Introduction
As you can see in the previous parts, the shining point of our design is that we have introduced the quorum sensing device into our circuit. In order to see what the characteristics of our design are during the process of attracting E. coli to atrazine, we have built three models respectively and compared their possible behaviors.
The first circuit, we called circuit one, is the most simple one, which has been constructed by Joy sinha et al in 2010. In this circuit, bacteria will stop walking in the region with high concentration of atrazine, in which way bacteria will finally get together to this region. However, bacteria can't tell each other the information about the destination like ants, which will tell their companies the location of food.
Fig. 4-1 Circuit 1. Atrazine will promote the translation of the CI protein. However, the CheZ protein, which represent the motility, will be repressed when the concentration of CI protein is high. So, the consequence will be more and more bacteria stopping in the region with high Atrazine.
The second circuit is our original blueprint with a complex structure and you can see the quorum sensing device here. It is a little complex and has a cascade, which is believed to prolong the respond time of our system. In short, the behavior of bacteria will be affected by the concentration of AHL, which represents the density of bacteria. It means that the bacteria can communicate with each other.
Fig. 4-2 Circuit2. The movement of the bacteria with this circuit will affected by the presence of AHL. In our initiate consideration, the cascade, AHL&LuxR→Plux-tetr---Ptet-CI---Pci-CheZ, will lead to the promotion of the production of CheZ protein.
The third circuit is the ultimate one that we have designed and optimized.We have replaced the cascade mentioned above with a hybridize promoter, which can be repressed by CI protein and activated by AHL-LuxR compound.
Fig. 4-3 Circuit 3. The greatest difference between circuit 2 and circuit 3, as you can see, is that the cascade in circuit 2 have been replaced by the hybridize promoter, Plux/CI. Then, we got a new organism that will respond quickly to the"

We are aware that founding a new company is a big challenge. What struck us the most, is the small number of start-ups that have been founded from iGEM teams – although there are numerous projects that are highly interesting not only from a scientific but also from a commercial point of view. Therefore, we strived to get an even deeper insight what enabled iGEM teams to found a new firm. The extensive results are presented on Supporting Entrepreneurship . We use the insights that we gained to improve on our way to the founding of a new company. Furthermore, beyond sharing the results we derived advices for iGEM. These advices wil help to increase the number of start-ups from iGEM teams. With these advices, we strive to increase iGEM’s footprint beyond the competition and shape the career of it’s participants.
Due to non-disclosure agreements company names were made anonymous and interview guidelines were taken out of the appendix. Our Business model is applied in the drug development process within the pharmaceutical industry.
1. Executive Summary
3D printing is currently revolutionizing many industries as well as the biotech sector. We build on this trend in order to bring our revolutionary technology to the market. To this end, we genetically engineer cells to make them produce a ""glue"" that connects these cells within milliseconds in order to build stable and living tissues by 3D printing.
We aim to introduce this technology to the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs are developed over a span of 10 years, and the whole process costs up to $ 3 billion. Both these factors stem from the lack of appropriate testing systems for drug candidates. Our printed tissues should be applied subsequent to 2D cell culture screening and before animal testing in order to identify promising drug candidates at an early stage and thus solve the customer's problem of cost and time in drug development.
In our business model, we print liver tissue into a 96-well plate and provide it to our customers from the pharmaceutical industry for toxicity studies in the context of drug development. These pieces of tissue constitute customized “mini-organs” for specific drug testing. For the first time, our technology allows us to achieve a quality of printed tissue that enables our customers to use these tissues in the drug development process, which corresponds to our USP. Thus, we enable our customers to develop drugs faster, with lower opportunity costs and less animal testing. We expect annual sales of 400–500 panels for a single strategic partner within the first year. Based on our interviews, a price of € 10,000"

Collaboration
This year, we collaborate with three different universities on different perspectives of our project. They are the Rice University , with whom we collaborated last year, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras , and the National University of Singapore . The exchange of ideas enables us to get inspired, and allow us to understand that collaboration is, in fact, a fruitful learning experience on either end."

Our Aim
We aim to genetically engineer  bacteria and design a prototype of a device that converts harmful components of exhaust gases (i.e NOx and SOx) coming out of  chimneys of various industries and car exhausts into harmless byproducts.
We aim to genetically engineer E.coli and equip it with the genes to synthesize nitrite reductase enzyme NrfA and CysI (sulfite reductase) and Sqr (Sulfide Quinone reductase) enzymes. NrfA reduces NOx to ammonia (NH3) while Cys1 and Sqr reduce sulphur dioxide (SO2) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and H2S to sulfur(S) respectively. These would   be immobilized on polymer beads that have a positive zeta potential and placed in a bioreactor. The bacteria will reduce the oxides present in the incoming gas stream and consequently the percentage of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur in the outgoing gas stream will be significantly lower.

In lanes 1 and 4 we see that a PCR product was amplified with the expected size. As negative controls, neither amplification was possible with a single primer (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6), nor in the absence of primers (lane 7) or DNA template (lane 8).
Figure 2. Polymerase chain reaction of DNA sequence of the fusion protein (C1 and C2). C1 and C2 sequences (lanes 1 and 4, respectively) were amplified post-synthesis to generate sufficient material for cloning. Control reactions: single primer (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6), without primers (lane 7), without DNA template (lane 8).  MW: molecular weight marker.
In order to have more DNA, we cloned it into TOPO vector (Fig. 3A), and transformed competent bacteria Escherichia coli TOP10, resulting in white clones (Fig. 3B). After bacteria culture and plasmid DNA extraction, we verified the presence of an insert by using Xba I and Hind III restriction enzymes (data not shown). After that, insert was extracted from the gel, and ligated into digested and dephosphorylated pET43.1a, the expression vector (Fig. 4A). We repeated the procedure, and we proved that our vector contained the insert by electrophoresis (Fig. 4B). Sequencing confirmed that it was the correct sequence.
Figure 3. TOPO Cloning (A) TOPO cloning vectors were used to overcome cloning difficulties. Trimolecular reaction is reduced to a bimolecular one. (B) Bacteria were cultivated onto LB plates added of ampicillin and X-Gal, resulting in white clones. White/blue selection was used to identify recombinant vectors.
