Project Description  The aim of our project is to create a bacterium that can detect the presence of vibrio cholerae in water. Some bacteria use quorum-sensing. They produce and release autoinducers; signal molecules which vary in concentration as a function of cell density. When a minimal threshold of autoinducer molecules is detected, gene expression is altered. This provides a mechanism for coordinated behaviour within bacterial populations. The detection of autoinducers involves a histidine kinase in the membrane which detects the signal and autophosporylates on a His residue. A phosphate is then transferred to an aspartate residue of a response regulator which relays the signal. We aim to create a fusion protein in E.coli capable of detecting the presence of CAI-1 (cholera autoinducer). This requires fusion of two related receptors with similar topography. The signal is then transmitted down its native pathway. We have chosen 2 similar receptors to create our fusion protein; BarA and CqsS. BarA is a sensory histidine kinase present in the membrane of E.coli. CqsS is a sensory histidine kinase from vibrio cholerae which detects CAI-1. We aim to fuse the N-terminal (receptor) domain of the CqsS (which detects CAI-1 and autophosphorylates) with the C-terminal (transmitter) domain of BarA (which accepts a phosphate and relays the signal downstream. We will then insert the recombined BarA gene into a high copy plasmid. An alternative is to transform the whole CqsS pathway into E.coli. Phosphorylation of the BarA/CqsS causes the phosphorylation of the response regulator UvrY, which then binds to DNA causing transcription of CsrB (a small regulatory RNA). CsrB inhibits CsrA which, in turn, inhibits certain genes. These genes are part of the pgaABCD operon, a 4 gene locus in E.coli. Upon CAI-1 detection by the fusion kinase, transcription of CsrB causes inhibition of CsrA therefore relieving the inhibition of the pgaABCD gene transcription. We want our biosensor to produce a response visible to the naked eye. We plan to insert E.chromi (from the Cambridge"

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
“Vitiligo is a skin disease that is caused by selective destruction of melanocytes and is characterized by white spots. Melanocytes and keratinocytes seem to exhibit a functional close relationship, mediated at least in part by keratinocyte-derived cytokines, which seem important for survival and activity of melanocytic cells” - New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Vitiligo: Imbalance of Epidermal Cytokines  at Sites of Lesions p. 87
Nina: These cytokines are important for us to study in order to check if we can introduce any into the skin.
""It has been hypothesized that melanocytes form a functional unit together with keratinocytes, the so-called epidermo-melanic unit (6). Close relationships important for melanocyte survival and differentiation likely exist between these two cell types, that are mainly because of keratinocyte-derived cytokines, acting on melanocytes via speci®c receptors (7, 8). Keratinocytes secrete GM-CSF, an intrinsic stimulant of melanocytes in UVA-induced melanosis (9), endothelins, which are intrinsic mitogens for melanocytes and stimulate UVB hyperpigmentation (10), and bFGF which is a natural mitogen for melano-cytes (11) and promotes melanin synthesis (12). SCF/c-KIT pathway mediated by keratinocytes plays a critical role in the control of normal human melanocyte home-ostasis, increasing the number, size, and dendricity of melanocytes (13). Furthermore, keratinocytes synthesize IL-1a, IL-6, TNF-a and TGF-b, which are paracrine inhibitors of human melanocyte proliferation and mela-nogenesis (14±18). Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that a functional change of cutaneous microenvironment ± i.e. an impairment in keratinocyte secretory activity ± may be involved in melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo."" - New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Vitiligo: Imbalance of Epidermal Cytokines at Sites of Lesions p. 88
Nina: The bFGF is interesting for us to continue studying. It does not need any glycolisation, which GM-CSF does. SCF stand for stem cell factor and might induce all types of cells to proliferate and get to active which might result in"

MARS Tutorial Videos
Summary
In this section you will find our Microfluidics 101 video tutorials. These videos take you through the basics of fabricating and using MARS microfluidic chips. Each is a fully narrated, step-by-step guide teaching you how to mill, make PDMS, and more! For those who prefer reading, each video is accompanied by an in-depth, printable written protocol.
This branch of MARS was validated by our iGEM poll. When we reached out to teams regarding what educational materials they would find useful, one of the highest voted tools were video tutorials with 73.8% of responses indicating video tutorials would help them start using microfluidics. This idea was also pitched to various microfluidic manufacturing companies who advised us on specific elements to include. For example, including written content in the form of protocols was suggested in order to provide a written guide to be carried into laboratory settings or referred to when offline. The inclusion of our “Cleaning” video was inspired by Black Hole Lab’s emphasis on proper cleaning and storage of their chips during training seminars for lab technicians.

Afterwards these were heat-inactivated for 20 minutes at 80 °C. The measurement with Tecan200 infinte Pro plate reader ranged over 76 minutes.
4 µg acetic acid were detected in the 0.1 x sample volume. In the 0.15 x sample volume the amount of acetic acid was 1.5 times higher and in the 0.2 x sample volume it was 2.5 times higher (figure 8).

About 1 mg of chitin was used as substrate. If chitin is completely deacetylated by NodB into chitosan about 60 µg acetic acid are expected to be produced. In our results about 50 µg acetic acid were produced.  Consequently, approximately 83 % chitin has been deacetylated. This extrapolated result is shown in figure 9.
Conclusion
We verified the expression of NodB in E. coli BL21 with a SDS-Page. After tagging the protein with a His-tag, we performed purification and refolding through an ÄKTA pure system, and verified the success through another SDS-Page.
To test whether NodB works properly, we used the acetic acid assay kit (Acetate Kinase Manual Format, Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). NodB deacetylates chitin to create chitosan. This chemical step releases acetic acid. As already explained in the methods, the amount of acetic acid is indirectly measured via amount of NADH consumption at 340 nm wavelength. The amount of acetic acid is stoichiometric with the"

After centrifugation, we were able to see a distinct band of phage in both the T4 and T7 gradients.  The T7 band was significantly lower in the tube than the T4 band.  Next time we run the procedure, we will be running the T7 phage through a higher concentrated gradient.  After leaving the gradients overnight in the refrigerator, the gradients mixed together and we had difficulty seeing the distinct bands to extract the phage.  We will have to rerun the experiment.

    Part name: Ethanol inducible promoter 0435, Ethanol inducible promoter 0405, Up-regulated in stationary phase promoter 0038
    Part number: BBa_K2800006, BBa_K2800007, BBa_K2800008
    Description:
            These promoters can give priority to strain’s growth and make it begin fermentation to produce isobutanol later. In fact, Zymomonas mobilis is a capable ethanologenic bacterium with high ethanol productivity and ethanol tolerance. As ethanol accumulated, promoters get higher expression in stationary phase.

    Part number: BBa_K2800021
    Description:
            Promoter P0038 is up-regulated in stationary phase. As a result, the strain grows and reproduces swiftly during the early exponential phase, consuming a small quantity of glucose and accumulating amino acid intermediates, and then before the glucose run out, enhance the expression of kdcA to decarboxylate 2-keto acids to aldehydes at a relatively high rate. Let the strain regulates itself, like a automatic control system, so as to improve the isobutanol yield.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Choices_-_-_TEXT.html," would have had more time for their blood-brain barriers to become established in comparison to newborn rats (Wong and Klaassen., 1982).
It has been reported that cadmium can provoke neuronal cells in the brain to undergo oxidative stress – the mechanism behind this is cadmium’s ability to encourage the production of reactive oxygen species when it interacts with the mitochondria (L´opez et al., 2006).
Cadmium can also affect the action of neurotransmitters. In studies, it has been shown to create an increase in concentration of inhibitory neurotransmitters (in particular GABA and Glycine) and create a decrease in the concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters (in particular glutamate and aspartate) (Minami et al., 2001).
Why use Bacillus subtilis?
Bacillus subtilis strain 168 is the bacterial species of choice for the 2009 Newcastle team. It is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive bacterium commonly found in soil. We chose B. subtilis for its ability to live in a soil enviroments and for its ability to sporulate.
Some of our instructors and advisers know a great deal about B. subtilis and there is an active bacterial cell biology institute studying the molecular biology and physiology of this bacterium at Newcastle.
The 2008 iGEM Newcastle team and a number of other 2008 also used B. subtilis and provide a nice overview of its advantages in their wiki . Thanks to the efforts of these teams the number of B. subtilis parts in the registry is increasing. This year we have added many more.

3-1.  Lux repression promoter can work!
In Artificial Cooperation System, two types of cells use quorum sensing to recognize population of the counterpart and help one another when they are dying. The quorum sensing in this system is regulated by AHL dependent transcriptional activation/repression. Therefore, we characterized activation/repression promoters. We examined the existing LuxR repression promoter which has never been characterized before in BioBrick registry. We found that the leaky expression of this promoter is too strong to use in this system. For this reason, we constructed and characterized a new LuxR repression promoter of which strength is weaker than the existing LuxR repression promoter.

3-2.  Antibiotic Activation Device
We succeeded in constructing and characterizing a NEW Biobrick device of chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) gene (BBa_K395162) which is activated by lux promoter. We found that the device is activated by LuxR/3OC6HSL complex and that the cell introduced the part was able to survive even in high chloramphenicol concentration (750 ug/ml) in the presence of 3OC6HSL.

3-3. luxI Assay
In order to test whether rbs-LuxI-ter (K092400) works correctly, we measured the amount of 3OC6HSL synthesized by LuxI generator (K395146). We confirmed that rbs-LuxI-ter (K092400) worked as expected and the amount of 3OC6HSL was sufficient to induce the chloramphenicol resistance gene expression at maximum level, which is regulated by R0062 in the Artificial Cooperation System.

In order to confirm the feasibility of the Artificial Cooperation System, we simulated the system under typical four experimental conditions. First, when the system worked and any antibiotics did not exist, cell A and cell B in the system showed no difference of growth.
Second, when the system did not work and chloramphenicol existed, the number of cell A decreased while the number of cell B increased.
Third, when the system worked and chloramphenicol existed, the number of cell A increased after temporal decline, which means"

Teaching Module ""Synthetic Biology"" for Highschools
Science in Action
Students at Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium preparing vanilla pudding solution for fluorescence measurement.
In the course of our cooperation with the grade 9 biology-chemistry class at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Aachen, we developed a teaching module about “Synthetic Biology”. The scope of the module is 8 school classes 45 min. each. Topics include
sources of and exposure to microorganisms in our environment
antibiotic resistances
quorum sensing
fluorescence and measurement thereof
the bio-molecular aspect of our iGEM project.
To wrap up the module we did some career-exploration in synthetic biology and related fields.
The teaching module is suitable for the subjects biology, biology-chemistry and sciences. The students should have completed grade 8, and know about the central dogma of biology as well as protein biosynthesis. Because our work is going to be evaluated based on this wiki, we would like to take photos during the lessons. In order to publish the photos on our homepage and our wiki, we need a consent form signed by the students’ parents. If you, too, are interested in collaborating with our team write us an email at igem@rwth-aachen.de
We have carried out this teaching module in cooperation with Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium. Here are some impressions of this collaboration:

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Ideas and Mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html,"cer DAPG with the repressor will lower the it’s affinity to bind to the operator sites of the promoter, in turn activates promoter transcription. Second,  according to Brynne et al. (2014), the response functions of phlFp is comparable to tetp, as a result, it is possible to fine tune the strength difference of the promoters using different strength of RBS.
2. tetp
The tetp module consists of a Tet repressible promoter upstream of the CDSs of phlF and lacI, which are then followed by the reporter gene, mtagbfp. When tetp is actived, the two repressor proteins, PhlF and LacI will be expressed along with the reporter gene, mtagbfp. This results in the repression of the two other promoters in our system, phlfp and lacp.
Creating a reproducible Tristable Switch with distinct signals is another goal we would like to achieve this year.  As the three states are interconnected with each other, high level of stochastic noise could possibly lead to indistinct signals and thus disrupt the stability of our genetic circuit. As a result, the tetp we used is an improved version with minimized background expression. With this, we hope to minimize the number of variants that may affect the stability of our genetic circuit so as to achieve the goal mentioned previously.
3. Reporters
We have used three fluorescence proteins, mRFP, mTagBFP and sfGFP as our reporters to indicate the signal outputs generated by the Tristable Switch. As the result, overlapping in the excitation wavelength of the fluorescence proteins should be minimized.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html," We will use this as a template to amplify vector sequences adding SfiI restriction sites. I had problems to get amplification in the PCR reaction (twice), so I did analytic digestions with different restriction enzymes (four different cuts). The restriction patterns are not as expected. I may have used the wrong template (maybe the tube was mislabeled). I made new mini-preps, double-checking that the strain was the right one. Next week I will try to do this again with the new miniprep DNA.
Prepare large amounts of the vectors necessaries to transpose the mini-Tn7. we will need fairly large amounts of pTNS2 (containing the Tn7 transposase complex), pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T-Km (positive control), pBBR1MCS5 (negative control) to electroporate into the recipient strains for the transposons. I streaked the strains on selective plates, set up inocula, purified plasmid DNA and measured the concentration of the DNA, which was generally lower than expected. Also I did some checking of the pTNS2 plasmids with restriction enzymes.
Finally I started a protocol to make electro-competent cells of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, two of the four strains we will use to characterize the behavior of mini-Tn7.
Week 2 (July, 11-15)
Our order of DNA synthesis has not arrived yet. It is a month behind-schedule by now and we are getting anxious about this delay of the DNA synthesis service. I know I must use my time in the lab despite not having all the required materials, so I made a list of all the experiments I can run without the mini-Tn7. Actually It is a long list with a fair amount of work to do. I set priorities and start from the top!
First of all, I need a suicide vector I can use as the mini-Tn7 delivery system. Similarly to last week, the new minipreps of pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T-Km yielded no PCR product and the restriction pattern with five different enzyme combinations was again not what we expected. Despite our efforts, it is evident that the plasmid we received was not pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T-Km as published. After contacting the Schweizer lab about this problem, they informed us that they had sent us a different, although similar plasmid, but unfortunately it is not suitable for our purposes. Instead, restriction analysis confirmed"

pfu-PCRs with the tvel10-plasmid, one with the tvel10-243 primer-mix and one with the tvel10-1161 primer-mix. Both PCRs showed correct bands for the PCR-product in a test-agarose-gel-electrophoresis. Digested template with DpnI.

Additionally we want the laccases with overhanging ends for cloning in our shuttle vector for expression in Pichia pastoris. Therefore we used Pc_lac35_FW_oS / Pc_lac35_RV and Tv_lac5_FW_oS / Tv_lac5_RV primer pairs.

Comparison of DEET and D-limonene effects on beans development
Safety/Security
Introduction
Although poisoning by DEET (active ingredient of the most common commercial repellents) and D-limonene are rare events, it is known that these two substances may be toxic. The absorption of high concentrations of DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) can     have neurotoxic effect and even be lethal (1,2,3,4,5). D-limonene, if ingested in high concentrations may also cause death (6).
Therefore, we conducted a simple test on an eukaryote model to compare the effect of the two substances on beans development (Phaseolus vulgaris,Fabaceae).
Methods
In order to reduce fungal contamination, water and cotton used in the experiment were sterilized by autoclaving. Beans seeds were immersed in 2.7% hypochlorite and then in 70% ethanol (5 minutes for each solution). The seeds were divided into 5 groups     corresponding to five different treatments), each containing 16 individuals. Each seed was placed on a piece of cotton inside a plastic cup. The groups were placed on a bench in order to receive the same illumination.
All seeds initially received 2 mL of water. Treatments were initiated after 24 hours. We adapted limonene concentrations (Limonene 1 - non lethal; Limonene 2 - lethal) to seeds size, according to a prior study of toxicity reported by (6). The following     treatments were administered every 24 hours:
Experiment was initiated in August 11th and treatments lasted from August 12th to 20th.
Analysis of results
Beans development
At the end of the experiment, all individuals in each group were measured, as seen below:
There was a significant difference between the growth of limonene 1 and control groups compared to the group receiving DEET and limonene in higher concentration, as already noted (6).

8-15
Degradation of our fusion protein is still significant. Results seem to suggest that the fusion protein is being cleaved at the linker, resulting in both the dxCas9 and the fusion protein being present in our sample. The heparin chromatography was relatively successful at separating the two populations. The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt. As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (gel1, lane 9-15 and gel2, lane 1-7). At high levels of salt the mostly fusion elutes (gel2, lane 8-15). Only these last eight elution fractions are pooled. Thus losses are tolerated, to obtain a relatively pure fusion fraction which can be further purified by MonoQ.

Protein Purification - MonoQ Chromatography
The fusion protein was further purified with MonoQ chromatography. The 1mL MonoQ 5/50 GL column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃.  16mL of sample (4x diluted heparin chromatography elution fraction 16-23 of fusion protein) was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse monoQ of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

We were also able to learn more about their microfluidics systems, for example their take on volume dispensing on a chip. Although we were not able to integrate their system into our existing workflow, it offered an alternative method of metering using external systems. During the call the possibility of integrating multiple flow layers into our chips was discussed in detail. While we are not equipped to create multi-layer chips at this time, we are excited to explore this area in microfluidics further in the near future.
Fraunhofer
During the last weeks of summer, we had the opportunity to tour the Fraunhofer Center for Manufacturing Innovation located on BU’s campus. Through this tour we were able to better understand how they approached designing and implementing microfluidic technology for research purposes, and how this translated to mass manufacturing. We were able to see chips housed on-site such as  a rapid diagnostics chip for septicemia and a PCR chip being designed for mass scale manufacturing.
Over the course of the tour we were able to discuss their goal of moving research into mass manufacturing and industry, as well as what types of barriers need to be overcome in order to do so. Many of the points they covered, such as lack of documentation, high levels of specialization and lack of standardized manufacturing, were all barriers we have been looking to overcome. Although we were interested in solving similar issues, our workflow would not necessarily impact the microfluidic fabrication industry directly. Our workflow would have an impact, however, through allowing synthetic biologists to:
Rapidly replicate and prototype chips designs
Easily, quickly and cheaply produce iterations without reaching out to industry manufacturing
Keep standardized design files and documentation to pass on to companies for mass manufacturing
Blacktrace - Dolomite
Blacktrace are a company involved with designing and manufacturing modular microfluidics for research and industry. Our conversation with them revolved around how they approached quality control, as well as what types of problems they encountered when handing off microfluidics to consumers.
This led to an in depth conversation regarding the types of educational materials they have designed for first time microfluidics users. If a complex microfluidics setup is being installed in a lab, Blacktrace typically hosts a two-day training seminar covering the basics of using and maintaining the hardware. For smaller scale chips and devices, they include detailed information in the form of manuals and web support.
Throughout the conversation, Blacktrace stressed the importance of easy to understand educational materials and gave a few suggestions regarding what we should include in our own project. What we were able to take away from this outreach was the"

Preliminary Project Description
Aflatoxins, specifically, aflatoxin B1 have been troubling food and agriculture industry all over the world. As secondary metabolites produced by certain species of Aspergillus, aﬂatoxins have been one of the most toxic and problematic . Though many past traditional biological methods have been put in this fight against these toxins, the purposes were mostly realized by mixing whole strains and degrading toxins passively.
Our goal this year is to create a more sensitive cellular device to simultaneously detect and degrade AFTB1 in the environment. We have two subsystems, the Detection Subsystem and the Degradation Subsystem. We will take and modify some past parts designed by Tsinghua 2017 as our biosensor to detect AFTB1. And we will utilize this part to induce downstream genes to produce enzymes that will degrade aflatoxin outside cells. We have some candidates now that show the ability to degrade AFTB1 and they will be tested by us then.
Detection Subsystem
Inspired by Tsinghua 2017, we will reconstruct the sensor based on the yeast two-hybrid technique. There are two domains in this part, the transcription-activation domain (AD)  and the DNA-binding domain (BD). They correspondingly use two different single-chain antibodies of AFT ScFv1 and ScFv2 to link together when AFTB1 exists and activate Gal4 promoter then. When the promoter is activated, it can open downstream genes, the Degradation Subsystem.
Degradation Subsystem
The degradation subsystem is designed to degrade aflatoxin which will be induced by the Detection Subsystem.
bacC
bacC is a bacilysin biosynthesis oxidoreductase gene from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. As a new report says, bacC may contribute aflatoxin degradation in some degree. The BLAST results show that bacC has some similarities and identities to reductase with nine reductase enzymes of Mycobacteria smegmatis, which have been proven to clean aflatoxin. Some experiments were also completed by the author to support that. As a good candidate to us, we will design experiments to express bacC and"

The general Plasmodium primer-probe pair was created as described below.
To distinguish suitable sequences for primer/probe design we created a                  FASTA file with all available mitochondrial nucleotide sequences of                  Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, P. ovale and P. vivax from the NCBI database 5 .                  These 2080 Sequences were aligned with ClustalO 1 . For this step we used ClustalO,                  running on a computing cluster and the following bash command:
nohup clustalo --outfmt=msf -o outputname.msf -i inputname.fasta & > nohup.log
Afterwards, we created a frequency matrix from the resulting MSF file. The frequency matrix was created with Emboss Prophecy 2 . We used the following parameters:
EMBOSS data file: EDNAFULL
Threshold reporting percentage: 75
Gap opening penalty: 3.0
Gap extension penalty: 0.3
Subsequently, we calculated a new matrix based on the frequency matrix. Table 1 shows how we calculated this matrix.
Table 1: We calculated a matrix                      with eight columns and as many rows as positions in the frequency matrix. In the columns,                      B - F are the nucleotides Adenin (A), Cytosin (C), Guanin (G) and Thymin (T).                      The first row and column are only shown for a better orientation in the matrix.
In this matrix, we searched for positions with a high value in column I                  (near or equal 1) and a nucleotide summation as high as possible.                  The sequence of Plasmodium is often Thymin/Adenin rich,                  so we had also to look for a high Guanin/Cytosin-content.                  If a suitable sequence is long enough for a primer and probe design,                  we designed primers and a probe with OligoArchitectTM 3 .                  Afterwards, we calculated the secondary structure of the primers and the probe with RNAstructure 4"

This project also provides an open framework, where other iGEMers can extend our current functionality and collaborate with us to further develop the user interface too. Hence, in subsequent years, the cost of the project will remain almost constant at $700, but it will have better and better software support.

Part construction was confirmed through restriction digest and sequencing and is compatible with all assembly standards. This part is roughly 220bp - an appreciable size difference to observe in gel electrophoresis when undertaking assembly.
Ligation Independent Cloning
Ligation independent cloning (LIC) is a new procedure that exploits the 3’-5’ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases to produce sequence-specific overhangs for target primer insertion. In the LIC procedure, the DNA is cut with a restriction enzyme(s) and DNA polymerase is added in the presence of only one dNTP. In the absence of all other dNTPs, the equilibrium of the polymerase activity shift to exonuclease activity and nucleotides are removed from the point of the restriction digest until the polymerase encounters a nucleotide that corresponds to the single dNTP present. At this point the exonulease activity stops and is counteracted by the 5’-3’ polymerisation activity which prevents further changes to the DNA due to only one dNTP being present. This results in a polymerase-digested vector with non-homologous sequences of sticky-ends. Primers can then be designed with complementarity for the sticky-ends, allowing for the insertion of a desired peptide sequence within the vector by simply annealing the primers to the vector and transformation into cells.
The thermostable protein Taq polymerase was chosen as a carrier molecule, to facilitate the production of a peptide as a peptide-Taq fusion protein separated by a thermolabile bond, such as an Asp/Pro bond. The proposed bioprocess would then involve heating the bacteria below the threshold of the thermolabile bond for simplified lysis, then following clarification or polishing, heating above the threshold of the thermolabile bond to separate the peptide from the Taq protein allowing use expression immediately in assays, or providing a simple starting source for final purification.
The peptide plasmid was also designed with the intention of  allowing peptides to be inserted easily and quickly by a process of Ligation Independent Cloning (LIC) (refns) to produce a desired peptide at will, or even allow the rapid and economical production of a library of peptides for drug design and screening. Two test peptides were chosen to explore the capacity of the peptide expression platform being Losartan and"

CB bottom miniprep
Today we performed a miniprep on the 4 tubes of CB bottom bacteria with 4 ml of culture in each tube.  6 ml of culture were eventually consolidated into a single spin tube during the miniprep, so this would be the equivalent of 4 minipreps in one tube.  Of note, after lysis (during addition of buffer P2), the tubes turned extremely blue, darker blue than we had ever seen before.  This would seem to indicate that the lysis step occurred very successfully.  However, even after consolidating four minipreps into one tube, we still got terrible concentration results for our samples, displayed below:
DNA concentrations after miniprep
We will thus seed more LB/spec culture with CB bottom bacteria tomorrow, and perform the miniprep on Monday with TF supervision to hopefully troubleshoot some of the problems with low yield.
Also of note is that the bacteria were left on the shaker for approximately 23 hours at the time of miniprep, which is longer than the ideal 12-14 hours.

Primer tag test two
On Friday, we repeated the PCR to test for sub-pool specificity of our primer oligo tags for the chip, using the same PCR protocol.  Today, we ran a gel to see if the results were any different, but alas, they were the same.  It seems that the primers for CB bottom also amplify out the control sequences, which means that our primer tags are not as specific as we thought they were.  The gel can be seen below, with the lanes arranged as follows: CB primer + CB DNA, control primer + CB DNA, control primer + control DNA, and control primer + CB DNA.  We would ideally expect bands in lanes 1 and 3 and no bands in lanes 2 and 4.  However, this was not the case:
PCR repeat results
We might try doing touchdown PCR or raising the annealing temperature to get more specificity in the future.  It may also be worth ordering oligos to represent the other 5 subpools of targets and cross test the primers with each DNA subpool to make sure that the primers are specific enough to pull out only one subpool.  In the end though, this specificity"

In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR P39Q Y42M mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM). For the P39Q Y42M mutant we observed the decrease of the specificity compared to the wild-type tetR sequence.

Abstract
E. coli time manager
We are constructing delay switches to control/preset the timing of target gene expression. Our project uses two classes of bacteria: senders and receivers. Senders produce signaling molecules, and receivers are activated only after a particular concentration of this molecule is reached. The combinatorial use of senders/receivers allows us to make a‘switching consortium’which activates different genes at the preset times.
As signaling molecules, we utilize molecules associated with Quorum sensing, a phenomenon that allows bacteria to communicate with each other. Although different quorum sensing species have slightly different signaling molecules, these molecules are not completely specific to their hosts and cross-species reactivity is observed (1),(2) . Communication using non-endogenous molecules is less sensitive than the original, and requires a higher signal concentration to take effect. This reduced sensitivity results in the slower activation of receivers, thus creating a system in which different receivers are activated after different amounts of time following signaling molecule release.
Introduction
Fig. 1 Burnt popcorn. He could have prevent this if he properly preset the timer...
Many electronic devices we use in our daily lives have the ability to keep track of time. For example, a VCR is able to record a TV program at a pre-set time, and a microwave automatically stops heating after a set amount of time. automatically stop heating when the right time comes. Using these temporal pre-programming functions, we have been liberated from either staying up late to watch a European soccer game or from worrying about our popcorn being burned black while yelling and shouting to the match we have videotaped. In this way, the timer function has revolutionized our lifestyle.
We thought the same applies to the biotechnology; we would like to freely implement the 'timer switches” to various biological functions, preferably both independently and in parallel format. These “functions” include sensors, synthesizers, or degraders of bioactive compounds/ materials, transportation and secretion machineries, communications, getting/ sticking together, proliferation and cell death. If successful, we will be able to program exceedingly more complex complex behaviors in cellular systems.

Although the accumulation of toxic tailings is a prevalent challenge in our oil-dependent provincial economy, the environmental concerns they present is a global issue. Their pollution of surrounding water bodies, prolonged damage to aquatic biodiversity, and ever-increasing size are especially detrimental to the global sustainable development effort. Successful implementation of our project will, therefore, benefit both our local industries and the global community.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Human Practices Overview
Protocol Model Development
The initial work on how we would represent a protocol in our database involved comparing our preliminary model with a variety of different protocols as well as interviewing our advisers for an intended end user opinion on the matter.
Standard Protocol Format
Opened discussion with OpenWetWare and Protocols.io to develop a protocol file format to simplify the sharing of protocols between online protocol repositories."
Cork_Ireland,2015,Team:Cork Ireland#achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," on the equipment and reagents they had and whether they believed such a detector was a viable and sustainable tool.    We considered this in the design of our prototype and what to include in kits sent to TCD & UCL labs.
Also while in Malawi, Donnchadh evaluated resources in the lab and what diagnostics tests are available to patients of that hospital.    The issue of social justice arose as gaps were clear between the hospital described by Biomedical Scientist with experience working    in Ireland, Dr. Brigid Lucey, and that described by the Malawi biomedical scientists. Our project aims to bring first class molecular    diagnostics to areas where it currently is not by providing an alternative to expensive equipment such as PCR machines. With this in mind,    we designed our kits to be low cost, easy to ship and practical for use in labs which may be small and under-resourced.
Knowledge of  synthetic biology was also limited in Malawi and this may hinder acceptance of our detector. To address this, Donnchadh    explained our project and gave detail on what exactly synthetic biology is to workers in the hospital lab. We also learned of a culture    of seeking medical care from witch doctors in Malawi. Donnchadh explained the concept of synthetic biology to this figure in the community    where he worked, and got her approval of this and an acknowledgment that other advancements in science and medicine can aid in healing also.

Environmental Impact
Mycelium-Based Packaging vs. Current Products
Recent reports on polystyrene production demonstrate the increasing demand for environmentally friendly substitutes [1]. We hope to encourage this trend by facilitating improvements upon Ecovative's existing material. To compare the eco-friendly material to its competitors, we used a rubric created by the Colorado Mycological Society that encourages researchers to develop a biodegradable substitute to harmful disposable products [2]. The areas we researched include product toxicity, raw material toxicity, carbon footprint, biodegradability, and sustainability. Based on the following chart, it is clear that the environmental impact of the fungal product is negligible compared to that of current mainstream materials.
By genetically engineering the fungi used in the material, we will make the manufacturing process more efficient and, as a result, decrease the energy required to make the product.
Comprehensive Environmental Assessment
As scientists, we are often inclined to reduce complex procedures down to simple, step-by-step protocols. Assessing risk and evaluating environmental impact are no exception; our goal this year was to utilize a universal checklist that every environmental iGEM project could fulfill in order to ensure environmental safety, the idea being that we could easily and systematically find answers to questions of environmental safety in scientific literature. We followed the approach from our project last year: Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA).
CEA differs from traditional methods of risk assessment by recognizing that risk assessment is fundamentally a decision-making process in which scientists, experts, and the public should be engaged. The goal is to foster transparent discussion and use collective judgement to evaluate limitations and trade-offs in order to arrive at holistic conclusions about the primary issues that researchers should address in their research planning ["

Overview on Collaborations
This year, our team actively collaborated with two iGEM teams in China, which are the team Tsinghua-A from Tsinghua University and the JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University. The team Tsinghua-A focused on constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measuring the capacity of parallel information channels. Our team members, Lechen Qian and Haolong Zhu, helped them to gain access to a better home-built computation platform, applied their knowledge to modify and operate the algorithm, and scanned two key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant) relevant to their modeling project in use of Gillespie Algorithm. In addition, we also helped JSNU-China from Jiangsu Normal University to culture a hela cell clone (the ninth generation) in our culture facility, which later on became an indivisible part in their project and gave them new thinking about utilizing new cell lines. We also benefited a lot through multiple interactions with the two teams during team collaboration. For example, the wiki-design team at Tsinghua-A depicted a brief mechanism of our project in a cartoon style to better illustrate our biofilm-interfaced hydrogen-producing platform. Their help has also provided us inspiration to design our own big picture later on.
Besides, to further propagandize the iGEM as well as synthetic biology, the iGEM Day for the Public Interests (iPDI) was established this year alone with the start-up of the first-ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech. For this year's iDPI, our team organized a Lab Open House Day in relation to the Shanghai Concordia International School. Inspired by our speeches and the lab visiting, some of the students demonstrated strong curiosity to the iGEM and synthetic biology. Therefore, we were now assiting them to build up their first-ever high school team for the futrue iGEMs. Our team will keep supervising them. Click here for more details about our collaborations with future member in the iGEM community.

This is the simplest job, since the VEGF & VEGF antibody complex structure have been texted by X-ray diffraction. That means the interface of those two proteins has been determined. What we have to do is just remolding the amino acid sequence to have a stronger binding affinity. However, this is the best chance to test RosettaDock, since we have got the correct response. After 5000 times of global docking, we finally chose a best structure, in consideration of total energy, binding energy and interface (Antibodies have stationary interface, CDRs). Then, another 1000 times of local docking was operated. (see more from principles )
Figure 2. Docked structure compared to crystal structure
(RMSD= 6.030 Å)
(A) Crystal structure
(B) Docked structure
Finally, we have got a not-so-bad docked structure. As Figure 2 shows, the docked structure has only minor difference compared to the crystal structure.
Next step is sequence design of the VEGF-scFv. With 200 rounds of sequence design of the CDR loop by RosettaAntibodyDesign, we finally mutated 4 residues on the heavy chain: (using AHo Scheme numbering)
Thr-59 → Val
Tyr-69 → Glu
Leu-113 → Trp
Tyr-134 → Phe
The Thr-59 and Tyr-69 belongs to CDR H2, while Leu"

Project Goals
Develop the prototype of an easily an automated liquid handling system that satisfy the following constraints
Low Cost – Cost significantly lower than $10,000.
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible
Hardware Design that is easily replicable  by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM team.
Achievements of Goals
We have developed BioBrick-A-Bot Model C, which satisfy all the goals listed above, as follows
Low Cost – Cost under $700. Require 2 NXT Kit ($278 each), Wooden Frame ($30 materials) and RobotC ($50).
Hardware Platform – We selected Lego Mindstorm NXT Kit which is the industrial standard  and is easily available.
Hardware Design – We provide detail instructions of how BioBrick-A-Bot is built, so that other iGEM team can build it.  We checked in the Hardware Design document into iGEM registry.
Software Design is robust, plug and play. We introduce a new concept called LegoBioBrick which consist of a LegoNXT Brick connected to 1-3 motors, doing a specific  tasks in BioBrick assembly. The software should be flexible enough to plug-and-playmultiple LegoBioBrick instances build by different iGEM teams, with different physical dimensions and geometric dimensions. 2 prototype instances, ALPHA-120 and ALPHA-90 are developed to proof the point.
We implemented BioBrick-A-Bot using 2 LegoBioBrick modules ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a frame BETA which can communicate well with each other using Master Slave Synchornization.  A demonstration of its functionality by transferring colored dyes on a 96-well plate is provided. We made the software open-source, so that other iGEM team can easily replicate BioBrick-A-Bot or extend its functionality by adding additional modules. In the next version of (BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0) we will also add another module called MU, which is a Movement Utility.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," accumulates and naturally exports acetate, which can in turn be used by E. coli for biomass and product formation.
Safety Considerations
Public concern of outbreak by GMO’s is a real issue. The large-scale industrial application of our consortium of GMO’s would, if anything, only increase such concerns. For that reason, we have decided to implement a safety switch in our genetic designs, allowing the Synechocystis and E. coli to thrive when together, but not separately. In our consortium, E. coli is already dependent on Synechocystis, from which it receives the carbon it requires to grow. In addition to that, we also engineered Synechocystis to be fully dependent on E. coli via an amino acid auxotrophy. This means that we use a Synechocystis knock-out strain that is unable to synthesise one of its essential amino acids, which it requires for growth. Only when supplied with the amino acid externally, which it in this case receives from our E. coli strain, engineered to produce and share the same amino acid, can it grow. This way, we ensure that our consortium functions only in its appropriate context, hopefully alleviating some of the concerns regarding GMO’s.
Consortium organization
Our project focusses on the creation of a stable, self-sustaining enabling technology for biorefineries in the form of a phototrophic-driven consortium. Although we will not be able to actually construct a biorefinery of the type that could be implemented in industrial applications, our consortium would ultimately inhabit the compartments of a biorefinery where conditions are optimized for stable product formation. There are several ways in which to operate such a synthetic consortium in a refiner. Of course, the specifics of the biorefinery and its organisation depend largely on the actual application in which it is used (see application scenarios below). Yet it is worthwhile to consider the two most basic options - a single compartment for both species, our initial idea, versus separate compartments for both species -  in order to highlight the way practical imperatives can constrain biorefinery design options. These considerations, which shaped our outlook on the final implementation of our biorefinery in significant ways, are based largely on discussions we had with Professor Atsumi from UC Davis, head of one of the most prominent research groups in the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for bioproduction.
Our initial idea was that, in the biorefineries’ ultimate embodiment, Synechocystis and E. coli would simply live together in the same compartment."

The Brauer Group: Jeffrey worked with Benjamin Huang as part of the Brauer Group. They were in charge of the light regulation aspect of the WashU iGEM project. Ben and Jeffrey spent most of the summer cloning and testing the light regulated transcription elements.
Ben also spent a significant amount of time coding and making the team wiki page look pretty awesome. He did most of the coding for the site through self-learning of html and often sought Google for help involving web design elements. He did not use any outside resources or companies to code the site, but borrowed inspiration and snippets of code from previous iGEM teams: in particular 2013 WLC-Milwaukee, 2013 TMU-Tokyo, and 2012 WashU. He also began work on the kinetic model system of the light regulation system. He continued cloning work during the school year, along with taking over organization of the team and keeping up with the many deadlines when Jeffrey went abroad.
Jeffrey worked on managing the team, setting up meetings, and having conversations with the school administration and other iGEM teams. He also worked to create our team apparel.
The Rebstock Group: Caroline Focht worked with Richard Li as part of the Rebstock Group. They were in charge of the plasmid design and Nif activity testing aspect of the WashU iGEM project. Caroline and Richard spent most of their time in summer in protocol development and nitrogen fixation activity testing. They continued running experiments and biobricked during the school year.
Caroline also concentrated on WashU iGEM Outreach program, which produced numerous educational videos, and sought out other iGEM teams for collaborations. She also produced most of our logos and graphics for the website and presentations.
Richard was lab manger of iGEM at Washington University in St. Louis, thus in addition to the wet lab work he was also in charge of fundraising and securing for the project.

Sample preparation and protein loading
5. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min or for up to 60 min for samples that were in pellet form. Avoid boiling samples, because membrane proteins can irreversibly aggregate in SDS at temperatures >50 °C.
6. Mount the gels in the vertical electrophoresis apparatus (see EQUIPMENT), and add anode buffer as the lower electrode buffer and cathode buffer as the upper electrode buffer (anodes and cathodes are commonly marked red and black, respectively, by the suppliers).
7. Load samples under the cathode buffer. Apply 10-μl sample volumes to 0.7 × 5 mm sample wells.For the optimal resolution of peptides of 1–5 kDa, reduce the amount of SDS in the incubation buffers, for example, by fourfold and reduce the volume applied to 5 μl. Reducing the amount of SDS facilitates electrophoretic separation of peptides from the bulk of SDS. To avoid streaking of peptide bands, peptides and bulk SDS must be separated before the faster-migrating bulk SDS and the peptides immediately following reach the separating gel. The sample volume applied for Tricine–SDS-PAGE should not substantially exceed 10 μl, because stacking of proteins in the range 20–100 kDa is less efficient than in Laemmli–SDS-PAGE.
Electrophoresis conditions
8. Set running conditions appropriate to your type of gel; guidance on appropriate running conditions are given in the table below. Start electrophoresis with an initial voltage of 30 V and maintain at this voltage until the sample has completely entered the stacking gel. The next appropriate voltage step can then be applied. The initial current may be as high as 80 mA for a 0.7mm 10% gel. Gels may warm up, but the temperature should not exceed 35–40 °C. Approaching the end of the run, voltage can be gradually increased to shorten the total time of electrophoresis. Fast runs give better results than overnight runs, especially with 10% acrylamide gels. Alternatively, a constant power of 10 W per gel might be set to ensure an even distribution of heat. The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on"

We ran the two plasmids on a gel so that we could gel purify the plasmid backbones. The results showed that we didn't let it digest long enough, so we cut the pieces out and will digest again next week. The results also appeared to show that the two plasmids had been mixed up. What we thought was UV+pACYC184 seemed to be GFP+pBR322 and vice versa.
We purified the HSP that we cut with KpnI and XhoI and eluted with 20μL. It's concentration was 16.4ng/μL. We also purified our PCR HSP g-blcok control and eluted with 50μL.It's concentration was 36.5ng/μL.

Hello :) My name is Mark Lea, I am in Grade 12 and I go to Chinook High School. I am really glad that I have had the opportunity to participate in our iGEM project this year! Originally, I wanted to focus on the wiki design and coding, but I have found that I am very interested in wet lab and mathematical modelling. I have learned a lot this season, and it has even influenced what I want to study for my undergraduate degree. Currently the degree that interests me is Biochemistry (Biology AND Chemistry!!?), and in the future I would like to pursue a career in Medicine. Outside of iGEM I enjoy playing piano, volunteering, listening to music, drawing and reading anything!

TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Safety#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," researches. See for example our future application scenario T cell therapy in which one of our scaffold proteins can function as a kill switch, thus providing safe by design. There are numerous other cases in which our scaffold can work as a tool for safe by design.
Fusicoccin
Fusicoccin is crucial for our scaffold to work as designed. As described in the background information , fusicoccin is a toxin and it is not proven whether it is safe to use or not. Research showed that fusicoccin in a concentration of 12 times larger than the necessary concentration did not cause any measurable negative effects on the HeLa and HEK293T mammalian cell lines.1 To ensure safe use of fusicoccin in bacterial or mammalian cells, more research on its toxicity is still needed.
Risks of our project
Due to the modularity of the scaffold proteins we designed, they can be used for almost every case in which proteins need to be brought together. On one side these possibilities are a great advantage. On the other hand, when everyone can use these scaffold proteins, they might be used for the wrong purposes. To prevent this from happening, permits around genetic modification should be closely monitored to make ensure they are not misused.
An interesting question is whether you could design something that cannot be misused. With the current technology a lot of things can be used against their real purpose. The goal must be to design things in a way this cannot happen. Whether this is possible or to what extent it is possible to check whether it has been successfully done is still unknown.
Used organisms, vectors and antibiotics
Organisms – Several strains of E. coli have been used in this project. For the amplification of plasmids, the plasmids were transformed in Nova Blue (K-12). For the Gibson Assembly, NEB 5-alpha E. coli is used. For the introduction of mutagenesis, plasmids are transformed into XL10-GOLD. For protein expression, the plasmids are transformed into BL21 (DE3). All of these strains belong to the risk group 1, since they are non-pathogenic strains and will not survive long outside the lab.
Vectors -  For our project, we used the pET28a vector, because a lac promotor is built into this plasmid, which makes controlled protein expression possible. For creating the BioBricks of our project we made use of the PSB1C3 vector.
Antibiotics - Different antibiotics are used in order to “kill” bacteria which are not wanted for growing in the cultures"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#VanessaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," produced several cultures that were both dark and light in color. Plasmid preps were made of the dark and light cultures of the UV promoter. The dark culture had an okay amount of DNA concentration. However the other samples did not have a good concentration of DNA either.
There seemed to be contamination or something else growing on the plates because some of the cultures were oddly shaped and there was a pungent smell. As a result, a sample of plasmid prep culture was stained and looked under the microscope. Most samples did not have E. coli in the sample.
Week 2: 6/11-6/17
A second round of plasmid preps were made of the same plates to troubleshoot the cultures that do not have high concentrations of DNA. These unfortunately still did not work or produce anything. Only the UV promoter sample had a culture.
This week the BU Wellesley team is demoing the QIAcube from Quiagen. Plasmid prep of the UV sample was used to start up and learn how to use the QIAcube.
It seems that the problem is the plates with ampicillin. A sub-group of our team were working on putting together the GFP (Bba_J52028) and terminator (backbone, Bba_B0015) to test out various RBS and promoters combinations. Once the GFP and terminator were ligated together, the construct was transformed on a Kanamycin plate. This successfully grew on the plate. Other parts were transformed and grew nicely on the Kanamycin plates. As a result, it is believed that the ampicilling plates are not selecting because there was also a negative control plated with just top 10 cells and there was some growth seen on the plates.
New ampicillin plates were made.
New transformations were made of the 7 original parts chosen and few additional ones (RBS, promoters, RFP). Most of these seem to grow successfully, however 2 plates had cultures with a  pink tint to them. There was one plate where nothing grew on it. There was also two negative controls for ampicillin plates and kanamycin plates, where nothing grew. Plasmid preps of the new transformations were made.

2. Add then appropriate amounts of 10x Buffer and T4 DNA Ligase. Make sure not to pipette up and down or vortex to mix, this will shear the ligase. Gently swirl with the tip of your pipette to mix.
3. Incubate reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. After incubation heat inactivate the ligase by another incubation at 80o C for 20 min.
NOTE: The ligase buffer should smell like wet dog. If you smell nothing from the tube, then the buffer is old and useless.
Can also use the Ginkgo Bioworks protocol:
1. Get the 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer and the T4 DNA ligase from the 20 degree storage.
2. Put them on ice to thaw.
3. In a PCR tube add 11 uL of water.
4. Add 2 uL of each digest to the tube.
5. Use a pipet to thoroughly mix the T4 DNA ligase buffer and resuspend the precipitate in the bottom. Then add 2 uL to the PCR tube.
6. Add 1 uL of T4 DNA ligase.
7. Flick the tube to mix it. If necessary, put it in the microcentrifuge to get all the liquid back to the bottom.

Synthetic Peptides
Peptides were obtained by solid-phase synthesis using the Fmoc strategy. Cleavable TentaGel® R RAM from Rapp Polymers was used for synthesis. Deprotection of the Fmoc-protected amino group on the surface of the TentaGel®-Resin was performed with 20 % piperidine in dimethylformamide (2x15 min).
Figure 1: Mechanism for the deprotection of Fmoc-protected amines
Cysteine was activated with HBTU (0.97 eq.) and added twice in 5-fold excess. The product was washed 5 times in DMF and 2 times in dichloromethane (DCM). Deprotection of the Fmoc-protected amino group of the coupled cysteine was performed like the deprotection of the TentaGel®-Resin. HBTU (0.97 eq.) activated lysine (Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH) was coupled twice in 3-fold excess, with the second coupling taking place overnight. The 4-methyltrityl (Mtt) protection group was removed by washing the resin with 1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM with gravity flow. Carboxyfluorescein was activated with HBTU (0.97 eq.) and coupled twice to the free ε-amino group of the lysine, whereas the second coupling occurred overnight. After extensive washing and deprotection of the α-amino group, the synthesis of the tag"

Education & Engagement
A child's mind is an unbiased and enthusiastic one, waiting eagerly for any impressions that come along. Keeping this in mind, our team has worked to inculcate the idea of reduce, reuse, and recycle in young inheritors. As part of our team's efforts to publicize science, especially about applying the concepts of synthetic biology tools towards addressing real world challenges, we organized talks and demonstrations on our institution's foundation day. We educated school and college students, showcasing applications of synthetic biology towards improving the standard of living through presentations and conducting plantation drives. We received several enthusiastic responses and returned inspired and rejuvenated by their thought provoking questions. Thus, we quote that ""If a child can't learn the way we teach, then maybe we should teach the way they learn.""
Student Awareness
Talk by Prof. Ram Mohan at IISER Mohali
The job of spreading awareness always starts from home. The talk was successfully organized together by BDF, Curie Club and iGEM2017 team on 08-09-2017, 09:00 PM in LH3 by Prof. Ram Mohan. The talk was accessible to all age groups.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations from all subjects were included for kindling the flame of science in students. The iGEM team also included its theme of waste management in the Biology section of demonstrations by showcasing them a bookshelf made of discarded plastic bottles.

Testing Team Heidelbergs pSBX-vectors
The iGEM team Heidelberg constructed a set of expression vectors that contain a T7 promoter prior to the BioBrick prefix. This way RBS-CDS parts can be cloned into the vectors by standard BioBrick assembly and then expressed in BL21(DE3) by induction with IPTG.
Heidelberg X-press vector design
The iGEM Team Heidelberg created new expression vectors with an integrated T7 Promoter
In collaboration with the iGEM Team Heidelberg the iGEM Team Aachen tested 8 of these vectors for their expression capabilities.
We successfully cloned and expressed one of our fusion proteins K139020 in a pSBX1A3 vector. You can read more about the background of this expression on the Galectin-3 page .

In addition, we decided to use BioBricks from previous and current teams and attach them to our construct, as well as creating composite parts, which would     be compatible with our flexosome or any other construct containing the corresponding cohesin domains. We collaborated on this with Aachen and also utilised     some previous parts from Uppsala (2011).
In the end we were able to design a basic part containing the Bacteroides cellulolyticus dockerin domain, and a composite part containing the same     domain together with eforRed from Team Uppsala 2011. For further information please refer to the registry or our Parts section.
