Background
DN is the largest single cause of ESRD in many developed countries and will continue to be the                         leading cause of death in diabetes mellitus. DN occurs in 20% to 40% of all patients with type 2                         diabetes mellitus, accounting for approximately 50% of cases in the developed countries.[1] The                         costs of care for people with DKD are extraordinarily high. In the Medicare population alone,                         DKD-related expenditures among this mostly older group were nearly $25 billion in 2011.[2] In                         China, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy is also increasing at an alarming rate due to the rapid                         increase of diabetes prevalence and low awareness rate. As the initial symptoms of chronic                         nephropathy are very secretive, hypertension, urinary protein, edema and other obvious symptoms have                         entered the stage of clinical diabetic nephropathy or dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).                         Furthermore, patients often fail to go to the hospital for examination, so patients with diabetic                         nephropathy often miss the optimal intervention period. Failure to intervene early can lead to a                         dramatic deterioration in kidney function and a 90 per cent mortality rate. However, if the renal                         status of patients can be monitored at any time, the reversion rate can be as high as 70% if                         intervention is carried out before stage iii of diabetic nephropathy (incipientDN).
At present, urinary microalbumin (mALB) excretion rate is mainly used to diagnose diabetic                         nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the following                         disadvantages:
The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and factors such as urinary                             tract infection can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, leading to misdiagnosis and                             missed diagnosis.
When mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to stage iii, and at this time, the patient's GBM                             thickening and mesangial matrix increase are more obvious, and there are already glomerular                             nodules and diffuse lesions as well as small artery hyaline changes, and the glomeruli have                             become dilapidated.
Han-Henrik Parving said, ""Microalbuminuria may not be as sensitive and specific a predictor of diabetic                         nephropathy as previously suggested. Other markers of risk for diabetic nephropathy are needed for                         optimal clinical management.""[3] Studies have shown that the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients                         with beta2 microglobulin"
StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," the NCBI database. Specifically, the exon sequence for Ca+2-binding protein CBP86 form VII was optimized for synthesis, again in E. coli. The same computer setup was used, and DoubleOptimizer was run for the default 10 seconds:
In this case, the sequence went from being over 47% composed of repetitive sequences 8 nucleotides or more in length to being completely non-repetitive. Also, the codon usage distribution is now a near-perfect match to the E. coli codon usage distribution.
Algorithm
DoubleOptimizer uses a genetic optimization algorithm.[4] This algorithm mimics natural selection by taking the original gene sequence and generating several variants by copying the sequence and creating random silent point mutations in each copy. Each variant is then assigned a fitness score based on its repetitiveness and closeness-of-fit to the desired codon usage distribution, and the most fit variants are kept. These are then re-copied, re-mutated and re-scored, and again only the most fit variants are kept, through several thousand rounds of selection. When optimization time runs out, the most fit member of the population after the final round of selection is displayed.
One challenge in implementing this algorithm efficiently is that scoring for repetitiveness is a time-consuming process (the time belongs to O(n2) in the length of the sequence). Because many thousands of sequences are scored in a single optimization, finding a way to reduce the computational burden of this step was a task of paramount importance. Our solution was to store for each sequence a matrix representing the locations in the sequence where repetitions are already known to occur, and to only attempt to add or remove repetitions that could by affected by the point mutations that were made. This significantly improved run-time, compared to the unsophisticated technique of independently re-scoring each modified sequence.

We intended to use the 15 of the 20 Anderson Promoters available in the iGEM distribution kit, in standard pSB1C3 backbone with chloramphenicol resistance. This would create a library of strains applicable for measuring promoter strength.
The following promoters were sucessfully inserted in front of Spinach2.1 and the constructs verified by sequencing:
BBa_J23101
BBa_J23102
BBa_J23103
BBa_J23106

As the list indicates 9 constructs out of the 15 were successfully constructed. These constructs were stocked to be used for future measurement of promoter activity.
Standard series for DFHBI-1T
A standard series was created to correlate a Spinach-DFHBI-1T complex concentration to a specific flourescence signal. Since we discovered that DFHBI-1T itself caused small amounts of fluorescence, we started by measuring this. To find the background fluorescence associated with unbound DFHBI-1T, a standard curve was made as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: The graph shows the correlation between DFHBI-1T concentration and fluorescence, in the absence of any Spinach RNA.
We found the slope of the curve to be 0.12 µM-1, and have thereby obtained a value for the fluorescence which a given concentration of unbound DFHBI-1T is responsible for.
To generate the Spinach2.1-DFHBI-1T standard series, fluorescence was measured with different concentrations of DFHBI-1T, in the presence of excess Spinach2.1 RNA. 5 measurements were made for each concentration. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: The graph shows the correlation between DFHBI-1T concentration and fluorescence in the presence of excess Spinach2.1. The background fluorescence for unbound DFHBI-1T is subtracted. The relation can be used to calculate the concentration of Spinach2.1-DFHBI-1T complex.
The slope of the curve in Figure 4 was determined to be 1.00 µM-1 and the intercept was found to be 0.78.
We have thereby generated a standard curve that can correlate the observed fluorescence signal to the concentration"

Radiation Biology
When bacterial cells are damaged by ionizing radiation they can be damaged in many ways. We will highlight how these cells can be damaged, what chemical reactions are doing the damage and how cells can protect themselves before and increase repair afterward to increase cell survival of acute radiation.
Normal Cell Function
The prokaryotic cell carries on as if it were a normal day. The DNA, the string of code with information to direct the cell’s daily activities, floats freely in the cytoplasm. It allows itself to be transcribed by the RNA into proteins, which reside casually in the cytoplasm, the intracellular environment of the cell.
Damage to the DNA and Proteins
The cell is hit repeatedly with radiation, causing extensive damage to the DNA and proteins. The damage to the DNA includes:
1. Base Damage
DNA is composed of a backbone attached to nucleobases. Damage may occur to the bases.
2. Single Strand Breaks
The backbone of DNA is made up of a repeating pattern of sugar and phosphate. A single strand break occurs when this backbone is broken.
3. Double Strand Breaks
DNA is commonly found as a double strand. If the opposing strands both develop single strand breaks, this double strand break may cause the separation of the two fragments of DNA.
Damage to the protein may include damage to the active site of ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase.
Ionizing radiation is radiation with sufficient energy to remove an electron from an atom.
It has the power to cause Double Strand Breaks, as well as initiate the Fenton Reaction, which can cause damage to proteins as well as DNA.
Fenton Chemistry results in the production of a hydroxyl radical through the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron by means of hydrogen peroxide.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid pET21 (Novagen) and the B0015 terminator, and a modular cloning strategy was used to build the complete genes in pSB1C3. As the T7 promoter contains an XbaI site the complete genes have not been submitted to the iGEM registry. Instead the coding sequences, in pSB1C3, have been submitted for future teams to use with their own chosen promoters.
Expression was confirmed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). We also expressed a GFP lacking a signal peptide as a control to verify that it was the signal peptide, not GFP itself, that is responsible for transferring to the periplasm. The cell preparation for the periplasm Western blot involved cell fractionation in order to isolate the periplasmic fraction for the assay. The cytoplasm Western blot was performed using an iBind membrane protocol .
Figure 4: Western blot of cyotplasm and periplasm. Expected molecular weights (kDa):
A = 0 | B = 29.90 | C = 29.90 | D = 29.71 | E = 29.03 | F = 29.92 | G = 29.46
Figure 4 shows that GFP expression occurred in all of our seven cultures. GFP lacking the signal peptide is only seen in the cytoplasm as is GFP fused to the signal peptide from N. defluvii. All other signal peptide GFP fusions have been successfully transferred to the periplasm, as demonstrated by the periplasmic Western blot. This indicates our chosen perchlorate reductase and three of our chlorite dismutases should be transported by E. coli's export system into the periplasm.
Chlorite dismutase
Once we had demonstrated that the signal peptides were functional in E. coli, we needed to express the four Cld proteins. We also needed to determine if the enzymes were active and could breakdown chlorite into oxygen and chloride. This helped answer the question:
""Could we express the four enzymes in E. coli, and if so are they active?""
We inserted a His-tag and flanking flexible linkers between the signal peptides and enzyme amino acid sequence of A. suillum Cld; A. oryzae Cld; D. aromatica Cld; and N. defluvii Cld. These were synthesised by IDT along with the T7 promoter from plasmid pET21 (Novagen) and the B0015 terminator, and a modular cloning strategy was used to build the complete genes"

Overview
We introduced Negative Feedback Loop(NFBL) to our control system, which contains three parts - named A, B and C - to ensure the precise control. As shown in Fig.1, part A activates part B, which then upregulates part C. However, part C will repress the expression of the part A.
Although the two-node loop, in which part A activates part C while part C represses part A in return, is enough for a negative feedback, it is more unstable compared to the three-node loop, indicating that it is harder for the output of two-node loop to follow the input owing to the huge fluctuations. The improved performance is resulted from the existence of part B in the three-node feedback loop. By working as a buffer in the system, the output downstream part B is allowed higher sensitivity and fidelity.
Fig.1 Negative feedback loop compared with two-node loop.
Lux is put into our negative feedback loop as the part A. It is reasonable to choose it rather than other induction systems as Lux shows better input-output linearization, which is a good beginning for the output to follow the input.
As the signal has been input to the system by part A, we want to ensure the fast response of the other parts. There is no better choice than the RNA switches, since they do not need to be translated, which save much time. Therefore, STAR and pT181 are introduced to our system as part B and part C.
Besides the fast response of the two parts, they also show advantages on the efficiency. The activation caused by STAR could reach almost 100-fold, which means we could reduce the signal attenuation as much as possible in our system. Meanwhile, the repression of pT181 is 98%. The high repression effect can reduce the inevitable leak as just tiny quantity of it will prevent the expression of part A.
In conclusion, the feedback loop and the parts we choose can ensure not only the fast response of the system, but also the high-fidelity of the output.

Numbers below the sequences indicate cysteine pairs forming disulfide bridges. Boxes below the sequences indicate residues overviewed in 3WMT template: catalytic triad - red, substrate-binding residues - magenta, calcium-coordinating residues - cyan.
Selecting the mutations
Our esterase and our chosen template alignment was refined manually after each homology model generation using MODELLER toolkit. The final structural model of CAT-Seq Esterase was visualised with ICM Browser (Fig. 3).
Figure 3. Homology model of CAT-Seq Esterase.
a) Superposition of the generated homology model (light blue) and the template used (light yellow, PDB ID: 6G21).
b) View of the catalytic triad in the model. Residue coloring: catalytic triad - red, mutation positions - orange, calcium-coordinating residues - cyan. Catalytic residues as well as the mutations are numbered in boxes. Hydrogen bonds in the catalytic triad represented as black dashed lines.
The residues chosen for mutation were scattered around the catalytic triad of the esterase and involved mainly polar and aromatic side chains. In literature, these side chains are assumed to form bonds stabilizing the binding of the substrate.
When selecting the mutations, we have aimed for the polar and aromatic residues in the binding pocket, and mutated them into other synonymous residues to avoid total inactivation of the enzyme, yet ensuring a change in catalytic activity.
These are the following mutations we have chosen:
N107D; G194A; W224Y; K227R; K230R; Y368F; E430D; M431L; R509K; ΔP348-H356
Experimental validation of the CAT-Seq Esterase Mutants
After carefully selecting the mutations in-silico, we have synthesized and measured the Activity of those esterase mutants in the laboratory. The mutations have successfully altered the activity of the original Esterase. Also, there were no cases of complete inactivation of enzyme catalytic activity.

The L.A.S.S.O. Interface
To simulate how the L.A.S.S.O. could be used in the real world we created a software application to accompany the hardware. The L.A.S.S.O. Interface was developed to show how the results gathered by the L.A.S.S.O. could be automatically sent to the relevant people. The graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in Visual C# to interact with a local SQL Database. The database is composed of four tables, with the following columns:
Clinic: Stores the details of a clinic
Medical: Stores the details of a member of medical personnel
Patient: Stores the details of a cystic fibrosis patient
Results: Stores the results of patient tests
The schema diagram of the database is as follows:
As shown in the diagram each entry in the Patient and Medical staff member is related to a clinic. This is to allow for the automatic transfer of data when tests are carried out. The Results table then stores the results of each patient test.
The interface allows for the user to log in as either a patient or member of medical staff (Fig 1.), with each being able to carry out different operations. Once a patient is logged in they are presented with a view that shows them the information that is stored about them (excluding their password) and the information about their clinic (Fig 2.). They can proceed from there to take a test. This will require the L"

Project Summary
The title of our project: ViroCatcher
The Fact: Although traditional medical treatments for viral diseases usually have a high specificity, the treatments will likely fail to cure diseases once viruses mutate.
Our Motivation: Is there any chance to create an universal solution to fight against viral diseases?
Our Strategy: Fight inconsistency with consistency. Counter changing viruses with specific binding.
Our Objective: Use engineered bacteria which are safe for the bloodstream to bind and remove many kinds of viruses.
Our Method: Design bacteria that can catch viruses using constant binding regions between viruses and viral receptors/specific anti-viral antibodies.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," The pH sensitive and glutathione redox state reporting green fluorescent proteins pHLuorin2 (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) and roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . We aim to target them either in the peroxisomal lumen or the cytosol. To achieve peroxisomal targeting we attach the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 with Golden Gate cloning .
Figure 5.1 Level 1 plasmids with medium promotors and uracil auxotrophy. Top left roGFP2 cytosolic. Top right roGFP2 peroxisomal. Bottom left pHLourin2 cytosolic. Bottom right pHLourin2 peroxisomal.
Using promoters with different expression strength in order to find optimal measurement conditions is of high interest. There is a trade off between a high signal-to-noise ratio and self induced effects which are both dependent on expression levels (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . This cannot be generalized for each sensor. For example, pHlourin2 has sparse influence on the existing pH because of the buffer effect of proteins.
Validation of the peroxisomal localization can be achieved via fluorescence overlap of the sensor and a peroxisomal marker in our case pex13-mRuby ( import mechanism ).
Figure 5.2 Level 2 plasmids with peroxisomal marker Peroxin13-mRuby and uracil auxotrophy for colocalization. Left roGFP2 with strong promoter. Right pHLourin2 with strong promotor.
It can also be validated by transforming the sensors attached to the PTS1 sequence into Pex5 knockout yeast strain. The sensor is expected to show no specific localisation, because of the missing import sequence. We calibrate the sensors in living yeast cells and physiological ranges so that we can not only perform relative but also quantitative measurements. We aim to confirm our hypothesis of an more oxidized redox state of roGFP2 in peroxisomes with violacein pathway activity and want to measure differences in pH within yeast strains with peroxisomal membrane anchored pex3-bacteriorhodopsin protein (membrane proteins) .
Once expression and localization of the sensor is proven by microscopy, measurements with a plate reader or a fluorometer are acceptable. This allows a high number of replicates to be measured accurately in reasonable time. Microscopy is performed with a filter based Nikon Eclipse TI fluorescence microscope at 100-fold magnification"

Testing the constructs RBS-NisA-double terminator ( BBa_K1365556 ) and RBS-Superfolded GFP-double terminator ( BBa_K1365555 ) with some different promoter: P2, PLas, and two constitutive promoters ( BBa_J23101 and BBa_J23115 ), and inserting these constructs in pIL253 ( BBa_K1365301 ) vector
 
The ligations of the different constructs were performed overnight, after which the ligated plasmids were transformed to L. lactis NZ9800, and finally a colony PCR was performed with several colonies of each construct
The construct with the P2 and PLas did not show any bands on the gel, therefore further steps were only done with the constructs containing the two constitutive promoters
The same constructs with the promoters from the promoter collection of Uppsala (see September 19 till October 5) were subjected to ligation again, but this time the vector pIL235A was used instead of pSB1K3
These constructs were transformed to L. lactis NZ9800, and plated on M17 agar with erythromycin

Killing h.p.
Our main goal is in this, eradicating from the body Helicobacter pylori that lives as the pathogen with pexiganan, which a powerful new antimicrobial peptide. In our project we use pexiganan to eradicate Helicobacter pylori because the pexiganan molecule has a powerful effect on the pathogen. Furthermore, it doesn't have a toxic effect  on our natural body cells. Pexiganan molecules’ dose for destroying erythrocytes is 250 ng/ml, the other dose for  destroying H.pylori is 16 ng/ml.
In gastric fluid acidic pH conditions, the peptide degradation speed is very high; Pepsine, the stomach’s main digestion enzyme, crushes all of the peptide structure molecules; the drug taken for gastric fluid has a very short lifetime. These are all reasons that make it difficult to set an effective dose.
Because of this reason, in our project we aim to start pexiganan synthesis only with the maximum closest reach.
We also aim to produce enough pexiganan molecules to eradicate all of the h. pylori population in the stomach.
In line with our aims;
1. With the parts described previously, our synthetic bacteria will enter into the mucosa layer where the h.pylori is in stomach.
2. We use E.coli in our treatment to continuously product DAMP-Pexiganan molecules. These continuously produce and accumulate proteins that don't have any lethal effects to the cells. Hence, DAMP-Pexiganan molecule’s active site is shut down by DAMP.( TEV protease recognition site located between the DAMP and Pexiganan molecules.) Thus, it goes to the area where Helicobacter pylori is in the stomach until the pathogen detects pexigan molecules  created by E.coli and that allow E.coli's ability to remain alive until producing enough pexiganan.
3. Due to the presence of H. pylori in the environment, extremely high concentrations of NH3 and Al2 molecules induce AND GATE the system. As a result of this activation, TEV protease molecules will be produced. The produced TEV Protease break the large amount of connections accumulated between DAMP and Pexiganan in the cells and releases pexiganan molecules. These pexiganan molecules are active lysis molecules that cause cells to splinter. For this reason,"

BBa_K1508003 (IIA(Glc) + double terminator)
This biobrick contains gene coding for  IIA(Glc) (BBa_K1508002), followed by double terminator (BBa_B0015). IIA(Glc) is glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS). This circuit inserted to the upstream part of plasmid Bba_J04450. We hypothesized that by over-expressing the enzyme, more glucose can be uptook compared to normal condition.
Coding
BBa_K1508002 (IIA(Glc) - E.coli glucose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA)
Phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a major carbohydrate active -transport system, which is executed by a cascade of protein rally. For glucose uptake, IIA(Glc) is the only enzyme specific to glucose transport. We measure the concentration of glucose in the medium using catabolite repression mechanism toward lacI promoter activity upstream of a reporter gene, mRFP. We expect by over-expressing IIA(Glc) in E. coli, we will obtain different range of glucose standard curve in our measurement system.

2. Affibody expression in human cancer cells
Affibody-AAV was produced [link to protocol of virus production], and used for transduction of human cancer cell line (HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line].
As the Affibody was predesigned to include 3xFLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) in its sequence, we used anti-FLAG-specific primary antibody to specifically detect the protein using immunofluorescence.
Results
Conclusion and future aspects
Affibody construct could be successfully expressed in human cancer cells on cell membrane.                 In the future, the Affibody could be expressed exclusively in cancer cells using our Boomerang approach using dCas9-VP64-gRNA system under the control of cancer-specific promoters.

France-Aix-Maseille, Questioner
Aix-Marseille Université (France), propose a collaboration. They needed to collect a lot of information about chewing-gum and GMOs around the world.                  They prepared a small survey, and we went to the country streets and interviewed random people.                 It was a fun challenge. We received a gold badge for our help.
Aix-Marseille project idea:
""Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific engines are used but they are heavy and expensive. The time required for its use is long and they need a large quantity of water. Besides economical aspects, chewing gums have an environmental impact. They are dangerous for the wildlife such as birds. Indeed, believing that it is bread, they eat chewing gums and choke. Regarding these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally- responsible way to sanitize our streets.""

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#mb9_-_-_TEXT.html," is employed as the main chassis for our prior design on the DNA sequence, stem-loop and enzyme. As a matter of fact, when using hairpin and Csy4 enzyme to tune the expression of genes, it is relatively safe for industrialized applications and scientific research. In our project, all parts we have utilized are selected from Risk Group 1, none of which are with a Red Flag. As for microbial organisms, the microbial organisms have no chances to escape from our laboratory because we use ultraviolet sterilization after experiments. Furthermore, all equipment used for recombination strains will be sterilized by High-Pressure Steam Sterilization Pot.
3.Biosafety lab work
Our cautiousness about experiments makes it even impossible for classis to escape. Every week, we do a thorough laboratory cleaning, including spraying alcohol and disinfectant to sterilize. Every day we check all the instruments and strains in our lab. For the lack of nutrition, recombinant strains cannot survive outside the lab. What's more, the teacher responsible for laboratory safety checks our safety work every week. And we are certain that everything we did is under our control.
Fig.1 We have strict safety regulations and safe operation.
4. Biosafety education
We organized a summer camp to popularize life science with middle school students, and teach them basic microbial experimental operations such as butterfly specimens, microbial painting and plasmid extraction. More importantly, we explained the safety of laboratories to them before entering the laboratory in order to raise their biosafety awareness. No experiment carries zero risk to the experimenters, so we must learn how to protect ourselves. Before each experiment, they were educated to be equipped with some necessary facilities, such as latex gloves, nitrile gloves, goggles and lab coats to protect them from biotic and abiotic hazards. Undoubtedly, safety is always in the first place for us.

Establish links between project and stakeholders
1. Integration with labs
The purpose of our project is to regulate the expression of a target gene with the help of miniToe structure which is composed of endoribonuclease Cys4 and hairpins. Initially, we just wanted to realize the regulation of one gene expression. By establishing dialogues with labs, we found the limitations of our thoughts. Thankfully, enlightened by Professor Liang in Ocean university of China and Professor Du in Institiue of microbiology, we changed our initial thoughts and extended the expression gradients of target gene by model prediction and mutation of hairpins and Cys4."

2012 iGEM 4th meeting - May 7, 2012
1. iGEM Asia jamboree
- Oct 5 ~ 7, at HKUST, Hongkong.
2. Shared research info done about previous ideas and discussed about it
I) Dohoon Kwon : will upload his on the website (cafe).
II) Jeongmin Lee : Heat releasing bacteria
- Heat releasing bacteria used in massage were based on fermentation of bacteria. Giving sawdust as a carbon source, and adding some enzymes related to fermentation will produce heat. (enough to feel warmth)  But boiler using this method is under patent, so it is required to find other applications.
III) Jihoon Jung : Logic circuit adopting channel rhodopsin
- Searched whether the idea has been already covered by previous iGEM teams. Confirmed that no team in 2011 iGEM has dealt with the idea. Will search more in 2010, 2009 iGEM teams
IV) Sanghoon Han : Display system using bacteria (adopting magnetosome)
- 2011 iGEM Washington team already carried out a magnetosome toolkit design. More research required and will figure out how to apply their toolkit in this idea. Confirmed using magnetosome system in E.coli is possible.  It is still confusing how to arrange bacteria in certain direction in response to electric field, without moving bacteria distributed in 2D plate since magnetosome is for magnetotaxis, which literally refers 'taxis'.
V) Hyunkee Kim : Bateria detecting herbicides
- Detection using tfa4 gene product. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid has structural similarity to IAA and therefore is used as an herbicide to a dicotyledon.  Design an operon using promoter of tfa4 gene to sense 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and use fluorescent gene as a reporter gene.
3. Teams for further development of some ideas above and suggested idea from advisors
- Display system team : Sanghoon Han, Kyeongwoo Jang
- Logic circuit team : Jihoon Jung, Jeongmin Lee
- herbicide team : Hyunkee Kim, Dohoon Kwon
- Producing pearl : Jihyong Nam, Kye"

This does not include potential revenue from other water management sources for oil and gas, only mandated sources provided from Environment Canada legislation.
In order to achieve this market capture, an early customer must be identified, as discussed earlier in the selling activities section. Six major companies dominate the majority of water quality sensing and monitoring including HydroQual Laboratories, which is responsible for a large percentage of the water toxicology sensing done for oil and gas companies. We are in the process of establishing partnerships with companies such as HydroQual Laboratories to ensure that we can capture this part of the market.
Marketing Activities
Once we have developed a working prototype and begin manufacturing our product, we require a market strategy to implement delivery of our product. The market is composed of a large number of small companies who may have interest in purchasing this product. Therefore, direct distribution will be the easiest means to release our product to the market.
These price points allow for maximum profitability while maintaining a competitive advantage in cost against our competitors. The lower cost of the device also opens our market to not only target large service providers such as Golder Associates, HydroQual Laboratories, and A&L Consulting, but also smaller firms and laboratories who are more greatly impacted by product price point.
We plan to advertise our product through government regulatory bodies as these institutions will dictate the acceptance of our technology in the marketplace. Our initial market strategy involves the adoption of our technology in the oil and gas sector in Alberta. This will be followed by efforts to include the remainder of Canada, targeting other mining operations including precious metals, coal, etc. and further into North America by penetrating markets in the USA.
Our company’s strategy is to be more than a field service company. The current water monitoring field is dominated by hundreds of small service based consulting companies.  This provides easy entry but allows for limited growth in this highly competitive space. In contrast, we see ourselves fitting into oil sand providers present monitoring frameworks giving us a competitive edge over present service company models. This allows for us to penetrate more of the market, reducing potential competitors that we might have faced.
Expansion into other Markets
With a versatile technological platform, we hope to be able to transition easily into other markets. This could be advantageous in terms of expanding our profit potential with second and third generation products, or it could be advantageous should we run into insurmountable hurdles in accessing our first market. Examples of such markets could include:

Apoptosis Induction
Title: Validation of pMLPm activation with dCas9-VP64-gRNA and induction of apoptosis in C8-D30 astrocyte cells
Conducted by: Liat Tsoran, Mor Pasi and Ori Tulchinsky
Date: 30/9/18-14/10/18
Aim: In this experiment we wanted to test the activity and efficiency of our synthetic engineered system that should induce apoptotic death by the activation of the synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) via dCAs9-VP64-gRNA complex that is expressed by A1 reactive astrocyte specific promoters.
Importance: In the astrocyte pathway we aimed to eliminate only A1 reactive astrocyte by triggering apoptotic death, while maintaining the resting cells in the central bervous system (CNS) intact. In this experiment we wanted to test the effectiveness of our enginnered system, in which, dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex that is expressed under the regulation of A1 reactive astrocyte specific markers, can activate the pMLPm"
UESTC,2013,Team:UESTC#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Sunday  May 19, 2013
This discussion is mainly on software and biobricks as well as the CLOTHO platform. We talked about the ideas of the software finished by the team Wellesley_HCT_2012, UTP_Software_2012 and USTC_Software_2012 and their advantages, disadvantages and use value, which are inspiring to our own projects.
Wednesday  May 22, 2013
We talked about the software MGEC finished by the team Edinburgh _2008, which was designed for biologists to establish genetic engineering circuit model more easily based on modeling and data analysis. Another piece of software we discussed is BioBrick Manager_2010 which is mainly designed to connect Biobrick parts, and then to save as XML file. We also analyzed their disadvantages that need to be improved.
Friday  May 24, 2013
In this meeting, we discussed some pieces of software of the iGEM competitions before. For examples, Synthetic Biology Simulation Software: measuring the efficiency of the terminator; Digital Synthetic Gene Circuit Software (which can not perform large-scale optimization), then we thought about what we can do about it. USTC 2012 Software: Anti-circuit design was also introduced.. This time, we discussed a relatively new paper on anti-SD sequence, and the question that whether we can create a piece of software on codon optimization. So after the meeting, we should research this literature intensively to understand how to use the anti-SD sequence to achieve codon optimization and whether someone has already done similar software. Then we should study the corresponding data on RBS site, and grasp the information from compared sequences. More details will be finalized in next meeting.
Sunday  May 26, 2013
Today, we continued to discuss some software. Such as Tinker Cell which is a synthetic biology CAD software, in which analysis and biological networks are visualized by third-party C or C + + as well as python modules. And CAD tools, databases, a rule of network Design and a language Kera, GenoCAD, and network concepts were also introduced by different team members. Finally, we summarized the software discussed and drew some conclusions for our projects.
Friday  May 29, 2013
CLOTHO platform is a way that can be considered for making software. Also we discussed M4B (with its network structures, including a relatively new scoring rules for parts), and Synbioss. And we studied the python scripting language. This time, a new idea was proposed by Xiaonan"

Moreover, I am still concerned with our project. It seems as we are just doing what the Maranas group has already done with the OptStrain (OptStrain: a computational framework for redesign of microbial production systems. {Maranas 2004}). It seems like they have already done what we have done but their code is in GAMMS and isn't an open source program. Hopefully when our program is done, we will have some awesome cool features.

Last week I had the MCATS so I took a little break, but now I'm back. I've been trying to learn python and have been following Dr Bhalerao's book, ""Python Cookbook"".  My goal is to finish the book by the end of the week and learn some cool stuff. I will also refer to another book that I have torrented (shhh!, downloaded), ""Programming Python"".  I have also been messing around with the Kegg API and tried to figure out how it works.
Riyad This week I learned a good deal about making stand alone matlab functions. This would allow us to use the COBRA functions outside of a matlab environment. I also started doing research into the S-matrix and found some matlab functions that might come into future use. I continued to get familiar with python and made a random letter generator that spits out ""A"" ""T"" ""C"" and ""G"" ,randomly... It was fun to make but not sure how practical it is

This week has been very exciting in terms of coding and programming.  I had fun learning about dictionaries and how to make them and use them in Python.  I was also able to manipulate the Kegg database in a number of ways through the KEGG API. Looking through the KEGG API, there are many commands, such as get_reactions_by_enzyme, and get_enzymes_by_compound.  However, I realized there is no command to get_reactions_by_organism.  Since our program will go from compound A to compound B through the various reactions listed on KEGG, I felt this type of function would be very useful to us.  This would be useful in determining a host organism by seeing which organisms each reaction can take place"

Last year,our project AlkSensor won the gold medal and Best Poster award. This year we form a team of 16 students from different majors of the school of chemical engineering. Not only seeking help from our instructor, we are planning to launch a series of interchange activities with other teams and Chinese Academy of Sciences. We also pay a lot of attention to team building. Creating a comfortable atmosphere and maintaining a stable and amicable relationship are also crucial for a successful team work.

Materials
A variety of materials were considered for the fabrication of the incubation chamber.  For the outer and inner shell, it was necessary to use a material that was easily cleaned and maintained.  The inner shell needed to be highly impermeable to moisture, so a humid environment could be maintained inside the incubator.  For these reasons, we focused on metals and plastics.

We eventually settled on rigid HDPE.  In addition to being the most cost-efficient material, HDPE is relatively easy to machine, especially when compared to metals.  When considering insulation materials, we once again had a plethora of options.  We were in need of something that could properly insulate without adding too much bulk to our incubator, so we planned to use insulation that was no more than an inch thick.

For the silver medal requirements the following conditions have to be accomplished:
Identify and investigate one or more HP issue in the context of the project
Demonstrate that our work is safe, responsible and good for the world
Develop new creative approaches
We will now narrate how we’ve accomplished the requisites, but please visit our Integrated Human Practices page and our Project Justification .
Identify and investigate one or more HP issues in the context of the project:
Tequila: an economic and cultural heritage
Tequila is one of the biggest industries in México. It is an alcoholic beverage extracted from Agave Tequilana, with 558 places within states that dedicate fully on the Agave growth and production. It is a major source of employment and economic gain for many. The chain of value is not only limited to economic aspects but it is also important in several areas of the country as cultural, ethnical, social and environmental. Agave is also a vital species for indigenous populations and its growth also promotes development of medicine, fertilizers and food, as well as it helps eradicating poverty.      (CIATEJ, 2016 ). Tequila is now exported to around 120 countries, and the production is about 300 liters/minute  (El país, 2013).
The tourism industry in Mexico is also a major economic and development tool. A report from the National Chamber of Tequila Production states that, of the total products consumed in Mexico by foreigners, 57% accounts solely for Tequila, as it is a major attraction for tourism. Also the same report stated that 900 thousand tons of Tequila are produced annually, employing 300 thousand people across the country  (Millenio, 2017).
But like any major industry, it produces tons of waste. The two major contaminants that result from Tequila production are bagasse and vinasse. By 2014, 240 thousand of bagasse were produced which is equivalent to 20 days of residue generated in the metropolitan zone of Guadalajara city and up to this date its has doubled. The problem with bagasse"
ZJU-China,2017,Team:ZJU-China#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," calcium ion cannot cause a much higher fluorescent intensity as we expected. So we tried to detect the intracellular relative calcium concentration of the two groups.
To our surprise, the difference of the intracellular calcium is not as large as we expected. When the yeast is cultured in medium containing 200mM calcium, its intracellular calcium concentration is only enhanced 8% and the basic level of the uninduced group is relative high. And these phenomena may explain the former result.
Though the expression level of the induced group does not enhance more times as we hoped, from another perspective, only the 8% increment can cause the 147% enhancement of the expression level which means this part can be a sensitive intracellular calcium reporter. Especially when considering the ability that TRPV1 can induce a more than 60% increment of intracellular calcium ion, we're sure this part will work well when combined with TRPV1-Ferritin system.

We based our library layout on a synthetic binding protein named Monobody (adenctin) as well as on a naturally occurring binding protein named Nanobody. Each possesses advantages compared to conventional antibodies, making them suitable for our system. Read more about our used scaffolds.
Setting up a humongous library, containing all different kinds of variants, seemed tempting or even impossible at first, but after researching the literature we opted for a more defined and optimized library. For doing so, we restricted the randomization of the binding regions of our scaffold proteins to specific amino acids ( Fellouse et al., 2004 ; Koide, 2009 ). With this choice we were able to randomize larger parts of the scaffold to generate antibody like binding properties while at the same time keeping the theoretical library diversity at a maximum of about one billion, 1,073,741, 824 variants to be precise. Note that the number of variants can be further increased in our evolutionary selection system. See our Design and Construction for further insight.

National Meetup
On June 21st 2014, a National meetup was organised in Wageningen by the BananaGuard team. The aim of the symposium was to present the projects and meet all the other Dutch teams participating in iGEM ( Delft-Leiden , Eindhoven and Groningen ) this year and to engineer collaborations with the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) . The representatives of RIVM presented their work and showed enthusiasm for our project and the field of synthetic biology. They invited us to attend a future RIVM policy meeting with government representatives.
National meetup presentations.
The symposium started on a sunny afternoon in the Forum building, the centrepiece of Wageningen University & Research Centre . After all teams arrived and enjoyed coffee, the symposium started. Each team was given the opportunity to present their project and their progress so far. Since many people with different backgrounds were present, a broad spectrum of feedback was delivered after each presentation, giving each team more insight into the projects.
Discussions during the break.
Afterwards, a BBQ took place, allowing the teams to socialise with each other. In the informal atmosphere, discussions went on about the iGEM projects, but also about synthetic biology in general, the working environment of each team and numerous other topics.
Barbecue after National meetup.
A few months later, we participated in a second National Meetup, organised by iGEM Groningen . Since all teams had a lot of progress, this second meetup also proved to be very helpful and informative.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

We got bands for both the 311/312 and 313/314 wild type and mutant.  We need to do PCR cleanup and start with the cloning procedure.  297/298 and 301/302 didn't show any bands for either the wild type or the mutant.  We suspect this may be to boiling them for too long (12 min) at the start.  We are going to try boiling them for only 5 minutes and see if we can get bands next time.

Project description
Team Uppsala University 2012 is dedicated to combating the rising antibiotic resistance in bacteria by means of synthetic biology. Old and well-known antibiotics are quickly becoming ineffective as resistance genes are spreading. Scientist around the world struggle with varying success to develop new antibacterial substances. But do we really have to abandon classic antibiotics? Team Uppsala University begs to differ, we believe new methods will allow us to combat the resistance itself, and make the bacteria once again sensitive to old drugs.
Working with real-world resistance genes isolated from ESBL outbreaks at Swedish hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems active at three different levels: DNA level, transcriptional level and translational level. Our systems will be delivered to the target bacteria using an engineered phage and/or a conjugative plasmid.
At DNA level, we will develop a method for permanent removal of plasmids from bacteria. Using TAL Effector Nucleases, we will be able to target and cut individual resistance genes.
At transcriptional level, we will use synthetic super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms in bacteria.
At translational level, we will construct a modular large-scale screening system for sRNA:s and use it to find strongly silencing RNA sequences against three common resistance genes.
With this team on the project, there is no question about it: Resistance is futile!

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Isoprene is supposed to recycle OH. NOx causes oxidant build-up.
Mechanism for NOx removal?
NO sources: Internal combustion engine. Cannot target.
NO2 sources: Internal combustion engine, thermal power station, pulp mill. None of which could be targeted.
Pulp mill industry is one of the largest producers of water pollution in the world. An alternative to paper could solve a lot of problems. Still unfeasible.
Containment is an issue.
Estrogenic endocrine disruptors in waste water
- Estrogenic compounds are released by multiple sources (1)
- In addition, many compounds in drinking water can act as mimics of estrogen in human and animal bodies (2)
- This is problematic because endocrine disruptors interfere with the hormone balances of humans and animals, in particular fish (9)
- Biosensors for this already exist (3), (4)
- This could perhaps be coupled to a degradation mechanism, involving e.g. laccases, which degrade one type of xenoestrogen (5)
- However, laccase degradation of bisphenol A leads to the production of corrosive compounds (6). It may therefore by preferable to use horseradish peroxidase, which appears to be able to degrade a range of estrogens and estrogen-like compounds (7)
- Horseradish peroxidase works most efficiently at around neutral pH (8), which is close to that of most waste water (buffering may be an issue?).
- This peroxidase is especially useful as its reaction products non-enzymatically aggregate and can be separated from waste water by traditional processes. Horseradish peroxidase also degrades phenol (7), which may give it another useful application in clearing industrial waste from waste water.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

Step One: Utilizing E. coli 1303's Ribitol Operon
In order to test for the presence of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), we are taking advantage of E. coli 1303’s natural ribitol metabolism pathway. SInce ribitol is unique to Pgt, by detecting ribitol, we will be able to indicate the presence of Pgt. The ribitol operon consists of four separate genes, rbtR, rbtD, rtlK, and rbtT.
rbtD is under constiutive control and catabolizes ribitol into ribulose. This product in turn induces the transcription of ribitol kinase. rtlK is the only gene that requires the presence ribitol in order to be induced. Since we are looking for a system sensitive to ribitol, rtlK was our target for detection. We decided reassemble the ribitol operon, replacing the rtlK gene with a fluorescent protein. With our modifications, the cells will produce a fluorescent signal in response to ribitol.
The ribitol transporter can be found in the registry as the composite part BBa_K2663001 .
We have chosen E. coli DH5α to be the chassis for our sensing mechanism because this strain of E. coli are incapable of metabolizing nor naturally interact with ribitol. This eliminates any unwanted activations of the ribitol operon an ensures that any"

Collaborations
One of the values we can learn from iGEM is the ability to collaborate with many enthusiastic students from all over the world. This year we made cooperation with students from three different continents; Peru, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan.
1. ColegioFDR_Peru
This year, team KUAS_Korea has been collaborating with ColegioFDR_Peru high school iGEM team. We were delighted to have this chance, thanks to the iGEM since this collaboration was accomplished based on connections we have made through the Giant Jamboree last year. We shared our trials and errors KUAS_Korea have made in iGEM for past few years as well as general understandings in synthetic biology which could help them starting things up.
ColegioFDR_Peru is a high school team, and this is their second year in iGEM. This time they are aiming for synthesizing keratinase-containing E.coli, which degrades the feather waste that can cause the avian flu at chicken farms. It is such a brilliant project reflecting their country’s socio-contextual issues, so feel free to find more of them at their wiki.
Since two countries, Korea and Peru is far apart to have an actual meet-up, we have consistently communicated through e-mail, Facebook, and online Skype. The first online meet-up was held on August 14th, and at the moment both teams were still at the stage of setting basic concepts and principals of the project. We discussed each team’s projects and gave comments regarding the direction of the project and further points to elaborate. Listening from the outer perspective, especially from young active students from the other side of the world was a truly helpful and intriguing experience.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration with ColegioFDR_Peru was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of the iGEMers are facing. We went through some basic requirements for iGEM together such as project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look"

Julian's Work
Today I did Cell Lysis
I thawed the  30C pellets from the freezer. I followed the nature protocol for all cell lysis with some differences as noted below. <a href="" http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n3/abs/nprot.2008.250.html ""></a>
Resuspended the pellet in 1X Lysis buffer (See protocol). I added 3mL of buffer/g of cells for a total of 8mL. Mixed to homogeniety and to break up pellet.
I initially added a small amount of chicken egg lysozyme into the cells and incubated for 20 min. I then added 0.5mL Dnase and again incubated for 20 min. The mixture looked somewhat viscous and was completely homogenous. Cells appeared to have lysed. I also added PIC mixture found in the fridge near rocky's bench.
I then centrifuged at 5000g for 25 min to pellet the insoluble stuff. This formed a hard pellet and the supernatant was no longer clear.
However, this pellet looked a lot like the starting cell pellet so I was not sure if lysis had taken place.
I tried to lyse the cells further by adding another 1mL of 8X lysis buffer. I added more lysozyme as well and incubated for a further 30 min.I repeated the above steps and reserved this supernatant separately. Final pellet looked somewhat better and more lysed. This second supernatant was frozen.
For the 1st supernatant, I heated at 80C for 10 min using the heat block. This caused a white protein precipitate to form. The protocol says this step will precipitate many endogenous proteins but leave the silk proteins in solution. I then centrifuged as directed in the protocol to pellet the precipitant.
the supernatant still had some precipitant floating in it after centrifugation
this was removed by syringe filtration
final produce was clearer than before precipitation"

As we had realized that working with S. aureus brings significant safety issues (check our safe-by-design page  for more information), we reached out to PAMM for help. To discuss the collaboration, we were invited to visit their laboratories. On Friday September 21st, we met with Kees Verduin and Jeroen Tjhie, two of their microbiologists. We presented them with our progress and discussed some issues we were still struggling with. It was very encouraging to hear that Kees and Jeroen saw a lot of potential in our approach. Afterwards, Kees gave us a tour through their impressive laboratories. It was interesting to notice the differences with our own lab. We were very impressed with the amount of work that had been automated! We also learned a lot about the safety measures they implement in their different labs with varying safety levels. Kees ensured us that our experiments with S. aureus will be nothing special for them in terms of safety. 😉 After this tour, we cannot wait to come back for our own experiments!
Insights
A lot of work in diagnostic laboratories is automated.
S. aureus does not require any extraordinary safety measures when we work in PAMM’s laboratory
Follow-up
We planned several experiments to test the functioning of lysostaphin.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Finance_-_-_TEXT.html,"  This was also inspired by our milestones timeline whereby we expect to have a product ready for the market by 2016.
This makes several assumptions listed below:
Salaries were determined based upon the need of attracting new talent to our business, as described in the operations section of the business plan. Additionally, we accounted for inflation throughout the years.
Equipment funds assume government grants will reduce the overall cost of the equipment components. 2014 electrochemical equipment expenses are higher than other years as they account for the purchase of a potentiostat. Subsequent years account for maintenance. Additionally, molecular biology equipment assumes lab support through government programs therefore requiring minimal input for large equipment.  Engineering equipment will be minimal as it only reflects research and development for small scale prototypes.
Prototyping fees have been assessed to be a total of $200,000-$250,000 with an approximate development round of 4 months per prototype assessment with 5 rounds of prototyping required to finalize the product.  This will occur from the later part of 2014 onwards to the beginning of 2016.
Consumables were based on averages collected during the 2012 iGEM season, examining the cost of technology development.
While prototyping is occurring in 2015-2016 so will field-testing, on commercially available samples.  Prototype equipment costs were based upon commercially available quotes for lyophilization systems.  We plan to be a small scale system in 2015 and a full production sized system in 2016.  This is similar for our bioreactor systems.  Prototyping costs were made based upon our manufacturing calculations.
Consultation fees were determined based upon the assumption that a consultation with industry will cost from $100-$125 per hour with an average number of hours of 100 per year.  These would be with end-users and outsourcing particular skillsets we require.
Market evaluation was determined based upon government grant programs for market assessments.  In 2015-2016 market evaluations will be more limited to potential new markets and ventures for our current and next generation products.
Field testing will require access to other analytical devices and third party services to compare our technology platform to other standard methods.  This can be incredibly costly, a single GC/MS sample and other systems can cost between $150-$250 per sample. We assumed four different detection methods at 50 independent samples at a cost of $150 per submission which will continue to grow in 2016 to a large number of samples.
As our technology is developing, new intellectual property will be generated, and this is reflected in our profitability analysis in the legal section.

Flow Cytometry Data
pTet-pBad RFP Characterization with atc and arabinose
For the first tandem promoter flow cytometry experiment, we tested pBad-pTet-BCD2-E1010m-B0015 and pTet-pBad-BCD2-E1010m-B0015. We planned on inducing each promoter separately with it's corresponding small molecule (either arabinose or atc) and also planned on inducing both together. We followed the flow cytometry workflow . By growing the constructs in different concentrations of media, we hoped to see RFP fluorescence increase as the small molecule concentration increased. For each concentration, we also had a negative. We also ran controls including: J04B2RM (RFP Positive), J04B2GM (GFP Positive), COXGR, COXRG, and DH5alpha. For an explanation of how we chose our controls, please refer to our Software Tools page.The pTet-pBad graph turned out the way we expected and showed the anticipated function. For the 5,000 and 10,000 ng/ul atc concentrations (for both graphs), the cells died because of the high concentrations. This is why the graph dropped rapidly.

Ir. Chen continued to introduce us to the whole process of primer synthesis - ammonia                         hydrolysis -                         initial                         inspection - purification - quality inspection - lyophilization. He took a tube of yellow                         material                         from                         a primer                         lyophilizer, saying “this is the primer that you usually use"". It was the first time for us to                         see                         the                         primers in                         person, which was an absolutely unexpected startling surprise. Ir. Chen explained to us that in                         this                         small test                         tube, there were Oligos with a number of tens of thousands of OD, which were tailored to our                         big                         customers, which                         indeed impressed us a lot.
After visiting the standard primer synthesis workshop, Ir. Chen also showed us around their GMP                         standard primer                         synthesis workshop, which is mainly used for the synthesis of Oligo probes for synthetic                         disease                         diagnosis. The GMP                         standard is a quality management standard that all medical drug synthesis processes in China                         need                         to                         strictly abide                         by. We didn't expect that even simple primers also had medical safety requirements, which once                         again                         expanded our                         ""Bigger Picture"" layout. We hold the firm belief that with the advancement of technology,                         genetic                         editing                         technologies like Crispr in the future will have substantive applications. So how does TSINGKE                         BIOTECH                         ensure the                         safety of the primers used in this process? Ir. Chen told us that they have been also paying                         attention                         to this                         issue                         and TSINGKE BIOTECH has now achieved the entire industry chain covering from oligonucleotide                         monomer                         preparation to                         primer synthesis and gene synthesis, and will strictly abide by relevant national laws and                         regulations                         as well as                         business ethics, ensuring the quality and safety of each primer from raw materials to delivery                         process.
The fruitful research process soon came to an end. Ir. Chen and Mr. Hao arranged the vehicles                         considerately to send                         us back and welcomed us to continue to carry out Human Practice at TSINGKE BIOTECH.
Exploration of artificially synthesized genome
Easy for Judge:
Gained a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the commercial application model of                         gene                         synthesis                         technology;
Obtained the affirmation and encouragement from Dr. Du on our project;
Acquired the suggestion from Dr. Du that we should employ an E. coli chassis that knocks out                         homologous                         recombination systems to reduce erroneous rearrangement of genomic fragments.

Signal transmission between Wildtype MATx ↝ MATa: STE2 receptor from Sacharomyces cerevisiae, and between synthetic MATa expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor; \(\Delta\)Bar ↝ MATa: STE2 receptor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was characterised. As a negative control, signal transmission between MATa expressing ""Candida parapsilosis"" alpha-factor; \(\Delta\)Bar ↝ MATa: STE2 receptor from Sacharomyces cerevisiae was studied. No significant level of fluorescence was observed suggesting these signals being orthogonal. The results show that the signal transmission range in saturated culture is approximately 100 μm.
Yeast induced blood agglutination on-chip
Illustration of microfluidic chip used for yeast-induced blood agglutination. No sophisticated mixing topologies were required due to the presence of the 100 μm wide channel ease. The eventual cell aggregates were observed in the subsequent chamber.
Standard agglutination tests are time consuming and require specialized equipment occupying large bench space [Choi2009] . Special microfluidic topologies were designed and fabricated to test yeast-induced agglutination on-chip to lower the time and sample volume requirements. Prior to the experiment, the synthetic yeast cells were perfused and dissolved in plasma, which is the natural medium for the IOD band diagnostic. Blood sample and yeast culture were introduced to the microfluidic chip through separate inlets, and were brought to contact in the chip. During the experiment, the flow was reversed few times to provide sufficient time for the cells to form the eventual cell aggregates, and to decrease the required sample volume. The overall experiment duration did not exceed 60 seconds. The amount of blood necessary for the experiment was approximately 5 μl.
Functioning of location tags was proven by cell clumping consistently observed in mixed samples of yeast cells with the anti-HuA location tag and red blood cells from a type A donor. The control samples, where anti-HuA location tag display was not induced, showed negligible aggregation. The experiments also prove the compatibility of yeast cells with blood samples as no significant clumping or other abnormalities that would indicate overall concept infeasibility were observed in control samples.

NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," our WT-dCas9, although a high MW smear was observed. This phenomenon seems isolated as the same smear was not observed with the truncated dCas9 variants.
They demonstrated liberation of gRNA upon denaturation in Figure B lane B5. Unfortunately, the same gRNA bands were not observed in our wild-type dCas9. Similar gRNA bands were observed for truncated dCas9 in figure D. Based on the difference in intensity of the gRNA bands between RNP/RNPF lanes and denatured lane, results seem to suggest that HNH is able to bind to gRNA best, resulting in lesser free gRNA, followed by 3ple and 5ple. This corresponds to our gene activation tests, confirming that the poorer gene activation observe is not just due to poorer target DNA binding – it is likely that poor gRNA binding could be a contributing factor for the poor gene activation by truncated dCas9-VPR.
The lack of supershifted RNFP in WT-dCas9 experiments coupled with a high MW smear led us to suspect potential DNase/RNase contamination. Such a contamination would also explain the loss of the gRNA band in the denaturation lane. Supershifted RNFP also adds doubt to the intensity of RNPF complex band. A lower percent native gel and a smaller target DNA PCR product would likely result in a smaller shift, and be more in line to established dCas9 EMSA experiments in literature. Noting these weaknesses, we look forward to further improving this protocol in the future. Such information would conclusively characterize the altered binding affinities for target DNA and gRNA by our truncated dCas9 variants.
We are deeply thankful to Macquarie iGEM team for going above and beyond in this iGEM collaboration. We had initially proposed this experiment to merely observe DNA binding causing a supershift, but the results have taught us much more – such as about the variable gRNA binding by truncated dCas9. A special shoutout to Dr. Edward Moh, whose expertise has made the planning of this collaboration a fun process, despite us not being familiar with the experiment. Do check their wiki also!

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#team_-_-_TEXT.html,"10th: Training has begun! Upon finishing the winter semester, the wet lab team began its training in the lab. The new members of the lab who did not have lab experience learned various techniques that would be used over the course of the entire summer, such as PCR, genomic extractions, and transforming constructs into yeast cells. Theory was also taught this week.
May 11th to May 17th: Successful PCRs were achieved by all members. The wet lab team moved onto creating dimers and multimers of PCR amplicons.
May 18th to May 24th: Training construction complete, transformations and confirmations were conducted for the rest of the month. Confirmation includes both PCR and flow cytometry.
May 25th to May 31st: Training completed. Research and understanding of the tri-stable switch was focused on this week, to ensure all wet lab members had a solid understanding. Additional meetings with Dr. Kaern as well as a the construction of a research proposal has purified the many ideas into two solid designs.
June
June 1st to June 7th: Research into pigments was completed, to be used as a reporter and a possible paint application. Primers were designed and ordered to construct the various promoters needed in both designs. Much of this month was dedicated to running PCR after PCR in order to obtain a high concentration and quantity of the fragments that make up the final construct that we were to create. We even had an all-nighter during the month in which the entire night was dedicated to running PCRs!
June 8th to June 14th: Primers arrived, construction of test constructs with each promoter is started. Since many of the sections of the promoters are common, pGalTx was first obtained, and then modified to get the variety of activating and repressing regions. Lex constitutive promoters were also designed.
June 15th to June 21st: It was found that the constitutive promoter we were using to express our repressor was too weak (mrp7). In order to remedy that, we are creating a new strain with a strain with a much stronger promoter (pADH1) in the hope of visualizing strong repression by hindrance.
June 22nd to June 28th: Success! Repression by hindrance was shown to strongly repress in pGalTx, with pADH1 driving rTTA. Other test constructs coming along, with the first few promoters constructs being completed, and the next round being started.

Do the biological materials used in our lab work pose any of the following risks?
Every species we worked with belongs to BL1. They do no harm to human. Experimenters is careful not to release any parts to the public. And even the worst situation happens as it is released, it will hardly bring risks.
a)Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys. However, E.coli is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it toxicogenic. Any concerns for E.coli in terms of health considerations are mitigated by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.
b) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.
c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:

Daniel C.:
We are doing some basic social studies to check the field and also see what kind of resources doctors in the field have available. So we can design our device accordingly.                             I’m actually looking at an article right now, where you are talking about Helen Lee and Claude-Edouard Michel from Cambridge […] In the article […] it says that the sensitivity was actually higher than previous diagnostic tests, so why did it fail?
Dr. Courtright:
It worked well when Claude […] assessed the specimens in the field, at that point of care time. But when they tried to train other people on assessing in the field it failed: it was too specific to one individual being able to read it in the field.
Kai:
Okay, so it was not reproducible?
Dr. Courtright:
Correct. What I can do is to find the documentation that addressed it. I don’t think they put it out as a publication. I think it came out more like some internal communication. What you probably find in the literature is where it was successful. What you probably not find is where it did not see any fare down the line, because the actual application was not successful. […]
    So I will give you a bit about my background. So I’m an epidemiology biologist by training. I have done primarily ocular epidemiology since my training. […] My background before doing my PhD was in the field of education and also in the field of international health. Since 2001 my wife and I established the Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology (KCCO). It was something we had wanted to do, because we had worked in Africa for five years between Ethiopia and Malawi in the late 80’s and early 90’s. We have gone back to and I worked at the university of British Columbia for a number of years. We always knew we wanted to return to Africa to set up the institute that really was focused on eye care not so much of training clinic. That’s because that was already placed, but in training people in operational research also in looking at a lot of […] the management aspects of providing eye care. In most developed countries the systems are in place and an epidemiologist can walk right in and provide eye care services.
   That’s not true of course within Africa so the institute we set up in Tanzania was really focused on training people from around Africa to providing mentorship so that they could run effective and efficiently managed eye care systems. So the research"
USTC-China,2012,Team:USTC-China#team_-_-_TEXT.html," majoring physics in USTC. I am especially interested in condensed matter theory. However, iGEM provided me with an opportunity to put what I learned into practice.
Biology is one of my interests since my childhood. With the hope to see how much the frontier biology research differs from my childhood dream, I joined iGEM team last year. During this year, I equipped myself with enough biology knowledge, especially in synthetic biology, which in my mind is quite an interesting and promising area that scientists designed, modeled and set up biological functional parts to solve real problems and to perform basic scientific research as well.
I treasure a lot the time I worked with my teammates together during the summer. In our project, I designed a computation model based on my knowledge learned in computational physics class. What is more, with the help from biology department students, I set up ODEs to describe our system. It is exciting to see how effective these two 'weapons' works!
Beyond academic activity, I am an easygoing boy interested in painting, chess, movie, traveling bicycling, plants and animals and so on. I am glad to be your friends!
