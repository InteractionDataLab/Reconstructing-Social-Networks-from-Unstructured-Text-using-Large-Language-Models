General Comments
I knew the word DNA but could not explain it to my children.  It was good opportunity that kind young men explained it to them. They knew details and were cool. (from parent of the respondent)
I had a bad image for genetic modification because I had heard genetically modified foods affected our health. But, I knew it contributed to our society and came to have a good impression through your explanation.
It was interesting because I could watch DNA from a familiar food, banana.
I felt DNA familiar through the experiment. It was so fun because I could watch DNA from familiar foods,banana. Thank you.
The experiments was so fun. Thank you.
Your explanation was easy to understand.
You should tell us more the advantage of genetic modification.
Online Forum about Syn Bio Regulation
In this year, we participated in the online forum held by Tec_Guadalajara in Mexico. This online forum was held for shaping policy for our discipline of biotechnology/synthetic biology. This online forum imitates the real discussion from parties and observers to the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD, part of United Nations).
Hokkaido University team had a meaningful opportunity to think of the regulation about treat of GMOs with like-minded people who are familiar with gene recombination technology by participation in this forum. So this collaboration is one of our action of Human Practice about GMOs.

Symptoms
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#secondtry#KillingImprovements_-_-_TEXT.html,". We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC   and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by rTEV protease. Also, there is a Linker1 between MVN and   mRFP to ensure that the fluorescence is not affected. The coding sequence is regulated by the promoter J23105, the   RBS B0034 and the terminator B0015. We transformed the plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) after the construction   work.
Figure 5. Final construct of the plasmid for rTEV protease digestion assay.   Linker2 is a 7aa linker that can be specifically digested by rTEV protease. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein   domain linker mentioned in Figure.4. The whole INPNC-MVN-mRFP fusion protein is expressed under the constitutive   promoter J23105.
To make our results persuasive, we also constructed 3 control groups: C1, C2 and C3. Plasmid C1 has the Linker2   shifted to Linker1 so that it can not be digested by rTEV protease. Plasmid C2 has the INPNC and Linker2 sequence   deleted so that MVN-mRFP is not displayed on the cell surface. Plasmid C3 has the whole coding sequence from INPNC   to mRFP deleted. We also have a blank control group with no cells added.
Figure 6. Gene circuits of the control groups. (a) Plamsid C1   differs to the original plasmid in that Linker2 is shifted to Linker3, which is a 8aa flexible protein domain linker   that cannot be cut by rTEV protease. (b) Plasmid C2 has the coding sequence of INPNC and Linker2 deleted. (c) Plasmid C3 is a plasmid with only the promoter, RBS and terminator left on the   vector.
Cells of the experiment group and control groups were cultured to the exponential phase. Afterwards rTEV protease   as well as buffer were added to the cell cultures according to the protocol from the company. The cell cultures were   co-incubated with rTEV protease and centrifuged afterwards to separate the cells and MVN-mRFP that was cut down by   the protease. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant could stand for the amount of MVN-mRFP and was measured   by microplate"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point

The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

First, we integrate a gRNA responsive promoter (pGRR) which controls GFP production. Then, we insert a 9Cas9-Mxi1 plasmid in W303 yeast strain. Finally, we integrate two gRNA sequences complementary to pGRR. The production of each gRNA is controlled by synthetic inducible promoters, GAL4 and Tet-O. dCas9-Mxi1 complexes with either gRNAs and hybridizes to pGRR which suppresses the production of GFP. Overall, the project poses no health and environmental risks, given that the synthetic genetic network has no phenotypic effects on other organisms. Furthermore, no project-related material will leave the laboratory for reasons other than sterilization for discarding.
Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory
As per iGEM's Safety Committee regulations, our laboratory and team strictly adhere to the recommendations proposed by Akbari et al in “Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory”.
According to Akbari et al., our experimental design, as explained above, “[does] not risk creating a gene drive system because cassettes encoding [dCas9] and sgRNA are not inserted into the cut site or located adjacent to one another in the genome and can thus be safely used by researchers without additional precautions.” [dCas9 will be maintained as a plasmid. There is no cut site due to the lack of endonuclease activity in dCas9.] Furthermore, our transformations are conducted on a haploid strain of yeast. The yeast will not be crossed. There will be thus no risk of conversion of heterozygotes into homozygotes within the population. Finally, the study involves the introduction of genetic parts with synthetic sequences in laboratory mutant strain of yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.

Yener Tuncel
I have graduated from METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and just started the Bioinformatics Graduate Program       this fall. My main research interests is in systems biology,       and its applications. Currently I am focused on genome wide       association of SNP biomarkers, where we will utilize systems       biology approaches for discovering disease gene and pathway       associations after highthrough-put genotyping studies. During       the course of our research on the iGEM project this summer as       a Molecular Biologist I worked on the standardization of the       parts information for our applicaiton database. Also, as a Bioinformatician       in training, contributed to the development of the algorithms       for the BioGuide software. Besides research, I develop educational       tools for biology and bioinformatics education and getting used       to do couples dancing.
Motivation
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU ( Middle East     Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the     increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in     biobricks entries at partregistry.org .     While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible,     searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge.     This year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for     our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting     parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs.     Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find     possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy,     fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group     of friends who are software engineers, and initiated the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE     team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIO-Guide     software.
Scope and Future Aspects
The partregistry.org is     a continuously growing collection of standard genetic parts that can     be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems.     The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry     users benefit from using the parts and information available in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone"

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," showing the relationship between the input light and fluorescent intensity.
By combining the RGB system and our concept of mixing color, we could use the LEDs and projector to produce colorful pictures. As shown in Figure 11-12, the pictures drawn by projector were quite colorful and color gradient could be easily produced, which could hardly be produced using traditional tools of art and science. Furthermore, changing the pictures we projected onto the plates, we could stain our bacteria with more bright color, such as green and yellow as shown in Figure 13. We welcome all iGEMers to create more imaginative artworks just using pictures or sounds in the computer, and our E.coli will help you to create wonderful pictures on the plates. (for more details, see LIGHT TO COLOR .
Figure 11-12. Pictures produced by casting pictures on the plates by projector. Bright colors and color gradients were easily produced. More imaginative creation using the RGB system are welcomed.
LIGHT TO ODOR
We first tried to use CRISPR/Cas9[4] gene-editing system to knock out the original tnaA gene of E. coli producing smell to prevent E. coli from giving off a nasty and unpleasant smell[5]. And figure 13-14 shew the PCR results of the plasmids and homologous sequence we designed during the process of gene knock-out.
Figure 13. The PCR results of pTarget
Figure 14. The PCR results of Homologous sequence 1, 2, 1+2
Then we applied the RGB system to achieving the light-odor conversion. By using enzymes that produced odor as actuators, we constructed a new plasmid (BBa_K2598062 )and thus could induce the production of the lemon, rain, and flower odor by red, green and blue light, respectively.
Figure 15. The function of the actuators and the wavelengths of input light in RGB system[6]
We then tried to detect our products using HPLC. However, rare previous literature had reported the mobile phase, the temperature, and even the parameter settings of the three molecules, especially geosmin and methyl benzoate. It required a large amount of time and effort for us to discover the right mobile phase and specific detection wavelengths of the products. Considering that our system had been tested by fluorescent proteins and enzymes and it really worked well, we did not spend more time on the HPLC analysis, but we believed that we could do further researches on our products once the conditions and the parameter settings of our products were reported.(More information, see LIGHT TO ODOR"

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Nagasaki bomb was a different type and far more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. Even if the use of the Hiroshima bomb was justifiable in order to precipitate an end to the war, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later was clearly a test of new arms. It cannot be justified.
The student mobilization ended, but I was not sure if my school record would allow me to enter a college. To receive some guidance, I visited my Isahaya school a week after the end of the war. Attached to the main gate were several sheets of large paper, on which numerous names were written. About half of the names were crossed off. Apparently the school was being used to accommodate the injured people of Nagasaki, who were listed on the papers. In the exercise field, several men were slowly strolling under the strong summer sun amid the noisy shrill of cicada. All were half-naked. When I looked closer, I saw that their skin was covered with something black with white specks. I thought it was a black medicine (I later found out it was dried blood). The white specks were maggots that had hatched on the human flesh. But that was not the most shocking sight. At the front of the gate, bodies covered with straw mats were stacked on a cart, probably to be taken to a crematory. Two people with a stretcher, a body on it, were coming from the school building. At that moment I noticed two half-naked people standing near the fence. They had been watching the loading of the bodies, a process that might happen to them in a few days. I felt as if I were seeing ghosts. My brain froze, the shrill of cicada faded, and my senses vanished. I think the mental shock I had at that sight, when I was 16 years old, had a certain permanent effect on me. I have regretted for a long time that I did not speak to these people; probably I didn't have the courage at that time.
Nagasaki Pharmacy College
I tried to enter three different colleges in 1946 and 1947, but all rejected me. I didn't have a strong school record to assist me, because I hadn't studied even one day at the Isahaya school from which I graduated. I then heard that the Nagasaki Pharmacy College, a part of Nagasaki Medical College, was readying a temporary campus at a vacated military barrack near my home. (Both colleges had been completely destroyed by the atomic bomb.) I was admitted to the"
HKUST-Hong_Kong,2012,Team:HKUST-Hong Kong#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"rel peptides anchored to the chassis cell wall. It is known that phages displaying this peptide bind preferentially to the highly tumorigenic HT-29 colorectal cell line than to the less tumorigenic HCT 116 colorectal cell line. The binding preference is characterized by an at least 10-fold increase in binding affinity. As expression of this peptide in bacterial cells is novel, steps should be taken to minimize the chance of its horizontal transfer to pathogenic bacterial species, which could result in increased infection activity of that species. Integration of this gene into the bacterial genome, an approach taken by our team, would be one way to work towards reducing horizontal gene transfer.

Isolation of a Colon Tumor Specific Binding Peptide Using Phage Display Selection
Elements of our toxin-antitoxin system for controlling cell lysis contain the ydcDE operon of Bacillus subtilis. The ydcE gene encodes an endoribonuclease that cleaves multiple regions of cellular mRNA, while the gene ydcD has been shown to inhibit this endonuclease activity in vivo. Our system employs those same gene products recombined with different promoters: Pveg promoter for ydcD, Pxyl promoter for ydcE. An investigation to determine whether expression of the E. coli ydcE homolog (mazF) in macaque monkeys is safe yielded results indicating an absence of tissue damage and antigen-specific antibody production. We therefore consider the ydcE product to be non-toxic to humans.

Construction and characterization of our project’s assorted constructs involved work with two non-pathogenic bacterial strains: Escherichia coli DH10B and Bacillus  subtilis 168; both strains commonly used in research, education, and industry. In the manipulation of these strains, Biosafety Level 1 standard regulations were strictly followed. Our characterization also required the use of human colon  carcinoma HT-29 cells, which were handled only by trained team members using a designated tissue culture hood with HEPA filters. Biosafety Level 2 safety requirements were observed. Gloves and laboratory coats were worn when performing laboratory work.

What is CRC?
Colorectal cancer (CRC), or colon/bowel cancer, is a common form of cancer that most frequently develops starting with polyps. In 2014, an estimated 1.3 million people lived with colon and rectum cancer in the United States. In fact, about 1 in 20 men and women are expected to have colon cancer at some point in their life.  CRC is caused by the APC gene, or activating mutation in β-catenin, which results in the accumulation of β-catenin and subsequent complex formation with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Excessive β-catenin can interact with TCF to activate the transcription of proliferative genes, such as c-MYC and cyclin D1, in the colon.

Project Motivations
After speaking to Minako Abe, an immunologist, we became aware of the immense prevalence and impact--especially in Japan--of colorectal cancer. In Japan alone, in 2015, there were almost 50,000 deaths from colorectal cancer, marking a sudden, sharp spike in the number of young adults that were diagnosed with this cancer. Finding out that two faculty members at our school were survivors of this disease further cemented our belief in the importance of addressing it at its root.  The issue is especially prevalent in Japan mostly because the younger generation is not fully aware on how common colorectal cancer is becoming and because they are not checking up on their bodies as frequently as they should be. This motivated us to not limit our project on only addressing early detection of CRC, but also raising awareness.
How did we do it?
Our goal was to create a biosensor that would be able to diagnose CRC at an earlier stage and have it fit for a home-kit where use would be accessible and convenient. To do so, we looked upstream fill in. The activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, a protein that triggers the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Building off of a rapamycin induced split-luciferase system characterized by the 2015 Peking iGEM team, our construct consists of a promoter reporter system that looks at two downstream products, C-myc and COX-2. As for community outreach, we wanted to take advantage of the fact that we live in the most metropolitan area in Japan. We did so by carrying out"

Graph of these averages. The error bars are standard deviation but are very small because the 3 replicates for each sample are technical replicates, so do not show the variation that would be seen with biological replicates (3 different colonies for each of the 16 samples).
Fluorescence scan image from the Typhoon with labels for which samples are in each well.
These data indicate that there is no difference in fluorescence between either KillerRed or KillerOrange and the cells only control either with or without induction with IPTG. There could be several reasons for this, including the light was not intense enough to excite the fluorescent proteins, however no fluorescence from this type of the test with a laser for excitation would be unlikely.  It is also possible that no protein is being produced, which could be due to insufficient IPTG. However, the RFP in J04450 under the control of the lac-repressible promoter R0010 clearly shows that in the DH5α.Z1 strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. This is not a perfect control for the concentration of IPTG used unless KillerRed and KillerOrange also have the R0010 promoter. Interestingly, in the DH5α strain, there is no significant difference between RFP fluorescence with or without IPTG – this is due to DH5α not having a functional copy of LacI, the lac repressor, therefore lac-repressible promoters are not “OFF”, so cannot be switched “ON” by IPTG induction.
Sequencing
Another reason there may not be any KillerRed or KillerOrange protein produced, is mutations in the promoter. This was something we encountered when attempting to clone a promoter in front of the toxin from the toxin-antitoxin system we were working with. If a protein is toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated"

Friday was a crazy day. Spent most of my day in the morning sorting out non-igem stuff like bills, cleaning, disposing of dead bodies etc. the usual day-to-day stuff. Came in around lunch and discovered there was quite a bit of unexpected craziness. Sat down and with the other team liaisons and refined and redefined the mission statement as well as what we were  expecting of our campaign. Also spent a fair amount of time creating deadlines. Had a diet coke and chocolate muffin... highlight of my day.

Woke up without cognition of being in this universe and cycled to science library. Set up this diary page on the wiki with Lewis to save us from iGEM oblivion.  Put some azo dye music to entertain myself and Lewis since we are the only current occupiers of this library. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eERi_OQiiLM Wrote down what i did this week. Both impressed and depressed. Made up some things. Harrassed people on fb to do it. I am afraid that this will have to happen again.
Azo dyes arrived! Red, pretty and ready to be used for some side experiments :)

Now I was thinking I could actually step up my dissertational game and do my discourse analysis with a little help of some Foucauldian theory and concepts. I mean, why not combine the notions security apparatuses and neoliberal governmentality with the ideological discourse of ecological modernisation??

Fig 3. Mechanism of intron self-excision (adapted from (5)) – The construct used above is our experimental construct, further discussed below.  (a) The first transesterification occurs when a GMP attacks the 5' end of the intron (InL-lox-InR). (b) The second transesterification occurs at the 3' end of the intron, led by the 3' end of the exon.  This results resulting in (a) the fusion mRNA for transcription and (d) the intron sequence, to be degraded.
2.3 Staphylococcus phage twort ORF142
The Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage Twort is notable for having three introns within a single gene (6).  This ORF142 is a putative structural protein, though its role has not yet been confirmed.  Sequence analysis reveals three highly similar introns, I1, I2 and I3, closely interspersed in the gene.  Experiments show that they are self-excising, and can produce variable splice products, depending on the intron(s) removed (6).  This is likely due to their terminal sequence similarity (6).  We have chosen to work with a modified version of these introns due to their independent, self-excision capability, and the low likelihood of disrupting important secondary structure on incorporation of additional RNA.
2.4 Application
Gene shuffling has been used to create fusion protein libraries of compounds that are more effective than the parent proteins.  Examples include interferon, antibodies and Cry proteins, a family of biological insecticides (7).  Many of these recombination systems, however, rely on in vitro recombination, cloning, then expression and screening of the protein products.  An in vivo recombination system allows the recombination and expression to happen in the same step.
3.0 Lab and Design
Our project, which continues from last year, is a proof-of-concept for the use of Group I introns in providing scarless removal of an internal sequence.  The marker gene we are using is GFP.  Fig 3 (above) and Fig 7 (below) describe the desired, final construct.  Essentially, successful self-excision of the intron should result in a normal, functional GFP protein.  The final construct will be assembled by joining five ""pieces"": the two halves of the GFP protein, the two halves of the intron, and a lox recombination site.

Due to its toxicity and persistence, TCP poses a serious risk to ecosystems and human health[18,19,21].
Four Key Enzymes

Selected LinA and LinB are cofactor-independent dehalogenase from Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26,  LinA mediates the first step of aerobic microbial degradation of γ-HCH  to 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene , which is further metabolized by the sequential activity of LinB.

DhaA and HheC also are cofactor-free dehalohygenase. DhaA from Rhodococcus sp hydrolyzes carbon-halogen bonds in a wide range of haloalkanes, including TCP, to the corresponding haloalcohol, releasing halide ions. Haloalcohol dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 is a potentially useful enzyme involved in the degradation of several important environmental pollutants, such as 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol, 2,3-dichloropropa-nol, 1-chloropropanol, epichlorohydrin and so on.

The Light System
Light inducible systems allow spatial and temporal control over gene expression.     Our goal is the expression of the mCAT-1 receptor through a light inducible     system to allow spatiotemporal control of the virus entry into the target cells.     We used two different systems: expression is induced by light of the blue and     red wavelength range. To test the performance of the light systems, we used an     assay where the cells express secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP).     The amount of produced SEAP can be measured by its enzymatic activity. It     breaks down the substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate to the yellow para-nitrophenol,     which can be measured with a spectrophotometer.
Function of the Light System
Because the proper function of the light system is important for our project,       we tested two different light systems. The red light system is based on the protein       phytochrome B (PhyB) from Arabidopsis thaliana and is activated by light around 660 nm,       whereas the blue light system contains a protein from Avena sativa (AsLOV2) which       requires 465 nm light for activation.
To test the function of the red light system, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO)       that are known to work better for this purpose than other cell lines. For the blue       light system, we tested  CHO cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).       As reporter the"

What is science?
The mission of CBSin as a NGO is to reduce barriers of science between academia and society. To know what path to follow, we need to be in constant communication with both sides. In that way, we went to Lorena's public square and to the University campus to discuss about science. We were interested in gathering kinds of understanding and point of views of science most people have, not only people related to science such as graduate students, professors or researchers.
We can define science as: “The study of the nature and behavior of natural things and the knowledge that we obtain about them.” [Collins Dictionary] or “The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.” [Oxford Dictionary]
We asked the population these simple questions:
1) What is science for you?
2) Why is science important for you?
3) Why university is important to society?
4) Have you done something of your house by yourself (DIY)?
We didn’t give them answers ready to select like an exam, we left a blank space an let people write what they wanted. We did that on purpose, because we wanted to see what people really think of science. Only to analyse the data we tried to establish standards and allocated the answers in these standard answers, based on the what written by our public.
Both publics answered that science is an investigation just like its definition. However, we can see that a small part of the population from Lorena see much more stuff in science: lots of them see science as a synonymous of life, nature, and the universe which are branches of scientific study. It was nice to see how the ordinary population see potential in science.
As you also can see, it’s not all the people that see university as an institution responsible to build professionals or help the improvement of social equality/development like the graduation students see. Most of the population see the university just as an institution for developing study, not necessarily related to building professional or social development. Maybe we can conclude from this that science and the research in Brazil is something distant from most of society. Now, with CBSin, we want to change this reality"

Step 4.  Logistics
After production and preparation of Mantis from the central production plant, it has to reach the population residing in remote areas. After production and drying of the cells in health centers (see Step 3), the diagnostic is spread throughout the different tiers of the healthcare system [1] until reaching the local population. During the first-time distribution of Mantis in the area, the local facilities and field teams are supplied with both the Mantis device as well as the whole-cell Mantis biosensor. Owing to this model, only the biosensor itself needs to be shipped in subsequent rounds (aimed against the new disease), since the device is already present on-site. A manual how to use the device will be distributed as well. Below, more details can be found on the logistics in two distinct outbreak cases.
Case: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Congo
In Congo, health care starts in local health centres (centre-de-Sante) which have staff ranging from basic levels of training to full-fledged experts. Secondly, there are hospitals and clinics staffed by medical doctors, which often provide definitive treatment. Finally there is a national hospital in Kinshasa. During active case detection, mobile teams travel to urban neighbourhoods or villages in rural areas to test everyone. This is needed since 70% of the population lives in rural areas [2]. These mobile teams gather from a central point, e.g. local health centers, and go out with a four-wheel drive or motor bike for 20 days per month, testing around 6,000 people, depending on village sizes [3]. Mantis can be used for both passive case detection in local health centers with minimal facilities, as well as active screening by these mobile teams.
After independence of Congo in the 1960s, the healthcare system collapsed and the number of infected people increased significantly [4]. Although increasingly more effort is put into control of epidemics in Congo, the health system has collapsed again after recurrent political and social instability since the civil war (1997-2003). Some estimated 5 million deaths between 1997-2004 were attributable to treatable conditions. Currently, the Democratic Republic of Congo is war-torn between the governmental"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," the bioweapon convention in 1972. A point of view more adapted to recent developments in technology and the uprising discussion about research with biosecurity concern can be found in discussions and proposals of non governmental institutions and advisory boards, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) , the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) and the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft/Leopoldina (German Academy of Sciences). Some define dual use to the potential of research results to be used in benevolent and malevolent purposes as well. As a result of our analysis, we find the definitions to vary between the different states and organizations. While organizations within the USA use the term for research results as described, in Germany this dilemma is referred to as “research with security concern”. This topic was addressed by Terry Johnson at a Giant Jamboree in Boston . Nevertheless, we could not find a definition of dual use within the iGEM safety page. More surprisingly, we did not find definitions of biosafety and biosecurity either. To promote a better understanding of the underlying principles and raise the awareness of the dual use dilemma, we want to provide definitions of biosafety, biosecurity of dual use and dual use research of concern.
Biosafety
""Biosafety describes the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release.” ( World Health Organization, 2004 )
Biosecurity
""Laboratory biosecurity describes the protection, control and accountability for valuable biological materials (…) within laboratories, in order to prevent their unauthorized access, loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release.""( World Health Organization, 2004 )
Dual Use
The potential of knowledge to be used in both benevolent and malevolent ways is defined as dual use risk. In addition, the potential of items to be used for military purposes is reffered to as dual use potential. Research providing knowledge containing dual use risk is called Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC).
Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC)
The National Science advisory board refers the “generation and communication of information and new technologies from life sciences research that have the potential for both benevolent and malevolent application (…) along with the subset of dual use research with significant potential for generating information that could be misused (…) to as “dual use research of concern.” ( NSABB, 2007 )
In view of these non consistent definitions in such an important field, we see the necessity of an international definition to establish a uniform basis for discussion and establishment of guidelines. Cont"

In order to evaluate our project we started the searching of a protocol which we                                         could use in our human cell lines to recreate the effects caused by burn                                         accidents with either hot liquids or hot surfaces, which was told by the                                         foundation Rhino Q to be the most common ones. We obtained two main articles                                         which had a lot of potential to our project, both articles described the                                         methodology in which we could treat our cell lines to recreate this burning                                         effect and also it was described how we could measure it. By those means our                                         assays would involved the usage of a hot glass Petri dish and the evaluation of                                         cell viability by the usage of MTT or other molecules.
Wet lab
We transformed E. coli DH5 alpha for plasmid multiplication purposes resulting                                         into correct results for BBLEP and BBTNC5, for BBCOL5 the observance of red                                         colonies were determined as a non conclusive result because of the problem that                                         BBCOL5 part construction had a constitutive RFP as a reporter but the                                         re-ligation of any iGEM plasmid also results in a RFP but controlled by a lac                                         promoter, in order to verify the results obtained a posterious induction / non                                         induction experiment must be done to determine the veracity of the ligation.

COLLABORATIONS
In line with the collaborative nature of scientific work, the team worked with three other teams to build better projects. We helped the Notre Dame Collegiate high school team with running imperative assays for their project and assisted with their graphic design. Collaboration with the University of Lethbridge team aided both teams in the development of their projects and determined direct applicability of each project into the other. Cooperation with the Queens Canada team provided us with advice on some of the technical aspects of our project’s progression.

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
By engaging with three main impact groups: researchers, students, and the public, we were able to communicate our project and address concerns surrounding synthetic biology in the community. We began our public engagement adventure with a faculty talk outlining our project plans to researchers at the U of C. Through the summer, we engaged with high school students by creating a curriculum and lesson plan, and gave a graphic design workshop to an iGEM team in need. Last but not least, the general public was engaged through public science events and a meeting with spiritual leaders in our community.                   Additionally, attendance at conferences provided opportunities for collaboration and valuable advice from synthetic biology entrepreneurs and iGEM alumni.

SAFETY
Safety was actively considered prior to and during the completion of laboratory experiments.  Specific training and procedures were adopted for work with E.coli  DH5-alpha and HEK293T cells. Safety concerns regarding the potential applications of our project  were also investigated and managed.

Our journey towards a safer gene therapy was shaped by the exploration of the societal context in which our project exists. Snip, Equip, Flip evolved over time through careful consideration of the project’s applicability to current research, ethical debates, religious views and established public opinions.
Addressing foreseeable societal concerns, our system was designed with an ex vivo, non-viral approach. However, we found through meeting with the Spiritual Care Advisory Committee at Alberta Health Services that we had not yet explored other issues, such as the alteration of natural order by enhancement, or cultural erad"

Wells 4 and 5 act as a positive control to indicate a successful transfection, as they are transfected with Puc-GFP, a vector that can express green florescence protein (GFP). We expect see GFP expression when examining these wells in a fluorescence microscope, which would indicate a successful transfection.
Wells 9, 10, and 11 contain reactive astrocytes co-transfected with Enhancer E7 and Renilla. Wells 15, 16, and 17 contain astrocytes co-transfected with Enhancer E9 and Renilla. Enhancer E7 is an active enhancer in HEK293 that was cloned into a pGL4.23 that contains Luc and Enhancer E9 is a negative  enhancer in HEK293 cells. These wells act as a negative control for reactive astrocyte cells as the enhancers are specific for HEK293 cells, yet we have transfected them into astrocytes. Therefore, we expect low values of firefly luciferase luminescence.
Wells 18, 19, and 20 contain reactive astrocyte cells which did not undergo transfection. These wells act as a luminescence baseline for each transfected cells and to validate that our experiment is not contaminated with plasmids. We expect to see low levels of luminescence both for Renilla and firefly luciferase in these wells.
In order to increase the transfection efficiency, we preformed this experiment twice with and without trypsin. The use of trypsin should enlarge the cell surface area, therefore improving the transfection efficiency. Therefore, we used both options in order to test the promoter activity.
Results:
We found that the pTIMP1 and pSTEAP4 values are very high when compared to the negative controls of the empty vector. The values obtained from the E7 and E9 enhancers are also very low. We received reliable results both for the experiment with and without the trypsin.

Capacity Limitations
The continuous growth of urban areas has exerted increasing pressure on their water management systems. Whilst treatment facilities might have been initially located in remote areas, residential and commercial development has often started enveloping them. That makes potential for expansion limited to impossible.
Rapid Growth
Population growth equates to increased demand for potable water. Current surface and groundwater resources are stretched thin so new urban developments depend on new water purification and recycling systems. Decentralised facilities can more rapidly and adaptably meet changing demand.
Homeland Security and Disaster Mitigation
As previously discussed, centralised water systems are attractive target for potential terrorist activities. Damage can impact the lives of the many people residing in the large areas dependent on them. Additionally, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes can knock out centralised facilities causing huge disruption. Decentralised water management systems are more resilient. Disruption is likely to affect a smaller area and temporary supplies can be diverted from nearby functioning facilities.
Wastewater Recycling
Society no longer has the luxury of using water only once (Levine 2004).
Water supply sustainability implies a balance between the rate of withdrawal and the rate of water replenishment. Additionally, the water returned should be of the same quality as the water withdrawn. Due to the huge water demand however, it is difficult to replenish supplies by natural means.  Additionally, the distribution of water by use of dams, reservoirs alongside ""other shifts in land-use patterns alters the rate, extent and spatial distribution of freshwater consumption and replenishment"" (Levine 2004).
In order to achieve sustainable water use it is necessary to turn to methods that ensure that we replenish the water we use, for fresh - and groundwater replenishment this means water recycling via wastewater reclamation and treatment (Dolnicar 2009).
Reclaimed water processing system for citrus irrigation in Florida(waterencyclopedia.com)
Wastewater recycling has been on the rise for the past two decades as our societies become increasingly urbanised. There are two different categories of water reuse: direct and indirect. As an example of indirect water reuse, Oxford and Reading are upstream of London on the River Thames. Sewage originating from these cities mixes with the water that ends up in the London water supply. Direct reuse is more controversial and has been mainly employed to provide water for irrigation. For example in the state of Florida, more than 56000 acres of golf courses, 200,000 residencies, 500 parks and 250 schools are irrigated by reclaimed water. St. Petersburg, FL is home to one"

We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can make the better plan, central or prediction in the experiments.
We consider the tubulin length is the function of time, assembling rate, disaggregation and hydrolysis rate. According to the literature, there are some relationships between these promoters.
Details of Original Differential Equation Model
a. - Model Assumption
We only consider tree main phenomenon in the solution: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
There are three types of dimers, Taxol-dimer, GTP-dimer and GDP-dimer. Only Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer, no matter they are dissociative or already fixed on the filament, can aggregate new Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer.
Especially, the difference between Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer is that new fixed aggregation Taxol-dimer will not disaggregate and become dissociative again.
According to literature [2] , every Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer may hydrolyze into GDP-dimer, which can no longer combine new dimers and growth.
b. - Parameter specification
c. - The explanation of the process
As we discussed in the modeling theory, we only consider three main phenomena: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
Now we consider how these filaments growth specifically. At first, initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are added in the solution. Then they aggregate into filaments forms, including \(G_{11}\), \(G_{21}\), \(G_{12}\), \(G_{22}\)(the meaning of these parameters are specified in table above).  \(G_{11}\) and \(G_{21}\) can become \(G_{12}\) and \(G_{22}\) if new dimers are aggregated at the endpoint. Also \(G_{11}\)and \(G_{21}\) can disaggregate into the solution and become dissociative dimers (\(T_1\) and \(T_2\) again. If all the GTP-dimers at the endpoint become the GDP-dimers or there is not enough \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the solution, the growing process is stop.
The flow chart of this process can be illustrated as follow:
According to the flow chart, we can get the ODE equations as follow.
$\dot{T_1}=k_1 G_{11}-r_1(G_{11}+G_{21})$

SIRV MODEL
What is SIRV?
An SIRV model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Vaccinated) for the spread of a virus, in general, divides the viral host population into four classes: those susceptible to be infected, those that have already been infected, those that have recovered from an infection, and those that have grown resistance to the virus and thus not susceptible to be infected. The difference between our SIRV model and the earlier simple continuous time model is that with the SIRV model, we take into consideration the possibility that certain individuals from a strain of bacteria may, over time, become resistant to a type of phage through genetic mutation. This is in keeping with the law of natural selection and evolution, and we hoped that this model may help to explain why bacteria and phages co-exist in many instances.
Purpose:Taking into account the possibility of genetic mutations and virus resistance, we improved our previous continuous-time model in hope of explaining the co-existence of bacteria and phages.
Assumptions:
All the assumptions from our previous Continuous Time Model.
No recovery is possible. Unlike other viruses that attack animals and plants, phage infection of bacteria is relatively fast, and a recovery is unlikely. Therefore, we did not consider the possibility that an infected bacterium may revert to a susceptible state.
Definition of Parameters and Variables:
1. All parameters and variables from the Continuous Time Model.
**The intrinsic growth rate and natural death rate of bacteria will apply to both the susceptible class and the resistant class of the bacterial populations in this model. The prototype below will demonstrate this.
2. Mutation rate: the mutation rate represents the probability that an individual from a population of bacteria will develop resistance against the infection of a certain type of phage through genetic mutation.
3. Probability of successful lysis: Although it is assumed that no infection may be reverted, there is a small probability that an infected bacterium may not be able to produce phages (The bacteria may have defective enzymes, for example), in which case the infected bacteria will not be lysed. This parameter, the probability of successful lysis, is involved in computing the number of infected bacteria and number of phages produced at any given moment.

Collaboration with NYU-Shanghai
We provided plasmids synthesized by ourselves, E coli and IPTG for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. The two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transport. They want to use arabinose to stimulate transcription but with no color, we suggested that use different concentration of arabinose might find the best concentration to show the color. Because they use arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG should be the better choice. At that time, we use IPTG inducible plasmid PET21a respectively with blue chromoprotein and yellow chromoprotein in BL21 (DE3), both of them showing the color. Therefore, three week ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot, and we were also proud of supporting other groups in 2015 iGEM"

Biology
Moving in to the CIME, a biology teaching platform, free for the summer vacation. Preparation of new storage. PCR results from last week cloning.
Cloning session :
every 1st-step constructions that failed last time, so 6 constructions.
2, 2nd-step constructions :
MerR-LuxR
TetR-LuxR
Ligations :
Because we still have a low cloning rate we tried different proportions between vectors and inserts:
1 vector/1 insert
1 vector/2 inserts
1 vector/3 inserts
Transformations with electrocompetent cells
Spreading over Petri Dish
Results :
Best results on Petri Dishes with the proportion 1/3. All constructions seem to have the right size except MerR-LuxR.
Sequencing Order
RBS-TetR RBS-LuxI RBS-CinR RBS-LacI pLac-GFP pCin-GFP pMerT-GFP pLux-Lyco
Products Order
For ligations, digestions, PCR, MiniPreps, MidiPreps
Cloning Session :
5 constructions with Fha1
3, 2nd-step constructions
LacI-LuxI
MerR-CinR
TetR-CinR
1 construction for the tests
pLux-GFP
1st-step construction
RBS-CinI
The final RBS (Fha1) which allows to keep the toggle off has just been delivered. So, all first steps constructions including RBS were made once again. Because the efficiency of Fha1 hasn't been completly demonstrated, we keep on cloning with the standard RBS. So, RBS and Fha1 constructions are made in parallel.
Results :
Every constructions gave colonies on Petri Dishes. But PCR cheking showed that nothing were amplified on every Fha1 constructions with VF2 and VR primers. Thus, Fha1 was provided in a PCR blent plasmid instead of an iGEM's plasmid. The insert of the test construction is having the right size. 2 out of 3 2nd step constructions had the right size. We still have issues to clone the 1st step construction: RBS-CinI.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," [2] [9] . Also research is done towards a new method making use of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides disrupt membrane structure by binding to and disordering the double layer cell membrane of fungi, bacteria or viruses. Some of them are capable of activating intracellular pathways by entering cells or binding to specific receptors [9] . Because the cell wall structure of oomycetes is different from that of fungi, most fungicides are not effective against oomycetes. To fight oomycete infection phenylamide metalaxyl, inhibiting RNA Polymerase 1 is used. More research is done to find different molecular routes that can be used as center of attack [2] .
Pesticides are effective in inhibiting pathogen growth, but the extensive usage also forms one of the main environmental issues in the world today. Pesticides can pollute drinking water [5] . Wild plants and animals become endangered with threat for extinction [6] . Besides this environmental damage, there is evidence that pesticides are hormone disruptive and possibly even lead to cancer [7] [8] . Finally there are also cost issues, which were emphasized by regulators during the symposium at the RIVM.
Current approach
Pesticides are used to protect crops against harmful microorganisms. The chemicals can either be spread preventively or afterwards as cure [2] . Preventive usage of chemicals could imply unnecessary contamination of the soil. Whereas in curative usage, it is necessary to keep constant check of the soil and crop quality. This, if done manually, is very labor intensive, expensive and in any cases crop quality diminishes due to infection. In an ideal world, pesticides distribution only occurs when pathogens are present. Thereby it would be useful if soil check-up and pesticide distribution is automated.
Application COMBs
To reduce pesticide levels in the soil we could use our sensor system to monitor for presence of pathogens. Using the “click reaction” to adhere pathogen-specific aptamers to our sensor, we could manage the detection of pests in crops. This detection can then activate the process in the cell, which eventually leads to the excretion of pesticides. In this way pesticides will only be secreted when this is necessary, which can reduce the environmental burden.  To make our system work, we need a molecule that we can detect and we need to be able to produce a useful output signal. As discussed before, pathogenic organisms produce virulent factors such as mycotoxins. The factors produced by these pathogens are specific, can diffuse through the ground and are small enough to be detected using our aptamer system"
WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"12th: Meeting with Victor Mowatt
Cam met with Victor Mowatt, the CEO of Bulk Ag Innovations, an agricultural technology company, to discuss our hardware. He was worried that our device could be knocked down and potentially crushed in a field that used agricultural machinery. Therefore, while we originally intended to have multiple devices around a field with built in spore traps, we decided to design a device that could be housed in a separate location with detachable spore traps that could be hung around the field’s periphery where they would not be affected by machinery.
June 21st: Visit to Monsanto
Our team met with several plant pathologists at the Monsanto Research Center who had previously worked with wheat rust resistance genes. They reviewed our project design and made recommendations of other experts in the field to reach out to. Previously, we had intended on expressing Sr35 intracellularly, where it would interact with AvrSr35 secreted by Pgt. However, they recognized that although AvrSr35 can enter wheat cells, it is not necessarily able to enter yeast cells, and suggested that we use Aga2 to display Sr35 on the surface of our yeast cells to eliminate the issue of AvrSr35 entering the yeast cells altogether. Although our project design focuses on demonstrating the interaction of Sr35 and AvrSr35 inside yeast cells first, we incorporated this advice into the future direction of our project by improving the Aga2 + linker ( BBa_K2663004 ) part in the iGEM registry so that it would later be ready to incorporate into our Sr35 mechanism.
July to August: Collaboration with Electrical Engineering, Anthropology, and Microsoft
Missouri Coalition for the Environment
We also met with Melissa Vatterott J.D., who is the director of the Food and Farm program for the Missouri Coalition for the environment. Ms. Vatterott is helping the Missouri Coalition for the Environment advocate for the decreased use of pesticides and GMOs. We asked Ms. Vatterott about her thoughts on our project since we are technically recommending the use of fungicides, a pollutant and harmful to the crops and user’s health when used incorrectly. She thought that our project could be a valuable tool if it provided farmers a way to minimize the use of fungicides by advising them to use them only when helpful to prevent crop loss. She liked how we were already going to pair it with an educational program and adapt it to local culture and considerations. Our conversation provided valuable insight into how fungicide contributes toward damaging the environment, and how our team needed to be cognisant of the negative externalities"

Success isn't about the end result, it's about what you learn along the way.- Vera Wang
Molecular Biology
The root of our project is the molecular biology lab. First, we started to amplify our expression vector pet28a, wildtype light chain, and our genblocks SNAP25, pHluorin 2 and Omomyc. As you can see in figure 1 to 3.
Fig 1. Amplification of vector pet28a and SNAP25
Fig 2. Amplification of omomyc.
Fig 3. Amplification of pHluorin2.
The first barrier we encountered was the mutation of the wt light chain of BoNT, in order to detoxify the protein. These mutations were induced via mutagenesis PCR
The following mutations were induced:
E230>A;H233>G;Y375>A
With Gibson Assembly we first combined the vector pet28 with the mutated light chain.
Next we transformed the combined plasmid into E.Coli.
Our sequencing results validated the insertion of the three point mutations. Figure 4 shows the alignment of the wildtype sequence (ph6-t-BoNTCs-)with the sequencing (LEMO-P15-alig). The mutations are highlighted in yellow.
Fig 4. Alignment of mut LC and wt LC.
After detoxifying the light chain we expressed it and performed a toxicity assay. The results of this assay can be seen under ""assays"" on the bottom of the page.
After the toxicity assay revealed, that the mutated light chain could not cleave SNAP25 anymore, we could progress with our cloning experiment. Next, we performed Gibson Assembly of the pet28a vector , themut light chain , the heavy chain and the part. This was successful for the HiBit and Omomyc part.

Protein Expression
Our project divided protein expression and purification into two phases. The first hurdle that had to be overcome was the validation of the ToxAssay. Three proteins were needed. These were the LCwt, LCmut and SNAP25.

Deadlines:
We have been asked to go into Simon Langton Girls School on the 10th October to give a talk about our project and synthetic Biology.
On the 1/10/14 we have to give a 15-20 minute presentation with the summer school students about our project.
BioBrick:
We are nearly ready to send off the R-Linalool Bio-brick however it needs to be at a higher concentration.  Mark suggested getting it to a higher concentration running a successive elution profile from 4 mini preps.
Assembly of limonene syntheses has not worked.
When a gel was run it showed no DNA was present.  It was suggested to check for definite if all the parts are actually there.  We should run a gel on all the parts from assembly allowing us to quantify them.
Also run a single digest on RBS and promoter containing the plasmid and then put these onto a gel.  Again just to confirm that they are there.
Mark emphasised the point, don't presume that anything is there for definite.  For example, with Zingiberene purified from a gel, run again on a gel to double check that it is there.  It will save us a week's work if it isn't actually there.
Modelling:
Taylor has obtained Km values for R-linalool and Zingiberene.
We hope to be able to able to set up a system that allows us to change parameters such as concentration of substrates and enzymes in order to see how this affects flux of the system.
We can add the optimising sequence work that we did when designing the sequences as part of our modelling work.  Mark suggested looking back over the sequences and seeing if there were any rare codons that we removed.
Our Project in industry:
In order to be able to collect the fragrance we would need to be able to break the cells.  We need to look into current methods of how industry breaks"

Utah_State,2009,Team:Utah State#ETHICS_-_-_TEXT.html," 2009).  The Hart researchers also found that there is a broad consensus that “more should be done to inform the American public.”  90% of adults surveyed agreed with that statement and 73 % “strongly agreed.”
In an address to the National Academy of Sciences, David Rejeski (2009b) suggested that there is a lack of good science reporters.  Media, for various reasons, is prone to embellish and to present information that catches attention, but is not necessarily accurate.  This leads to inaccurate initial assessments of synthetic biology.  Once an initial assessment has been made, the feelings rarely change, but rather become stronger (Kahan et al., 2009).  Addressing public perception, Tucker and Zilinskas (2006) wrote:
Although it is often difficult to persuade scientists to leave the laboratory for even a few hours to participate in a public discussion of their work and its implications for society, such efforts should be encouraged because they generate good will and may help to prevent a future political backlash that could cripple the emerging field of synthetic biology.
With more than 100 teams participating in iGEM coming from around the world, we represent a tremendous asset in disseminating accurate knowledge to the public.  We propose two measures that could be taken by iGEM teams to increase public education.
In order to qualify for a gold medal a team should make an effort to have accurately released in a school newspaper or website, an article about synthetic biology and the school’s involvement with iGEM.
Encourage iGEM teams to host or give a presentation addressing synthetic biology open to the school and public.  The presentation should also be open to accepting questions and addressing concerns.
Efforts to honestly present information to the public will lead to public trust and a market that welcomes innovations from the field.  Interaction with the public in this fashion will also help to establish guidelines as to what research is considered acceptable and will aid in establishing regulatory frameworks.
Conclusions
The teams participating in iGEM can play an invaluable role in establishing policy regarding human practices and in acting as a liaison between the community of synthetic biology and the public.  The multidisciplinary aspect of iGEM is conducive to progress in these two areas.  With a concerted effort we can help ensure that synthetic biology continues to progress and reach its potential.
Our team has taken specific measures to follow our suggested proposals.  In the education of our team, we discussed the potential benefits of a standard secretion system but also discussed the potential of our designed secretion pathways to be used in a malevolent manner.  As a"

After the ligated plasmids had been transformed into DH5α, they were purified with Zyppy miniprep kit from Zymo. The plasmids were then verified by restriction analysis. If the restriction analysis showed the expected band lengths, the plasmids were sequenced by Macrogen EZ-Seq. Strains containing plasmids verified by sequencing were added to our glycerol stock for use in future measurements.
In Vitro Transcription
We needed to establish a standard curve for fluorescence of Spinach. We therefore ordered a primer with a T7-promoter tail so we could do PCR amplification of Spinach2 and Spinach2.1. The products were purified with Qiagen Qiaquick PCR purification kit. The purified PCR product was used as template for in vitro transcription . The RNA product concentration was measured on a NanoDrop, and stored at -80 degrees celsius.
Measurement
Three types of measurements were done:
Measurement of standard curve using in vitro RNA.
Measurement of fluorescence signal from cell culture.
Measurement of Spinach degradation rate in vivo.
For measuring the standard curve, excess of in vitro transcription product was mixed with increasing known concentrations of DFHBI-1T and fluorescence was measured. A fluorescence buffer was used. This enabled us to derive a correlation between fluorescence and concentration of Spinach-DFHBI-1T complex, as well as compare the fluorescence of Spinach2 and Spinach2.1.
To measure the fluorescence signal from a cell culture containing Spinach, 10 ml LB media was inoculated with 1 ml overnight culture. When the culture reached an OD600 of approximately 1, the culture was centrifuged and the pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml 0.9% NaCl and kept on ice. The OD600 of the sample was measured and DFHBI-1T was added to a final concentration of 200μM and the samples were kept on ice for 1 hour before measurements were made in a fluorometer .
The half life of the Spinach2.1 RNA was measured by inoculating 100 ml of LB with 2 ml overnight culture. Spectrophotometric measurements were made during the exponential growth phase in order to determine the growth rate. At approximately OD600 = 1, rifampicin was added to terminate transcription in the culture, and a T0 sample was taken. Every hour a sample of 10 ml was taken and measured .

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Notebook#Doug's Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," official alpha release is set for July 26th! We will see how things go. This next week will consist of chasing down bugs and cleaning up the code. After the alpha release Matt and Nade are going to continue to work on Clotho full time while I return to working on my primary research 80% of the time and working on Clotho 20% (getting it to work with Pobol).
Clotho has changed a lot since my last post. I imagine these changes will be documented in the other member's notebook pages. The main thing that is going to happen next week (other than the Alpha release) is that we are going to meet with BioJADE (Jonathan Goler) and BioStudio (Sarah Richardson) developers as well as folks from JBEI (Tim Ham) about their parts registry. The goal is that Clotho Beta will interact with other tools and also migrate its internal data representation to something like Pobol for BioBricks.
We are also going to begin to write up the work regarding various assembly algorithms that are in Clotho. This will be targeted toward a synthetic biology journal.
Week of August 3rd, 2008
They keep pulling me in!!
I have been doing work on a number of other projects but it is becoming increasingly obvious that I am going to have to integrate PoBoL support into Clotho in order for it to truly be useful to the community. To that end I have created a system to create ""binding files"". A binding file describes the relationship between fields in a databases and both objects and fields in the PoBoL specification. This binding file now will allow Clotho to perform operations in a standardized way based on PoBoL based data and use the binding file information to understand how to query and update a database. Here are some screenshots of both how configurations and binding file.
PoBoL Configuration and Binding Management System in Clotho
The next step is to integrate PoBoL based data into the Clotho environment. This will include the algorithm manager, parts navigator, and parts packager.

1 Project Introduction
2 E. coli Project
2.1 Production of Medium Chain Fatty Acids as a Biofuel
2.2 Production of Ethanol as a Biofuel
2.3 Construction of a Glucose Insensitive Inducible Promoter in E. coli
Project Introduction
Our project aims to overcome problems in modern oil reserve limitations by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. In the past there have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli, however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs(Galbe, Sassner, Wingren and Zacchi, 2007). Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E. coli. In addition to cutting costs, Cyanobacteria and E. coli will be co-cultivated in an apparatus that allows for the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. This consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis provides an energy source that is beneficial to the environment.  Not only will this project provide an efficient and environmentally friendly means for producing biofuels without the need for a carbon source, but the use of novel bacteria also frees up land and water reserves for food crops. The idea that two different bacterial species can be developed into a cooperative system also holds further industrial implications for medicine production and other endeavors.
E. coli Project
The goal of the E. coli team was to transform E. coli with genes that produce medium chain fatty acids and ethanol, both of which can be used as biofuels."

Collaboration
The Wits CSIR iGEM team collaborated with Imperial College London, both for the modelling and the potential suitability of motility experiments in the testing of our machines. The biologists in our team and those at Imperial College London had a number of skype conferences to discuss the progress of our lab work as well as to share insight into both qualitative and quantitative assay for motility.
We provided Imperial College London with some ideas regarding motility assays using TTC in stab agar. Their team gave us some tips about the preparation of cells for motility experiments and recommended spinning down the bacteria and resuspending them in a low volume of broth to increase the density of cells. They also recommended the use of capillary motility assays.  There was an exchange of protocols both ways to aid in the set-up of our experiments. A week later we discussed the progress we had made in the lab. We gave each other tips and suggested more assays to indicate the ability of our bacteria to move towards a stimulus. Imperial College London shared with us a type of capillary assay they were performing at the time and we, too, shared a protocol with them which is detailed in Gullivan and Topps (2006) paper, Guiding bacteria with small molecules and RNA.
Collaboration was also performed between the engineers to improve the modeling for both the teams. Several Skype conferences were held between the team from Imperial College London and the Wits CSIR team to discuss the design and theory behind our own chemotaxis models. The collaborative effort resulted in the Imperial College London kindly providing us with a model for our theophylline riboswitches. Their modelling results can be found on our href=""https://2011.igem.org/Team:WITS-CSIR_SA/Project/Modelling"">modelling page.

NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," the point that ITRI will adopt our project into their lab.
Dr. Shen suggested us to think more about the bioproduct after our E. coli uptake CO2. We can easily transgene E. coli to let E. coli metabolized CO2 and produce amino acid.                                          The highest value of bioproduct will be the health food.                                          However, we could hardly make the health food which made                             from industrial flue gas into the market. There are still many valuable products we can achieve with less limitation when applying to the market,                                          such as electronic material solvent, biocytoculture, agricultural chemicals, etc.                                          Besides, the last choice will be biofuel. We should try to reuse our product again and                                          again to maximize the value before converting it into biofuel.
This suggestion triggers our design about recycle system (link)                                          after bioreactor.

Part1. Interview record
Date：October. 6, 14 pm.
Location：Biotechnology Green Energy Expo conference hall
Is the bioreactor technology being involved in ITRI?
There is a biotechnology laboratory in ITRI. They work on converting microalgae into bio-fuel and dry anaerobic fermentation. Therefore, bioreactor technology was involved in ITRI.
After the carbon capture process, how to transfer those captured CO2 while being condensed?
Once CO2 was captured, we will liquefy it to decrease volume                                                      and then the vehicles will carry those high density liquefaction CO2 to storage.                                                      Or through piping, we can transfer captured CO2. to north of the sea for sequestration.
However, technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS)                                                      didn't implement in Taiwan, since that the inhabitant in Taiwan regarded CCS as environmentally hazardous technology.                                                      More and more national disaster due to climate led to local doubts about the safety of CCS.                                                      The currently policy of reduce carbon emission is to reach 2% decreasing CO2 emission on 2020 compared with the standard year.                                                      The long-term emission reduction goal is to cut emission in 2050 by 50% compared to 2005 levels totally                                                      we hope to clean 1 hundred million tons of CO2. The main challenge was the downstream process of CCS,                                                      utilizing technology.
According to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act                                                      which was passed by Taiwan’s parliament (the Legislative Yuan), 1 ton of carbon tax is NTD 100 (35 USD),                                                      which is that industrial work hard to avoid high tax.

Master SNAKES- a Python library that provides and simulates Petri nets- https://code.google.com/p/python-snakes/
There also exists a Petri Net Markup Language http://www.pnml.org
Week (4) of July 14
2014 07 14- Monday
Updates:
Breadth-First Search and Topological Sort Algorithms are possible traversal algorithms that will be implemented in our design.
Tasks:
When visualizing your network don’t mind the details such as device composition, simply denote devices as a node along with transitions and intermediates. For transitions, just write it in conditional probability format. For example, A+B > D the transition will be written as D| A+B which reads as “ D given A+B.” Eventually we will be substituting our transitions with a mathematical functional representing a logic gate.

Roadmap for ChassiDex based on case studies
We conducted case studies on the functioning of popular databases such as PDB, Wikipedia, Google Maps, YouTube and BRENDA. The case studies can be found on our Silver HP page .
Key takeaways from the case studies
1. Almost all databases have staff to curate and manage data
2. YouTube and Google Maps let users comment and thus ensure some realistic information to other users. Google Maps also lets users give suggestions
3. PDB restricts data addition to only those with experimental results
Roadmap for ChassiDex
1. After iGEM 2017, we will be constituting a dedicated team of students to curate and manage data.
2. We will be adding a feature that will let users give suggestions and post comments.
3. After the database grows to a sizeable extent, we shall tie up with laboratories working with different chassis organisms and curate data in collaboration with them. This shall ensure up to date and legitimate data.
Iterative testing and redesign
We believed that entering data on our database could be a tedious and confusing process and we wanted to make this process as user-friendly as possible. Hence, we after the first prototype was done, we decided try it out ourselves and began to enter data.
Our first prototype
With the testing of first prototype by ourselves, we realized that the what data was to be entered in what field was not clear. Our instructors also gave us the same feedback. Hence, the user interface was completely overhauled, to include a help section on the left and data fields on the right. The second prototype is shown below.
Second prototype with a major UI overhaul
The testing by entering data ourselves continued and we got more insights on the design. One of our team members accidentally closed the 'add page' while filling up data, as he had multiple tabs open on his browser and was trying to close all unwanted tabs. All the data he had entered so far was lost. Hence, we added a confirmation before the tab is closed. This is shown below:
The confirmation before close
After these changes, we sent out a collaboration request to other teams to fill in data. Team IISc-Bangalore and Team INSA-UPS_France filled in data in our database and did not report any problems or ask"

Kanamycin aliquotes of 50mg/ml in water and Ampicilin aliquotes 100mg/ml in 50% ddH2O and 50% ethanol were prepare by Lilia and put in the new box labelled ""iGEM2011 Antibiotics"" at -20°C in BM building.

The transformed cells with digested pSB3K1 Pconst-tetR yielded only white colonies, which indicate that RFP actually got cut out. Nadine also made a colony PCR on 10 of the colonies, because the primers include the multiple cloning site. As a control, the same PCR was made on undigested pSB3K1 Pconst-tetR plasmid. The expected size for the digested would be 1200 kb, whereas with RFP it should be around 2000 bp. But the gel gives disappointing results, with every colony and the control showing the same ~800 bp band... Liquid cultures have been made, and if they don't turn red we'll miniprep them and send to sequencing. !!Uppdate: I used the tetR plasmids for Gibson assembly, so the results are fine and show that TetR is still present in the digested plasmids.
Alessandro made the extension PCR on RPF to put it under the control of 4 different T7 promoter: T7const (almost 100%), T7lac (T7 promoter with different versions of a lac operator downstream). The gel will be run on Monday as well as the gene specific PCR for T4 lysis cassette.
Lilia made colony PCR on TetR variants prepared by Alina and transformed on Wednesday.
Vincent took his TetR variants out of the incubator to find that 2 of the 4 had been successfully transformed and had given around 100 colonies each (the successful ones were Y42F and V36F, both single mutations). He made liquid cultures to be used for glycerol stocks and minipreps the next day. The goal is to have the variants ready for sequencing by Monday. As for the transformation efficiency, each sample reaction got 65 ng of DNA in .5 uL (eventually 50, 100, and 200 mL were plated)

-CH Presented on the Cholera quorum sensing system and our plans for our project (ie, E.coli, lambda phage etc).
4/15/13
- KP Today we started out by getting photographed. We also watched the phage group’s presentations. It seems as if they have a good start to their project. We didn’t have too much time to do our own experiments, but we did set up an overnight to do mini-prep tomorrow, and we streaked out our plates of lambda phage. - KK The three phage groups presented today. I realized how very quickly each of our groups has specialized to the point that I have to concentrate deeply to understand what seems to be second nature to members of the phage group. That’s good! It means each of our groups is moving along nicely. The objective of the phage project is to make a library of sizes - the biggest and smallest phage capsids possible using phages that have already been well characterized and approved for medicinal purposes. One group is working on selecting for the largest phage possible, one for the smallest, and another group is developing a method to purify both phages as they are made. Afterwards, we laid out singles of our three E.Coli strains with Lambda prophage incorporated into its genome. Tomorrow Kelton and I are going to go in and check on them after our Intro to Medicine class.
-CH Listened to presentations from the phage evolution groups. Seems to me they are all doing well and have good plans for their projects. We also as a group figured out what we are going to do inbetween semesters. Meet this Weds at 5pm to set up some more transformations and redo the mini prep. Meet on Friday at 2pm with Dr Grose for help with making primers.
CH 4/17/13 Set up transformations for pJG78b, pJG79b, pJG79c, pJG80b, pJG81b, pJG81c, pJG81d. Method: Added 1ul of mini prep of each plasmid to 25ul of dH5alpha. 5min on ice. 2 min heat shock at 42. 2 min recovery on ice. 30min recover w/ 1ml of LB at 37. Plate 50ul onto LB-Am. 37 overnight.

DhaA+P2A+HheC gene were expressed in E.coli strain MC1061. Separating supernatant and sediment of the broken cell liquid and used colorimetric method to detect the activity with TCP and 1,3-DCP.(Fig.7). DhaA+P2A+HheC in supernatant had activity of DhaA and HheC enzymes, while in sediment, there wasn't any activity.
HheC has a strict structure. Only if four HheC subunits compose together as a tetramer can it catalyze dehalogenation. Measuring the activity of HheC in chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC is an ideal way to detect the effect of P2A peptide. The purified enzymes, HheC and DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein was isolated by AKTA FPLC. Using substrate 1,3-DCP, HheC specific activity was 6.72(U/mg) and the chimeric protein specific activity is 5.28(U/mg). It indicated that the 2A peptide was an excellent linker to compose the two enzymes together.
Fig.6 lane7 and lane8 are blank controls, lane1 and lane3 are the expression of DhaA and HheC gene. In the lane5 and lane6, HheC and DhaA bands couldn’t be found,there is DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein band, P2A peptide sequence can’t cleave DhaA and HheC. In the sediment, it is DhaA+P2A+HheC inclusion body.
Fig.7 the reaction in buffer(50MmTris-SO3,PH=8.0), after breaking cell, the supernatant and sediment were separated. Blank control was the cell transformed empty vector. Colorimetric method is a way of detecting the concentration of Cl^-(refer to protocol). The solved chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC could degrade 1,3-DCP and TCP. The inclusion protein didn’t have any activity.

In polycistronic co-expression system, the quantity of HheC was less than DhaA"
WHU-China,2012,Team:WHU-China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," at Wuhan University, which mixes the eastern and the western architectural styles, is in exquisite layout.
1.The Library
The library is the highest building on Lion Hill. It’s the landmark and spiritual symbol of Wuhan University. The integrate appearance of the library is of traditional Chinese palatial architecture. It is designed by an American architect, Mr. F.H.Kales. What a surprise! On the top is erected seven-ring tripod, with heating chimney installed on the roof. The reinforced concrete framed structure and combined steel rack for the bearing was adopted in structural technology. On the ridge, ring corridor, and eaves are delicate ornaments of entwining dragons, cloudings, bucket arches, fairies and animals. It’s the knowledge treasury and academic status as well as a significant site for visitors.
2.Wuhan university administrative building
One of the distinctive characteristics of the buildings on Luojia campus is that they are built according to the topography of the hill and groping variation in order. There are more hills and less land on Luojia campus. Kales, architect and designer of the campus, solved the problem.
The sculpture is given to Wuhan University as a present by the 81st and 82nd students graduated from this university. Kunpeng is an animal in   Chinese fairly tale. In the North Sea, there’s a huge fish called “Kun”. As it swims, the water under its fin splashes 3,000 miles high. When it changes into a bird, it is called “Peng”, which can fly in the cloud of 90,000 miles high.
3.The Cherry Castle
In 1938, Wuhan was occupied by the Japanese invaders. Luojia Hill became the central headquarter and field hospital of Japanese army in Central China. It is not until eight years later that Anti-Japanese War ended in victory for us. The first cherry blossom was planted by the Japanese. However, as the florescence of cherry blossom is twenty to thirty years, the cherry blossoms now are absolutely not the original ones. A professor of Wuhan University has kept a record of the various data of cherry blossom for 60 years, which is even earlier than Japanese.
Are your used to a tidy and well-equipped laboratory? Are you often troubled by the lack of equipment and reagents? Yes we are. We do not even have an aspetic operating board functioning well. Sometimes we were scared by the loud voice emitted by the clapped-out centrifuge with broken lid. The fact that depressed us was that our PCR machine always went wrong. So to avoid being"

0.5 ul vector (200ng/ul)
Pipet up and down 5-10 times to mix (do not vortex) and aliquot 3.5 ul per tube. Add 1.5 ul finish PCR product (after verification of successful PCR by gel electrophoresis).  Total reaction volume should be 5ul.
Note: this is a very small reaction volume. As such, use of PCR tubes gives you more control when manipulating the reagents in the tube. If you are only setting up one ligation, you must set up a 10 ul ligation. At no time should you be trying to pipet 0.5 ul as our pipets are highly inaccurate below 1 ul.
Reaction Conditions
Incubate at 4oC overnight.
Bacterial Transformation
Preparation
This is the easiest step to ""mess up"" in the entire workflow. Cells must be kept cold at all times! Chill labeled tubes, ligation mixes, etc., on ice prior to mixing of cells and DNA (ligation mix). Other hints are listed below.
Never thaw frozen cells in your hand; always plunge frozen cells in ice and allow to thaw there. As soon as they thaw, they start dying. The more time passes (up to the point where SOC is added) the more they die and the less transformants you'll get. Also, never heat the cells prematurely; make sure your timing for the heat shock step is precise.
Check to make sure the water bath is holding at 42°C. If it is not, but is just slightly under (still above 40°C), that's fine. If it is too hot add a small amount of ice to bring it down; notify TAs so temperature can be adjusted. Do not adjust the temperature yourself.
Get one LB/Carb/IPTG/Xgal plate per transformation from 4°C, label, and put on bench top.
Obtain SOC and make sure it's sterile (it should be totally transparent). This should be prepared for you by the TAs in advance, but if you are curious about what it contains:

However, in view of the absence of interlaboratory tests among the laboratories accredited by WADA, the analysis was not performed on the Olympic samples; it was only performed on samples selected exclusively for research. ( Pereira, et al. 2017 )
2018: ADOPE
Our enthusiastic team set out to tackle gene doping to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. Read more about our project here.
Because the niche market for gene doping detection method is still empty of tests that are actually implemented, a market analysis of this niche is hard to make. We can however analyze the doping detection field as a whole. We spoke with Mr. Olivier de Hon from the Dutch anti-doping authority on how to enter this market. “ What matters in the doping world is this: is it effective and scientifically validated? If the answer is two times “yes”, laboratories can use your method or will even have to use it obligatory. You need to convince the WADA, and more specifically the Laboratory Expert Group.” This is the way to realize implementation.
“What matters in the doping world is this: is it effective and scientifically validated? If the answer is two times “yes”, laboratories can use your method or will even have to use it obligatory. You need to convince the WADA, and more specifically the Laboratory Expert Group.”
Olivier De Hon, Dutch Doping authority
Before we can start convincing the WADA, we will need to pass two important first hurdles. We need to have enough funding to continue development, and we need to ensure that once we have convinced the WADA, we remain their detection method of choice. As a first mover, this is an important consideration. We need to continue being the best gene doping detection method even after others enter the market. This is important: by being the best we can be, we force other methods in development to be even better, thus helping the field advance more rapidly.
The steps then, to enter the gene doping detection market, are clear:
Identify how we can develop the best possible detection method.
Gather enough funding to complete development.
Demonstrate a method that is efficient.
Demonstrate a method that is properly scientifically validated.
Implementation by convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert Group of the efficiency and scientific validation of the method.
This is the road to letting our detection method have a positive impact in the doping world.
Realization
We have started taking the steps needed to reach our final goal of convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert"

Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". To gain a deeper understanding of biology in the 21st century, we need to integrate knowledge from various disciplines, while biology-based solutions to societal problems can influence the world more profoundly.
In the following sections, we will guide you through our human practice in detail.
Investigation of the educational background of iGEMers
Figure. 1 shows the numbers of teams per country (2007-2018)
Figure. 2A shows the number of teams in each year (2007-2018)
Figure. 2B shows the proportions of teams from
different regions in each year (2007-2018).
In 2007, only 61 teams from around the world participated in iGEM, but iGEM has now attracted more than 300 teams for three consecutive years (305 teams in 2016, 338 teams in 2017, 370 teams in 2018). Since 2015, IGEM has teams from Africa every year.
Overall, it was evident that the number of teams increased with the years. Although the teams mainly come from Asia, North America and Europe, we find more and more African and Latin American teams participating in this important event in the field of synthetic biology. We have reason to believe that the influence of iGEM in developing countries is gradually increasing.
In addition, we find that iGEM's influence in Asia, especially in the Western Pacific, is gradually increasing. Asia has become an important pillar in iGEM that cannot be ignored.

In the 2009-2013 track selection, ‘Foundational Research’ was among the top 3 most popular tracks in all the five years, indicating that in the early days of iGEM, many iGEM teams focused on fundamental aspects of synthetic biology. Following tracks were ‘Environment’, ‘Health’ and ‘New Applications’, occurring in the top 3 tracks for 4, 3 and 3 years, respectively, showing that environmental and health issues were also of great concern to iGEM teams.
In 2014, iGEM officially made major adjustments to the tracks, adding the resources of ‘Community labs’, ‘Hardware’, ‘Measurement’, ‘Microfluidics’, ‘Arts & Design’, and split the original ‘Food & Energy’ into ‘Energy’ and ‘Food & Nutrition’ in 2014, as well as ‘Health’ into ‘Diagnostics’ and ‘Therapeutics’ in"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description-backup_-_-_TEXT.html," “a threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.
antibiotic resistance poses a catastrophic threat. If we don't act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can't be treated by antibiotics.
Professor Dame Sally Davies

March 2013
The World Health Organisation’s antibiotic resistance Global Report on Surveillance, reports increasing worldwide incidences of antimicrobial resistance, in particular antibiotic resistance. This highlights very high rates of resistance in bacteria that cause common healthcare associated and community-acquired infections, such as UTIs [ 1 ]. UTIs account for over 7 million doctor visits per year. Catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, and there is a high incidence of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria that cause UTIs globally [ 2 ].
Biofilms
Major structural elements of bacterial biofilms.
Biofilms are aggregates of surface-associated microorganisms that are encased in a matrix of highly-hydrated extracellular polymeric substances, which include extracellular polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, as well as proteins [ 6 ]. Van Leeuwenhoek, using his simple microscopes in 1684, first observed microorganisms on tooth surfaces and can be credited with the discovery of microbial biofilms. ""The number of these animalcules in the scurf of a man's teeth are so many that I believe they exceed the number of men in a kingdom."" - Leeuwenhoek
We now know a great deal more about biofilms. Environmental changes are responsible for the transition from planktonic growth to biofilm [ 13 ] and cause changes in the expression of surface molecules, virulence factors, and metabolic status. This allows the bacteria to acquire properties that enable their survival in unfavourable conditions [ 14,15 ], such as in the presence of antibiotics. The low nutrient and oxygen levels at the bottom of the biofilm give rise to metabolically-inactive bacteria. As such, these persister cells are rendered unsusceptible to most traditional antibiotics, which rely on bacterial metabolism to exert cell-killing effect [ 7 ].
UTIs
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of all microbial infections [ 16 ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which causes an"
