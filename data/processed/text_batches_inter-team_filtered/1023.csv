Application of our uniCAS toolkit
Overview
Our toolkit opens up the possibility to deal with a wide range of yet unadressed scientific questions in the near future, including the field of systems biology and complex metabolic engineering approaches. Other advantages cover monetary and logistic aspects, as the only component for modification lies indeed within the crRNA itself. In turn, this can be ordered as two corresponding forward and reverse primers - see Team Freiburg's easy crRNA Design Tool . Logistic, financial and human ressources stay at a minimum using the uniCas toolkit for gene regulation. Accordingly, CRISPR/Cas9 systems have already been established for many model organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio and Mus musculus.
Our toolkit inspired leading scientists from the University of Freiburg, providing a cornucopia of possibilities ! In the following, we want to further point out some possible application techniques.

Stem Cell Reprogramming
Notably in 2012, the Nobelprize for Medicine was awarded to Shinya Yamanaka and John Burdon, two outstanding experts and pionieers in stem cell research. In a 2006 and 2007 Cell paper, Yamanaka and his colleagues described an approach to reprogram somatic fibroblast cells of both mice and humans to what they termed ""induced Pluripotent"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

requires high amounts of buffer. However, as mentioned in the Labautomation-section [soll ein Link sein], the company Labcyte developed a system to use acoustic waves for pipetting nanoliter droplets into microtiter plates in a very fast manner.   Now they invented an acoustic mass spectrometer, which combines acoustic nanodroplet formation with mass spectrometry.   The device is able to measure 3 samples per second without the need of a mobile phase.   Such a device could be used instead of biosensor-based flow cytometry to broader the applicability of our metabolic engineering workflow.

Fermentation: Butanol
Background:
With our world’s rapid industrial growth and increasing globalization of the consumer market, we have created an energy crisis that our planet can’t sustain for much longer. Rising demand for high energy liquid fuel has only driven us further to our dependency on a resource that is quickly depleting around the world; this is of course fossil fuels. We must, as a single people, begin looking for a renewable or at a minimum a live carbon solution if we are to have any chance of preventing a global catastrophe that will endanger all that humanity has achieved in our brief existence. However the reality of the situation is that the technology and resources to rectify our predicament already exist and have so for several years.  Bio-Butanol is a viable and greater alternative to current fossil fuels, due to bio-butanol’s carbon sequestering of today’s plants. Fossil fuels rely on atmospheric carbon that died millions of years ago while bio-butanol relies on sources that were grown within that year. Expansion of current methods could greatly reduce the impact and even slow the destruction of the planet, however if we hope to halt the issue definitively, we must take responsibility for our energy harvesting and use our technologies to their fullest potential. Existing bio-butanol production relies on an engineered Clostridium acetobutylicum that converts sugars into the desired 1-butanol, via its solventogenic pathway. However, as many researchers and industrialists have noted, working with the Clostridium has proven difficult due to its additional byproducts: butyrate, acetone, and ethanol making the control over the yield of butanol difficult. Along with a short and spore forming life cycle Clostridium is far from an excellent producer of butanol.
Aims:
The aim was to produce butanol through this fermentation pathway. The focus was converting glucose to butanol by creating two fusion genes to complete the pathway from Butyryl Coa to Butanol. One from Shewanella and one consisting of native ACD and Aldy genes from HVO.  In addition, we wished to grow multiple cultures both aerobically and anaerobically, and at different pHs, to test solvent production without modification. We were looking for butyric acid and/or"

（5）On July 13th ------ Biogrowing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co. Ltd
    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,", measures the fluorescence of the entire population of cells, the fluorescence can be   affected by the concentration of cells and hence show a response that is not all-or-none. Looking at Groningen’s results, it would be more appropriate to say that the population of  cells that is transformed with plasmid containing BBa_K607036 ( BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0840 ) showed gradual response to increasing arabinose concentration.
Different genetic context could be responsible for the different response of the PBAD promoter.
Due to lack of manpower, unfortunately, we could not produce 3-D graphs for cells with pSB1C3 backbone as controls. Assuming that Groningen 2011 result was valid, we can speculate  that difference of the PBAD promoter response could have resulted from the different backbone that we have used to characterize the promoter. In fact, Cambridge 2011,  who also observed all-or-none response ( Experience page. ) used pSB3K3 as backbone for their constructs. Without proper  controls, it is hard to make a conclusion.
Methods
Construction
1. Construct pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240
2. Transforming pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 to DH10B, DH5α, and BW25113.
3. Transforming pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 (Standard Constitutive Promoter/Reference Promoter) from the 2014 Distribution Kit to DH10B,  DH5α, and BW25113.
4. Transforming pSB3K3 BBa_E0240 (GFP generator) from the 2014 Distribution Kit to DH10B, DH5α, and BW25113.
Measurement
1. Preparing supplemented M9 medium
(M9 Minimal salt medium protocols could be seen on the Protocols page, or download the PDF file)
2. Culturing E. coli DH10B strain carrying the whole construct listed on the construction part. Grow cell culture overnight (Incubate 37°C and shake for 15 hours) with M9  minimal medium (we used Corning® 96 well storage system storage block, 2 mL, V-bottom, sterile to culture the cells, and Corning® microplate sealing tape white Rayon (with acrylic), sterile, suitable for cell/tissue culture applications, breathable sterile membrane.)
3. Take out 20-30μl of overnight cell culture (we used Multichannel Pipetman) and mix it with M9"

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Most people expect lower price.
And we also collect views of the public on the popularity of allergen testing and the privacy of personal allergen information. As the bar charts demonstrated below, over 36% of respondents highly agree that allergen testing is worth popularizing while approximate same proportion of respondents highly disagree that the personal allergen information should be accessible to the public. This result implies us that respondents expect the popularity of allergen testing but also worry about the privacy protection of personal allergen information.
Opinions on whether allergen testing should be popularizing are divided.
Summary
The analysis of the questionnaire survey results helps us to point out the characteristics of the sample, which also makes contributions to evaluate our sampling methods. It also gives us follow inspirations about our human practice activities and project developments.
As the result of survey, the allergen testing is not as popular as we expect in China. So, we tend to design a human practice activity to popularize knowledge about allergy and allergen testing. The targeted population should be those who suffer from allergy but have not taken it serious enough. Also, we want to share more knowledge about allergy to the kids because they are harder to express their feeling than adults. Thus, we choose to hold an exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum.
From the result, we have some ideas about the stakeholders and potential users of our project. They can be population who suffer from frequently allergy and are eager to find a convenient and cheap way to do allergen testing, at the same time the personal allergen information of them can also keep privacy safely. Besides, we should try to co-operate with hospitals and medical school to get more information about allergen testing methods used in clinic now and the feedback of patients.
We try to design a hardware that can ensure our testing can even run in family by people without professional knowledge. This kind of household allergen testing is ultimately convenient and cheap, also it protects the privacy of patient well.

A visit to Peking Union Medical College Hospital
On Sep. 22nd, 2018, 3 representations of Tsinghua-A went to PUMCH to meet two clinicians that we have contacted previously.
The first clinician was Dr. Gu, from the department of allergy.
At the beginning, Dr. Gu gave us a very perspicuity demonstration on allergy reactions. Our talk went through the whole 4 types of allergic reactions in clinical definitions respectively, including the causes, the symptoms, the biochemical processes in cells, and how will doctors treat with those situations. Dr. Gu’s review helped us to clarify a lot of details"

Keep in mind that lab spaces are not entirely meant for a large group of students. Prior to deciding on the exact date and time for your event, try and put out a survey to see how many students are actually interested. This will help you decide whether you should have one or two sessions and whether or not they should be on the same time and date or not.
Before finalizing the details for the event just prepare a timeline and run it through the instructor as well as the volunteers teaching the students so everyone is on the same page.
If someone within your team or outside of your team is making a commitment for the event that is critical for its execution, ensure that they either understand that once they make a commitment to a certain time they cannot leave or make them sign a contractual form binding them to the event. This will ensure no last minute cancellations.
EXTERNAL WORKSHOPS
Community Brick (Synthetic Biology and You, Gr.11)
The purpose of this event is to education younger generation (Gr. 11 and 12 students) about the field of synthetic biology, what it involves and what kind of future it holds for them. The idea behind it is to let them be aware of the opportunities out there for them in the field of science.
This workshop involves a selected science class from the local high school to come to campus for a whole day event. Being able to contact a High School teacher and letting them know about this opportunity for their students is the main part. It is slightly easier for the beginning year to keep it limited to local High Schools just because that way you are limiting any communication and travelling issues. Team members could also get in touch with their old high school science teacher to see if they are interested to attend.
If the teacher is hearing about this for the first time it is usually beneficial to have brochures, pamphlets or postcards to distribute to the prospects. This makes sure that they leave with enough information to get them to start thinking about the idea of getting their students to come and learn about synthetic biology.
Sometimes getting in touch with teachers can be hard. If you University/College has outreach programs that associate with high schools, get in touch with them, they can be a great aid in terms of networking with the High School teachers.
Keep in mind that even if the High School is local, there needs to be a written contest of the teacher agreeing to perform this activity on the given date and any changes made should be informed to the other party in a well advanced notice. This should also be run through the school’s administration to avoid any last minute changes or cancellations."

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," backbone, however, the backbone switch of R0011 also to PSB1C3 was not successful, probably owing to the small length of the RBS. On the other hand, the construction of J13002+hpaC was finally sent in for sequencing too, pending results. Site-directed mutagenesis of the dsz operon was also initiated - dszA has four PstI cut sites. dszB has a PstI and a NotI site. dszC has two PstI cut sites. Mutagenesis was started this week to change a single base pair in these genes in a way that the cut site is eliminated but the amino acid the gene codes for stays intact. In addition another mutagenesis has to be performed in order to replace the Tyr at position 63 of dszB gene with a Phe. Ohshiro 2007 showed that this mutation increases the activity of the enzyme.  The mutagenesis was started by mutating the second PstI site in dszC (PstI2) and a control plasmid containing a point mutated β-galactosidase gene was also mutated with its specific primers. Kappa Hifi kit was used for all the mutagenesis. After the PCR mutagenesis and running a part of the PCR products on the gel, amplification was observed. Then the PCR products were DpnI digested to degrade the parental DNA and they were transformed. Control PCR products were plated on an amp plate containing IPTG and X-gal. The colonies that grew on the control plates were blue indicating that the mutagenesis had worked and the β-galactosidase gene was now functional. Then O/N culture of dszC mutants were miniprepped and digested with PstI enzyme and the results were successful (Lisa gel pic).
Attempts to do all the mutations in the genes in one step using the Knight procedure failed (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Knight:Site-directed_mutagenesis/Multi_site). This procedure used Taq ligase buffer. We suspected that the reason this procedure is not working might be that the Kappa polymerase is not functional in Taq ligase buffer. Therefore we did some experiments on the controls in Taq ligase kit and kappa polymerase kit to find out the buffer that they both work best in. The result was that both enzymes (kappa polymerase and Taq ligase) work best in a buffer made of half Taq ligase buffer and half kappa polymerase buffer.

Plate reader and pSR01:
the Bauer plate reader seems to have worked very well, bu† unfortunately none of our pSR01-transformed colonies grew.  This is probably because the plates were a couple weeks old.  Unfortunately our glycerol stock of the strain also is missing, so we will try growing up some of the colonies in case on of them works.  Otherwise, we will grow up ∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ and transform again.
Transformation: usual protocol, about 100µL DNA, recovery 2hrs, plate 1µL, 10µL, 100µL.

The kan plates from the transformation all had colonies! We chose one from 2:17H and one from 3:11P to grow up in LB+kan for miniprep and glycerol stocks.
Ordered quikchange primers: for OZ052 and OZ123 we added the context bases 5' and 3' of the binding sequence (found in OPEN supplementary materials).  Since CODA did not include the extra bases, we left them the same as the original plasmid (i.e. Zif268's).

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," our knock out switch         is of paramount importance in our project. We have designed several measures to increase the efficiency of our knock         out switch. First is the implementation of two recombination deletion systems: Cre-lox and Dre-rox systems. Due to         the property of non-crossover recombination between Cre-rox or Dre-loxP, if one of our recombination systems fails,         other recombination system can still induce the deletion of the origin of replication, thus termination of the expression         of gene of interest and making our knockout switch doubly safe. Second is the use of mutant loxP sites, lox 66 and         lox 71. After the recombination between lox 71 and lox 66 sites, the characteristic property of these target site         prevents recombination back to the original state, increasing the efficiency of deletion.
Mechanism of Cre/lox system induced deletion
In the case of Cre protein, it recognizes 34 base pair sequences known as loxP sites. There are also mutants of the         recognition site, for example lox 66 and lox 71 which have distinctive activities from loxP site. The lox sequence         consists of asymmetric 8 bp sequences of spacer region (also called linker), which is flanked by 13 bp palindromic         repeats. Because of the asymmetrical properties of linkers, it provides a control of directionality of recombination         by Cre protein. When two lox sites have compatible linkers with identical orientations, Cre-mediated recombination         causes a deletion of the sequence in between the two lox sites.
Mechanism of Dre/rox system induced deletion
Dre protein is a Cre-like site-specific recombinase (SSR) which had diverged sufficiently to recognize its own recombination         site that is distinct from lox site named rox. The base pair of rox site is 32 (lox site has 34 bp). The rox site         is structurally similar to lox site. It also has two palindromic repeats but are 14 bp (lox site has 13 bp repeats)         and are separated by only 4bp linker sequence. Multiple research papers mention that there is no crossover recombination         between Cre-rox or Dre-loxP. (Brian L, 2004)

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," photosynthesis of the algae, which is fixed in the water, is influenced and limited by lots of factor.
Not only in the laboratory but also the factory, Culturing algae in the stirred-well mixed culturing vessel with fixed volume is a common way. Under the circumstances, we believe that those important parameters, which is related to the growth of the algae, are all isotropy. In another word, by only considering the result which is dependent on time, we can meet the requirements of the experiments, or even the production.
Thus, after weighing up the actual conditions, based on the combination of the existing model of the first order ordinary differential equations, we set up some second order ordinary differential equations to simulate the growth velocity - the algae’s dry weight of the time derivative. Furthermore, the results, which the model has simulated the growth condition of the algae in limited light and nutritive substance, quite tally with the actual situation. In some limiting cases, such as limited light with unlimited nutritive substance or unlimited light with limited nutritive substance, these equations can be simplified into some common first order ordinary differential equations.
Fig.1 The logical relationships among four parameters
Firstly, according to the flow figure below, we explain the logical relationship of the four important parameters of the model.
The growing speed of the alga in the incubator, A, which means the change of dry weight of the alga in unit interval is equal to the increase minus the decrease of the organic substance in the cells. The decrease is mainly based on two ways. One is the natural death and the other is the artificial separation of the useful mature alga.
The carbon dioxide in the water area is converted to saccharides by the photosynthesis of alga and then stored in the cells. This also shows the conclusion that the growth of the population density of the alga will accelerate the speed of the decrease of carbon dioxide. Hence the content of carbon is equal to the inflow minus the part which are converted by photosynthesis.
Similarly, the content of mineral substance in the water area M is also a factor which has its influence on photosynthesis. It will decrease faster when the amount of the alga is increasing as well.
In a certain space, the sum of the carbohydrate, S (exclusive that in the cell), can be considered as the result which the fixed sum of the photosynthesis subtracts the total sum of the increment of the dry weight and the decrement of the dry weight in the culturing medium (death, artificial extraction).
The quantitative relationships among four parameters shows below:

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2011,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#EGEN2_-_-_TEXT.html," the energy is released as heat. Thus the ocean isactually a gigantic energy reservoir. Its energy is transformed from solarenergy and stored as salinity potential. When sea water mixes with fresh waterfrom river, massive amount of energy is released.
Fig.1  Cycles of mixing-entropy battery.

Recently, some institutes are devotinggreat efforts to seek efficient methods of extracting energy released frommixing sea water and fresh water. Mixing-entropy battery is thus designed toconvert salinity potential to electricity1(Fig. 1). One pair of electrodes can specifically bind sodium ions or chlorideions, thus separating the charge when they are immersed in high salinitysolution, while decreasing the sodium chloride concentration in the solution.During this process, electrons in the cathode flow across electrical wires andreach the anode when there is complete electric circuit, since the immobilenegative charges (chloride) accumulating in the cathode repels electrons, whileimmobile positive charges (sodium) accumulating in the anode attract electrons.When the electrodes achieve equilibrium with the solution, there is no electriccurrent anymore. The next step is to immerse full-loaded electrodes in freshwater. Due to the salinity difference, sodium ions and chloride ions arereleased from the electrodes and those exceeded electrons in anode flow back tocathode to resume the original state. When the equilibrium is achieved, theelectrodes are re-immersed to high salinity water to start another cycle1.
 
However thismethod only has high efficiency near estuaries. To solve this limitation, were-design this method using halorhodopsin-transformed E. coli. In our project, we fabricated the pair of electrodesaccording to W. Guo’s method2 and withdrewcurrents from the battery. This is the first attempt to generate electricityfrom light energy by microorganism system in iGEM competition.

Since  CRISPR-P's results page displays only 20 off-target sites, Optimized CRISPR Design’s results page displays only 50 off-target sites, so we can see from the table: For the previous 11 sgRNA, the number of our software’s NGG off-target sites are exactly the same with the other two software. This result can be a strong evidence for the availability of our software.
For example, the comparison figure of the sgRNA of ranking 5rd (in CRISPR-P):
CRISPR-P-------5 NGG off-target sites
CRISPR-X------5 NGG off-target sites
Optimized CRISPR Design ------5 NGG off-target sites
The comparison figure of the sgRNA of ranking 9th (in CRISPR-P):
CRISPR-P-------8 NGG off-target sites
CRISPR-X------8 NGG off-target sites
Optimized CRISPR Design ------8 NGG off-target sites
In summary, in the case of the same input sequence, the output sgRNA results of our software have the same number of the output sgRNA, the same sequence information, the same location information and the same NGG off-target sites with the other two CRISPR design tools—CRISPR-P and Optimized CRISPR Design. Therefore, our software—CRISPR-X, is valid and available.

The main idea of our project is to detect pollen by a DNA-based method, but another plan has been also to differ between the different types of pollen. Concerning this, we mainly focused on the pollen most commonly causing allergic reactions in our area. To analyze and to extract the DNA, we had to break open the outer layer of the pollen. Some attempts to mechanically or chemicaly open pollen are described here: Pollen
Pollen have an outer (exine) and inner (intine) layer, parts of which consist of pectine and cellulose (Assays) . Therefore,we wanted to use Escherichia coli to produce enzymes which are able to dismantle these substances and hereby break open the pollen.
For this purpose we chose the following enzymes:
Out of the Bacillus subtilis the genes pelB and yesZ and out of Xanthomonas campestris the gene pelB. The genes pelB out of B.sub. and Xan. Code for pectinases or pectin lyases, yesZ being a beta-glucosidase, which could have enhanced the further dismanteling of the shell.
The BioBricks are supposed to be assembled performing a Gibson Assembly. For this we isolated the DNA of Bacillus subtilis and Xanthomonas campestris B100 and amplified the genes with specific primers. We wanted to clone the genes into psb1C3 and send them in. Using the E.coli vector pz9 availible to us in our lab we planned to characterize the genes. All in all we were trying to perform 6 clonings (3 clonings into psb1C3 and 3 into pz9). The psb1C3 constructs can"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," increase the efficiency of the carbon fixation process substantially. As for the Calvin cycle parts, we corresponded with the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team on their experience of the implementation of the carboxysome, and received the two parts that together contained the cso operon from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. These parts were BBa_K1465204 , containing csoS2, and BBa_K1465209 , containing csoS3, csoS14, and csoS1D. As part of the optimisation, we aimed to combine these parts into one part containing the entire cso operon, as shown on Figure 1. Furthermore, a promoter was required to drive the gene expression. For this purpose, Ptac was chosen, as for the genes encoding the Calvin cycle enzymes.
Figure 1. The envisaged design of the carboxysomal genes, encoded in the composite part, BBa_K2449030 , under control of the Tac-promoter.
We succeeded in assembling both carboxysome parts in the composite part, BBa_K2449030 , but for some inexplicable reason, this composite part likewise emerged difficult to clone with the Tac-promoter. Therefore, it was decided to focus at other aspects of the project and, as for the Calvin cycle part, keep this part theoretical henceforth.
A fitting approach to verify the expression of the genes involved in carbon fixation, could consist of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). For this, one could build upon the experience obtained by the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team .
In order to test the functionality of the parts we had hoped to assemble, we had reached out to Nordcee , which is a major research group within the Department of Biology at SDU. Our hope was to compare the carbon fixation rates for cultures expressing the Calvin cycle enzymes alone and in combination with the carboxysome, whereby the effectivity of the microcompartment also would have been assessed. In cooperation with Nordcee, measurements of CO2 decrease in an airtight culture would have been carried out with an infrared CO2analyser. Another test approach would have been using 14CO2, and then measure the amount our organism had taken in.

GMOs‘s regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Valencia_UPV started in August. We discussed about our projects over a Skype on the 3rd of August. Due to the different application areas, it was complicated to set up an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                        We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Utiel-Requena (Valencia) and La Rioja; they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.  See feedbacks here LINK (to our wiki).                       On our side, we answered to the few questions they had to complete their Human Practices project.                      These questions helped them to have an overview about how their project will be seen in other countries depending on the regulation.
""The collaboration has helped us to define a part of our Human Practices. We wanted to know the social opinion about GMO crops and the current situation about their human consumption in each part of the world. That's important for us because our project depends on it social acceptation.""

Due to the completely different application areas there was little room for an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.                      We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Krini and Trikala and another from Thessaloniki (Greece); they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.                       On our side, we presented their project “pANDORRA” to some of our human practices contacts and forwarded their surveys, one to bioethics experts and regulators and another to synthetic biology experts.                     These surveys helped them get an overview of how regulation linked to their project works in France and also to have information about synthetic biology related to their project from French experts.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Research should be an open environment - a heterogeneous landscape filled with professionals from different genders, ethnicities and religious beliefs. However, today this is not fully true, with a skewed ratio of men and women within academic research. Together with Women in Science, a non-profit organization at Karolinska Institutet aiming at providing networks for women within academia, the Human Practices team hosted an event for women and non-binary high school students to talk about how crooked the path can be in becoming a scientist, and how important it is with women in science. The event was interactive, and we created a dialog between the speakers and the audience which resulted in a great discussion. The audience was asked what they thought of when hearing “female scientist”.

A jellyfish on the Lucite board was grasped by the nails of the disk and rotated by the stick, which was held between the index finger and thumb. The setup worked, at least in principle.
A number of improvements were made over the next two years. A razor blade was installed at the edge of the Lucite board; the razor blade and the rotating circular blade were in contact each other on their flat sides and the jellyfish was cut at the intersection of the two cutting edges. It made cutting so sharp and smooth that the jellyfish might not even feel that their rings were being cut off. To make the rotation ofjellyfish easy, a seawater outlet was installed near the center of the board to lubricate its surface. An ice bath was installed to cool the ring reservoir; this prevented a loss of activity from the rings and also served as a preparation for the extraction process. In the summer of 1969, the quality of the machine-cut rings finally surpassed that of the hand-cut ones. We therefore set up two cutting machines and used them, thereafter, to cut all of the jellyfish.
With machines that could cut rings at 10 times the speed of a hand-cutter, and with a sufficient supply of jellyfish, our mode of operation had to be changed. We needed a large working space, and we also did not want to disturb other researchers with our messy, smelly, and noisy experimental processes. Fortunately, we were assigned to use the Gear Locker, a small, isolated building that had been used for storage in the past. Two large tanks installed outside the building were used for temporary storage of collected jellyfish.
Ring cutting was probably the most important step in determining the quality and yield of purified aequorin. Cutting too thick would increase the amount of impurities. Cutting too thin would decrease the yield because some of the light organs were cut through and destroyed. Therefore, we always assigned the best workers to do this job. Of the many excellent helpers we had in our jellyfish operation, I remember particularly three girls who worked for many summers and cut rings extremely skillfully and fast: Debby Nash, Liz Illg, and Laura Norris; the first was from the town and the other two were daughters of biology professors.
Our jellyfish cutting usually began at 11 AM. A counting person would put 80 jellyfish into each bucket, already half-full of seawater, and would then take the buckets to the cutters. Two cutters cut the jellyfish with the"

Public and Environmental Safety
The E. coli K-12 and B strains are quite unlikely to represent any danger to animals, plants and micro-organisms. In our particular case, given the safeguards that we have implemented, our GMOs are still safe to the environment. Moreover all our protocols and experiments were carefully planned and executed. There was limited exposure of our genetically modified organisms to the outside environment due to the containment and safety rules followed while working at the bio-lab.
The most important aspect of our project was to modify E. coli by controlling part of its genome. Our modifications should not raise safety issues in terms of public safety, because according to the EPA the Escherichia coli K-12 we use within our project doesn't represent a direct threat to human health. The E. coli K-12 and B strains are not considered a human or animal pathogen. Furthermore, it has a poor ability to colonize  the colon and generate infections. Moreover, it can easily be eliminated with ethanol.
Patient Safety
Considering the applications that our project could have in the near future, the main risk to the health of the patients would be the potential occurrence of DNA mutations on any part of our device. If e.g. the promoter or any other regulatory component engineered in the bacterium were to lose it's functionality as result of a mutation, there is a possibility that the CEST proteins production would not be effective or that the safety mechanisms would be inactivated. The latter could cause major issues like sepsis. Even though mutations are unlikely to occur, it is still important issue consider. Therefore different types of safety locks should added to the device.

Our system can work if we can prove the ""in-promoter"" will have different activities under different concentrations of inhibitor and the inhibitor can be used as a signal to sense the plasmid numbers. So we need to do two things to prove that our system could work. Our modeling part is aim at solving the two main problems to model the situation in the experiment and application.
·EXPERIMENT part·
Aim
To model the different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor and the relationship between the inhibitor and ""in-promoter"".
Find out the threshold of inhibitors’ concentration which can decide whether the ""in-promoter"" expresses or not.
FIRST step: The relationship between the ""in-promoter"" activity and inhibitor.
In this part, in order to model the situations with different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor, we use the PBAD promoter induced by different concentrations of the arabinose in this circuit (Fig. 1).
Fig.1 The circuit constructed to model the situations with different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor.
So ""in-promoter"" will be repressed on different levels under the different concentration of the inhibitor.
We can separate this circuit into two parts. For the first part (Fig. 2), after adding the different concentration of arabinose, the AraC protein will combine with the arabinose and form a complex. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the downstream inhibitor. The reaction direction is along the direction of the DNA → mRNA → inhibitor protein (Fig. 2).
Fig.2 AraC protein will combine with the arabinose and form a complex. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the downstream inhibitor.
For the second part (Fig. 3), the inhibitor protein will combine with the ""in-promoter"" sequence to negatively control the expression of the RFP protein.
Fig.4 The inhibitor protein will combine with the ""in-promoter"" sequence to negatively control the expression of the RFP protein.
According to this mechanism, we modeled this circuits to build the relationship between the RFP intensity and the arabinose. Main considerations in this model are the process of repression, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis.
The assumptions we made are:

The model has utility for anyone trying to grow mycelium within a mold. The user will input the size of the initial sample, the size of the mold, and the number of days given to grow. The model will tell the user whether the mold would be filled or not. Furthermore, the model will tell the user how much mycelium was grown in the time given.
Discussion
Before this model, there had been no published model to accurately simulate mycelial growth, let alone within the constraints of a mold. The Eden model was a necessary but insufficient starting point for this model, and the reference used can be found at this link: http://www.jfgouyet.fr/fractal/fractauk/chapter4.pdf. Overall, the ability to accurately simulate mycelial growth is useful for anyone attempting to use mycelium as a building material. The model was able to simulate mycelial growth accurately, adhering to the results obtained in the lab with high fidelity. The code base is given in plaintext below. Finally, the code is extensively commented. Please refer to the code base below if you require further clarification.

Tokyo_Tech,2016,Team:Tokyo Tech#Modeling Details_-_-_TEXT.html," under Plux induced by C12.
The mRNAs of Snow White coli and the Queen coli decrease from original degradation and the cleavage at ACA sequences by MazF dimers. On the other hand, those of the Prince coli don’t have any MazF genes so they decrease from original degradation only.
After translation, C4 and C12 are enzymatically synthesized by LasI and RhlI from some substrates respectively.
For simplicity, we assumed that the amount of substrates is sufficient so that the C4 and C12 synthesis rate per cell is estimated to be proportional to the LasI and RhlI concentrations.C4 decreases from original degradation only meanwhile C12 decreases from both original degradation and degradation by AmiE, which the Prince coli produces.
Applying mass action kinetic laws, we obtain the following set of differential equations.
$$ \frac{d[mRNA_{RhlI}]}{dt} =  leak_{Plux} + \frac{\kappa_{Lux}[C12]^{n_{Lux}}}{K_{mLux}^{n_{Lux}} + [C12]^{n_{Lux}}} - d[mRNA_{RhlI}] - F_{DiMazF}f[mRNA_{RhlI}][DiMazF] $$

BostonU,2015,Team:BostonU#Mammalian synbio#Current Challenges_-_-_TEXT.html," subsequent cloning. One issue with this standard is that mammalian parts are quite large, and with many internal restriction sites it is difficult to remove these so that they are easily cloned as BioBricks.
Our team noticed this problem during our own project. In order to clone some of our parts (~1-5kB) as BioBricks, we found many instances of 2-3 internal EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, and PstI sites in these parts. We are thankful for the IDT offer that enabled us to eliminate some of these sites and synthesize our parts such that they were BioBrick compatible.
The other option for part submission is to use the MammoBlock standard proposed by the MIT 2010 and 2011 teams. MammoBlocks utilizes a recombination-based assembly and is able to bypass the original BioBrick conformity requirements. However, cloning MammoBlock parts requires Gateway assembly, which is expensive and proprietary, and may therefore be infeasible for many teams.
Awareness
We recognized that overall awareness about mammalian synthetic biology efforts may be limited in the iGEM community.
Lower Knowledge of Research
For our team, we were fortunate to receive a lot of guidance and resources from our lab members. In particular, our PIs Dr. Mo Khalil and Dr. Wilson Wong are very interested in studying cutting-edge eukaryotic synthetic biology systems, particularly for translational health and therapeutic applications.
When a new team begins their iGEM journey, they may be inspired by past projects. Many of these notable examples stem from engineering classic microbes, such as E. coli, and these sources of inspiration serve as an important platform for how teams develop new project ideas.
We think that if the iGEM community had the opportunity to learn more about emerging mammalian synthetic biology research and applications, this may inspire more future iGEM teams to attempt this research.
Lower Incentive or Reward
We more broadly thought of this problem in terms of how certain chassis may be well-suited or more optimal for different projects and applications, and furthermore if iGEM teams are hindered from pursuing these particular projects from purely a cost or resource standpoint. For example, teams that are interested in health and medicine applications and how their projects perform in a mammalian cell may not gravitate towards actually using this chassis because there is no incentive or reward for doing so, and the high cost vs. low resource dilemma may be too high of a barrier. Such a team might instead settle on a “less optimal” chassis. In contrast, teams that do actually perform research in the most"

Today we had a meeting with the Secretary of Sustainable Development of Amazon.  So freaking cooll!!
We also had a magna meeting!!! With all of our team members.
Transformation has finally worked!!!!!! Our biobricks were finally cloned into the bacteria!
- DH5α with BBa_E0840 – pSB1C3 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- DH5α with BBa_K346004 – pSB1C3 (Bioaccumulation biobrick).
- DH5α with positive control pUC72
Today we are going to inoculate the transformation in liquid LB media chloranphenicol 34ug/ml for miniprep purposes. We’re also going to inoculate JM110 with streptomycin 40ug/ml.
For the genetic constructions we are going to use the Xbal enzyme. To achieve this we need DNA without methylation dam. We cloned the bacteria into the (DH5α) dam positive, but we’re still going to transform the multiplied and concentrated plasmid into JM110, so that it will lose its methylation in the Xbal restriction sites.

Kevin transformed the CBAR product into DH10B and plated it. Hannah worked on developing a document that condenses all of the protocols used in the lab. Victoria worked to develop new primers for building the main construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Chris and Hannah began work on new Chemically Competent DH10B cells. Hannah completed PCR runs for her new primers that arrived today.
Tuesday, June 26, 2012 The transformation from the CBAR reaction Kevin did yesterday proved to be successful, and produced many colonies. Six of these were chose and cultured. They will be tested to see if they contain the complete construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on ligating components for the Codon Optimization Project. They also grew cultures containing components they would need later on in the assembly. Hannah ran PCR on some new segments of her final construct that just came in. These were later run in a CBAR. This new set of components would be better and produce the desired construct.
Wednesday, June 27, 2012
The cultures from the CBAR for the Multidirectional Promoters Project were mini-prepped and tested to see if they contained the correct components for the final construct. The gel to check this unfortunately did not set correctly and the cultures needed to be redone. Fortunately, Kevin had made a backup. Some additional colonies were also cultured to expand the search. Hannah worked on the sequencing primers for the Multidirectional Promoter construct. She also continued work on a document combining all of the protocols we use in the lab. Kait and Victoria completed digestions and ligations for the construction of their construct for the Codon Optimization Project.
Thursday, June 28, 2012
Cultures from the Multidirectional Promoters Project CBAR reaction were mini-prepped, again. 4 additional colonies were prepped to expand the search for the correct construct. These were then digested in preparation for use in a gel to confirm length. Hannah ran PCR on components for the Multiple Start Codon construct. She also inoculated cultures with colonies from one of her new CBAR reactions. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on their own PCR runs to make the new Codon Optimization construct.
Friday, June 29, 2012

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

""One of the largest barriers to microgravity research"", Dr. Dhoble said in an interview, ""is cost of a random positioning machine (RPM). This device is required to simulate microgravity for cell cultures. A small RPM costs around $10,000 commercially.""
We saw this as an opportunity to make an impact at the intersection of engineering and science. We designed, 3D-printed and tested a homemade RPM, effectively reducing the startup cost of microgravity research from $10,000 to ~$50. We will gladly share the 3D models for this device upon request, so that any iGEM team, researcher or hobbyist can pick up microgravity research with minimum cost and difficulty. It is our hope that the early work we have done here will set the precedent for future microgravity work.
This is the 3D model for our RPM. Come check us out at our exhibition table during the jamboree!

Repressor cooperativities bring down the rate of production of the protein in a multiplicative fashion via the hill function, which can be represented as (P represents protein concentration, n represents cooperativity) –
And again, as the cooperativity of the repressor changes, the level of the protein changes as follows –
Therefore, the high cooperativity promotes faster degradation. This fact was exploited by us for this purpose, employing repressors with the highest cooperativity from the 73 TetR homologs that were reported in Voigt’s paper (see references below). Thus, we were able to take care of the rise and fall times using these high cooperativity TetR homologs. The cooperativities and names of the repressors used in our system are as follows –

Holding the Constant ON State – Time Delay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once we were ensured that the rates would be faster, we next turned to holding the constant ON and OFF states, a property that square wave oscillators exhibit, and sinusoidal ones don’t.
In order to maintain its state once it is high, we required a time delay between when the level of a node rises and when it falls. This is taken care of by our square wave oscillator by having the two extra repressor nodes. Basically, the two nodes do not qualitatively change the state of the oscillations, since if A has to repress D, then now in our circuit, A represses B, which in turn now cannot repress C, and therefore C is produced, which represses D. Therefore, the effect remains the same, but there is a delay introduced. This is shown diagrammatically below –

A Visit to BGI
  July 23, 2012, two iGEM competition teams of our university SUSTC visited BGI for communication and learning from each other .
  Before this, our iGEM team members have held several journal clubs during the past semester to learn basic knowledge of synthetic biology, just before the summer vocation we decided our project, BioSearch iPhone App development for ShenZhen-A team, Transcription Terminator Efficiency Calculator for ShenZhen-B team. After 10 days summer training and work, both two teams have basic achievement on their projects. The urgent need is to communicate with other matured teams to get valuable advices and experimental experiences. So we visited BGI.
  During trip to BGI, iGEM team members first visited the BGI Exhibition Hall to know the development of BGI and their research result, (photos).
  In BGI military school, we saw the training classroom for beginners, library and practicing labs, then we went to the laboratory of BGI researchers, our iGEM team instructor Jiankui He introduced the principles of the sophisticated gene sequencing instruments there and watched the researchers’ demonstration. After the visit, we met team members of BGI(SHENZHEN team),introduced work progress, discussed and gave recommendations to each other on several issues we came across.
  
  
  
A Visit to HKUST
  On July 28, two SUSTC iGEM team visited HKUST to exchange experiences, show work progress with HKUST iGEM team.
  Our team have basically developed the BioSearch iPhone App, the other team of SUSTC also have almost finished their software part. Both of us want to get some useful recommendations from a matured iGEM team like HKUST and BGI.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," ensure that our plates actually had the insert, we ran a cross junction PCR on 8 colonies (diluting in 50 ul water). We also performed the cross junction PCR on some whole CB bottom plasmid, to see if there is a approxmiately 80 bp difference in the gel.
We used the following recipe for the reaction:
12.5 ul water
10 ul kapa
0.75 ul forward primer
0.75 ul reverse primer
0.5 ul template
gel
The expected product size if there is an insert is about 1500 bp, while the product without the insert is about 1400 bp. It is difficult to see whether there is a difference in the sizes of the bands.
We also sent the samples out for sequencing (with the reverse sequencing primer), to confirm whether or not our ligation was successful. If it is, then we will send out 96 samples for sequencing.

Biobricks
Zinc finger expression plasmid digests
Yesterday's digestions with LacI and LacIq did not work, so we tried again using a slightly different protocol from New England Biolab's Biobrick kit instructions .
Got the same odd doublet again
Digested one part with EcoR1 and one part with Spe1 to see if one of the enzymes would give us the expected ~50 bp fragment, but this also didn't work
We have concluded that there must be something wrong with the LacI and LacIq sequences.  Possibly one of the restriction sites is missing. We will abandon this version of the biobrick for the time being.
pSB1C3 shipping plasmid: 1st PCR cleanup failed, so we redigested using the New England Biolab's Biobrick kit instructions . Minelute produced a yield of 30 ng/uL, so a lot of DNA was lost but the concentration was still workable.
Zinc finger + omega subunit: Mineulte produced 77.8ng/uL
ZFB-hisura biobrick digests
PCR to add restriction sites to insert:
EcoXba ZFB_F and PstNotSpe URA_R primers; 10ng of Spe-ZFB-hisura-Xba as template; 25uL KAPA reactions
60C annealing and 90 sec elongation
Minelute of 4 reactions combined = 616 ng/uL

 Ink Production
      
The modeling portion of our project will allow us to estimate our pigment yields. The main pigment example that we are using is melanin. When designing the melA expression construct, we referenced from the Lagunas-Munoz et al., 2016 and we learned that the yields of melanin in E. coli are the highest at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and at a pH of 7.0. We will be using their experimental results as a model for what we should be expecting during our attempts to produce the melA tyrosinase and melanin in E. coli. As our system is modified from the system used in this paper to account for BioBrick standards and what we have available to us in the lab, we may be able to explain some differences in our production levels. We are using a different plasmid, cell strain, and will initially be using richer media.
The graphs below summarize some of the data obtained by Lagunas-Munoz et al., 2016. Firstly, they found that the cultures would reach stationary phase before melanin production would begin (or at least be detectable). Secondly, melanin would only be produced when the glucose in the media was consumed, which correlates with the culture reaching stationary phase. The group also found that melanin production was not favourable at growth temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius or higher. They found that the optimal balance between cell growth and melanin production occurred at 30 degrees. Using this information, we decided to grow our melA expressing cultures at 37 degrees until we induced expression with IPTG, then continue to grow the cultures at 30 degrees.

The samples were measured every 30 minutes at OD588 (λmax) and OD450 (λmin) using the BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega plate reader, under constant temperature of 37°C.  All points are the mean of 2 biological replicates for each plasmid, normalized to the blank with error bars = SD.
Figure 10 indicates that all of the E. coli CT and Ctrl plasmids had normal growth curve patterns over the 22-hours period with no detectable growth in the negative control.  Our data analysis based on the 588/450 OD ratio showed that there was no difference between the dynamics of chromoprotein expression by CT and Ctrl plasmids - even when the blue colour on Ctrl wells were clearly visible by naked eye. We also did not observe a blue colour change in our CT samples despite being induced by different ethanol concentrations (0-5%).
It is known that biological samples including individual cells in culture, tissues and subcellular structures contain particles which scatter visible light extensively [5]. We hypothesised that light scatter could be the factor that caused interference. To test if this was the case, we attempted to purify our proteins before proceeding to perform the spectrophotometry test. iGEM CU-Boulder 2013 had a similar attempt which they used purified amilCP protein samples to run an absorption spectrum test (400nm-600nm), which they successfully demonstrated the maximum absorbance value of amilCP chromoprotein (λmax=588nm), identical to the λmax value previously reported[3]. By using a similar approach, we managed to extract the AlcR protein from CT plasmid and amilCP blue chromoprotein from Ctrl plasmid using a BugBuster protein extraction kit. We then diluted the purified samples (1:10) using LB broth as diluent to see if we could identify the suitable parameters to validate our model. The purified samples were then used to perform an absorbance spectrum test (λ=350-650nm).

Server Part
The server of Biohub 2.0 are written in Python 3.6, which is an easy-to-write and cross-platform language and can lower the learning curve of developing plugins. We choose Django to be the basic framework, partly for it allows fast prototyping and large-scale deployment, partly for it already contains a matured plugin system (Django App Framework). However such plugin system is static, which means plugins cannot be loaded/unloaded during runtime. It will be a great deficiency for a website that may frequently alternate its components. To solve the problem, we build our own plugin system on the basis of the one in Django. We carefully monkey-patched Django's underlying implementation to make its core components (URL resolving, data model registration, and etc.) dynamically changeable,  whilst avoiding possible memory leaks. We also supplemented Django by adding many new features:
Hot Reload: Other processes can send SIGUSR1 signal to Biohub 2.0's worker processes to inform them that the installed plugin list has changed and the server needs to be reloaded. By this way the server can be renewed without stopping.
WebSocket Routing: Websocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, which is supported by most of modern browsers. Biohub 2.0 develops a customized protocol over Websocket, making it easier to route Websocket packets. We have used this protocol to achieve real-time notification sending and notifying accomplishment events in ABACUS plugin.
Background Tasks: As a website designed for synthetic biology, their must be many computation intensive tasks, which will blocks requests if handled inappropriately. Thus we split out and encapsulate this logic and make it an independent module. Background tasks can use websocket to notify certain events. Currently we have used in ABACUS computing.
The modules are all available for plugins, so developers can take advantages of them to build amazing artworks.
About the Bricks Data
Biohub 2.0 is constructed on the base of Biobricks data, which comes from two channels. We use the data downloaded from offical interface as our initial data. The initial data is actually a snapshot of iGEM, containing most information of the bricks. However certain fields, such as group name or parameters,"

Collaboration with NTHU-Taiwan
Collaboration Emphasis: Human Practices and Dry Lab work
This year, our team was able to collaborate with the NTHU-Taiwan iGEM team over the course of the fall semester, during which time we had several Skype sessions with members of the NTHU team. The NTHU team’s detection method for EDCs in water also addresses an important aspect of water contamination in our world and as such we were well equipped to aid each other in improving our respective projects. In the collaboration between our teams, we were able to help each other survey American opinions and knowledge on EDCs as well as Taiwanese knowledge of bacteriophages and their concerns with E. coli contamination. With their help, we were able to use one of the software programs that they suggested and design a 3-D model of our water test kit. We improved each other’s projects based on these collaboration experiences and it was a pleasure to work with them!
Response: Combined Detection
Because both of our teams focus on water quality, we’ve planned to achieve a multiple detection integration system based on the NTHU teams prototype that has the ability to detect various pollutants and contaminants in water, like a Swiss Knife with many functions! However, it would be very difficult for our team to construct detection equipment and a 3-D model because of a lack of an engineering expert on our team. Fortunately, both of our teams focused on quantifiers, so it would be more convenient to transfer the NTHU teams techniques and continue working with them to create a functional integrated system. The NTHU team has also graciously offered to assist our team with learning how to assemble a working model that can be used with their informational systems and in the future, incorporated into their system as an add on design.

Overview
BioBrick Search is a novel BioBrick search tool with the aim of providing more efficiency and reliability in searching existing BioBrick parts.
This tool provides a search result page with detailed information and ordering based on popularity and reliability, a much-needed feature that the current search implementation at partsregistry.org and other conventional BioBrick search have not offered. The tool also features a sophisticated web-based interface that everyone can intuitively use on their browsers without installation.
We have already made this software available to the public in August 2012 and received several positive responses from users. You can try it out at our website!
Background
In deciding and carrying out iGEM projects, you are frequently faced with the task of searching BioBrick parts. Currently, partsregistry.org is the official and most comprehensive BioBrick database and most of iGEM participants use partsregistry.org to search for BioBrick parts.
Even though searching for BioBricks is such an essential process in iGEM, it has been quite a time-consuming and irritating process to some iGEM participants, partly because the search software is not very user-friendly.
Problems with the current partsregistry.org BioBrick search we identified include:
Search results are not ordered by reliability or relevance to the search query but by ID (e.g. BBa_K123456), which is not likely to help users find the BioBrick they need.
Information given for each BioBrick in the search result page is insufficient for users to judge whether the BioBrick suits their needs and thus users need to take the additional step of jumping to the wiki page for the specific BioBrick to find more detailed information.
We thought these problems severely compromise the usability of the partsregistry.org BioBrick search and so created a new search software, ""BioBrick Search"" that resolves these issues. In order to achieve an efficient and reliable search experience, our tool has the following features.
Easy-to-view, informative result list

BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and opportunities. However, plenty of problems also occurred in society.
The biggest problems are biosecurity and biosafety.
According to the WHO (2004), biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. Since the 9/11 event the funding for work on biodefense has dramatically increased in the US. The US Government Civilian Biodefense Funding, between ﬁscal year 2001 and 2008 cost US tax payers more than 39 billion $. And here comes a line chart of a website which is related to the bio-safety. We can easily find that populaces are focusing on this area more and more, which should, and already caused our attention.
What’s more, economy is also a big problem of synthetic biology. According to the same organization, biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion orientational release of pathogens and toxins. Nowadays, entrepreneurs are facing the threat of theft, and thus, we also focused on this problem.
Biosafety
Have you ever played Plague Inc.? If the answer is “yes”, you sure have experienced the horror of a organisms destroying our whole world. As we all know, industrial bacterial can secrete several chemicals that has considerable significance for us. However, they are also easily stolen by thieves. What’s more, the pathogenic of bacteria can’t be depressed at this time. The threat of bio-weapon cannot be ignored
In 2003, CIA has made a report in development of bioweapons. They assessed that “Industrial biological products might be horrible than any disease that we already known”. In 2006, DSAC (Defense Science Advisory Council) also started a survey of military opportunities and challenges in this area [2].
For example, many bioterrorism incidents have occurred in the whole world wide. Such as the anthrax mail attack which is occurred after 9/11.It was said that these anthrax strains were from a laboratory. Which means it’s necessary for us to develop some method to contain microorganisms inside the lab.
What’s more, to limit the emission of synthetic microorganisms to the environment, we also need a method to prevent it. There is no reason to believe that full biosynthesis of currently semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin or cocaine, or fully synthetic amphetamine-type stimulants will not be possible and economically attractive using the toolkit of synthetic biology in the near future.
Recent years, it is reported that a new form of biology is rising: “biohackery” [3]. Biohackery allows everyone operation the"

As the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent in general.
The improved model with gene expression
Despite the great accuracy showed by the original model under in vitro conditions, we still want to figure out how the recombinases might work in in vivo experiments with gene expressing at the same time, for an obvious reason that we will finally carry out our circuit inside a living changing E. coli.
Considering the fact that the combination between the inducer and promoter are much faster than the production of integrase, we we assume that the activation of the promoter happens instantaneously..
Furthermore, the concentration of the protein (except for recombinases) shall decrease as a result of both degradation and dilution.
The maximum promoter activity can be estimated by the following equation
For the serine integrase, we assume the decrease in concentration is solely caused by dilution. And the dilution rate can be estimated as follows.
Last but not least,with the cell division, the new DNA produced without integrase combined should also be taken into consideration. So the origin model can be adapted to a new form as follows.
As the graph shows(figure2.1), the transformation rate can reach almost 100 percent in general. The critical difference between the vivo and vitro environment is the replication of DNA which decrease the concentration of LRI1 and LRI2 and increase the one of LR relatively and partially. Such process is a special kind of “transformation” which can skip the slow equilibrium process., ”syn”, to achieve a higher transformation rate in a short time.
Figure 2.1 | The figure separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours in vivo. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.

Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were unable to test the switches with luciferase. If we had managed to test our switches with luciferase, we anticipate that our sensitivity would be significantly higher.

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.
Applications
Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

We were unsure as to the clinical implementation of our project, so we spoke with Dr Justin Daniels, a pediatrician and clinical director, who has served on NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a UK public body that provides national guidance to improve healthcare) appraisal committees. He suggested its main value could be as a screening tool for high risk individuals.

    Additionally, we noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domain (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering may be applicable to other cases. We then expanded our reverse engineering strategy to cope with another common toxic heavy metal, lead (Borremans et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009; Mergeay et al., 2003). We primarily took lead resistance operon apart, followed by description of function, structure and operation of PbrR, a lead responsive regulator. Then modeling was conducted to analyze the characteristics of PbrR and topology of its regulation behavior. Information collected confirmed the possibility to design a genetic circuit whick can make lead sensor and regulator components more efficient and robust. Our engineered E.coli bioreporters is capable of discriminating different concentrations of lead ranging from 10^-8 to 10^-6, similar to mercury bioreporter mentioned above. We also engineered PbrR into single-chain coiled coil (MBP) via the same method as MerR. Exhilaratingly, the following inductive expression of PbrR MBP on the surface, in periplasm and in cytosol along with the lead (II) absorption test showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 95% of 10^-7M Pb (II) in 5 minutes, which is comparable to mercury MBP expression in E.coli, proving validness of our engineering strategy.

Regulations for Synthetic Biology
In South Korea there is no specific set of regulations designated just for synthetic biology. There is, however, an act called the “Biotechnology Support Act” that can promote the lawful development of synthetic biology in Korea. The purpose of this Act is to effectively support biotechnology in Korea by laying the foundation of biotechnology research ultimately to contribute to the sound development of the national economy. This Act states that the Korean government will make efforts to promote international cooperation in biotechnology researches, promote joint researches within Korea, take policy measures to support biotechnology research, and collect information for  technology development(""Biotechnology support act,"" 2008).
There is also a law called “Transfer of Living Modified Organisms Law (LMO Law) that can partially regulate the bio-safety aspect of synthetic biology. LMO Law was first written in 2001 by the Department of Knowledge and Economy under the Korean government. The term Living Modified Organism defined in the Law is very comprehensive and can cover organisms made in synthetic biology research. This law states that before an extensive application of a research, the possible environmental effect of the LMO need to be predicted. Because synthetic biology, however, often produces novel synthetic microorganisms, the environmental effects of the novel microorganism are hard to predict. Modification of LMO Law or a new law, therefore, is required to encompass the whole aspect of synthetic biology (Kim, 2010).
Also, Korea does not have a method for estimating the environmental effects that the LMO can cause and therefore, rely largely on foreign investigations. Such a method will be needed if South Korea begins to develop more drastically altered LMOs (Kim, 2010).
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Scientists
Academic synthetic biology projects are gaining serious traction in Korea, with only 2 such projects in 2009 increasing to around 200 project in 2013. More scientists are also being involved in synthetic biology research(""National science and,"" ).
Government
The Korean government has regularly supported new technologies that integrate different disciplines. As an example of this kind of technology, synthetic biology has received extensive support and promotion by the government as outlined by the Bio-Vision 2016 plan. Korea’s government will continue to increase investments in biotechnology and expand the technology and its market (Kim, 2010).
Public
No study specifically regarding the perception of synthetic biology by the public has been conducted in Korea. It is therefore hard to judge how"

Who are we?
Hello there! The Washington University in St. Louis iGEM Team is a group of enthusiastic undergraduate scientists who are not only curious about the natural world but also motivated to help solve problems in it. We operate under the Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering  (EECE) Department at Washington University and have been working in the Tang and Zhang labs under the mentorship of Dr. Janie Brennan and Eugene Kim. Since our home institution is a hub for biological, engineering, and medical research, we were afforded many resources to carry out our research.
This year's team consists of one rising senior, three rising juniors, two rising sophomores, all of whom originate from different regions of the United States and have distinct backgrounds and interests. More about our team members and our advisors can be found on our Team page .
Our Project
The Problem
For the last century as a consequence of industrialization, greenhouse gas emissions have depleted the ozone layer, especially at the Earth's poles. One function of the ozone layer is to absorb UV radiation emitted by the sun, protecting life on Earth from its harmful effects on DNA. When exposed to UV, DNA tends to form pyrimidine dimers which interfere with DNA replication and translation and can lead to mutations and cell death. While many focus their attention on the effects of UV radiation on humans, photosynthetic organisms must also be considered because they are responsible for the world's oxygen and form the basis for nearly all food chains. Though many photosynthetic organisms already have UV repair mechanisms, it is becoming increasingly necessary to fortify and supplement these mechanisms because of the drastic increase of UV exposure within the last century.
The Idea
In order to protect against increased levels of UV-B radiation, our team turned to an extremely radiotolerant species of tardigrade, R. varioenatus. Known for its ability to survive in even the most extreme of environments, this strangely adorable microorganism has several genes that encode resistance to the dangers of UV irradiation. We see this as having two major applications: (1) the production of UV-resistant cyanobacteria which could replace current wild"

European iGEM Meetup organised by TU Delft
Two of our teammates participated in a European iGEM meeting in the Netherlands in Delft as the only high school iGEM team and also the only one from Eastern Europe. It was held on the 7th and 8th of July and we had the chance to meet several iGEM teams and scientific researchers there. Participants had the opportunity to attend lectures held by university professors about synthetic biology and responsability while working on a synthetic biology experiment. It was a great pleasure for us to talk to others with similar interests about our scientific research work. Every team brought a poster to this excellent meeting as a result of which we could have a deeper insight into other iGEM teams' project. In our experience, the TU Delft team provided a great chance to make friends from the iGEM world and collaborate with other participant teams. We extremely appreciated all of the precious, practical and helpful collaborations given by others. In the name of the Methungeny team, I would like to thank you the possibility to show our project to others, TU Delft! (https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft )"

We also made glycerol stocks and streak plates of the sequence verified BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B with the Kozak sequence, TALE A (colonies 5 and 6) and the intact and mutated (B3M3, B5M0, B5M1, B5M7) TALE B target sequences.
For the Golden Gate constructs, we did a PCR of β-lactamase with primers 16 and 17 and PCR purified the products with concentrations around 40ng/uL.
A colony PCR of construct 2 ( pSB1C3 + BBa_J04500 +His+E coil+Link+hFTN+lFTN) and construct 9 ( pSB1C3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +K coil) did not show bands in the expected size.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
University closed August 5 due to Civic Holiday.
This week we worked on the following constructs:
a) construct 11*: pSB1C3 + BBa_J04500 + TALE A +Link+βlac;
b) construct 11: pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+βlac;
c) construct 10*: pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 + TALE A +Link+K coil.
The gel for construct 10* and 11* showed bands in the expected size. After gel purification and DpNI treatment, they were transformed in competent Top10 cells. Colony PCR showed bands of the correct size for construct 11*.
We did a PCR on BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A with primers 1 and 8 to use it as our vector in Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed bands of the correct size but PCR purification had low yields (20.4ng/uL) and low purity. After Antarctic Phosphatase treatment, we set up Golden Gate Assembly of construct 11. The gel showed no bands. We repeated the procedure, and PCR had nonspecific amplification. Gel purification also had low yields and low purity. After that, we did a PCR with less amount of DNA (10ng/reaction) which showed no bands. Another attempt was performed with different DNA concentration (5 to 45ng/reaction).

GolS Predicted 2nd Structure.PNG
The GolS predicted C-terminus secondary structure does not conform helix nor beta structure. C-terminus behaves like a freely coiled tail. The tail presents certain concerns upon insertion of the His-tag like for ex, inhibition of dimerization or hindrance to the DNA binding property.
GolS C-terminus.PNG
GolS C-terminus 3D coordinates appear to be so close to the DNA-binding domain. This has been verified using several servers including I-TASSER and RAPTORX. All of these indicate that C-terminus cannot form helix or beta structure. .
Suggestion for the upcoming 3D models:
●
Visualization of wt GolS with both noncleavable and cleavable His-tags (Ser and Gly ends):
GolS noncleavable His-tag: Tam
GolS cleavable His-tag Gly: Cathy
GolS cleavable His-tag Ser: Alex
●
Another recommendation upon modeling GolS and its variants:
We will be exploring programs that monitor ligand binding sites particularly different heavy metal ions (Au(III), Au(I), Cu(I), Ag(I), etc...) in order to compare the specificity based on distances of the binding pocket chelation and structural changes between them.
Program suggested at the moment: COACH from University of Michigan

Introduction:
This model would predict the fluorescence level over time in single cells with respect to different concentrations of vitamin B9/B12 inputs. It was able to predict the trend of fluorescence level over 20 hours after inoculated cells were taken from their cultures and placed in M9 minimal media.
The system consists of a riboswitch on mRNA that would partially inhibit the production of GFP upon binding with the respective vitamin (B9/B12) (Beisel and Smolke, 2009). Each riboswitch binding vitamin B9 was found to bind two molecules (Batey et al., 2011) while the one binding B12 was found to bind only one (Batey et al., 2017). The mRNA produced by transcription would form hairpins that would stabilize upon binding with the vitamins. These hairpins would then reduce the amount of the GFP produced downstream by a factor depending on individual riboswitches. The mRNA and GFP molecules would then degrade over time. They would also diffuse due to cell growth according to (Beisel and Smolke, 2009). The production, degradation, and diffusion would result in several equilibriums. By specifying the initial amount of vitamin input, the amount of GFP level over time can be modeled.
It was simplified with several assumptions. The cell growth was simplified to a number of segments and the rate of vitamin transporting through the membrane was assumed to be instant. Since calibration curve relating OD630 measurements and cell counts was not constructed, it was difficult to estimate the concentration of vitamin in each cell experimentally. The effect of the decrease in concentration of vitamin outside of the cell due to the increase of the cell volumes was assumed zero. The pattern of production of mRNA and GFP and the growth rate of cell were also generalized to be a few constants into a few segments.

Summary
While the iGEM team from Darmstadt has developed the project they quickly realized that the degradation of PET and the recovery of resources are a topic for the entire population. The question was how to inform the whole people, and how to reach them best. For this reason, the iGEM team decided to separate the people into five broad areas. To do so, the team has participated in events, which cover many areas of the society or they organized these events on themselves. At these events it became clear that Synthetic Biology was not a well known topic or was highly controversial discussed. The team took on the task of eliminating the misinformation and to discuss the impact and safety assessment.
The team has organized a student laboratory, in which the students themselves can experience Molecular Biology. Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen,"

19 tubes were prepared for the EPO PCR, containing the serum extractions of 20/09/2018 as template DNA, two positive controls (linear and BB EPO used for spiking), a negative control with MiliQ as template and a non spiked serum extraction as negative control. The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 40 seconds and an annealing temperature of 65 °C, 30 cycles. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4°C.
The PCR gave positive bands for all the spiked samples. But also for the negative control, the unspiked serum. After redoing of this PCR for the non spiked and spiked samples using the two EPO primer combinations 072+073 and 074+075 it became clear that there was a contamination in the non spiked serum samples.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," system. Indeed, it is known that the presence of protein V alone in a cell renders it immune to subsequent infection by M13 bacteriophage. However, it has also been shown that the presence of protein II in the system reverses this immunity, which demonstrates some regulatory role by protein II [8].
This suggests that expression of proteins II and V may be relevant to our goal of retransmission of a DNA message. Since proteins II and V are important regulatory proteins, fiddling with them might require extensive remodeling of the M13 regulatory system, which is outside the scope of what we thought was reasonable for our iGEM team. However, it might be wise for those attempting similar goals in the future to consider potential complications arising from proteins II and V.

1. Additional Characterization of part BBa_K325909
Improving upon the work of the Cambridge iGEM team 2010 and NTNU Trondheim iGEM team 2017, we performed additional experiments to add further information and build upon the characterization of part BBa_K325909. As this part is provided in the 2018 Distribution Kit, we tested the effectiveness of the arabinose induced lux operon-encoded enzymatic pathway for light emission in part BBa_K325909 by transforming it into E. coli, incubating overnight and subjecting it to different final concentrations of arabinose over a course of five hours. Reflecting upon the previous characterizations, we chose a temperature of 29℃ to perform our experiments, since by looking at the information presented by the NTNU Trondheim iGEM team 2017, it seems as if 29℃ may provide us with the brightest results.
Luminometric and photometric measurements were taken with a Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flask 4.00.53 every hour throughout the experiment, and the data was recorded on the raw data table provided below.
The data is analyzed using the formula: (Average Luminescence/0Hrs Luminescence)/(Average Abs/0Hrs Abs) for each concentration of arabinose, and the graphs are plotted below, with part BBa_K325909 abbreviated as 4L:
From the graph, even though the relative luminescence of the bacteria are similar during the first four hours, there is a significant increase in relative luminescence during the fifth hour at a concentration of 0.1M, therefore we have concluded that inducing part BBa_K325909 with 0.1M arabinose will result in the most intense light emission.
2. Construction of the Composite Part BBa_K2836002
To increase the light output from part BBa_K325909, we used de novo synthesis to create an additional luxG gene from a different strain of the same species of bioluminescent bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri), which codes for the flavin reductase used in reduced flavin mononucleotide"

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

4.  Our approaches to the questions we encountered
Through the activities mentioned above, we  found two questions about our project. The first is whether the tool would be  really useful for understanding the economic system. The second is how we can solve  the safety problem (related  to commercialization.)
Our approaches to these problems were questionnaire  to students and interview to a biosafety specialist.
First, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo  Tech to confirm whether  our project would help the understanding of economic system. The results are here.

Fig. 6-1-4-4
By looking at the answers in the questionnaire, we were able to have confidence that our project can help people understand economic system better than before. Although we used several scientific details related to synthetic biology, the project was understandable for students without any knowledge of this field. Therefore, we can say that our project, which is making an educational tool for iGEMers is effective and practical for all students majoring science.
From this approach, we were able to see our educational tool’s effect. We can say that this feedback gave many good effects for us.
 
5.Interview with the Science Magazine Newton
On June 17th, we were interviewed by the graphic science magazine Newton. Newton is one of the most popular science magazines originated in Japan. Despite its scientific focus, easy-to-understand contents and catchy photos are used, so it is read by many people regardless of age and gender.                   In the article, the history and requirements of iGEM were described, along with what our team has done in preparing for the Jamboree. The article is shown below (Figure 6-1-5-1).
