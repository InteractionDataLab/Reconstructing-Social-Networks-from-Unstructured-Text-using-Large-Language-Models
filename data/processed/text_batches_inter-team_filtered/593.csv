Modeling Overview
In our project, we are dedicated to design a quorum-sensing oscillator which consists of two types of cells. Cells of the same type can fluctuate synchronously and certain designs were made to adjust the phase and the amplitude of oscillation. These are the things that our modeling part aims to simulate. We built and simplified our simulation system step by step and deepened into further characteristics of the system, which would provide firm evidence proving that our design does work.
PART 1 Accurate Model
In our first step, we wanted to describe the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. We came up a set of ODEs with 19 equations.

Full  Model of Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 6 The entire designed genetic circuit
Actually, in our genetic circuit, we transformed a  plasmid which can secrete AHL to environment (Fig.6). When the AHL density h of  environment was high, the AHL came into the cell. Then AHL combining with LuxR repressed the expression level of cheZ which controled the motility of E.coli. So it was necessary to take  account of the AHL effect.
First,  the AHL was synthesized by the E.coli cell at the rate λ. And the  degradation rate β of AHL whose half life is normally about 15 to 30 minutes. Considering the diffusion of AHL, we obtained
(4.1)
where Dh is the diffusion coefficient of AHL, which is about 0.001mm2/min[6].
And the cell diffusion coefficient of E.coli is determined by the density of AHL. Therefore
(4.2)
whereDρ(h) is a decreasing function of h.
Furthermore, the nutrient consumption influences  the growth rate of E.coli. Therefore
(4.3)
where n is the                            nutrient concentration.
Fig. 7 The growth rate relates to nutrient concentration
For the nutrient, we made an assumption that  the amount of nutrient consumed were proportional to the amount of cell increasing.  Taking account of the nutrient diffusion, we had
(4.4)
where k was the ratio that nutrient converts to  cell mass, Dn is nutrient diffusion coefficient which is about that of small molecule[ 7 ] .
We used several possible forms of functionDρ(h)(see Results Section2 ). The  results showed that if the cell diffusion coefficient decreases fast near the AHL  density threshold, the pattern came out as a multiple-ring one( Results Section2 (a),(e) ). On the contrary, there was only one-ring pattern.
Therefore, in order to to make this curveDρ(h) decreasing sharply near the threshold, it followed a prediction that we can get a multiple-ring pattern by making an auto-activate genetic  circuit which the combination of LuxR and AHL can activate the expression level  of itself.
Fig.8 The designed genetic circuit for predicted pattern
Furthermore, we did some  two-spot patterns which initially have two points of E.coli cell, so as to compare with the experiments culture ( Results Section3 ).

Introduction
Oil recovery is quite a huge project that requires a lot of manpower and material resources every time there is a new method to test. So it’s important to find a way to simulate the process and get the results. Fortunately, nowadays mathematics is developed enough to construct a model like a machine,putting the known parameters into it and getting the simulated results without conducting the whole experiment,which is likely to be rather complex.In our project, we just use mathematical models to have a general govern and better understand of our system’s efficiency. The device we constructed works in a dynamic environment and compared with the diameter of the water injection well where the microbes are transported into the oil reservoir and water channel where they function,they are small enough to obey the law applied to water flow which carries them.That’s what we refer constructing the transmission mode,which helps us determine when to “wake up” our engineered microbes.And we also need to know how to “wake them up”- the behavior of fim switch is simulated.By connecting the models together, we can run the microbes virtually with no worry of time,safety and cost,which should be considered when conducting on the spot.
General Model
We employed Darcy’s Law to estimate the time cost on the arrival of microbes at the water channel.Upon arriving at the spot, we put inducer like IPTG to activated the complemented gene Bcs A,which is a gene controlling the production of cellulose knocked down in our device and operated by an operon.With the effect of cellulose,the water channel is blocked and the fim switch is activated by adding another inducer like Ara artificially.Then the switch make it possible to produce rhamnolipid in our engineered bacteria,which helps driving oil flow out with water.Thus, the efficiency of oil recovery is increased.

The period of the in vitro oscillation was stable despite temperature change (temperature compensation),  and  the  circadian  periods  observed  in  vivo  in  KaiC  mutant strains  were  consistent  with  those  measured  in  vitro. Therefore, it's of great possibility that the cyanobacterial Kai oscillators can also be reconstituted in E. coli.
The relationship between KaiABC proteins and their output pathways [1]
(B) The oscillation in KaiC phosphorylation results from the opposing actions of KaiA, which stimulates KaiC autokinase activity, and KaiB, which attenuates the positive effect of KaiA. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that the phosphorylation state of KaiC affects the ability of the clock to reset properly.
(C) The SasA protein interacts with KaiC through its N terminus (hexagonal domain), which is similar in sequence but not structure to KaiB. Temporal information is transduced from the Kai oscillator to SasA through the stimulation of SasA autophosphorylation by KaiC. RpaA is activated by SasA through transfer of a phosphoryl group. LabA acts as a mediator of negative regulation from KaiC and is predicted to repress RpaA function.
(D) In addition, the Kai oscillator regulates the compaction rhythm of the cyanobacterial nucleoid (double-stranded loop), which would control accessibility of transcriptional machinery to promoter regions.
(E)  SasA is not required for rhythmic chromosome compaction, but it is necessary (as is RpaA) for overt rhythmicity of gene expression. Arrows and perpendicular lines indicate, respectively, positive and negative regulation.
Aims
Building KaiABC proteins, SasA and RpaA in E. coli.

Our modeling hypothesis:
How can we use genome scale modeling and flux balance analysis to optimize nitrogenase activity in vivo?
<img class=""img-responsive"" src=""
""/>
The key limiting factors of the nitrogenase reaction are ATP and reduced flavodoxin. Therefore, our analyses focused on ways to either produce or provide more of these essential metabolites to the nitrogen fixing cell.
How?
Looking for potential gene overexpressions which lead to increased production of intracellular reduced flavodoxin and ATP
Looking for potential gene knockouts which redistribute flux, decreasing ATP consumption or leading to increased production of reduced flavodoxin
Determining which supplemental metabolites lead to the largest increases in reduced flavodoxin and ATP production

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human#Containment_-_-_TEXT.html,". We discussed many different ways in which we could ensure that the DNA we engineer into our bacteria does not spread to other microorganisms or adjacent ecosystems. We consulted our advisors in the synthetic biology centre at Imperial who informed us about already existing ""kill switches"". Most of these are based on killing bacteria in response to a specific stimulus. However, many of the compounds that cause activation of these switches could not be applied to soil without side effects. In addition, we could never ensure that all bacteria in the soil would be eradicated through application of these compounds. Switches that kill bacteria after a certain number of replication cycles are also not necessarily applicable as the lysed bacteria leave behind genetic information that can be taken up by other soil microorganisms.
3. Result We took a novel approach towards designing a ""kill switch"" and designed a containment device that is able to contain genetic information in our bacteria at the same time as preventing horizontal gene transfer to other microorganisms. Gene Guard is based on a toxin/anti-toxin system taken from the lysis cassette made by the Berkeley 2008 team. This originally involved the secretion of holin along with lysozyme, so that the holin would form pores in the inner membrane and allow the lysozyme to break down the cell wall. This caused the cell to lyse when the inducible promoter was induced by arabinose. Also included in this cassette is the gene for antiholin, under the control of a weak, constitutive promoter to prevent any leakage. Our project takes this a step further. By using the anti-holin's ability to inhibit the activity of holin, we can create a system in which the lytic activity of holin can be negated by the presence of antiholin in certain cells. This means that we can make a plasmid that can kill one cell, but replicate in another.
Chassis choice
1. Goal In chassis choice, we had to consider several aspects. We wanted to choose a chassis that we would be able to transport to arid areas, preferably already enveloped inside a solid seed coat. In addition, we want the bacteria to be able to persist in the soil long enough to carry out their function. On the other hand, we also want to prevent spread of the bacteria into far-away ecosystems where they are more likely to have a detrimental effect on the ecological balance.
2. Action We consulted two ecologists, who are experts in above-below ground interactions and soil microbial ecology. They both advised us that while it may be more obvious to use naturally occurring soil bacteria such as Bacillus subtil"

Select for transformants by plating the transformation on a synthetic defined (SD) plate with amino acid dropouts for whatever gene is encoded on the vector you transformed.  Double integrations (integrating two constructs at ones) worked very reliably for us, and triple integrations worked about half the time.  If you need to integrate more than four constructs, you can transform up to three into each haploid mating type (a and alpha), then mate them to yield a diploid strain with all of your constructs.  Use complementary selection markers (e.g. His, Trp, Leu in type a and Trp, Leu, Ura in type alpha) so you can plate the mixed cells on SD-H"

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Overview
Our project aims to create a new kind of life form, mixed-reality cells, which are half-real and half-virtual. What should be mentioned is that mixed reality states occur only when a virtual and a real system are sufficiently similar.(Alfred Hübler, 2013). As two genetic oscillators built-in E.coli are alternative, we also simulate two e-oscillators in computer as virtual part corresponding to the genetic oscillators.
To reach the mixed-reality state, the approach is separated into three stages,the former two of which will be mentioned in modeling part. The first stage is virtual-virtual coupling. We use two e-oscillators of identical characteristics to simulate the mixed-reality process. They would transfer parameters and interact with each other to a coupled or synchronized state. Secondly, LED lamp is adopted to replace the fluorescence of real cell as the physical real part. It will connect with e-oscillator to compose a mixed-reality state of physical. On the other hand, it will show that our interface hardware could work as expected. At last, we wish to  achieve our goal, mixed-reality state. The genetic oscillator in E.coli will interact with e-oscillator in a computer through our interface hardware and gradually they would be strongly coupled.
E-oscillators
Two genetic oscillators, dual-feedback oscillator and quorum-sensing oscillator, are built in our wetlab, so we first analyze the important biological processes and construct ODE sets to simulate these two oscillators separately. However, due to the time interval between the expression of regulating protein and their binding to promoters, we improve our models more precise by DDEs. Once the better genetic oscillator is selected through experiments, we will adopt the corresponding one as the virtual part.

What is the Newsletter?
This year our team together with Pairs Bettencourt made 8 issues of Newsletter. Newsletter is a platform in which different teams can exchange their ideas. There are 3 special issues, consisting of how to set up and operate an iGEM team, the development of synthetic biology in different countries (and ...). The other 5 issues introduced teams’ project and updates, ethical discussion, and some interesting topics.
The meaning of the Newsletter
As we know, good communication will make various teams had continuously progress. Projects abstract showed in the Newsletter can make teams know what other teams are doing. And they can seek help from other team.
Why we need Newsletter?
Topic 1. A chance to share stories with everyone
Topic 2. A platform to show ideas and processes to the public.
Topic 3. A way to let people in synthetic biology related-area appreciate our articles.
Not only do we offer a communication platform among teams, we also interview professors and collect suggestions from teams to establish long-term relationship between teams and the organizing committee.
At the same time, we manage to connect normal teams to software teams. (Insert a picture to show the connection between wet teams and dry teams)
Teams all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. In addition, special issue offers access to peripheral issue, such as help new teams, interviews to teams and experts, case analysis, experience in team construction and popularization of synthetic biology. We excavate the quintessence of past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further.
How we make Newsletter serve for teams?
In spite of Meetups, we have Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and QQ to keep in touch with other teams in no time. In particular, we are grateful to Stockholm(a link to Stockholm here) for offering the platform called issuu.com (link to Newsletter on issuu.com ). Thanks to their generous help, we successfully publish our Newsletters to the public. Meanwhile, we send Newsletters as attachments to both writers and readers who we’ve contacted.

Sick today :/ Tummy hurts
See below for repeat of AFRP GFP measurements in biological replicates.
Some questions that we still need to answer:
Why yeast instead of bacteria? Other studies have made similar circuits in bacteria before (see ""Building Biological Memory by Linking Positive Feedback Loops"" by Dong-Eun Chang et al.) The argument that yeast are slightly more representative of eukaryotic cells here seems far-fetched as we are not really looking at anything endogenous to yeast. Not that I think we should drop everything and start working in bacteria. We should have a solid response to this though.

He stressed that the solution to a problem will often be better when found in conjunction with a team from diverse backgrounds than when limited to colleagues in your own academic circle - a step outside the scientific comfort zone.
Perhaps one of the biggest influences on an alumnus iGEM could ever have is convincing them that they could make a living in synthetic biology. This is what iGEM has done for Justin Pahara. His company Synbiota, founded with colleagues who work in bioinformatics and software development, will provide tools and services to enable and equip scientists, particularly those in synthetic biology, with a grand aim of making a web of information and idea sharing which they hope will improve the productivity of the field from grass-roots school projects to field leaders.
We probed him to find out how much of iGEM had rubbed off on him and his business ventures. He replied that Synbiota is adhering to synthetic biology principles. They agree with abstraction as a valuable process by which to remove unnecessary complexity and strongly support crowd-sourcing of information as an engine with which to power progress. Justin firmly believes that it is only a matter of time until the rest of the world adopts these principles in broader contexts.
Justin claims that he would always have headed into biotechnology to make his name, but that iGEM resulted in a profound change in his ideas about science and engineering. Although he believes he would have realised the benefits of concepts such as abstraction and crowd-sourcing eventually, he feels he has had a head-start on colleagues working in biotech as a direct result of his involvement in iGEM and being introduced to synthetic biology. For Justin, the most important thing he learnt was the parallels that can be drawn between synthetic biology and the software industry as markets.
In particular Justin envisages a future where the cost of DNA synthesis comes down to the point where, like when the personal computer entered peoples homes, making DNA will be not only relatively quick and cheap, but a technology with a rapidly growing user base. In fact he predicts that the design and ‘light tinkering’ of DNA is a field that will literally explode. He paints an inspiring picture one of DNA modification by those in academia, corporations, DIY bio, even junior high school kids will be just chilling out, writing DNA code.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Sponsors_-_-_TEXT.html,"Brick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Construction of DDE equations
The ara operon is regulated by the AraC protein. If arabinose is absent, the dimer AraC protein represses the structural gene by binding to araI 1 and araO 2 and the DNA forms a loop. The loop prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter of the ara operon, thereby blocking transcription .When arabinose is present, arabinose binds AraC and prevents AraC from interacting. This breaks the DNA loop. The two AraC-arabinose complexes bind to the araI site which promotes transcription. When arabinose is present, AraC acts as an activator and promotes the translation of Cre. Then we use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells. The description of the system contains the above mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. Thus we came up a set of DDEs with 12 equations:
Parameters
The parameters are inherent factors determining the behaviors, properties of a system. Some of our parameters are derived from original ones, some of them are created to describe the new equations, and others are set for further testing.
Result
We coded the system in MATLAB. The result following shows that the concentration of Cre and the concentration of Cre-Loxp which we use all the paper to denote the Cre protein which binds to Loxp sites grow to a peak and then decline to zero. So we can expect that the inversion of the DNA which is proportional to the concentration of Cre-Loxp happens only in a period when Cre-Loxp exists.
The concentration of Cre：

The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~
Input
In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.
We here give a design of our user interface of input. It is under construction.
Step#1 Compartment Construction

When you enter in our interface,the first step is to choose the environment of our system . A flask is like a container , all the  reactions are happening in it . After that you may pick a appropriate condition for our lovely E.Coli . One E.Coli isn't enough for some specific problem , so you have to decide how many you will pick up . Small molecule is also available in our interface"

Summary of the project to date
Phase 1: Electro-Transformation of plasmid pNif51142 into E. Coli strains
- 2014
To successfully transform pNif51142, we used Electro-Transformation, also known as Electroporation.  Electroporation provides a method of transforming E. coli to efficiencies greater than are possible with the best chemical methods. By subjecting mixtures of cells and DNA to exponentially decaying fields of very high initial amplitude, we were able to deliver the plasmid into all of E. coli strains that were tested in the project.
Results
According to the gel running and antibiotic testing, bands in the gel and the survival of all strains transformed in antibiotic Kanamycin (there was an cluster of Kanamycin-resistant marker gene in sequence of pNif51142) both prove that the Electro-Transformation was successful.
Phase 2: Determine the optimal conditions for cell survival with plasmid pNif51142 in E. Coli

Due to the oxidative properties of oxygen, most nitrogenases are irreversibly inhibited by dioxygen, which degradatively oxidizes the Fe-S cofactors. This requires mechanisms for nitrogen fixers to protect nitrogenase from oxygen in vivo. Hence in our experiment, we firstly selected anaerobic condition as part of preparation step for the nitrogenase activity testing

Dreaming big. Anything is possible!
The whole lab got together to have group presentations and brainstorming for each topic from a wide wariety of perspectives. Topics presented ranged from nitty gritty details like the actual technology and its capabilities, to higher-level ideas like how interaction works when you factor in the users. Once presentations were over, we split into two groups with at least one member of each research group present and came up with five concepts. My group ended up branching out all over the place with potential ideas, and it was hard to distinguish some of them as they were different and yet still natural outgrowths of a seed idea.
12Jun 2012
It was pushed back by about a week, but we finally go to go to BU and meet their wetlab team! We started the day with a little symbol review and introductions, followed by iGEM medal requirements and their projects and tools. They told us about modular cloning, or MoClo, which really feels like synthetic biology. It's very machine-like and structured, but instead of having a mass-produced mechanical part, you have DNA instead. It's pretty interesting and seems like a great idea, and even though the timeframes sound long (five hours or so?) compared to days required by standard practices, this looks like a great improvement. But I don't really know enough about the topic or standard cloning in general to understand the drawbacks of this new process (perhaps because it's so new, a good repository hasn't been created and so it isn't ready for widespread use?). Wendy and Kim also presented the art project, along with a mass presentation by Casey, Kathy, and Wendy on all of the other projects and Monday brainstorming. We got a little feedback from them, but I feel like this stuff is a lot to take in all at once. Projection seemed to be a hit with the BU team, though, and I personally do like the idea of it a lot. It avoids the surface contamination problem by using in-lab surfaces, while still being portable - presumably you could hook up projector-camera combinations all over the lab, or wire up the scientists themselves (alright, maybe not). And cheaper and less personal than tablets. Afterwards, I brainstormed a few biosafety questions for our day with Natalie tomorrow, especially with regards to synthetic biology.

Description
iGEM Toronto was excited to participate in the 2017 Interlab Study to help establish a GFP fluorescence measurement protocol and characterize important promoters and RBS devices. In science and engineering, standardization is an important key to generating reliable data and comparing results from different labs. By comparing our data with labs from around the world, iGEM will be able to establish common standards of measurement for GFP fluoresecence with different plate readers.
Plasmids
iGEM HQ provided 8 Interlab parts in total, all in the  pSB1C3 backbone. They included a positive control, a negative control, and 6 test devices which contained various combinations of three promoters and two RBS devices. The positive control contained BBa_J23151, a 35 bp constitutive promoter, and BBa_B0032, a 13 bp weak RBS, while the negative control consisted only of BBa_R0040, a 54 bp TetR repressible promoter.
All the parts:
BBa_E0040: a 720 bp GFP gene from the Aequeora victoria jellyfish
Fluorescence is expected within 8 minutes
Excitation max: 501 nm
Emission max: 511 nm
BBa_B0010: an 80 bp transcriptional terminator from E. coli rrnB with 64 bp stem loop
BBa_B0012: a 41 bp transcriptional terminator from coliphageT7 for E. coli RNA Polymerase
Not a good terminator
promoter in reverse direction
The test devices were all 918 bp plasmids which constitutively express GFP. All consist of:
A 35 bp constitutive promoter in the BBa_J23100-J23119 family
1 and 4 have BBa_J23101
2 and 5 have BBa_J23106 - medium strength; more characterization info from Sheffield 2016

Aix-Marseille,2018,Team:Aix-Marseille#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," even if we had the opportunity to make laboratory experiments to test our traps, it would take to much time without the help of modeling.  A model run on a computer would allow us to better understand our results and improve the trap design. The field and laboratory trials would also help us to adjust our model and thus refine it. So, modeling our project quickly became one of our top priorities.
When we began, we wanted to test various parameters:
The effect of furniture
Our trap will most likely be used in a room with furniture (like a bedroom for example).  Even if we have the equation to model the diffusion of gases (the Fick's laws of diffusion),  this model doesn't involve effects of obstacles, which may have an impact on diffusion, and so on the efficiency of our traps.
The effect of air flows
We will put our traps in an inhabited room, so it may have openings on another room even outside.  These can cause drafts, which could have an impact on pheromone diffusion, and so on the efficiency of our traps.
This list is, of course, not complete and many other aspects will affect our trap efficiency and we hope to test them using our model.
Unfortunately, among 2 parameters we initially wanted to investigate, only one of them has been successfully incorporated into the program because of the complexity of the mathematical models and their solutions.
Through our program, we manage to discover new things about our solution, particularly about diffusion and the number of traps required to eliminate the bed bugs. Indeed, through various simulations, we manage to discover that the pheromone diffused through the space quicker than the bed bugs were. Those observations, back up by statistics studies of simulations, let us think that a great amount of traps are not required to eliminate successfully the bed bugs.
How did we model?
Our program has to model the diffusion of pheromones through a room containing furniture. It needed to include the behaviour of bed bugs influenced by the pheromones and to describe their deaths (caused by the fungus).  This model will have to manage a lot of parameters: from the diffusion of pheromones to the bed bugs movements and the interactions between all these variables.  Because of the complexity of the phenomena, build the program by describing every action occurring in our model would be too difficult.  Fortunately for us, we could use the language NetLogo, which allowed us to use agent-based modeling, a type of modeling particularly efficient for complex system modeling.
Agent-based modeling allows us to define the behaviour of the agents (the diffusing molecules, the bed bugs"

Introduction
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a gram-negative facultative anaerobe capable of transferring electrons from the cytoplasmic space to electron acceptors outside the outer membrane (OM) [1,2]. In particular, the Mtr respiratory pathway of MR-1 is required for the extracellular reduction of metals and metal oxides 2. The Shewanella Mtr gene cluster encodes three outer membrane cytochromes (OMCs), MtrF, OmcA, and MtrC, two periplasmic decaheme cytochromes, MtrD and MtrA, and two alleged OM b-barrel proteins, MtrB  and MtrE. The current model of Mtr respiration begins with electron transfer from carbon source catabolism to CymA, a cytoplasmic membrane (CM) cytochrome protein via the menaquinone pool. From there, electrons can be transferred to a number of different periplasmic electron carriers (PECs). MtrA, a decaheme c-type cytochrome and the predominant PEC for reduction of iron(III) and flavins, is physically associated with MtrB, a b-barrel protein spanning the  outer membrane. Together, the MtrAB complex transfers electrons to OmcA and MtrC, two outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, which can function as the terminal reductases for a number of different metal substrates [1,4].

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"PsiR}[pPsiR]$$ Where $m_{pPsiR,Psi}$ is the coefficient of reaction rate of the binding reaction, $\alpha_{pPsiR}$ is the rate of constant expression of $pPsiR$, $\delta_{pPsiR}$ and $\delta_{PsiI}$ are coefficients of reaction rate of the degradation reaction of $pPsiR$ and $PsicoseI$ respectively.
The concentration of inactivated repressor is $$\frac{\text{d}[CCI]}{\text{d}t}=m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI]^{\eta_1}[pPsiR]-m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{CCI}[CCI]$$ The change in $EGFP$ concentration depends on the concentration of its repressor,  $pPsiR$ which can be described by Hill-equation. Considering $EGFP$ is also degrading, the equation is $$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pPsiR]^n} -\delta_{EGFP}[EGFP]$$ Where $n$ is hill coefficient, $K$ is the ligand concentration producing half occupation, $\beta_{EGFP}$ is maximal transcription rate of gene $EGFP$, and $H$ is a constant used to indicate the deviation between the theoretical and actual values.
In device B, extracellular concentration of $IPTG$ is higher than which is intracellular, so it can enter the cells by diffusion. As a small molecular, the $IPTG$ inside the cell can be combined with $pLacR$ to generate $CC$. $pLacR$ is a repressor, which can bind to promoters on DNA and block gene expression. After binding with $IPTG$, $pLacR$ falls off from the promoter and the gene starts expressing, and eventually produce the produce $EGFP$. Since the gene of $ABR$ and the gene of $EGFP$ are connected in series, they are expressed together.
Similarly, we can get the function of device B by using the reaction rate equation and the diffusion function. First, $$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGO]}{\text{d}t}=0$$  According to the reaction between $IPTGI$ and $pLacR$ and the reaction rate equation, we can get $$\eta_2 IPTGI+pLacR\rightarrow CC$$ Where $\eta_2$ is"

Overview
Modelling in systems biology provides a tool for research. Modelling helps researchers to process, make sense of large amounts of data and also test different hypotheses.  Hence, a model can save much time and money since it makes it possible to test and compare different hypotheses before one starts doing laboratory work.
Our goal with the project and the model is to investigate the folding process and the necessity of the chaperone GroES. Our hypothesis is that GroES has a function on its own where it can interact with the substrate by holding it, thus preventing it to misfold, also called Holdase effect. This hypothesis is based on the work of our supervisor Per Hammarström [1]. But, the folding process is complex with many known and unknown variables that are incredibly difficult to test in the lab. Therefore the main objective was to find the optimal conditions for maximal protein production in E.coli. To do this, we implemented the model of LiU iGEM 2017 and developed it further. The model was made in MATLAB and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) was implemented. The model contains a translation of FoldEco, which is a model created by Evan T. Powers, David L. Powers and Lila M. Gierasch [2].
Our Model
The FoldEco model was adjusted by adding reactions that describe our hypothesis. We have added two reactions between Unfolded (U) and GroES, see figure above. By doing so, we give GroES the possibility to have a holdase effect. To see if it even would be worth trying to increase the amount of natively folded proteins with GroES, we created three different types of theoretical protein profile, the result is shown below in figure 1.
Our model and protein profiles can be found here: Our Model and Protein Profiles
Figure 1.
The first (blue) being a protein that would be prone to both misfolding and aggregation. The second (orange) would be easier to fold but still prone to aggregation. Lastly, we created a protein profile which was neither prone to misfolding nor aggregation (green)
Figure 2.
Describes the relationship between an increased GroES concentration and the GroES-Substrate releasing rate factor for the three different protein profiles.
Since we did not have any data on the rate at which GroES could bind"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Overview | Design | Results
Circuit Model
Circuit Design
To begin construction of this plasmid, the DNA sequence was generated and edited in ApE, a DNA editing software available through the University of Utah, from several existing plasmid sequences available through other labs on the Penn State campus. The construct was rationally designed to include two start codons within 7 nucleotides of each other, and thus in different open reading frames.
Each codon, labeled RFP-coding ATG and sfGFP-coding ATG for simplicity, codes for a different reporter in the respective reading frame of each start codon. The first start codon, RFP-coding ATG, if recognized by the ribosome, will translate the reporter RFP. The second start codon, sfGFP-codon ATG, will translate the reporter sfGFP if recognized by the ribosome. Super-folder GFP (sfGFP) is used to allow for the nonsense codons of the out-of-frame RFP sequence preceding the sfGFP reporter which would inevitably be translated prior to the green reporter sequence should the ribosome recognize the sfGFP-coding ATG. The super-folder protein will fold regardless of this nonsense sequence, facilitating the measurement of codon slippage through the measurement of fluorescence
To prevent premature termination of the translation of either reporter, all stop codons in the respective reading frames of each codon were eliminated through amino acid sequence substitution.
Circuit Construction
Initially, 4 gBlocks, available through IDT as oligos with overlapping 40bp sequences complimentary to the adjacent oligo, were used to perform a Gibson Assembly reaction with a digested dRBS1 vector. After several failed attempts, a second approach was implemented. Oligos for the missing circuit sequence were designed and annealed, according to their complimentary 20bp overlaps, and inserted into the nearly-complete vector using Gibson Assembly. This attempt was successful, and the initial construct was verified with sequencing.

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Interview with Professor from Zhejiang University
We conducted an interview with Hu Xiaoyun, the professor at Zhejiang University, about her opinions on synthetic biology and biosafety. Professor Hu started to pay close attention to the development of synthetic biology at an early stage, and she wrote a proposal to raise the awareness for this area. As a professor from the Faculty of Medicine, most of her thoughts and concerns were about mammals, such as genetic editing of embryos and in vivo experiments. She also underlined the potential risk of biological weapon, whose effect would be hugely disastrous for the whole society.
Since we chose a strain of bacteria as our chassis, and bacteria are the most thoroughly researched and widely used, we asked Professor Hu about synthetic biology on microorganisms. Her feeling was, although it has been developing rapidly in the past few years, most of the methods are yet to be applied in large scale, so it is still unheard-of for the majority of people. For governments, since the long-term effect remain unknown, they cannot issue new regulations. This leads to a potential problem: if laboratories or individuals use illegal sources of organisms, or the material is not properly disposed, it might do harm to the human health and environment.
The problem of biosafety cannot be solved without the effort from authorities and academia, as well as the understanding of the general public. After the interview, we became more determined to organize and improve the outreach activities for students.
Business Brief
The Market Demand
From our survey, we found out that about 91 percent of people have the habit of eating pickled food. In the United States, an increasing trend is seen in pickle consumption: as calculated by Statista, based on the U.S. Census data and Simmons National Consumer Survey (NHCS), 225.31 million Americans consumed pickles in 2011, and the number rose to 233.74 million in 2016. This figure was projected to increase to 242.84 million in 2020.
Fig 1. Population of pickle consumption in United States
As described in the Background of our project, multiple surveys and studies suggest a correlation of nitrite with gastric cancer. Because of various health campaigns, people begin to be aware of the potential risks of consuming high-nitrite-containing pickles. Thus, we reach the conclusion that the demand for safe pickles that meet the"

Also, there is still a big gap between science and religion, just because people think that these two areas cannot be combined.

James and I went to see Raavan , a new Bollywood telling of the Ramayana epic, in Hindi. We were amazed that the entire film was shot twice, in Hindi and Tamil. One of the lead actors in the Hindi version played the opposing role of demon in the Tamil version .
In mythology, travelling from A to B can be an epic journey, with many tales along the way framed by the larger narrative construct. Is the potential for the epic being rejected by the rational myth-making in synthetic biology? Yesterday evening with Arshia we discussed whether science was about closing down possible narratives to find the truth, whereas story-telling is about opening up the space.
Some of the discussion this morning focused on this question: that science (not always, but potentially synbio) is about finding the shortest route from A to B, whereas myths and stories are about creating the opportunity for multiple routes.
Today, the team are continuing the task to tell a myth through a bacteria, this time producing a Bollywood inspired poster. We looked at a great selection taken from the Taschen book, The Art of Bollywood , a historical archive of the poster genre. How are the key elements of the story conveyed? What metaphors are used? The Fake Science blog shows how new myths can be constructed to create a critical commentary.
Should these art/science hybrid posters of biological interpretations of myths be diagrammatic, narrative or simply evocative?
We reviewed the first iteration at the end of the afternoon, now the final version must be created by tomorrow!
Wednesday 23rd June: A New Myth
The team presented their Bollywood film posters of Hindu mythologies told through bacterial universes this morning. Beautiful renderings, extremely complex metaphors told through graphic representations. Amazing!

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"In our directed evolution approaches PREDCEL and PACE, we select for beneficial mutations in a protein of interest encoded on a M13 phage genome. In order to generate a pool of protein mutants to select from in the first place, the efficient introduction of mutations during phage genome replication is essential. Mutagenesis-inducing plasmids (MPs) that enhance the mutation rate in E. coli by inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms have been described
badran2015development
. When transformed into E. coli hosts, these plasmids should cause mutation rates several orders of magnitude higher than usually expected under laboratory conditions.  The exact mutation rate induced by different mutagenesis plasmids could, however, vary between laboratories, as E. coli growth conditions and hence expression strength of the mutagenic proteins (e.g. error-prone polymerase subunits) could differ. However, robust induction of high mutation rates are critical for the success of PREDCEL and PACE and hence of major importance for other teams to reproduce our directed evolution methods. Therefore, we performed a small inter-lab study to evaluate the performance of different mutagenesis inducing plasmids and find the construct setup most robust and hence suitable for future iGEM teams to use for in vivo directed evolution.  To enable an inter-lab comparison, we developed a standardized mutagenesis plasmid test kit and assay and distributed it to iGEM team BOKU Vienna , ETH Zurich , Freiburg and Stuttgart . We are very grateful for their kind support and excited to share the results from this small inter lab study with all iGEM teams
Mutagenesis Assay Kit
We shipped 3 mutagenesis plasmids (#1-3). All mutagenesis inducing plasmids contain an arabinose inducible promoter PBAD. Upstream of PBAD the araC protein is encoded in the opposite direction and regulates the activity of the PBAD promoter. The expression cassette downstream PBAD comprises multiple, different mutagenesis supporting elements, e.g. error-prone polymerase subunits. According to literature
RN46
the mutagenesis plasmids #1-3 were expected to cause increasingly high mutation rates.
Mutagenesis Assay – Spontaneous Resistance Acquisition
Due to exceptionally high mutagenesis levels of E. coli cells transformed with one of the mutagenesis plasmids, these cells can more quickly adopt to environmental changes. Hence, one way to measure the mutagenesis levels is simply to quantify the level of spontaneous antibiotic resistance acquisition. Therefore, E."

On the Cld-sp gel, lower bands are found between Tinsel bands and Cld+sp bands suggesting a sequence that is 0.75 kBP to 0.9 kBP long, likely the 0.8 kBP Cld-sp gene. This fragment is shorter than Cld+sp, which is expected of its shorter sequence without the signal peptide. All of these digestions show higher bands higher than the CPB backbone. Based on discussions with our supervisor we have tentatively assigned these bands as “nicked circular plasmid” (N.C.) and linear plasmid.
Based on these results we believe that we have successfully substituted the Tinsel gene cassette with the Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-) cassettes in the expression plasmid CPB-38-441

Methods
Cloning:
Each g-block was combined with the expression plasmid CPB-38-441 at a molar ratio of 1:1 in  a 20 uL reaction containing 1x Cut Smart buffer (NEB) and 1uL BsaI HF. The reactions were incubated at 37O C for one hour and the BsaI was heat-killed for 20 minutes at 80OC. Ligations using T4 DNA ligase (NEB) were done by adding to each reaction: 4uL of 10x ligation buffer, 1uL ligase and 15uL MilliQ H2O. Ligase reactions were incubated overnight at room temperature.
The next day the ligase was heat-killed as described above. For the transformations, 5uL of each reaction was combined with 100uL of chemically competent DH5α E. coli on ice. For the negative control, no DNA was added to cells and for the positive control, the original host plasmid CPB-38-441 added. Samples were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Following a 45 second heat-shock at 42O, cells were then placed on ice for 5 minutes and then combined"

This causes another π–π stacking interaction (Figure 6), which increases the Van der Waals interactions, thus stabilizing the conformation. What’s more, Trp-113 generates another H-bond between VEGF and VEGF-scFv, which is contributes directly to the binding energy.
Figure 6. π–π stacking between Trp-113 and Phe-112 after mutation
The mutation of Tyr-134, however, has no significant influence on the Gibbs free energy. It may have minor effects on the conformation stability. Based on Monte Carlo method, RosettaAntibodyDesign does not always give the best answer.
After 4 point mutations, the binding affinity has increased a bit. The interface energy has decreased from -46.405 to -50.641 REU, calculated by RosettaDock.
Also, we have tested a previous part, BBa_K1694003. This is another VEGF-scFv, differing from the one we used. First, we used PIGSPro [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], a web-based tool to build the structure of immunoglobulins. The next step is finding the interface. After 5000 times of global docking and 1000 times of local docking, finally we find the interface of the previous parts, along with VEGF. After some structure refinements, we tested the binding energy of them. From the interface score calculated by RosettaDock, we can see a big difference. Therefore, our parts improvement work is successful.

The interface score is calculated by RosettaDock, which directly shows binding energy.
Figure 8. Parts (BBa_K1694003) local docking RMSD
The interface score is calculated by RosettaDock, which directly shows binding energy.
RMSD is calculated compared to the final docking result, expressing the difference between local docking and the final result. There is clear interdependency between interface score and RMSD, which shows a potential well near the final result. Within the potential well, the structure will be stable. Therefore, our docking result is reliable.

Abstract
This summer, our team is aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural environment. We successfully designed two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecule while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. We validated that AI-2 Controller works as expected by qPCR, HPLC and AI-2 Response Device. We also further demonstrated that our AI-2 controllers have the ability to manipulate biofilm formation process by 'quenching' or 'ignite' AI-2 signal in the environment.
Design of modular QS elements: AI-2 Supplier
There are mainly 2 steps involved in the process of AI-2 production in bacteria cells. AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by Mtn and LuxS and accumulates extracellularly with cell density. In our project, we cloned mtn, luxS into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of proteins associated with these AI-2 production reactions in Escherichia coli. Two AI-2 Supplier devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were successfully constructed using homologous recombination method.
During the construction, all intermediate constructs and final plasmids were immediately verified by restriction enzyme digestion verification and/or sequencing. As you can see from Fig. 1, we obtained gel bands at expected position of AI-2 Controller devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn.
Fig. 1: Restriction enzyme digestion verification of pLuxS (left) and pLuxSMtn (right)
Device pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were constructed by overexpression of the components responsible for AI-2 production (luxS, mtn). To verify whether the device realized the function as expected, qPCR and SDS-PAGE experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, two devices overexpressed luxS and mtn mRNA about 4 times than control group, pTrcHisB. Also in SDS-PAGE experiment"
Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#BobMcdonald_-_-_TEXT.html," you have any advice for the general public on where to find the right resources to validate a claim or to understand a concept? Bob: Well, there are some good websites out there that gather good data like Space.com is great for everything involved in space; New Scientists Magazine has a great website on the latest in science news, there’s another one called science daily, that works with National Geographic of course and Canadian Geographic… So as long as it’s a notable publisher or university, then you are doing well. Again, it’s the source. It doesn’t matter where you’re getting it, you always have to look at the source, where it’s coming from. And if it’s coming from a reputable organization then it’s probably fine. Nick: So, we found that groups without any university degrees show similar trends in terms of trusting skeptical claims and blindly distributing articles without assessments. Do you think general post-secondary education plays a significant role in scientific literacy? Bob: Yes, absolutely. Because, if you pick up a skeptic, I mean, skepticism is good, we need some skepticism in science, that’s how science works. As soon as you publish something, you’re trying to prove it wrong. And if nobody can prove it wrong, then your theory will stand up or your hypothesis. But if you only take the skeptic’s point of view, you’re unbalanced. You need to find out what the other side of that story is, and very often there will be a huge body of knowledge that will say something say the world’s climate is changing, and a few very vocal skeptics who are getting equal airtime. And in journalism they call that balance, but it’s not always balanced. And you have to say who is the skeptic, is that skeptic qualified to be commenting on it. And very often you’ll find that no, they are just people with opinions. Or in the case of climate change, we’ve since found out that they are sponsored by the oil companies. So who is this skeptic? Again, go back to the source. Who are these people, Who give them the right to say what they are saying? If they are just somebody with an opinion then in most cases, it’s demonstrating their own ignorance by saying because they don’t know the full story. But what think is this, well I don’t care what you think. You can think whatever you like. Science is not based on think or opinions, it’s based on evidence and experimental results. So again, separate the science from the opinions."
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," of our project, we asked our advisors for help and created a PCR troubleshooting protocol, which you can find on our protocol section .  Because we considered it to be helpful for other teams as well, we decided to offer help for all other iGEM teams: our First Aid Service for PCR Problems . Happily we could help some teams overcoming their PCR problem.
Helping iGEM Hamburg with their PCR problems
Since the beginning of their project the iGEM team Hamburg experienced difficulties performing gene amplifications. After tedious trial and error using different gradient-PCRs, experimenting with GC-enhancer solutions and DMSO concentrations we figured out a way to amplify eleven out of their twelve genes and gene fragments. The only one that did not work despite their efforts was the AraC family transcriptional regulator. They noticed our PCR First Aid Service and after a skype call in which Hamburg described their problems and attempts we gave them valuable tips. Our ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M betaine, try adding DMSO in 3 %, 5 % or even 10 % concentration or a combination of both DMSO and betaine. Hamburg gave a try to all these suggestions, unfortunately without having a hit.   We discussed the result with the iGEM Team Hamburg becuase we did not want to give up an gave additional tips to try. Our next suggestion was to design new primes, as ours had a very high GC content in the middle part and were therefore prone to the formation of secondary structures. Also, the new primer pairs should be designed to anneal at 72 °C. They offered to design to take over the design for us. These were the original primers: Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Investigation_-_-_TEXT.html," the cockroaches and distribute the commonly used drugs.
Q: How does it work for the current killing?
A: Every year, there are millions of funds to prevent the pests. At present, it has reached 75% of control. Although the control of cockroach does not reached 100%, the number of cockroach can be controlled to a level that is insufficient. At present, we are mainly responsible for the extinction of the external environment, and schools, hospitals, vegetable markets, food processing plants have their own team to prevent it. According to the patriotic health regulations, they are obliged to control the density of the cockroaches, and there will be a regular check by health supervision departments.
Q: Today, the most effective way to kill cockroaches is chemical way, but what effect does it have on the environment?
A: t will definitely cause environmental impact. Some substances in the medicine may be enriched in water or soil before the medicament is completely decomposed, which will affect the environment. Chemical control is not the best method, but it is the quickest method. When the insect population density is too large, the commonly used methods such as physical methods are relatively slow. At present, there are three main types of chemical pesticides, including organophosphorus, pyrethroids and carbamoyl esters. These three types of insecticides are biodegradable and pharmacologically effective compared to earlier insecticides. There is also improvement in sustainability and environmental friendliness. After comprehensive evaluation of existing chemical pesticides and other methods of cockroach, it is considered that chemical methods are relatively effective and rather safe.
Q: At present, CDC only kill the cockroaches outside the street, will it have any effect on them in the family?
A: The cockroaches in the family only have more connection with people, but the disease they carry mostly comes from the external environment. The cockroaches in the family may interact with the external through places like sewers. Thus, the prevention of cockroaches on the streets can also prevent cockroaches from causing health effects in the home.
Q: Our project is to use genetic engineering methods to transform fungi and kill cockroaches with fungi. Could you give us some suggestions on it?
A: The method of biological control has been studied since the 1990s, and the effect is obvious in the controllable range of the laboratory, but it has not been fully promoted in the commercial point of view, and may have some resistance in the industrial chain and actual operation. If bio-reconstruction is used, it is desirable to ensure its controll"

Therefore, we made smaller constructs to characterize each individual component in terms of promoter strengths, cross-talk between repressors and non-target promoters, and performance under full workload. The protocols used for characterization can be found here .
Characterisation of Component Performance
Relative Strengths of Promoters
To compare the relative strengths of the three promoters, phlFp, tetp, and lacp, we ligated each promoter to a GFP generator, BBa_E0240 , and measured the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) produced by each construct. The following constructs were built:
Figure 1. Comparison on the strength of phlFp, tetp and lacp. Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
The activities of phlFp, tetp, and lacp were measured and compared in RFU and normalised with OD600. The activities of phlFp, tetp, and lacp were found to be 4.840e+007 RFU/OD600, 2.275e+007 RFU/OD600, and 4.870e+006 RFU/OD600 respectively, which are all higher than that of the negative control, with phlFp exhibiting the strongest promoter strength, followed by tetp, and lacp.
Crosstalk between Repressors and Non-Target Promoters
The fidelity of our design relies on the specificity between the repressors and their target promoters. Since all three repressors in our design belong to the same TetR family, it is likely that crosstalks exists; and that should be investigated on. We ligated the constitutive promoter, BBa_J23101 to transcription units of each repressor to achieve a constitutive expression of the repressor protein. We then inserted the resulting composite unit upstream to a non-target promoter, in order to drive the expression of the GFP generator, BBa_E0240 . The following constructs were built:
To investigate crosstalk between phlFp and LacI:
To investigate crosstalk between phlFp and TetR:
Ideally, there should be no crosstalk between the repressors and non-target promoters, that is the presence of the repressor transcription unit should be independent of the GFP production cellularly. In that scenario, the GFP production of the two constructs above would be similar to that of a GFP generator driven by phlFp. Therefore, we compared the"
Arizona_State,2016,Team:Arizona State#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," characterization of AHLs produced by our Senders using gas chromatography, a direct comparison induction test on Senders using the well-characterized part F2620,  and develop comprehensive safety procedures for the handling of AHLs. The white paper and safe disposal protocol are several of our human practices projects that the ASU team investigated during the course of the project.
MOTIVATION
N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) is a type of communication that allows bacteria to monitor their population density for the purpose of controlling various group activities such as virulence or luminescence. Synthetic biologists have taken advantage of the simplicity of the QS system to incorporate signal-processing pathways into genetic circuits. This project aims to determine pathways with minimal overlap (“crosstalk”) and engineer QS modules as a flexible tool for building layered genetic circuits. Crosstalk occurs when when a single regulator is activated by multiple varieties of HSL molecules, impeding successful operation of complex genetic circuitry that uses multiple quorum sensing pathways. Homologous AHL networks have been identified in over 100 species of bacteria, but only four have been used in synthetic systems reported to date. Our goal is to expand the QS toolbox and enable the implementation of higher-order, complex genetic circuitry in synthetic biology.
In addition to expanding the QS toolbox, our team felt that an in-depth investigation on the safety of AHLs would be valuable to future quorum sensing research. From the interviews and questionnaires that we conducted to industry experts, it was clear that AHLs were not a focal point in their safety reviews. However, from literature reviews, we found that there are many opportunistic pathogens that utilize AHL to activate virulence. A brief list is shown below:
Because there are potential pathogens that could become activated, proper safety measures in the development and production of AHLs were necessary. In our Human Practices, we gathered information about the dangers of AHLs from experts and literature, developed a safe disposal plan, tested the safe disposal plan as an extension of our F2620 induction tests, and wrote a report on suggestions for the safety of AHLs. In addition, we added a safety section to our parts pages that we submitted to the registry.

Figure shows the diversity of AMPs used by Utah State iGEM team 2013
EcAMP-1 (BBa_K1162001)
EcAMP-1 is derived from the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli. It consists of 37 amino acids and is helical in structure, held together by two disulfide bonds. This feature enables a unique hairpin structure which is not found in most other AMPs. EcAMP-1 has shown to have a toxic affect against a variety of fungi and protists. The mode of action for EcAMP-1 against fungi appears to be the prevention of hyphae elongation (Nolde et al., 2011).
Spheniscin-2 (BBa_K1162002)
Spheniscin-2 is a potent antimicrobial peptide whose DNA sequence of the king penguin.  Studies have shown that in nature the King Penguin secrete Spheniscin-2 into its stomach to preserve food for long periods of time by preventing bacterial decomposition of the food.  In the wild the male usually incubates the egg for the last 3 months before the egg hatches.  In general the female will then come and feed her young shortly after.  However, if the mother is delayed the survival of the young can still be insured by the male (Thouzeau et al 2003).  However, storing food for long periods of time in a warm stomach would lead one to assume that bacterial degradation would be a limiting factor.  However, studies have shown that Spheniscin-2 has a wide range of activity against many gram positive, gram negative, and even fungal microbes, which allows the male King Penguin to store food for long periods of time (2.).  Thus, there is a wide range of use associated with Spheniscin-2.  The potential of interweaving Spheniscin-2 with spider silk holds many promising results.
Grammistin-Pp1 (BBa_K1162003)
Grammistin-Pp1 is an AMP found in skin secretions from the clown grouper fish and is made up of thirteen amino acid residues. This AMP is used primarily to fend off predators. Although initially thought to have little antimicrobial properties, studies proved that grammistin Pp1 target cell membranes by interacting with phospholipids. Grammistin Pp1 has been shown to be lethal against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including B. subtilis and S. aureus. A primary reason for our selection of"

What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I like the entrepreneurial aspect to the whole project. Having and idea and making that idea happen. To watch it expand into something useful, beautiful, practical and lastly, presentable. To handle and overcome the obstacles you meet on that road. Yes, it really thrills me. iGEM is exactly that and more.
What cheers you up?
Oh, that’s a long list. I would mention, children and dogs. Children because of their innate, almost unquenchable curiosity, in addition to their appreciation for the even the smallest things. They make us rethink- and re-evaluate our habituated views on things and actions. Dogs are very loyal and excited to see you - specially the dogs serving in law-enforcement. They chase you down as if they are huge fans and I, Justin Bieber - yes, they have us confused a lot
What did you work on during the project?
I helped the team by spending the majority of my time in the lab, planning, troubleshooting and excecuting the substrate screening experiments. I networked and facilitated contact with key university faculty and members of industry, condusive for the aim of our project. I applied- and procured samples of waste- and byproducts from several industrial processes in addition to acquiring sponsorships for branded clothing, bags and accessories for our team. ThenI also had the privilege of pitching our project in the ""Green challenge"" competition (DTU) and at the ""iGEM European Experience""-event in Paris (IONIS).

Which destination would you love to recommend other people visiting?
Marrakech in Morocco is one of my favorite destinations, the food culture is rich with a wealth of spices. Taking a walk in the old city gives both joy for the eyes that can’t rest on a single thing and a quest to not get stuck under a scooter or other vehicle before you can find your way out of the labyrinthine like small streets when you have become lost.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," their work is encouraging discussions about the development of synthetic biology from a policymaker’s perspective, which includes a collaboration with all Dutch iGEM teams since 2014.
For this collaboration, the teams were asked to depict their thoughts and concepts about safe by design in a video, podcast or other representation. We decided to make a movie (hyperlink) (it is in dutch) that shows how safe by design is implemented in our project.
In contrast to many other synthetic biology applications, BeeT is intended to be used outside the lab, in beehives, which is in close contact with nature. To get a better idea of the viability of our idea, and what it is like to request permission to use an engineered microorganism outside of the lab, we looked at the questions that are asked in such a request (link to website of RIVM) and discuss some that peaked our interest in the movie. Some interesting questions we had not thought about, such as “how can a genetically modified microorganism be recognized among natural relatives?”. Some other things we did not understand completely. For example, there are a number of questions about how the genetic modification was established. We would expect these questions when talking about the ethics of genetically modified microorganisms, and not necessarily when determining the risks of using it.
Another interesting aspect of the application of synthetic biology is responsibility: if our engineered bacterium would be commercialized, who would be responsible for any adverse effects? In our opinion, scientists are responsible for thoroughly and objectively investigating and reporting possible risks. Companies in turn should monitor whether the technology is sufficiently researched. Companies should also make sure that user manuals are correct and clear to understand, even to people with little experience with comparable technology. Users of the product, the beekeepers in our case, are responsible for using the product in the intended way only and following the user manual provided with the product.
Our movie ends with some open questions regarding safe by design, both in general and within our project. Examples are “what should be done to actually realize the insights that are gained by safe by design?” and “should there be more focus on the positive aspects of using a genetically modified microorganism when judging a permission request?”. We don’t know the answer to these questions, but think they are important nevertheless.
Concluding our collaboration with the RIVM, some members of our team, as well as the other dutch iGEM teams attended a meeting organized by the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “making"
