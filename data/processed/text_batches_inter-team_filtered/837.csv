SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," a photoreceptor combined with an intracellular indigenous regulator system Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. . EnvZ and OmpR make up the two-component system naturally found in E. coli. The photoreceptor known as Cph1 was isolated from the cyanobacteria Synechocytis PCC6803. Cph1 has functional combination sites, which combined with the kinase EnvZ form a two-domain receptor, known as Cph8. Activation of Cph8 is mediated by the chromophore phycocyanobilin, PCB, that is sensitive to red light with maximal absorbance at 662 nm Lamparter T, Esteban B, Hughes J. Phytochrome Cph1 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. Purification, assembly, and quaternary structure. European journal of biochemistry. 2001;268(17):4720-30. .
When not exposed to light, PCB activates the phytochrome Cph1, thus promoting kinase activity through the EnvZ kinase. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes regulated by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of PCB by red light results in a situation where the transcription factor OmpR is not regulated. The absence of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression.
Figure 1. Left: Red light activates PCB, which in turn inactivates the photoreceptor complex Cph8, preventing gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter. Right: In absence of light, PCB is inactive, which enables the Cph8 to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. This promotes gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter.
The photocontrol device can be used to regulate a toxin-antitoxin system, enabling the implementation of a light-dependent dormancy system. A toxin-antitoxin system is composed of two gene products, a cytotoxin and an antitoxin, the latter which neutralises the the toxic effect caused by the toxin.  In E. coli K-12 the cytotoxin RelE and antitoxin RelB comprise such a system Gotfredsen M, Gerdes K. The Escher"

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," now the most important plasmid we have!  More digestions and transformations were done to keep the flow of the project moving well.
Science U presentation goes extremely well. Instructors are happy, kids were very engaged and seemed to learn a lot. Cloning and sequencing continue, with the goal being the confirmation of all five variants so that progress can be made to inserting the RBS library and characterizing.
Week 12
Monday, August 4 - Sunday, August 10
- Notebook Entries
Sequencing confirms two of the GFPs correct, two more likely correct, and one (GFP4) still lagging behind in cloning. Progress made by inserting dRBS and transforming cells. Unfortunately, numerous tries are needed until this is done successfully. Oligos containing the dRBS are re-annealed more than six times, each time with minor improvements to the protocol. Sequencing continues, and G4 is re-cloned.
Week 13
Monday, August 11 - Sunday, August 17
- Notebook Entries
Construction of Plasmids 2 and 3 started by preparing and assembling some of the easier parts.  There was some trouble with our electrocompetent cells and some solutions being used in PCR clueing reactions.
Finally, lots of colonies found on plates with G2 and G3 that contain the dRBS. Colonies glow, which is encouraging, cryo stocks prepared, then TECAN measurements began for G3. Old plates cleaned out, cryo stocks prepared for anything that seems like it might be useful, and rest is throw out. Clay leaves for Spain.
Week 14
Monday, August 18 - Sunday, August 24
- Notebook Entries
The PAK backbone was fully prepared and joined with the crRNA.  These plasmids were grown up and sent for sequencing later in the week.  We also started preparing the HMF pathway for integration into Plasmid 2.  The HMF plasmid is very difficult to clone as it is a very large DNA piece.

These 5 µl were added to 15 µl of ice-chilled Gibson-Mastermix, containing strictly defined amounts 5x ISO Buffer, T5 Exonuclease, Taq Ligase and Phusion Polymerase (Gibson et al., 2009). Samples were subsequently heated to 50 °C for one hour. Thereafter, transformation of 5 µl mix to a 25 µl aliquot of chemically compentent E. coli cells was performed.
Transformation
3-4 µl of assembled plasmids, derived from either Gibson Assemblies or classical cloning steps, were added to a 25 µl aliquot of chemically competent Top10 E. coli cells on ice. After an incubation period of 30 minutes, a 42 °C heat shock was performed for exactly 45 seconds. Subsequently, a second incubational step on ice was conducted for 2 minutes. 500 µl of previously autoclaved LB medium were added to each aliquot of transformation mix. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and 300 rpm for one hour. Transformations were finalized with plating of 500 µl of transformed E. coli solution on an Ampicillin or Chloramphenicol containing agar plate. Subsequently, plates were stored at 37 °C over night.
Colony PCR
In order to screen for positive bacterial clones after transformation experiments, Colony PCRs with available primers were done as follows. One single plate colony was picked and dissolved in 17.8 µl of water in a PCR tube, subsequently 2.5 µl of 10x Standard Taq  Reaction Buffer, 1 µl of 10 µM Forward and Reverse Primer, 1 µl 2.5 mM dNTP solution and 0.125 µl Taq Polymerase were added from a previously prepared Mastermix.
Plasmid Isolation
To purify plasmid DNA from agar plates, either Roti-Prep Plasmid Mini Kit from Carl Roth or High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit from Roche were used for Minipreps. For high yields of supercoiled, endotoxin-less DNA, Genomed‘s Jetstar Plasmid Purification MIDI Kit or Genopure plasmid MIDI Kit from Roche were used with 150 mL of transformed E. coli o/n culture. No deviances from the manufacturers‘ guidelines were incorporated by performing the isolation steps.

Athens,2018,Team:Athens#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of synthetic biology, we decided to make use of the toehold-switch technology in a cell-free environment in order to detect the MERS-CoV viral RNA. This journey would have been impossible without the invaluable help of the personnel of the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute and especially the contribution of Dr. Pellagia Foka who served as our instructor.
The Signal
Dr Lee Alissandratos, Australian National University
Toehold-switches have previously been exploited for the detection of viruses. Research conducted so far has focused on correlating a change in colour or fluorescence to the presence of specific RNA sequences in a sample. Our initial plan was to design toeholds which would regulate expression of a downstream gene encoding GFP or HRP, correlating toehold unfolding to a change in fluorescence or colour respectively. However, the interpretation of an optical signal often requires further processing, via special lenses or mobile applications, e.g. through the use of a smartphone camera. Although Mobile Diagnostics is a promising sector for field applications, they are far from being standardized.
Dr Lee Alissandratos from The Australian National University provided his feedback on numerous occasions throughout the course of our project. As we were in search for “smart” reporter proteins that could facilitate the function of our proposed mechanism, Dr Alissandratos suggested coupling our virus detection mechanism with a robust and standardised low-cost technique, widely available and utilised at PoC: glucose monitoring with strips. Toward this aim, we concluded in designing toeholds regulating the expression of a gene that encodes trehalase; an enzyme that hydrolyses the glucose-dimer trehalose, leading to glucose accumulation when present in the sample. The glucose final concentration can be measured with a simple off-the-self glucometer thus enabling diagnosis.
Service to the Society
Mr. Panagiotis Doukas, Microbiologist, Analysis Medical Laboratories
The instructions concerning MERS-CoV diagnosis suggest sampling from the pharynx or the lower respiratory system. According to literature, the viral load in the sputum is slightly higher than that of the pharyngeal smear. However, we had concerns on which sampling method is more friendly to the patient and would be more suitable for a POC diagnostic kit. On one hand, not everyone is familiar with spit but on the other hand, the oropharyngeal sampling needs to be performed with the assistance of a second party. We reached out to Dr Doukas and he shared with us his insight concerning different sampling methods. He informed us that we could facilitate the secretion of"

3. the degradation efficiency varies from enzyme to enzyme, and the units are all (tetracycline /h). However, because this value is difficult to measure, we use the ABS value of the medium as a substitute for the dimensionless ABS value of the bacteria containing each enzyme after growing in the tetracycline environment for a long enough time. Supposed he degradation efficiency of lip is u, MnP is V and laccase is w. (The base number of lip is x, MNP is y, and laccase is Z.)
Taking a lip+mnp plasmid as an example, its degradation efficiency is as follows:             The number of plasmid introduced into each bacterium was x (expressing the number of lip x lip degradation efficiency +The number of MNP x expressed MNP efficiency.
The degradation efficiency of a MP + lip plasmid is:
We can see that the degradation efficiency of plasmid is different from that of two identical enzymes, and because the larger the plasmid is, the smaller the n is, it is likely that the degradation efficiency of three degrading enzymes is not even as good as that of a single enzyme.

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ells among other parameters are key to avoid false positives. The samples contained in the study PRJEB27635, have limited information                   about these characteristics, which only allow to make assumptions based on the observations of other parameters. This makes the validation process shown in this part more conversome.
Furthermore, In order to precisely find all the mutations contained in the genome and avoid any bias originated by the sequencing protocol or the genomic analysis, a matched normal sample from the patient is required. The study PRJEB27635                   does not contain any normal samples and hence the tumor and normal samples cannot be directly compared to detect the mutations. However, recent developments in the tools allow the use of only the tumor sample (Teer et al.)
Quality Assessment - FastQC Analysis
The data was pre-analysed using FastQC (Version 0.11.7). The program outputs a summary of different metrics of the reads and signals with a flag the scores that are suboptimal for genomic analysis. In general the results show good quality                   of the reads, with overall good per base sequence quality and Per tile sequence quality for all the patient’s data. Furthermore, the per sequence quality score follows the typical trend for good illumina sequence data as seen in Figure                   1. This implies that the data was collected accordingly and it represents the overall field of view of the targeted data. However, FastQC report shows three metrics that are consistently poor for all the samples in the study. These are                   per base sequence content.
Figure 1. Per sequence quality score for sample ERR2683866. The other samples in the study follow similar trends.
All samples contained an irregular profile of per base sequence content. The per base sequence content represents the relative amount of each base in your genome. Normally, in correctly sequenced data this value should be maintained constant                   throughout the genome. In the data obtained from the study the difference between A and T, or G and C is greater than 20% in certain position especially concentrated at the end of the library. This results can have several implications                   in the data to analyse. Often, this errors are caused by the presence of overrepresented sequences such as sequencing adapter dimers use to index and sort the Illumina reads, this can often bias the data and cause unrealistic results                   (Andrews). This suggest that the adapter primers are contained in the sequences. However, by looking at the Overrepresented sequences metric in report none of the datasets seem to contain any heavily repeated sequences. On the other                   hand, the low score of the per base sequence content can be attributed to a aggressive trimming of"

A Theoretical 4-D Model: Novel Paradigm Designed for
Future iGEMers to
Analyse Ethical Problems in Synthetic Biology
by Li Fuyao
College of Economics and Management, HZAU
In this part we:
built a theoretical 4-D model of ethical concerns in synthetic biology for the reference of future iGEMers;
demonstrated how to use this paradigm by example: When ""Rewire"" goes Haywire---Ethical Concerns of our Project.
1.Motivation
Evolution is a process which has a direction that begins in the coded genes of life itself and looks into the nebulous fog of tomorrow. Evolution is a faithful companion of time itself, which we could not see the future, but only the present and past of. Its direction can be traced back but can hardly be predicted, and it is a direction as old and unfathomable as time itself. Nature dictates the direction of evolution with no emotion; but when this direction intersects with the welfare of humans, however, it is tinged with the human perception of good or evil, right or wrong, is or ought. Especially when it's no longer nature who inflicted this direction upon evolution.
As has been discussed in the preface, artificial evolution is synthetic biology in hindsight. Hindsight here means not intentional when doing but happened after all. What synthetic biologists are doing is not intentional interference in the evolution process, but not being intentional is not enough; as long as it happen, it's our irrevocable responsibility.
Many previous iGEM teams have done impressive work"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"rescence fusion protein’s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol’s concentration treatments. The shape of experimental group emission curve and blank group emission curve are obviously different. That of experimental groups with different taxol’s concentration (final concentration: 0 μm, 0.5 μm, 5 μm, 25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm, 250 μm and 500 μm) are basically similar except of the whole translation of wave band. Line graphs are shown here.
According to the picture above we can tell that adding taxol would influence the emission intensity of the fluorescent protein, which induces the shape and position changes of the intensity curve. Then we verified the influence of taxol to the fluorescent protein.
Because the interpreted variable is discrete, we use the Box Plot to describe the intensity of emission of microtubulin under the different concentration of the Taxol. According to the distribution of characteristic bands, we divide CPS value into four bands and use the Box Plot to describe them respectively. The specific four bands are as follows, 520nm-522.5nm, 522.5nm-525nm, 525nm-527.5nm and 527.5-530. And we get the following plot.
From the figure, we can see four boxplots. Each of them stands for a certain concentration of the TAX；the straight line in the box is the median of the data under a certain concentration, standing for the average of the light absorption value OD350 under this concentration. The upper line stands for the upper quartile of the data and the nether line stands for the nether quartile of the data. We can find that data have a big inner undulation under the concentration of TAX greater than 12.5, but when the concentration is between 5 and 12.5, the undulation of the data is tiny. In addition to this, the average of the light absorption value OD350 is high under the TAX’s concentration from 0 to 1 and the TAX’s concentration above 12.5.
2.0 - Theory of the one-way analysis of variance
By constructing the F-test statistics, we can use the one-way analysis of variance to study whether classification of the independent variable’s different levels can make significant influence on the variation of the continuous variable. If the levels have a significant influence, we can further give the 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels."
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," as Cph1 was isolated from the cyanobacteria Synechocytis PCC6803. Cph1 has a fusion site, which can be used to combine it with the kinase EnvZ, from the EnvZ-OmpR kinase-regulator system, to form a two-domain receptor known as Cph8. The chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB) absorbs light in the red region with maximal absorbance at 662 nm Lamparter T, Esteban B, Hughes J. Phytochrome Cph1 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. Purification, assembly, and quaternary structure. European journal of biochemistry. 2001;268(17):4720-30. . When heterogeneously expressed in E. coli, it can, in combination with the light receptor Cph8, be used to form a light-sensitive circuit, making E. coli able to respond to red light abor JJ, Levskaya A, Voigt CA. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli. Journal of molecular biology. 2011;405(2):315-324. .
In situations where no red light is present, the photoreceptor PCB activates the phytochrome Cph1, thereby promoting kinase activity through the EnvZ kinase, illustrated in figure 1. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of the PCB by red light, results in a situation, where EnvZ will not be able to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. The lack of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression by this promoter.

A toxin-antitoxin system is a system composed of two gene products, of which one specifies a cell toxin and the other an antitoxin, which neutralises the toxic effect caused by the toxin.

Meeting Session With the Doctor
We also went to Tzu Chi Hospital to have a meeting with Doctor Chu Shao Yin, a pediatrician specialising in children diabetes. We told her about our project and she also gave us some advice and also some suggestion to improve our product. We introduced iGem to her and she was fascinated by what iGem is doing.
She also shared with us her data on Type II diabetes and also gave us some papers regarding type II diabetes for our reference. We had a great time and also got a lot of information regarding type II diabetes from our meeting with Dr. Chu Shao Yin.
Spreading Awareness Around
the Campus
We went to the department of Life Science and also the department of Human Genetics and Molecular biology at our university to promote our project, the Chromo Diabetector and also to promote iGem.
As we were promoting, there were many students who were interested in this competition. It is happy to see that more and more students are aware of this activity and hopefully more people can participate and we can see more eye-opening innovations in the future.
2016 iGem Asia-Pacific Conference
We attended the iGem Asia-Pacific conference organised by NCKU at Tainan. There were teams from Taiwan, China and Hong Kong that attended the conference. We presented our projects and also exchanged thoughts and ideas on how to make our project better. From this conference, we also learnt that there are many factors that we did not take into consideration while we were designing our project. There were many friends from the other teams that gave us valuable ideas and advices which enabled us to make further improvements.
Furthermore, this conference also enable us to make more new friends. From this, we had some help with our experiment and modelling parts from NCKU, SUSTC and also NCTU. Conference like this helps us to learn how to cooperate and also strengthen the bonds between 2 teams.

DNA damage tolerance
D. radiodurans
The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans shows remarkable resistance to a range of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, desiccation, UV radiation, oxidizing agents, and electrophilic mutagens. It is an aerobically-growing bacterium that is most famous for its extreme resistance to ionizing radiation; it not only can survive acute exposures to gamma radiation that exceed 15,000 Gy, but it can also grow continuously in the presence of chronic radiation (60 Gy/hour)  without any effect on its growth rate or ability to express cloned genes. For comparison, E. coli can withstand up to 200 Gy, and an acute exposure of just 5-10 Gy is lethal to a human being.
We explored various genes from D. radiodurans, implicated in its remarkable DNA damage resistance. By BioBricking selected genes and transforming them into E. coli, we hoped to confer additional DNA damage tolerance to the host cells.
Radiotolerance genes
PprI
PprI, which is unique to D. radiodurans, is invoked by present data as the most important protein for radiation response mechanism. PprI can significantly and specifically induce the gene expression of recA and pprA and enhance the enzyme activities of catalases. These results strongly suggest that PprI plays a crucial role in regulating multiple DNA repair and protection pathways in response to radiation stress.
PprA
A pleiotropic protein promoting DNA repair, its role in radiation resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans was demonstrated. PprA preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA carrying strand breaks, inhibits E. coli exonuclease III activity, and stimulates the DNA end-joining reaction catalysed by ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent DNA ligases. These results suggest that D. radiodurans has a radiationinduced non-homologous end-joining repair mechanism in which PprA plays a critical role.
PprM
PprM (a modulator of the PprI-dependent DNA damage response) is a homolog of cold shock protein (Csp). PprM regulates the induction of PprA but not that of RecA. PprM belongs in a distinct clade of a subfamily together with Csp homologs from D. geothermalis and Thermus thermophilus"

Flow CytoMetry (FCM)
From the result of fluorescence microscopy, the expression of HRH4-mcherry fusion proteins can be observed roughly, for measuring the expression level of HRH4-mcherry, FCM is performed. From the result, a distinct peak value can be observed. Though it can’t representative all the functional HRH4 that locates in the membrane, it can be indicated that most of them are correctly located from the fluorescence microscopy result, this data is enough to support our modeling.
Result
The test of this composite part set the foundation of our project, it proved that HRH4 can be expressed in high level under the trigger of a constitutive promoter-ADH1 promoter. Besides, the HRH4 can locate in the yeasts’ membrane without adding other sequence. It can be indicated that if mcherry is removed, functional HRH4 can still be expressed and locate in the membrane.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," )strain in co-culture with the Fim switch strains.  The assay was performed using methods described in Fim 96 Plate assay Protocol .  The data shows the expression of GFP in the reporter strain over a standard growth curve.  The FimW and FimR strains represent the white and red variants of the Fim switch strain respectively, these were co-cultured with the reporter strain in a 1:14 ratio.  Each data point is the mean of 3 biological repeats.  RFU stands for relative fluorescence units.
Conclusions
The aim of the Fim switch part was to make a processor module which can be visually inspected for functionality.  The Fim switch has been shown to expresses the eforRed chromoprotein under normal (uninduced) conditions which allows the user to both determine that the strain is alive and has maintained the Fim switch plasmid.  Following induction, the Fim promoter flips direction and begins expressing RhlI which synthesises the C4-AHL quorum sensing molecule.  This has been shown to successfully induce expression of sfGFP in the reporter strain ( BBa_K2205015 ).
Despite several attempts we were unable to produce a Fim switch testing construct where fimE expression could be controlled using the E. coli arabinose inducible promoter.  Though transformations did yield some colonies when trying to make this part, none were red in colour.  This possibly indicates that the arabinose inducible promoter (even when grown on 0.5% w/v glucose) is still too active.  The design for this construct has been submitted ( BBa_K2205006 ).
Future Work
Since there is some leaky expression of the fimE gene (even without a promoter) to fine tune the Fim switch the lac operator could be inserted upstream of the fimE RBS to repress unwanted expression.  The part could then be used following the addition of IPTG.  An alternative method would be to clone a transcriptional terminator upstream of the fimE RBS to prevent leaky expression from elsewhere in the plasmid.

I feel well informed about GMO
9/24
Genetically modified organisms – GMOs are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by means of genetic engineering.
Where do you see the highest risks concerning glyphosate?
10/24
The effect of glyphosate in different areas is still unclear. Concerning the health and biodiversity risks of glyphosate a Danish farmer in Europe alleged that glyphosate caused his piglets to be born with deformities; in countries like Argentina, experts have blamed cancer, miscarriage and deformation in humans on glyphosate. Environmentalists also point out potential harmful effects of glyphosate on biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition it was recently published that Glyphosate perturbs the gut microbiota of honey bees which increases their susceptibility to infection and might be the cause for the increased mortality of honey bees.
Another concern is the emerging weed resistance. By planting GT crops the farmer uses exclusively glyphosate to remove other weeds. On the one hand this leads to the reduction of other chemical herbicide intermixtures. On the other hand, a study shows that the use of glyphosate has significantly increased in the USA which might correlate with the emerging of weed resistances.
Clearly something has to be done about the effects on biodiversity and accumulation in the soil. Hence we took a further step in our experiments. We engineered B. subtilis in a way that it contains the enzyme GAT (glyphosate acetyltransferase) . This allows the bacterium to acetylate glyphosate rendering it inactive. This could be used to clean up contaminated fields and sites.
Microorganisms can be used in various ways (ecological recovering etc). Do you feel well informed about the possibility to use microorganisms in the envrionment?
11/24
“It is a very good idea – interesting and useful!“
“It would be better to fight the cause and not the symptom.”
“In general I think it is a very good approach but I have some concerns about your genetically modified bacteria. What happens when they spread and displace other very useful microorganisms or cause other harm?”
“I really like the project and the idea behind it. I would totally support it unless it would cause other environmental problems!”
“Maybe the you could also find a way to degrade glyphosate with bacillus.”
Would you visit information events about glyphosate or gene-technology?
12/24
There is for example an organisation called “ Agrar Koordination ” which organizes informational events and projects. One project focuses on gene technology in agriculture and another on the usage of pesticides. In addition, we organized quite a few informational"
Melbourne,2016,Team:Melbourne#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"particles}{m^3}})^{\frac{1}{3}}\\ &= (\frac{1}{6.022\times 10^{26} C})^{\frac{1}{3}}\\ &= 1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-\frac{1}{3}} \end{align} $$
Therefore, define the time constant $\tau_A$ as the average time of an enzyme substrate to diffuse between two enzymes in Scenario A:
$$\tau_A = \frac{MSD}{v} = \frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-\frac{1}{3}}}{v}$$ Here, $v$ represents the velocity via Brownian motion given by: $$\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = \frac{3}{2}k_B T$$ $$\therefore v = \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}}$$
Scenario B
Assume that the steric interactions between the peptide arms interact so that the average star peptide shape is tetrahedral.
$l$ = length between two enzymes in 3D
$r$ = arm length
Therefore, assuming that all products from enzyme reactions continue flow towards the node where they are being consumed and don't interact with other star peptides, the length the substrates need to travel is $1.633r$. We can therefore define the time constant for Scenario B as:
$$\tau_B = \frac{1.633r}{v}$$
Finding the reaction rate for Scenario B
As we go from Scenario A to Scenario B, the reaction rate will increase by a factor of $\frac{tau_A}{tau_B}$:
$$ \begin{align} \frac{tau_A}{tau_B} &= \frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-\frac{1}{3}}}{v} \times \frac{v}{1.633r}\\ &= \frac{1.18 \times 10^{-9} C^{-\frac{1}{3}}}{1.633r}\\ &= 7.23 \times 10^{-10}(\frac{1}{rC^{\frac{1}{3}}}) \end{align} $$
Mevalonate Pathway
We believe that a useful application for the star peptide is to increase the reaction kinetics of the mevalonate pathway.
This can be achieved with two star peptides joined together in conjunction with the enzymes attached to the ends of the arms as illustrated below.

Discussion and conclusions
For the fuel cell experiment we have obtained a series of interesting results. In our half fuel cells, E. coli seemed to exhibit properties similar to S. oneidensis. E. coli generates potential which closely relates to S. oneidensis outputs and the results repeat throughout multiple media, except for the final experiment using M9 with sodium acetate, which limited the growth of E. coli altogether as well as limiting the electrogenicity of other bacteria. However, S. oneidensis electrogenicity remains superior in all experiments, most likely because of its electron export system proteins. We hope that transferring S. oneidensis genes (especially mtrA or mtrCAB) into E. coli will improve its response.
It seems that electrogenicity can be linked to the growth of cultures, at least in the minimal media. This shows a great potential for using microbial half fuel cells in combination with different promoters and selectable markers. To test this concept we have tested the BBa_J33203 (arsenic promoter) + lacZ' construct in our half fuel cells as a growth-based biosensor. We have obtained encouraging results, where transformed cells show faster voltage change compared to controls, showing a good potential for our system to serve"

Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts which are defined as protein generators     but actually most of them do not fit to the definition provided above.     Although some parts are not functional and do not generate proteins     at all, they are classified as protein generators, which makes searching     for the parts difficult in the registry. Furthermore, there are also     numerous parts which are defined as “composite parts” but actually they     fit to the same definition with protein generators. In order to overcome     the problem of misuse of device type we have extracted related image     ID information for the composite parts. Image ID information helped     us to correctly categorize composite parts depending on its individual     atomic parts and identify the ones with more than one function, such     as being both inhibitor and activator. In other words, we used image     and part IDs in order to merge an input for its outputs.
Subtitle working conditions, includes all the detailed information     about the experimental properties of parts, and the details about the     working process of individual parts and complete devices. Additionally,     we marked the subtitle “Working Condition” in our standardization template     as potentially the most important title that helps synthetic biologist     to better understand the parts functions at iGEM’s part registry database.     The main problem we have encounter with the subtitle “working condition”     is within most of the parts the details about working process is not     enough and not provided regularly.
Examples of Misuse of Terminology:
For Composite Parts:
PartID: BBa_S04055
PartName: Synthetic lacYZ operon
This part is functional and responsible for the production of LacY     and LacZ proteins. This part partially fits the definition for “composite     part” but actually should be a protein generator as it fits fully to     the definition of “protein generators”.
For Protein Generators:
PartID: BBa_J45299
PartName: PchA & PchB enzyme generator
The part which is illustrated above actually fits the definition     for “composite part” but in part registry it is classified as protein     generator. This part can be functional but it needs a promoter. Even     though this part is not functional and is not capable of producing protein,     part registry assigns this product as protein generator. We suggest     that all parts in the registry, which are composed of more than one     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.

--Friday 7/15/11--
Today was a really fun day!  We did some minipreps in the morning but then drove down to UC Berkeley for a NorCal iGEM picnic.  We got to talk with our fellow iGEMers from UCSF and Berkeley and got updates on how their projects were going.  It was nice to see that there is a community of synthetic biologists in Northern California that we can share ideas and materials with.  After a relaxed lunch, we had a small meeting to discuss how to achieve the medal requirements.  We discussed helping each other to fulfill one of the gold medal requirements with the Berkeley team since some of our software tools might be useful for their project this year.  We then got to see their lab and received some pBAD+AraC since those parts from the registry seem to be faulty.  Overall a really good day!

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Modelling Diary_-_-_TEXT.html,"
This week was cut short by the absence of the Wiki team on Thursday and Friday. Regardless, the focus shifted onto writing for the wiki as Monday saw the finalisation of the wiki modelling page for the simulation. This was proof read and new information approved. We also started the week with the intention of writing various in depth pieces for the wiki including pieces explaining the maths and a piece on parameter scanning.
More bug fixing and general tinkering occurred, with the main focus being trajectory maths - the z coordinate needed to be found at the point the random walk path left the cone section.
Week 24/08 - 30/08
Another slightly emptier week for the modelling diary as the modelling team was used elsewhere within the project:
Our matlab skills were used to analyse and produce data for the interlab study. A script file was made to produce graphs of the data, which we also extracted means and standard deviations from.
General computer skills were used to make the poster and banner as they needed to be made using a high quality vector graphics application.
A lot of time this week was spent making presentation material in preparation for the UK meet up in London.
We expect more of the same next week as we prepare for the UK meetup - things are really hotting up!
Week 31/08 - 06/09
This was the week of the UK meetup and as a result Monday through Wednesday were spent working on presentation material and practicing our presentation, this also included finalisation of the poster material as well as other meetup related activities.
UK meet up in Westminster!
We presented on the process of building our simulation, our influences from the lab and human practices and what we hope to gain from each through parameter scanning.
We also spoke to members of other teams about some of their modelling practices and made some friends along the way.
Westminster University did a phenomenal job of hosting everyone, the event was fantastic!
As a brief aside regarding actual modelling, attempts at successful parameter scans were made, but yielded nothing :(
Week 07/09 - 13/09
We were back to modelling this week, with the lab team aiming to get us some data to feed into the model. This included the processing of in silico data from NUPACK in order to obtain probability distributions for the binding and splitting elements in the simulation. These replaced the pre-existing estimation for the likelihood of these mechanics occurring.

Lab equipment in Brazil
Hardware
When we think about an iGEM project, we have to wonder: what are the people’s necessities? How can we contribute to the world? Are we able to develop a new technology? What difficulties will we have to face?
We had to answer all those questions, and also face all the obstacles that could prevent the completion of our project. Brazil is not a developed country, and it presents a direct impacts on science. It is common to hear complaints about the difficulty to buy a laboratory device. Sometimes, even a simple equipment, as a centrifuge is not available, and as a manner to solve this issue, we explored the open hardware framework.
Open hardware consists in sharing information about hardware designs, offering many benefits to their users. The main advantage of its use is the possibility of building a new technology in a cheaper and faster manner. Besides, as the source code and all the instructions to build the devices are available, it is also easier to update, maintain and repair it.
The iGEM group and the open hardware community collaboration enabled the development of a centrifuge, an electrophoresis system and a transilluminator.  All of these devices were essentials to the project and now  we are excited to keep this collaboration. The continuous use of the equipments also increases chances of something going wrong, like in one of our electrophoresis runs when a power supply blowed up and, we got in critical situation. The repairment is very expensive and would take a long time to get it done. And there is no code available to just check which part went wrong.
More than only setting up a great hardware kit, we also interacted intensively with a broad audience. We engaged the USP community directly with a well structured Hackathon, got in touch directly with teachers and high school students at the FabLearn conference and spread the Open Lab Hardware word even for designers and artists at FAZ!
BioHackathon at USP
In the hope of reaching out to the community and effectively making an impact with our work, we organized a hands-on open workshop on making open hardware equipment for biotech. The event was organized in partnership with University of"

In our case, the ribosome binding sites in the construct could be replaced by a stronger or weaker one depending on the situation. This fine tuning process would help regulate the overall strength to avoid any part from dominating.

Philip Hau Sørensen
BSc. Human Life Science Engineering, 5th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
At my first year at DTU, I had a lecture session on synthetic biology. It was immediately clear to me how synthetic biology was the future of recombinant DNA technology, a field I have been interested in since childhood. When I heard that DTU had a student team working with synthetic biology, I couldn’t help but apply right away!
What did you work on during the project?
I worked on outreach, human practises and as part of the wet lab team. I was responsible for the 4th International InterLab Study of the iGEM competition. As part of the wetlab, I was involved in the design and testing of our BioBricks. As a side project to this, I did some modeling on the enzymatic reactions of the BioBrick device I developed.

Christopher Workman
Associate Professor, DTU Bioengineering
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I supervise DTU Biobuilders and iGEM projects because I believe in a future where synthetic biology is used to benefit society in new and diverse ways. The next generation of engineers and scientists will make the breakthroughs that will make this possible and it is exciting to be a small part of the development of this next generation.
What did you work on during the project?
My role was most often moral support and encouragement. There are so many challenges when going into the lab and experiencing repeated failures. This can be very trying on the patience and it is important to keep the spirits up in order to persevere.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html,"EF2-Jet could function as a good promoter, we set two groups, experimental and control, to verify it. We reconstructed pcDNA3.1 by connecting MEF2-Jet with the gene encoding luciferase. So, if MEF2-Jet could work normally, the expression of luciferase will gain a huge increase than that with no promoter in its upstream.
Method: Cultured ECHO and C3H10 cells in 24-well plate for 24h (medium for C3H10: DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). Experimental groups were transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing MEF2-Jet-luciferase, while control groups were transfected with pGL3-Basic which contains no promoter. After another 24h, we conducted a dual-luciferase assay to measure the expression of luciferase.
Note: We have searched related information and known the calcium concentration of the medium for C3H10 is 2mmol/L, because of the calcium ions got from DMEM and FBS.
Result: As we expected, expression level of luciferase in experimental group transfected with MEF2-Jet-luciferase largely outgrows its counterpart with pGL3-Basic. The picture below well depicts the function of MEF2-Jet as a good promoter. However, by comparing the experimental groups varying in Ionomycin concentration, we get no favorable evidence in explaining calcium ions could regulate the enhancer-promoter. In theory, after adding 5μM Ionomycin, it would have a significant intracellular increase of Ca2+, which would show a great up-regulated expression of luciferase.
Conclusion: In order to explain the result, we searched for more research and studies and found out that there is calcium in the cell culture (proximally 2mM) and that concentration might be enough to start transcription. Then we come up with the idea to reduce the calcium concentration using EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) a polyamino carboxylic acid, a chelating agent that is related to the better known EDTA, but with a much higher affinity for calcium. The result will be shown below.
2. Promoter functions without Ca2+ from medium
Idea: As the medium we use to culture C3H10 is DMEM mixed with 10% FBS, the Ca2+ concentration in this medium is about 2mM, which is not negligible in our experiment"

The problem
The current state of industrial biotechnology means that the vast majority biorefineries relies on edible substrates such as corn, wheat or sugar canes. This has sparked sparked the food vs. fuel debate, leading to the fundamental question: “Should we use our edible crops to feed the growing human population, or use it to provide sustainable chemicals to the industrialised world?”. A better question might be: “Why are we not doing both?”. The limiting factor of current processes, is a lack of molecular tools that has limited us to rely on a small number of organisms with narrow substrate ranges. Even though efforts has been made to expand the substrate range of many conventional cell factories, such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the task has proven difficult and real impact has soon to come as a result of these experiments
The solution
The development of new technologies such as CRISPR and Next-generation sequencing has dramatically reduced the effort required to genetically modify non-model organisms, and is effectively breaking down the barrier between model and non-model organism. Therefore we though: “Why force a model organisms to grow on non-conventional substrates, when we can start of with an organism that already grows on a broad range of substrates?”. See our proposed solution by scrolling down.

Start learning SBML and LibSBML. Well~~ download, unzip, install, OMG!! Quite a lot of codes, my teammates advise me to read the tutorial first. Yes, after reading, I realize the structure of SBML file and working process of LibSBML approximately. In terms of our software, some basic information of the SBML file is needed, such as amount of spceies and parameters, their names, information of each reaction, including the mathematical expressions of each kineticlaw. All these data need to extract from given SBML file. So it looks learning to use LibSBML is inevitable.

Go on working with LibSBML, Successfully output the species names, parameters and other informations.
Need to face some problems when deal with the mathematical expressions, SBML uses ASTNode to store the formula, although it is not difficult to manage the ""tree"" data structure, I still need to make clear the functions in ""class ASTNode"". My teammates need me to supply the information orderly, which means :
1. The information of one reaction should be stored by categories.
2. The terms(the formula related to one certain species) should be put together.
3. The whole information need to be packaged for next step.
Aug. 15, 2009
The readSBMLFile part finished, in this part, I pick each species list in the file orderly, and search all reactions, if the species appeared in ""ListOfReactants""; ""ListOfProducts"" or ""ListOfModifiers"", i'll push the informations of the reaction into the vertor<term>, the data structure of vector<term> has been decided as ""class val_func"". After the traversing, i'll package these vectors<term>, and sent to the next step.

The writeSBMLFile part finished, the experience of making read part facilitates me to assemble this part. Besides some normal steps, I use ""traversing binary tree"" to make the mathematical expression fit each certain reaction.

Thane showed us where this is in the lab and I leafed through the booklet for a little while. If you’re cool with it, I’d like to spend some time playing with the software and figuring out what that machine can do. So much of mathematical modelling depends on how frequently and effectively we can make measurements, and the experimental/data collection approach that we take will ride heavily on the instrumentation that we are working with, especially if we’re dealing with proteins that are degrading and processes that are happening quickly (are they? I still need to see if this is the case). The machine looks like it’s more sophisticated and advanced than the plate reader that I used in Toronto, which took forever to analyse a 96-well plate – which is bad news if we’re dealing with time-dependent data (and which is why I’d be reluctant to fill a 96-well plate completely unless the time between reading well 1 and well 96 is much shorter than the response time of the circuit and the half-life of the protein). But if it can make these measurements faster, then we’ll have much more versatility in what we can test, with (hopefully) more reliable models. I’ll bring this up tomorrow as well.

TRIZ Workshop (27th July 2018)
During the TRIZ workshop, Troyka Innovations , one of our sponsors helped us to work on a TRIZ action lab. In this workshop we used several methods to identify the problems in our project, and searched for ways to solve them. Next to Edwin Poorte, who guided the workshop, we invited our partners from EV Biotech, Linda Dijkshoorn and Sergey Lunev so we could come up with new solutions together. Combining all these expertises we came to great new ideas for our project!
Campnight at the Farm!
To further improve the group’s cohesion, the team decided to spend a weekend at an authentic Dutch farmhouse. Throughout the weekend, the team engaged in amusing yet team-building exercises. One exercise include the making of a square of rope together with the whole team, while blindfolded. This exercise was learned from our friends in Utrecht . A visit to the local dairy farm was also part of the program, followed by a breakfast of its fresh produce. This, together with a midnight hunt for a Geo-cash made that we felt like family instead of friends after this weekend.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Manufacturing_-_-_TEXT.html," accommodate the production of bulk numbers of cartridges in the hundreds (involving daily operations) with the intent of increasing this production to accommodate thousands of cartridges to be produced. This will be done through further partnerships to diverse manufacturing groups outside of Canada as we begin to move our production to a more global audience.  Our first major goal in our marketing strategy is to reach 30% of the government regulation market with our product.  This would require the capacity to produce approximately 15,000 cartridges per year. As the biological components for this volume of cartridges would still be small, FREDsense could feasibly produce the components necessary for this volume.
Timeframe - We plan to reach full capacity, supplying approximately 30% of the government regulation market (15,000 cartridges and 150 detectors yearly) by year three of active production as dictated in our budget and milestones section.  This means we will be required to begin negotiating new contracts with larger manufacturers and distribution providers by year 2 to ensure our company continues to grow.
Manufacturing Advantages
Our technology platform provides clear manufacturing advantages compared to similar products:
Versatility -  All products we hope to generate, the general toxin sensor and other second generation products, will use the same detector system. The only change in component is in the bacterial strain used in the cartridges.  This provides versatile product lines to be developed with minimal additional costs in manufacturing incurred.
Multiple Strategies - Our group has identified multiple types of prototype designs to accommodate changes in cost associated with the cuvette style cartridge system (i.e. using microfluidics as an alternative to cuvettes).  This will ensure that we can implement the best, most cost-effective, solution in our manufacturing.
Retaining Control - The province of Alberta has numerous government programs which allow for manufacturing contacts to be made more easily and at a discounted rate.  We hope to use these types of contacts to establish relationships with key industry manufacturing players.  By out-sourcing all of the non-biological components of our systems to these manufacturers, we have the ability to retain control of the sensing organism we are using while maintaining the benefits of allowing other contractors to build our detectors and partially our cartridges.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," points, negative or positive, depending on the effect and its power.With this, we designed three different layouts that include all important information on the card, exemplary shown on the cards for Ebola, Painkiller and Mutation, depicted below.
With this layout, all important information on the card is easily visible and the player gains a basic impression on the represented effect on the first sight.                     For each pathogen, a depiction and information on its spread, lethality, symptoms, possible cures and some extra facts are shown on the cards next to its assigned health points (HP).                     Thus, every player gets a very basic understanding on the pathogen’s effect only be seeing its health points.                     This basic understanding again can be deepened by looking at the additional information. Similarly, to the red cards, the blue cards –                     representing cures – give information on possible side effects or other interesting properties.                     The yellow cards, as they represent preconditions or events, show an extra information section for possible explanations.                     With this, we developed a basic set of cards as well as suitable rules for an exciting play.                     This basic set of cards we then used as the foundation for our collaborations. More on this can be found under the Collaborations segment.                     We also advanced the general English version with different features. We – for example – introduced grey cards to the set.                     These cards are included to the set to make the game flow more unpredictable and entertaining.                     As the normal flow of the game starts at a certain player and always goes on to the next one, cards like “Change of Direction” make the game more fun for more players.                     This is because not every player always has to wait for a whole round to take its turn and because one does not always take a card from or give cards to the same person.                     We think, that this card game educates in an entertaining way about diseases, how they are caused and how they affect us.
All files needed to play this game, the set of all cards as well as the rules with explanations of the game can be downloaded.
If you want to download the card game in other languages,                 check out the collaborations which arose from the card game!

Austin_Texas,2012,Team:Austin Texas#Spinach reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,". Little troubleshooting was needed as the gibson worked after one attempt. However, many errors were encountered when using various fluorescent plate readers, often wasting whole trials due to machine detection error.The promoter that would be tested for Spinach fluorescence was the T7 Promoter: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGT, resembles closely Bba_J64997 constitutive T7 promoter.
5' Spinach/mCherry Dual Reporter
This construct contains the mCherry gene 5' of the Spinach aptamer, we assumed this construct would be more effective at showing translational strength because of the possibility of the Spinach Aptamer secondary structure knocking off the ribosome during translation.
3' Spinach/mCherry Dual Reporter
This version of the construct has mCherry 3' of the Spinach aptamer, we had expected this construct would not be as efficient as the 5' construct.
Results
Protocol
The protocol for using the dual fluorescent reporter was performed as follows:
Grow culture of construct (both 5' and 3') overnight in BL21 AI or BL21 DE3 (BL21 contains gene coding for T7 RNAP under control of LacUV5)
Dilute on the following day and grow until mid-log phase
Induce BL21 cells (DE3 or AI) with either 1mM IPTG or 1mM IPTG and 0.2% arabinose, respectively.
Add 200uL aliquots of construct and control cells in a 96-well plate
The fluorphore for spinach fluorescence, DFHBI, was added either into the well plate if performing a dilution series, or directly into the culture of cells
Dilution series of DFHBI, revealed 100-200uM DFHBI being the ideal concentration in culture for max RFU values and minimal cell death
Analyze graphs of Spinach Fluorescence (RFU/ABS) vs Time
RFU/ABS calculated by RFUtest / OD600test - RFUcontrol / OD600control = RFU/ABS
Problems with mCherry Function
We had difficulty observing fluorescence of the mCherry protein when grown in the plate reader. Originally, the plate reader being used for this project was showing no fluorescence change in either the wavelengths of Spinach or mCherry (Spinach- ex: 469nm  em: 501nm, mCherry- ex:587 em: 610nm), and the assumption was made that the construct was not performing as intended. The plate reader we first used"

Next we left these incubation for 3 hours at 37C. We isolated protein from totally 16 hours incubated broth culture. We prepared a suitable buffer to create the conditions necessary to show the TEV Protease’s enzymatic activity.(Conditions are given below). Then we prepare our DAMP-Pex, and TEV protease isolated proteins by mixing in the buffer, we put the resulting mixture overnight incubation at 20° C. After incubation, to observe the fate of DAMP-pexigan proteins we did Western Blot. But in western blotting, we could not get any significant rational result.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

UESTC,2013,Team:UESTC Life#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," States and in Europe are polluted with TCP as a result of improper disposal of TCP-contaminated effluents and due to the past use of the soil fumigant D-D, a mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene and 1,2-dichloropropane that contained TCP as a contaminant (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, national priority site fact sheet and Tysons dump site). Due to its toxicity and persistence, TCP poses a serious risk to ecosystems and human health[18,19,21].
Four Key Enzymes
LinA and LinB
Selected LinA and LinB are cofactor-independent dehalogenase from Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26,  LinA mediates the first step of aerobic microbial degradation of γ-HCH  to 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene , which is further metabolized by the sequential activity of LinB.
Fig.1 Proposed pathway for the metabolism of lindane (-yhexachlorocyclohexane) in ''P. paucimobilis UT26''[3,4,5]. 1,-y-Hexachlorocyclohexane; 2, y-pentachlorocyclohexene; 3, 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene (chemically unstable); 4, 2,4,5-trichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-ol (chemically unstable); 5, 2,5dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol;
DhaA and HheC
DhaA and HheC also are cofactor-free dehalohygenase. DhaA from Rhodococcus sp hydrolyzes carbon-halogen bonds in a wide range of haloalkanes, including TCP, to the corresponding haloalcohol, releasing halide ions. Haloalcohol dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 is a potentially useful enzyme involved in the degradation of several important environmental pollutants, such as 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol, 2,3-dichloropropa-nol, 1-chloropropanol, epichlorohydrin and so on. Additionally, HheC has highly enantioselective dehal"

This study provided evidence of probiotics being able to serve a corrective role in decreasing the antibiotic induced dysbiosis in the gut [11]. The only impediment of probiotic treatments, is that they work over a longer time period, and as more of a preventative measure that is not always effective. Given the challenges of existing treatments, our goal has been to find an additional and efficacious treatment for C. difficile infection.
Bacteriophage (phage) Therapy
Phage therapy is a relatively unexplored route of treatment in Western medicine compared to Eastern Europe. Primarily because in the past antibiotics have proven themselves to be a relatively fast, and broad form of treatment for bacterial infections. Resulting in less experimental and therapeutic information being needed on alternative treatments such as phage therapy for the past century[7, 12]. However, as antibiotic resistance and other detrimental factors of antibiotic intake, such as the removal of commensal bacteria, are becoming better understood, an alternative treatment that is able to avoid these consequences is important. One such treatment is the use of phages.
Generally, a phage particle consists of a protein shell enveloping genetic material, and a tail that allows attachment and insertion of the genetic material into the host bacterium. They generally have two modes of action for propagation. The lytic cycle which is the process by which a phage inserts its genome into the bacterial host, hijacks the hosts protein machinery and generates up to hundreds of copies of itself until the bacteria lyses and the phages are released to infect more bacteria [13].
Whereas, phages that follow the lysogenic cycle will integrate their genome into the bacterial host chromosome and remain dormant within the bacterium. Thereby dividing with the cell to propagate rather than killing off the host immediately as a lytic phage would. Certain environmental stresses such as antibiotics and ultraviolet light can trigger a temperate phage (a phage that has integrated its genome into a host bacterium) to switch into a lytic state thereby killing the host bacterium. It is important to understand that most phages are able to switch between lytic and lysogenic cycles depending on their inherent nature and environment, rather than strictly persisting in one type of cycle [13].
Phage therapy has remarkable features that makes it a very useful treatment. Due to phages being living organisms they have evolved alongside bacteria, meaning they are more predisposed to counter certain bacterial defense systems. Plus, unlike antibiotics some phages have evolved mechanisms to"

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#Conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html," instead. We took two main approaches to developing such a model: an agent-based model (ABM), and a partial differential equation (PDE) model.
The ABM is a stochastic simulation of conjugation through a population of donor and recipient cells. The main advantages of this model are that it accounts for randomness of plasmid transfer, as well as likely maintaining accuracy on small-scale areas. Its main drawback is that it is computationally expensive to model a large number of cells, and thus cannot model populations on large scales.
The PDE Model addresses large scale populations through deterministic methods. Being a differential equation system, a wide variety of mathematical tools to analyze the system are readily available, and it is more computationally efficient than the Agent-Based Model.
Agent-Based Model
Overview
We have developed a novel model for bacterial conjugation on flat surfaces. By treating each bacterium as an “agent” that has properties associated with its type (either Donor or Recipient), and letting the group of agents interact over a prescribed period of time, one can make qualitative and quantitative conclusions about their behavior.
The model is based on the idea of having hexagonal cells that each may or may not be occupied by a donor (e.g. modified S. epidermidis) or a recipient (e.g. MRSA). An individual bacterium may divide into an empty neighboring cell and if the cell is a donor, conjugate with an adjacent recipient. We assume that the conjugative plasmid represses methicillin-resistance 100% (i.e. all donor cells will die upon introduction of antibiotic).
The hexagonal grid was used over a traditional square grid because hexagons offer more routes for conjugation and division to occur, as well as the fact that hexagons form a tighter packing structure than squares. Because bacteria are capable of very tight packing on flat surfaces, the hexagonal framework more accurately captures interaction between neighboring bacteria - an important consideration when modeling conjugation.
Algorithm
Before outlining our algorithm, it is important to explicitly state the general assumptions we made in the ABM:
The flat surface is treated as a 2D hexagonal grid (of size n x n), and refer to each grid location as a hex
Each hex may be occupied by at most one bacterium
We do not distinguish between transconjugants original donors
Donors and Recipients are both able to divide
Donors may conjugate with recipients, after which the recipient becomes a donor
A cell may divide if there is an empty adjacent hex
A donor may conjugate if there is a recipient in an"

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Sales and Marketing Strategy
Sales business model.Biolink provides a full service: 3D-printing tools, set-up of equipment on-premises, training, maintenance and customization based on needs.
Customer intimate competitive strategy. To gain a competitive edge, we cultivate unique relationships with our clients. By providing an end-to-end service to just a few clients (instead of limited services for a large number) we achieve   a double effect. First, we retain our clients on long term by gaining their trust and ensuring satisfaction. Second, the customer intimate strategy and high customizability offered will be difficult to imitate by competitors. (Treacy, 1997)
To achieve positive market results with this strategy we plan the following:
- openly communicate with clients to increase service efficiency and quality.
- offer consultancy on how clients can best fit our solution to their processes.
- invest in R&D improvements of our core services and for potentially radical changes.
- invest in providing high customizability of services based on customer requirements.
- provide on-premises installation, testing, maintenance and upgrades.
This strategy requires a strong understanding of clients and their processes. It also demands a decentralized company structure that can quickly react to changes in clients’ needs. (Treacy, 1997).
Management and Organizational Structure
We propose an organizational structure based on the iGEM team structure.To provide high quality, specialized and customised services for a small number of clients, we organize as a Holacracy (Robertson, 2007). Similar   to the iGEM team structure, a holacratic organization removes hierarchy by distributing responsibility and power across distinct roles.
Just like in iGEM, people are responsible for certain roles (such as R&D, Sales, Customer support, etc.) while also being free to help out in other areas. In this way, employees are involved and responsible, feeling that they drive the company forward   by doing what they are best at. People can have several distinct roles and work on several different tasks/projects.
For example, in a 3D printer project specifically designed for a toothpaste manufacturing company, a team of several members with various roles can be assembled to fulfil requirements. Some members are fully dedicated to this project, while others work   on it in parallel with different projects. This structure supports high flexibility, reaction and development time, while encouraging innovation and creativity. While teams self-organize, an overview and general direction of projects is given by a broader   circle containing the team - instead of exerting authority, it guides teams on the"

4. DNA restriction endonuclease reaction.
5. Recycle of DNA.
As most of us are from the School of Life Science and have already had the experience of these experiments, we expect we would have a good start and get into the best condition soon.

After 10 days of pre-experiments, we decided to start our experiments officially tomorrow.  We have basically determined our project.  Firstly, we hope to extract the plasmids from the bacteria strains from iGEM that might contain anaerobic promoters we want.  And for the plasmids we searched out from documents, we decided to get them through PCR.  Secondly is specific enzyme digestion at EX or SP site.  Following is adding report genes into EX or SP site.  The final step is to transfer the plasmids into VNP through electric transformation and cultivate the bacteria anaerobically.  Then examine the expression intensity of report genes to determine the property of the anaerobic promoters and to find out the best one.

Outreach
Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Outreach page. Outreach is fundamentally the communication between fellow scientists and non-scientists.
Nottingham iGEM 2018 participated in the University of Nottingham Discovery Day an open day for young children and parents. This was our first outreach event and it helped the team establish a dialogue with members of the public.
We also held workshops at 3 schools with students ages 15-18. They engaged strongly and positively with the activities and showed ample curiosity towards synthetic biology. Not only did this open a new avenue but it helped us understand just how much students knew about synthetic biology and different components of our project, we hope this can be developed further for future curriculums that will be taught in schools.
Finally, we published articles for local newspapers describing what possibilities our project could bring, as well as encouraging readers to engage with us.
Discovery day
16th June 2018
Nottingham iGEM took part in Discovery Day 2018 at the University of Nottingham! We put on a range of fun activities for kids aged 4-10 to learn more about synthetic biology and bacteria microbes!
First, the children got the opportunity to make their own plasticine microbes and put them in petri dishes! They used inspiration from our fun cuddly toy bacterium friends and produced some amazing results.
After that, both kids and adults had a go at guessing which mode of transport had the most bacteria- bus, train or plane. The answer- bus surprised a lot of people- including the adults!
Finally, everyone had a go at seeing how much bacteria was on their hands by using a special gel, then showing their hands under UV light to see how dirty their hands were. It seems that the kids had cleaner hands than most of us university students!
Overall it was an amazing day where we educated kids all about synthetic biology! The parents feedback to our team was incredibly posititve and the"

Based on these facts, we give the following hypotheses:
1. Regard two tetO operons as one equivalently.
2. Ignore the diffusion of ATc.
3. The reaction time between ATc and tetR, tetR and DNA is much shorter than transcription and                     translation.
Description and Equation
Reactions implicated:
$$tetR + [tetR - ATc_2] = tetR_{total}$$
$$tetR + 2 \times ATc = [tetR - ATc_2]$$
$$P_{tet} + [tetR_2 - P_{tet}] = [P_{tet}]_{total}$$
$$2 \times tetR + P_{tet} = [tetR_2 - P_{tet}]$$
$$$$
Equations5:
Based on Hill function, we can determine the amount of activated tetR, tetRact:
$$ tetR_{act} + n \times S_x(t) \rightarrow [tetR - S_x(t)_n] $$
$$ K_X = \dfrac {tetR_{act} \times S_x^n (t)} {[tetR - S_x(t)_n]} $$
$$ tetR = tetR_{act} + [tetR - S_x(t)_n] $$
$$ tetR_{act} = \dfrac {tetR} {1 + \dfrac {S_x^n (t)} {K_{X}}} $$
Based on Hill function, we can determine the amount of activated promoter, with which we can                     calculate the total transcription speed of all promoters per cell:
$$ P_{tet\_act} + n\cdot tetR_{act} \rightarrow [P_{tet} - (tetR_{act})_n] $$
$$ P_{tet\_copy} = P_{tet\_act} + [P_{tet} - (tetR_{act})_n] $$
$$ K_d = \dfrac {P_{tet\_copy} \times tetR^n_{act} } {[P_{tet} - (tetR_{act})_n]} $$
$$ A_{mRNA} = P_{tet\_act} \times beta $$
$$ A_{mRNA} = \dfrac {P_{tet\_copy} \times beta } { 1 + \dfrac {tetR^n_{act}} {K_{d}}} $$

In our experiment, we use GFP as an indicative of the efficiency of miR-21-sponge-6s and miR-21-sponge-2s as mir-21 detectors, and quantified the mir-21 expression in the cells through the plasmid pHAGE-pre-mir-21. Then we gathered our data and plotted them into two standard curves on excel. Through comparing the slope of standard curves of miR-21-sponge-2s and miR-21-sponge-6s respectively, we determine that miR-12-sponge-2s is more sensitive than miR-21-sponge-6s.

Upon further investigation, we discovered the reason for some of it - our sourced pET16b vector had an insert with the wrong restriction sites. This means a third of our potential clones (or half of what we tested) never stood a chance. This lead to an emergency meeting whereupon it was decided that, with 1 week left in the main lab we should divert efforts into FUEL. On the bright side, we had a whole week to finish our FUEL improvement, and with the whole wet lab team on the job (instead of just Rob) we made rapid headway and were ready to PCR over the weekend.

Closure of main wet lab team
Westminster presentation
The team were once again invited to a meetup, this time Westminster. To gain experience for Boston, Andrew went with Chris this time whilst David stayed behind to help the wetlab team finish up.  It was the final week of labs and things couldnt have been more tense. It was hard to work on the Westminster presentation when you knew how close to the wire the wet lab was cutting it - if the chimera wasnt cloned this week then we were buggered. On the thursday, the day of the presentation, we fortunately had a breakthrough - a successful clone of mK into lux operon in SB1c3.  However, this relief was mulled somewhat - our main lab space was to shut the next day, and the team split up, some to Toronto and Marseille, others to Warwick for placements. The rest would work in the PIs lab in restriced space.  On the last day,  there was a relaxed feel to it - knowing that as a teamyou have accomplished all you can is a sastisfying moment to say the least. The next time we would all be together was Boston in 3 months time, and whilst that seems an age, when you have a wiki to write it passes in an instant -_-

For another part of STEP, we proved the effectiveness of our transcription factor tTA and promotor pTight (Figure 3), and constructed a stable cell line with pTight-mCherry in both HEK293T and HeLa.

After both two sections of STEP were verified, we carried out experiment to confirm the whole system works and to explore the best condition for it to operate. We successfully figured out a relatively ideal transfection condition of TC/PC = 12 and total quantity of 2.44 μg per ml (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Transcription ratio and quantity test in HEK293T. (a) Relative fluorescence intensity at different PC concentration. The dynamic range increases as TC/PC ratio rises, while the gene expression drops after 14.  (b) The 1.00 indicates the original quantity of 3 μg/ml TC and 0.25 μg/ml PC. . The best dynamic range is found in 0.75-fold, presenting a 4.90-fold of reporter expression level.
The results from our overall tests are confirmed by our model, which also suggests that there could be a certain set of TC/PC ratio and quantity that can lead to a best dynamic range which may be significantly higher than other conditions. Thus we believe that STEP can be further optimised through more subdivided gradients.
Apart from VEGF, we carried out experiments with D-Dimer-STEP, and achieved a larger dynamic range (Figure 5a). The VEGF-STEP was also tested in HeLa and extremely low background noise was observed during experiments (Figure 5b).

iGEM Cooperation
Hoping to be able to com NCTU_Formosa, NYMU-Taipei and NTU-Taida, was built. We discussed the popularization and application of the synthetic biology in this platform.
On the experimental aspect, just like a real and formal iGEM competition, each group presented their own topic in an extremely formal and extraordinary style, hoping that more information could be given to the audience in limited time; after each group finished their presentation, there would be a time for Q & A in which everyone could ask questions, in case they didn’t understand. They might solve their experimental problem for the other team either by excluding or find better experimental methods. On human practice aspect, on one hand, in order to promote the synthetic biology efficiently, the three teams think of ideas and shared the creative and effective ideas together hoping that we could broaden the scope of the human practice to make more people know synthetic biology as well as increase the visibility of iGEM; on the other hand, we could share things each team have been done to understand each other.
iGEM Chinese Guiding Book
The most important thing we have done on promoting synthetic biology is that we have made a synthetic biology guiding book featuring many experimental protocols and well-illustrated graphics which could help people know the purpose of experiment much easily. The guiding book has been uploaded . Feel free to Download Our Guiding Book (PDF) . NTU-Taida and NYMU-Taipei have already own our guiding books. All those who want to take a look at our guiding book are also welcomed to download. We have strong confidence that people will get interested in molecular experiment more after reading our guiding book.
Popularization on Campus
We made a short video introducing iGEM , hoping that we can promote this interesting, brain-storming competition to everybody. We described iGEM as an once-in-a-lifetime experience, that anybody with a big heart & strong mind can participate in it. We played this video in the student diner at lunch time, so people can relax and see this vedio like they’re watching a movie.
After watching the short video above, some students told us that they want to know more about iGEM. So we made another video, sharing our experience on our experiments, trial-and-error learning, joining the iGEM final competition in MIT, and other feelings that can't be express by words. We’re glad that many students from different field of studies told us that they’re willing to join"

Abstract
BioBrick-A-Bot: Lego Robot for Automated BioBrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot
Commercial Liquid Handling Systems are extremely expensive, and are typically beyond the reach of the average molecular biologist interested in performing high throughput methods.  To address this problem, we design and implement a liquid handling system built from commonly accessible Legos. Our goal is the automation of BioBrick assembly on a platform that can itself be easily replicated and we demonstrate a proof-of-principle for this system by transferring colored dye solutions on a 96-well plate. We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build from 3 new LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.
Project Goals
Low Cost – Robot cost significantly lower than $10,000, the price of a commercial liquid handling robot. (Actual cost of BioBrick-a-Bot prototype: ~$700)
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible.
Hardware Design that is easily replicable by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM teams.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#LargePhage#Summerexp#Period1#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," 21 fractions of the Cesium Chloride gradient that had the smallest plaques. We plated them out with .075 agarose in hopes that the plaques would be bigger on the whole, so differences would be more easily seen.
The results were somewhat disappointing, it appeared that each plaques was smeared either because we allowed the phage to infect e.coli too long before we plated them, because the concentration was not high enough for the agarose to solidify, or a combination of the two.

We picked plaques and put them in eppendorf tubes numbered:
1: T4 control phage
2: 2 on 20-7
3: 3 on 20-7
4: 4 on 20-7
We grew liquid cultures of #1 and #2 (10 uL in .5 mL of E. coli B) for 3 hours. We then added 100 uL of chloroform and pelleted the bacteria.
We prepared seven EM grids (300 mesh). Each grid was prepared by adding 10 uL of sample to the grid for 1 minute, wicking off the droplet with filter paper, adding 10 uL of 2% phosphotungstic acid for 1 minute, wicking off the droplet, and placing back in the grid box. Grid label   Sample description
These next two samples were prepared by inserting a 23.5 gauge needle in a plaque on a plate and rinsing it in 50 uL of LB broth. B7 - T4 fraction 21 plaque 7-1 B8 - T4 fraction 21 plaque 7-2 These three samples were prepared by incubating E. coli and T4 together to try to get pictures of both. B6 - T4 + E. coli incubated together for 2 minutes B9?- T4 incubated with E. coli for 10 mins C7 - T4 incubated with E. coli for 40 mins These two samples were prepared by trying to propagate 10 uL of the samples used in B7 and B8 using a liquid culture technique as described above. B10 - T4 fraction 21 plaque 7-1 liquid culture C6 - T4 fraction 21 plaque 7-2 liquid culture
We imaged all grids except B10.  Also, B9 may be mislabeled as some of the grids fell out of the box as the technician was loading the grid into the machine.

g. Discussion
In this simulation, we consider all the channel walls are rigid, but in real cases, channel walls will deform when pressure applied. So the cross section area of the channel will be larger than what we have considered in this simulation.
In real cases, the microfluidic channels have a lot of defects at the edges of the channels. So the dragging force applied by these channels will be larger than what we have considered in this simulation, causing the fluid to have a lower speed. But due to the random distribution of the defects, at some points, the defects might accelerate the fluid flow by making the channel to be narrower than usual.
Fig.13 Topside View of Microfluidic Channels 20X
Fig.12 Topside View of Microfluidic Channels 5X
In this simulation, microfluidic channel width was set to 285μm as we designed, with channel walls exactly perpendicular to the bottom. While as in real cases, due to the low transmittance of SU-8 photoresist to the low-wavelength light, the photoresist at the top side of the channel will absorb higher energy than the photoresist at the bottom, causing a trapezoidal cross section profile. The flow speed change caused by this phenomenon is still unknown to us.

Connection with experts
Soil pollution is a widespread problem. To solve the problem, we can not only rely on ourselves unilaterally, so we need to get elites from each aspect of society involved. Therefore, we interviewed experts around the world in the field of biotechnology and environment, hoping that they can bring us some useful advice. And we leave our footprints throughout the world map to build a comprehensive and holistic view.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," allows the team to work with the biological materials required. Also he has done the Interlab studies                 for us. Right now, he is assisting Pim with Modeling and is part of our Human Practices squad.
Mariska Brüls
Biobrick Captain
Mariska is our Biobrick Captain. This means that she is responsible for all of the biobricks that we are handing in.                   Obviously, she is part of the Biobrick subgroup of our lab squad. She is also very fond of going to the gym and                   drinking tea.
Guido Oerlemans
Lab Captian
Guido is one of our two Lab Captains in charge of managing the lab work. He is almost never in the office but can                 always be found in the synthesis lab working on the hydrogel or the biolab working on the biobricks and protein                 expression.
Maxime van den Oetelaar
Lab Captain
Maxime, the other one of the two Lab Captains, is also in charge of managing all lab work. When not working on the planning                   of all experiment, she can be found in both the synthesis lab or in the biolab. Except for managing the lab work, she also                   plays an important role for the hydrogel synthesis, biobrick design, and protein expression experiments.
Laura van Hazendonk
Human Practices Manager
Laura is our lovely vegan Human Practices Manager. When she is not in the lab for the Cloning team, she can be found either                 at her desk on her laptop typing, or she is traveling to somewhere in the Netherlands to talk to a stakeholder or expert on                 the field that we are working on. She is the smallest person on the team but that does not matter, we love her anyway and is                 our favorite lawnmower.
Simone Twisk
Sponsor Coordinator
A project like iGEM would be nowhere without funding, and that’s what we have Simone for. Simone is our Sponsor                 Coordinator and is thus coordinating the Acquisition team to fund our project. She is also part of the Cloning team,                 Human Practices squad and is one of our two bachelor students. Side note, will eat Nutella without mercy and cookies                 are not safe around her either.
Weizhou Xing
Wiki Manager
Weizhou (or Tony as we call him) is our Wiki Captain. Without him, creating our wiki would have been much more                 difficult. Staying up late is daily business for Weizhou as the wiki requires a lot of time. Nonetheless we are                 very happy with him on"

Collaboration with Utrecht
The Biotechnology Conference in Utrecht
We first met iGEM-Utrecht at the European meet-up in Munich, where this team already set its mind on the organisation of a conference,      but was still looking for some support. After a short brain-storming it was clear:      We loved the idea of co-organising the conference to give people the possibility to gain insight into different fields of biotechnology      and so we got started with the organisation.
Figure 1: Front page of our flyer for the conference
The responsibilities were split between the two teams of us: iGEM-Utrecht arranged the venue and facilities,      catering and ticket-service, as well as companies for serious networking, while we were responsible for the design of flyers, posters and the powerpoint presentations.

Together we arranged talks about Single Cell Sequencing by Dr. Mauro Muraro, Metabolic engineering in E. coli to produce PHB from Sucrose by      Dr. Aljoscha Wahl and Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez, and the construction of artificial kidneys by Dr. Silvia Mihaila.
Co-organising the iGEM Biotechnology Conference with iGEM-Utrecht was a worthwhile experience, as it gave us the      possibility to not only learn how to work together over distances and how to organise an event, but also it was a perfect opportunity      to share our passion for synthetic biology with interested people and to exchange opinions, contacts and ideas.

Being supportive of a newcomer
For a successful project, a critical and objective review of progress and problems is necessary. If it is not possible for a team on its own to find a solution for a specific problem,     then it is probably time to ask the community. Sharing and collaborating is the policy of iGEM.     People"
