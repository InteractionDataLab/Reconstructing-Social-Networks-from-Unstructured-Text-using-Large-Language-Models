Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a workshop, introducing them to the basics of CSS and HTML as a preparation for a successful wiki. A few weeks later, our team member Vanessa gave a more detailed workshop regarding the design of the wiki and creating new pages. Of course, we answered all further questions, exchanged information about both our projects and provided them with help, knowledge and working materials, doing our best to support the first Bielefeld iGEM high school team. Some of the most important things our team learned from mentoring the high school team Rheda Bielefeld were the different requirements which a young high school team has, in contrast to an over-graduate team, and to adjust our way of mentoring to their needs. It was so fascinating to see the pupils working so hard in addition to their school work and we were very happy to facilitate their passion for synthetic biology. We are so delighted you were successful and are very proud you represent Bielefeld in the iGEM competition!
iGEM Team Hamm-Lippstadt
This year, the University of Applied Sciences Hamm-Lippstadt takes part in the iGEM competition for the first time. To support their start and to give them a broad overview over criteria of the competition, we mentored the team. For this purpose, we invited all members to our research facility, discussed the foundations of the iGEM competitions and provided the visitors with protocols for their everyday lab routine. Afterwards, our primary PI Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski joined us for a lab tour and a nice barbecue.
As an important aspect of our mentoring, we are in constant contact with the team, answering questions about the competition and their project.  Furthermore, we helped the team of Hamm-Lippstadt to participate in the InterLab Study.  We provided them with important working materials like Escherichia coli DH5α and 96 well plates. In addition, we offered them to use our laboratory as they had no own lab for genetic technology on site. Moreover, we answered broader and more detailed questions they had during several skype sessions. Further questions were answered during a second visit of the team of Hamm-Lippstadt. We were extremely happy, that they followed our invitation to our dual use panel discussion and we hope that we offered an useful input about dual use concerns of their own research and the importance to spreading dual use research of concern issues .  In addition to having fun teaching a new team the basics of an own iGEM project, it was fascinating to see a completely different team dynamic and research area. It was a pleasure to help them working on their own exciting iGEM project and"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model FBA_-_-_TEXT.html," and studied. As reviewed in the MFC part of our wiki, the DET route depends on the c-type cytochrome (MtrC and OmcA) in the cytoplasmic membrane interacting with the electrode. It can also use nanowires to transfer electrons to the electrode that is located distantly from the cells.
 
In the iSO783, we considered the reaction flux of CYOO2 as our optimization objective as it involved in the reduction of a type of cytochrome c protein, denoted as Cco (SO2361 and SO2362 and SO2363 and SO2364) or Cyco (SO4606 and SO4607 and SO4609) in iSO783). In such case, the reaction flux of CYOO2 is taken to estimate the DET flux.
 
DET- Lactate
As noticed the ability of S. oneidensis MR-1 utilizing lactate to generate electricity [3], we first examined the FBA model using lactate as the carbon source for electricity generation. We examined the effect of varying lactate uptake flux on two separate objectives, i.e. maximizing biomass growth and maximizing DET flux. We assume 5% of maximum growth as the boundary of biomass growth flux, which would be the minimum viable growth rates in practice as described by Mao [4].
Figure 4. The effect of lactate on maximum direct electron transfer(DET) flux of Shewanella utilizing lactate at viable growth flux boundary
Figure 4 shows that the DET flux reached a plateau at 81.68 mmol/gDW/h as lactate uptake flux increased. An upper bound existed such that increasing lactate uptake would no longer increase the electricity generation.
Figure 5. The trade off relationship between direct electron transfer(DET) flux and biomass growth flux when lactate uptake is set as constant
Noted that the biomass growth is driven to its lower bound when the optimization objective is set as DET flux, we studied the relationship between DET flux with biomass flux at constant lactate input. In figure 5, the DET flux first sustained at 81.68 mmol/gDW/h but then decreased when biomass flux increased beyond 0.164h-1. This implies the electricity generation could possibly be maximized when below a certain growth rate, however, higher growth rate could possibly decrease the electricity generation.

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"The laboratory at the Engineering School at Cooper Union contracts a licensed chemical waste disposal service that is handled by a designated Hazardous Waste Disposal Coordinator/Chemistry Stockroom Technician, who is responsible for scheduling and overseeing the collection of wastes. The proper disposal of media containing E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the use of personal protective gear, such as nitrile gloves, safety goggles and laboratory coats, will greatly minimize the risks posed to team members.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
Since all materials will be disposed of using a hazardous waste disposal service, there will be no possibility of health risks. Our project utilizes non-pathogenic derivatives of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so in the event of accidental or otherwise release, the health risks are minimal. They are classified as non-pathogenic and can be safely used in a BSL1 facility.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The risks upon accidental environmental risk are minimal, as described previously, concerning the uses of strains of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains we have been designing are intended to have a predetermined lifespan, minimizing risks.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
Our BioBricks are not designed to confer any pathogenic attributes to E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nor is there any data to suggest that they pose any detrimental effects on the environment. The strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that we are designing are actually for the purpose of safety.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
We are following our laboratory safety guidelines (see above).
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
At this time, we do not see any tangible risks or dangers our projects may pose to the general public.  The methods we are using are relatively common and also pose no risks.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design"

Cornell_NY,2016,Team:Cornell NY#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," family of bacteriocins undergo complex post-translational modifications that involve dehydration and intramolecular Michael additions, followed by cleavage of a leader sequence. The result is a complex penta-ring structure that is resistant to protease cleavage [26].
One difficulty we faced in protein purification can be attributed to the vastly different properties of these peptides, which led to low protein yields. Furthermore, the only resin available to us was HisPur Cobalt Resin from Thermo Fisher Scientific. In the future, it would be ideal to experiment with different columns and resins to determine the optimal protocol for purification.
In addition to zone of inhibition assays and growth curve analyses, we would like to have more quantitative information regarding the potency of bacteriocins. In the future, we hope to test these bacteriocins using dose-response curves to determine EC50 and the minimum inhibitory concentration.
Another important consideration is the shelf life of these bacteriocins compared to antibiotics, especially because proteins tend to be relatively unstable outside of native environments. We would like to test the relative stabilities of these peptides at different temperatures, and compare this to the antibiotics typically used to treat bovine mastitis.

ZJU-China,2010,Team:ZJU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," a well-known argument about synthetic biology that the biotic artifacts created by the synthetic biology departs from a core principle of Darwinian natural selection, leaving those biotic artifacts with no causal connection to historical evolutionary process. To strengthen this argument, the opponents of synthetic biology emphasize that the 3.598 billion years of evolutionary history must play some role in supporting an ethic of nature. Therefore, synthetic biology, this dramatic technological development is ethically problematic.
    To discuss this argument, we need to recognize why the opponents of synthetic biology emphasize the moral significance of evolution history or the ethic of nature. The moral significance of historical evolutionary process is fundamentally important for its proponents to seize the moral high ground. And then they can distinguish the so called ""natural"" and ""artificial"" by a moral standard. However such opinion involves the mixture of teleology, as we will prove and explain later, is not absolutely objective in this argument. Now to contradict this argument, we need to answer two questions. First, does the 3.598 billion years of evolutionary history own the moral significance of itself? Second, do the biotic artifacts created by synthetic biology against the core principle of Darwinian evolution?
    For the first question, my answer is no. For the nearly four billion years, the life on the earth was entirely shaped by the nature. However, 3.598 billion years of evolutionary history is a mere empirical fact, it is ethically neutral. As Michael Sandel once put it, Morality is not empirical. Whatever you have seen in the world, whatever you discover in the science can't decide moral questions. Morality stands a certain distance from the world, from the empirical world. That's why no science could deliver moral truth. Moreover, fossils that were contained at different geological layers, presented at arranged forms have substantiated evolution as an empirical fact. In this way, we cannot claim that the 3.598 billion years of evolution could not spontaneously provide some sort of ethic of nature.
    The reason why so many people tend to believe that the history of evolution has some moral significance is associated with the belief. There seems to be an immanent goal or cosmic purpose that justified the evolution process. Living organism's behaviors seem to be controlled by a plan or guided towards a certain aim. Everything that happens right now possibly serves for a purpose in the future. The idea that final causes exist in the nature is defined as teleology. Teleology also means design and purpose analogous to that found in human actions are also inherent in the rest of nature. To the eye of an untrained observer, the evolutionary history"

Collaboration
We collaborated with three different teams in the 2016 iGEM season. We assisted team Macquarie by making a graphical user interface on MatLab showing how the concentration of various intermediates including ALA (Y-axis) changes over time (X-axis) in chlorophyll.        We created a documentary for team Aix-Marseille focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes.        Team Heidelberg 2015 ran their MAWS software to provide us with a target specific aptamer, in exchange for numerous candidate PDB files for them to test their system on, as wells as valuable feedback about how well their aptamer performed in our thylakoid binding experiments.
SIMULATION MODEL
We constructed a simulation model of a photo-bioelectrochemical cell (PBEC) using AnyLogic to illustrate how different parameters would effect the efficiency of our cell. Changeable parameters include: light intensity
(μ mole photons.m−2.s−1),
casing material (Perspex or glass), electrode size and whether or not to select thylakoid attachment by making use of aptamers. Read more about this on our Model page .

Questions about BioWatcher asked by other teams in this mini-seminar:
1. Bioluminescence is too weak to penetrate tissue?
The bioluminescence used in BioWatcher has an emission wavelength of 490 nm. Although the intensity of bioluminescence at this wavelegth is not as strong as a aprt of it will be absorbed by body tissue, experiments proved the successful bioluminescence penetration captured under imaging system. Besides,the fact that this mild intensity of this bioluminescence is invisible to naked eye can ease the users’ concern of turning into green-glowing lamp.
2. Concerns about applying engineered cells in human bodies
The application of our system can be widely used in detecting soluble and insoluble ligands in the enviroment, living organisms and,our ultimate pursuit, in human bodies which post serious concerns. In terms of deliverying engineered cells into human body, invasive and noninvasive measures, such as injection, nasal delivery and viral therapy, are considered.However, we faced our biggest challenge--choosing the proper cell to be applied. Several aspects need to be evaluated including life span of the cells, its amount in circulating system, possible immune rejection…etc. As hard as it is, existing cellular immunotherapy is keeping our hopes up. Undoubtedly, this project is still immature. However, white blood cells and mesenchymal stem cells are our candidates so far.

Introduction
Every year, more than one million tons of laundry detergent is used to maintain and clean clothes. Laundry detergent contains many useful components, such as surfactants and enzymes that enhance the cleaning process by emulsifying and degrading components in stains thus removing them from the clothes. However, after each wash, the laundry detergent (including enzymes) is washed out with the dirty water, resulting in a large amount of waste and chemicals being dumped back into the water supply [1]. Our motivation for this project is to design a reusable laundry treatment that will reduce the amount of waste as well as cost that is associated with washing clothes; this reusable treatment will contain a higher concentration of enzymes, which will decrease the amount of detergent needed per laundry cycle thus lessening the impact of waste on the environment.
In today’s society it is very common for laundry detergent to contain certain enyzmes. The most common enzymes included in laundry detergents are proteases, lipases, amylases, and cellulases. Proteases are in charge of degrading proteins like those found in blood stains, lipases degrade fats and oils, amylases take care of starchy and carbohydrate based stains like custard or chocolate stains, and cellulases help maintain the structure of the material by “modifiying the structure of cellulose fiber on cotton”; it also makes the material softer and brighter [2]. Out of these four classes of enzymes, our project includes a cellulose, an amylase, as well as chlorophyllase, which can be used to remove grass stains. We chose these particular enzymes because they were easily attainable, with the amylase and the cellulase genes being available in the distribution kits and because they make up a large portion of enzymes included in regular laundry detergents. We chose chlorophyllase because of its ability to cleave chlorophyll (the green pigment associated with grass stains) into a water-soluble compound called chlorophyllide. Grass stains are really hard to remove and"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolic pathways (Valdehuesa et al.2013) ; (Vidra et al.2017) .    Most of these pathways use glycerol or glucose as starting substrate, but there are also publications where acrylic acid, CO2 or uracil were converted to
3HPA
(Vidra et al.2017) .    One promising route starts with glycerol which is dehydrated and oxidized.   For E. coli, a productivity of 6.6 mmol g-1 cdw h-1  has been shown (Raj et al.2008) .    However, this route depends on vitamin B12, which often can’t be taken up or produced by the chassis.   Many other routes start with glucose, which gets metabolized via propionate, lactate, β-alanine or malonyl-CoA (Vidra et al.2017) .    We decided to use a pathway, based on the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA and finally
3HPA
. According to (Valdehuesa et al.2013) who evaluated many pyruvate-derived production pathways from a thermodynamic point of view, this is one of the most efficient routes for
3HPA
production.   This pathway was first established in E. coli, but it was also  tried in many other chassis like S. cerevisiae and S. elongatus (Kildegaard et al.2016) ; (Liu et al.2017) ; (Rathnasingh et al.2012) .    We chose this route for several reasons.   Firstly, it is based on glucose degradation and V. natriegens has an unbeaten glucose-uptake rate, enabling high glucose consumption. Secondly, vitamin B12 is not necessary, the only cofactors involved are NADPH and biotin, both of which occur naturally in the organism.   Thirdly, theoretically just one further enzyme is needed to complete the pathway. All enzymes necessary for the production of malonyl-CoA are already present in V. natriegens and we just have to integrate the last enzyme, malonyl-CoA reductase.   Nevertheless, overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase increases production, so we took both enzymes into consideration. (Liu et al.2017) proposed, that there are many ways to further optimize the pathway and direct the flow towards a high product titer.   Hence, implementing many variations of"

Abstract
iGEM Kyoto suggested a nationwide survey to all the iGEM teams in Japan this year.  Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project.   We Kyoto team led other teams in the project, and successfully got over 1,500 answers in total!  From the survey, we found that opinions differ between students and non-students.   To our little surprise, the survey also showed that the majority of Japanese regard biotechnology favorably, while at the same time they worry very much about the safety.
Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practices” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose ""negative"" or ""neutral"" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practices activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.

PART Three, public outreach: knowledge worth spreading
In this summer，one of our teammates went to Heyuan Guangdong as a voluntary teacher with the hope to let children there got more knowledge about biology especially synthetic biology. We introduced to the rural children through the combination our team and our project with the film Big Hero 6.what’s more,we took part in Sino-USA Chinese Collaboration Workshop as volunteers. Through this treasure experience we had a deeper understanding to synthetic biology and we hope our work can promote the awareness of synthetic biology.
A.To be a voluntary teacher: Bring science to children in the country.
One of our team members Yang Yanxia went to Heyuan Guangdong province where was quite undeveloped and had lack of ides of science. She gave lesson on biology to make children there to get interested in biology and science and finally spread the idea science there.
The lesson was consist of microorganisms, gene engineering and a brief introduction of our iGEM project. First we taught them about microorganisms and showed an interesting micro world and the relationship with our life. What’s more,we brought a microscope to the school in order to let them have a vivid experience about the microorganism.They were excited to see the strange instrument which they had never seen. It was nice to see the children’s face with curiosity and joy when they exploring the new world in microscope.
The second part of our class was about gene engineering. We told them the concept and the aim of gene engineering and showed them some imaginary image of gene engineering such as cow which can produce milk with photosynthesis and plants which can produce potatoes and tomatoes at the same time. Amused by the interesting imagination, they began to draw their own picture of the world with gene engineering in their mind as well as ask for more images. The images really fuelled their imagination and we hoped these stimulating imagination in the future world with development of science and technology can stir up their interest to science.
Finally, we showed an animation that we adjusted from Big Hero 6 to introduce our iGEM project. Different roles in the movie represented different biological elements in our project and we told a story to explain process of our"

Interview with an expert in biochemistry; Dr. Maayan Gal
 Dr. Maayan with Team members Or and Yuval
In order to evaluate the product from another scientific point of view and in a commercial eye we met with a scientist who works in the biochemistry field. Dr. Maayan manages a laboratory at the Migal Institute, the institute deals in a variety of topics including practices related to proteins in various fields of study.
Dr. Maayan (age-38) shared with us his life in high school. About the importance of basic knowledge he acquired at high school, which has helped him to progress in his life as a scientist. Dr. Maayan studied physics, computers and electronics.
Dekel: In which fields do you work as a scientist?
Dr. Maayan: In the past I dealt with fields concerning chemistry, physics, and biology. My doctorate dealt with nuclear magnetic resonance, most people know it as MRI machines in hospitals, based on a big magnet which enables us to look at the tissue and see if there is a tumor or any other problems. You can see this on the basis of the technology which is based on the fact that there is a magnetic field.
I use the same technology as the MRI in order to look at biological materials, for example, when I look at protein in a vial, I can learn with the help of the device how the protein looks, if when we put a substance into the protein such as medicine there is a structural change of the protein or its chemical characteristics and that is based on the reaction of the molecular structure with the presence of the magnet”.
At this moment of enthusiasm we followed Dr. Maayan to his laboratory and watched a number of examples to understand how they react to magnetic resonance, I must admit that it is awesome!
Later in the conversation we told Dr. Maayan about the IGEM competition in which we are participating in and our chosen ""Alergln"" project ""."" I asked him what he thought about the kit and whether there is room to improve the technology we chose.
“I think that the idea is very good for the project as well as for the competition. The biological process you have chosen is special and not common; the social thought after the biological idea is very interesting.  Along with this, the process is based on known fluorescent processes; however, I think it would be a lot more practical to find if possible to have an interaction with a simpler method to measure, like electrical conductivity. We are talking about a home check"

Weblogs – a modern Way to reach a big Audience
The Internet offers many ways to share your opinions, feelings, attitudes and experiences. The coverage is enormous – so we used this modern tool to spread science in a way that is easy to understand for everyone:
The ""Sparkasse Bielefeld"" is a local credit institute and one of our sponsors. They visited us in our lab where we presented our project to them. Accessible for everyone, they have written a blog entry about us and published it on their weblog. As the Sparkasse is one of the leading credit institutes in Germany, we could reach many different people!

WissensWerkStadt: Society meets Science
The city of Bielefeld is currently planning the so-called “WissensWerkStadt” (English: Factory of Knowledge) in cooperation with Bielefeld Marketing GmbH. It is an empty building which should be converted into a house of science. It is meant to be a place for exchange between urban society and science: new ideas, productive corporations and exciting visions contributing to everyday life, culture and economy. On 30th of January, a variety of scientific groups were asked to perform experiments for the public at the current location in order to inspire officials who are responsible for the design of the interior of the house.
In cooperation with the Biotechnologische Studenteninitiative e.V. Bielefeld several simple experiments were performed together with visitors of various backgrounds and ages as an inspiration to how the new building could be structured. We conducted some experiments, which could be performed by children. The visitors enjoyed exploring scientific principles and (re-)discovering their interest in science. In the following discussion about the different possibilities to design the building, we gave input as well - so we were involved in creating a new place of science for a broad public.

March for Science – for Science, against Misinformation
Last year the march for science was initiated as a demonstration for science and against misinformation. Now it evolves into a movement to build a society of scientifically educated people, in which facts are the driving forces of politics. At the March for Science, people of every ethnicity, gender, age and sexual orientation demonstrate together for the freedom of science worldwide.
This year our team participated in the March for Science in Cologne. Together with other iGEM teams such as Düsseldorf, A"

iGEM Kyoto
On March 10th, we interacted with iGEM Kyoto team in University of Kyoto. Both teams gave presentations and had an exchange of opinions. So, we could sophisticate our projects each other. Furthermore, We shared ideas about not only projects of experiments but also activities of teams, to name a few, how to manage a team, chances of practicing presentations and how to educate new students. We could get a lot of instructive views for our teams. The meeting with them was very meaningful.
University of Kyoto developed the software to complete experiment data in Wiki and provided it to us. When you input experiment date like experimenter’s names, date and the amount of chemicals, this software translate the information into HTML. It enabled us to make wiki easily and quickly. In fact, we used this software and edited the page of experiment. Moreover, we felt it’s very useful for the team that are not familiar with engineering and for creating wiki simplify. We cooperated with improvement of it by providing feedback.
iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018
On August 8th, we met up with iGEM Tokyo_Tech, iGEM Gifu team, KAIT Japan and ASIJ iGEM team. Each team gave a presentation followed by a Q&A in English and exchanged feedback. Also, we discussed project ideas, funding issues, how to drive a team and so on. This meetup helped to improve our presentation skill and team-managing skill, and to get hints that can have a good effect on our experiment.

The perfect killswitch
...does not exist. Let us elaborate why.
Any killswitch must contain a sequence that is capable of destroying the cell carrying it. This is, per definition, a selective disadvantage and therefore prone to either being lost entirely, or else being silenced by mutation. The question now is “how probable is that?”
Without going too much into detail, the average mutation rate in Escherichia coli (genome size around 4.5 Mbp) is   1 x 10-3 base pairs per genome replication and while some base substitutions are more likely to happen than others, this does not matter much in the large scale of things. One mutation every one thousand replicated genomes may not seem like much, but it does mean that, in theory, the probability of a given base mutating in at least one cell as calculated by 1-(1- Pmutation / Genome size)2n exceeds 0.95 after n=34 divisions – under ideal conditions this takes less than a day.
Figure 1: Left: total predicted number of mutations in a growing culture; right: probability of one specific mutation occuring in at least one cell in the culture.
So how probable is it that a single mutation will kill the killswitch?
Mutations come in different flavors: single-base substitutions that can result in silent mutations with no effect on the amino acid sequence, missense mutations that lead to a single substitution on amino acid level and nonsense mutations resulting in a stop codon, thus terminating translation and usually yielding no functional protein. Furthermore, there are single-base insertions or deletions, which result in a so-called frame-shift that leads to a completely different amino acid sequence – usually gibberish – being translated.
For the sake of simplicity, we will now focus on nonsense mutations. For each codon there are nine possible"

Goal: To  do the ligation of luxR-TT-luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct and for ligation  was good, we extracted gel and did gel ligation and put it in 4°C, waiting for  transformation.
The  ligation of PBAD-RBS-luxI-TT and PBAD-RBS-luxR-TT were failed.
Cell Immobilization:
Goal: To  determine a PBAD-RLT standard curve.
400mL LB  medium with 400uLAmp+ 2mL PBAD-RLT aliquot , started at 8:56.
From 0 h  on, took and collected 1mL sample in Eppendorf tube per hour, storing at 4°C.  Repeatedly operated until the 13th hour. Determined each sample's OD value.
From 4 h  on, took 10mL sample, centrifuged for 3min at 6000 rpm and collected the  deposit cells, storing at 4°C.Repeatedly operated until the 13th hour. 65°C drying  for 12 hours and then measured each sample's dry weight.
The OD  curve was not a smooth S-Curve. The sampling process might bring some error to  the determination.

Some of the ideas were phenomenal, and some were let’s say...a little more abstract. The team is doing the workshop again at the Community Open Day on Saturday, where they’ll be bringing SynBio to the wider public!
Unfortunately, experimental progress has been plagued by admin issues, delaying us from getting the FAS module and our primers. On the plus side our electrocompetent bacterial colonies were successful, meaning our Court-Lamba recombinase knockout of the fadD gene is ready for the next step! Now we just need our primers. Modelling have had a bit more success, but both subteams have had issues with finding the source for delta-9-desaturase. Fortunately, this was more or less resolved by the end of the week!
We also had another social! Elsa cooked the team a delicious vegetarian lasagna, we found out more about Jess’ love of rodents, and Rob tried (and failed) to do Bhangra dancing.
Next week most of the team is off to YSB 1.0 in London. We’re really looking forward to meeting the other UK iGEM teams!
Week 6
This has been a very exciting week of collaborations for us! At the start of the week we had a Google hangout with Perdue to discuss their idea to standardise entry of parts into the registry. It emerged that there are many issues raised when it comes to standardising modelling. We agreed to help them with this. By the end of the week, this had somewhat grown...
On Thursday we headed off to London for the very first Young Synthetic Biologists (YSB) conference. This was a big meeting of all the UK iGEM teams. On the first day we listened to presentations from each team in the morning. The afternoon featured workshops covering topics such as public engagement, business startups and bioart.
The second day brought big news to the team. After our presentation, we had a lot of interest in our model. This led to a huge collaboration with 8 other UK teams:  Edinburgh, Westminster, Dundee, Newcastle, UCL, York and (maybe) Imperial. Our plan is two fold:
1) Relating to the collaboration with Perdue, we are going to write some standardised pieces of code for use in the majority of the software. Also we would consider what essential pieces of information are needed for submission of a model. The idea being that one day we could have a standard registry for models"

Collaboration with TAS Taipei iGEM team
We gave them the part with yebF, a motor protein that brings our product out of the cell. This was essential to their project because it allowed their protein, the granzyme B inhibitor, to be delivered out into the reservoir and to diffuse through the bandage.
Furthermore, NYMU hosted an educational summer camp welcoming members from the 2015 and 2016 TAS_Taipei iGEM teams to join and learn.
We have also been supportive for helping TAS_Taipei iGEM team with research and running the model for diffusion, bandage, and the ACT inhibition model.  We provided them with modeling expertise, literature values for our models and debugging expertise.
In addition to our help on TAS, we also collaborated with TAS
To provide us with the LuxR part which is pivotal for our oscillator. LuxR is essential for our oscillator which is used to report the presence of a malicious spore in the device part of the project.
TAS also helped us by running the initial experiments for our microbial fuel cell prototype. We were provided by TAS_Taipei with initial test results of the prototype for our project so that we found the correct soil to water to bacteria ratios(August 2015).
Three members of TAS (Alvin, Fiona and Huiru) are members of both NYMU and TAS teams. They worked at NYMU over the summer for the NYMU_Taipei team and are presenting with the team at the Giant Jamboree!

EDDUCATION:
In order to better disseminate our project, we combined mobile publicity and fixed-point publicity. Our publicity lasted half a week and had incredible effect. We had designed pre-presentation and post-presentation questionnaire to acquire a more intuitive understanding of our publicity effect.
After the end of the HP work, especially in education: Our team leader Zixi Yin told us: “Through the publicity of our project, we felt the enthusiasm of the public about synthetic biology. To our surprise, many nonprofessional people with various backgrounds showed great interest in our idea. They asked the motivation, the design and the effects of our project. An old man even asked how we realized our goal in details. We tried our best to explain our project to them. Besides, we gathered many useful suggestions from them. We are excited that our publicity has such great influence on common people.” Our pretty younger co-worker Zhuochen Zhang thought there was no doubt that our disseminate would have a great success. But the truth made her confused. We prepared a short speech, little gifts, and lovely folders in both Chinese and English, and why people care about Boston most? Our Human Practice official Yuhan Wu said that: “Indeed, the preach met a lot of difficulties: in the October 8 to October 23 this half a month, we had little experience in the beginning and choose a 3 hours’ rain propaganda made everyone exhausted, but only a few familiar students stopped and listened; the community preach contact began at the end of September to, but nearly a month after we have the opportunity to stand on the podium ... ... However, last week, I received a phone made me a driving force to continue to do - a off-campus lady who stayed nearly an hour after campus disseminate to get a further understand asked some forgotten details. ” Dear designer of all the picture-Qinge Liang said: “Questionnaire survey part impressed me a lot and made me sigh deeply. It was frustrated for me to scent out that the majority of people lacked knowledge of synthetic biology, some of them even had deep misunderstanding of gene manipulation. Even though meticulously"

He also inoculated 10 more LRG, in addition to the 5 we already have, for sequencing. We digested GadA with E and S, 64bp with E and X, 128bp with E and X. We redigested LR and G and ligated them. We also ligated the LR and G digests from before. Samson performed fluorescence assays.

Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#modeling1_-_-_TEXT.html," nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at t=60 min, and t=120 min independently. The estimated parameters were:
The results can be seen in figures 7 (t60), and 8 (t120) respectively.
Figure 7.
Model and experimental data for t=60min.

Model and experimental data for t=120min.
Compare this results with Are you hot? results .
One  question of interest is whether  the increment observed in the ratio IF/OD is caused by an incement of fluorescence during the time elapsed, or it is caused by a varying dilution effect due to a decrease in the specific groth rate during that period [1].
To answer this question notice that the absolute growth rate can be obtained from the regression model OD(t)= p1+p2*t obtained above. Notice t is expressed in minutes in our model. Indeed, the specific growth rate at time instant t can be roughly estimated as mu(t)= [dOD(t)/dt]/OD(t). This gives mu(t) = p2*60/(p1+p2*t) if mu(t) expressed in h^(-1).
Therefore, we took our models and weighted them by mu(t60) and mu(t120) respectively. The result can be seen in figure 6. Indeed, the increment observed in fluorescence from t=60 to t=120 minutes could have been caused by a dillution effect. Of course, the main point to keep is that the ratio IF/OD (or, alternatively IF/OD*mu(t)) increases with temperature. So...our construction works!

where
x1 = yeast concentration

Integrated Practices
The team elected to develop a new detection system aimed at improving the quality of life for humans and livestock around the world. We are aware of the importance of understanding different perspectives and considering different opinions; resulting in a large portion of our resources being devoted to correspondence with the public and experts, and incorporating the feedback received.
Westminster UK iGEM Meet Up
On Wednesday the 17th of August, Warwick iGEM travelled up to Westminster University to attend a two-day event, along with 16 other teams from around the UK.
After being welcomed to the University of Westminster by Dean Professor Jane Lewis, the event began with a question and answer session with Dr Markiv – a spokesperson for iGEM. She provided ideas that helped develop the ‘Human Practices’ aspect of the Warwick project, as well as troubleshooting the few issues that had become apparent with the Wiki page. After she voiced her concerns, we investigated how we could obtain and incorporate the views of the public and relevant professionals. Following this, we arranged to facilitate discussions with patients, researchers, and students in secondary education.
The opportunity to interact with and get to know other teams and their projects, along with the fantastic talks given by a variety of speakers, made the meet-up a very enjoyable and beneficial experience.
FredSense
We were very fortunate to speak to David Lloyd, CEO of FredSense Technologies - a leading biosensor company based in Canada. He was able to advise our team with regards to the business side of our project. On his advice, we decided that our sensor should not cost more than 0.50 USD per sensor, in order to successfully target the developing world. When estimating manufacturing costs, David recommended considering pre-treatment requirements, such as purification of the RNA and the freeze-drying process, as well as any hardware needed. His general guide figure of the overall cost of production was less than 30% of the resale price. He also proposed additional applications for our sensors, including testing mine runoff and domestic wells in developed countries.
David identified numerous issues that FredSense determined may affect the success of biosensors. Illiteracy and poor governmental structure may prevent success in developing countries, while lack of available treatment may render identifying health hazards potentially pointless. To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities"

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

Hair loss affects roughly 61 million people in the United States.  More than 95% of hair thinning in men is attributed to male pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia.  The hair loss product market is a multi-billion dollar market: in the United States alone, this market’s annual revenue is 7 billion dollars, with 3.5% annual growth rate from 2007 to 2012, yet a sufficient solution has yet to be made available.      The trigger for androgenetic alopecia is believed to be dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a derivative of testosterone. This summer, we engineered Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium found naturally on the scalp, to secrete 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD).  This enzyme reduces DHT to a non-steroidically active compound, using NADPH and NADH as cofactors.
Our project consists of 3 main parts: 3α-HSD secretion by the Bacillus subtilis, which is a part of the natural microbiome on the scalp, engineered E.coli for NADPH overproduction, and a comb as a tool to create a user-friendly experience. By synchronizing these parts, we hope to be able to show convincing evidence of DHT breakdown, providing a promising platform for treatment of male pattern baldness!
Problem
Hair loss affects roughly 40 million men and 21 million women in the United States. Approximately 25% of men begin balding by the age 30, and two-thirds begin balding by the age 60. Male pattern baldness (Androgenic alopecia) is the main cause of thinning hair in men - in more than 90% of the cases. This condition is characterized by hair receding from different areas of the scalp, beginning with the lateral sides of the forehead and the vertex 1 .
The male sex hormone, testosterone (which is produced largely in the testicles), is partially converted into a more potent derivative: dihydrotestosterone"

CAIC Orientation (Co-curricular and Academic Interaction Council):
It is a student body in IIT Delhi which deals with matters related to academic affairs and co-curricular activities. iGEM IIT Delhi held its orientation on 15th Sept, 2017. It drew a huge crowd which included students from technology clubs of various colleges apart from IIT Delhi. Our work on various genetically engineered biological systems their practical applications were presented to them. An enthusiastic response is received from the audience.
Biotech Freshers Seminar :
iGEM IIT Delhi held a seminar for a group of first-year students of DBEB who had just taken admission into IIT. The students were introduced to the field of synthetic biology and were told about its tremendous potential. Then, students were taken to the lab and a first-hand experience of various simple processes like agarose gel electrophoresis, streaking and spreading were provided. The students were shown the entire lab. Many of the students were enthusiastic about taking up synthetic biology as a career as the event ended.
Survey:
The main goal of our survey was to find out the reach of Synthetic Biology in the current school -going,college-going students and researchers in the field of Electrical Engineering.We got the survey filled by the students who attended our workshops in NEN sessions and schools since we wanted the students to fill our survey carefully after attending our workshop.It was filled out by 85 NEN students and 196 School going students.The Survey for Researchers was made out to be slightly more technical and was filled by 16 Researchers of our Institute.  The conclusion from our survey was definitely not as pleasant as we would have wanted it to be, but wasn't surprising as well.While a majority of students had not even heard of Synthetic Biology before we gave them a workshop, the response to our workshops stood in stark contrast to it.A special mention to the students of DAV Public school, Sector 14, Gurugram whose response to our workshop was way beyond our expectations and it really showed us the difference our workshop had made.As for Researchers, while only some of them knew about Biological Oscillators, most of them were interested in integrating their field of research with synthetic biology

Research
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
Spent much of today doing research, about potential systems to incorporate into the simulator levels, and of other elements of the cell that might be worth representing. Still trying to wrap my head around how to do something like the arabinose operon, which requires folding DNA, or how to do the Lux operon, which requires distinct compartments.
Came up with two potential systems for the levels: a positively autoregulated system (ie, permanent switch for cell memory), and an [1] interesting oscillator. This inspired me to investigate regulation motifs known to systems biology in greater detail.
My work in Second Life was stopped cold though, when the TetR object that I had been working on got knocked away from my working space accidentally, and I wasn't able to chase after it fast enough. The TetR object simply vanished, and the script inside had seen many changes but hadn't been backed up in more than a week!
I searched the internet for solutions to the problem, and after all those suggestions failed to find my TetR I resorted to using a server administration tool to return *all* of my object across the entire island to my inventory. It still didn't show up, which indicated to me that my TetR might be well and truly gone.
In how many other development environments do you lose work because a representation of a physical object containing your code gets lost?

Summary
Higher concentrations of Arabinose were used in induction, but nothing
The failure in induction was caused by the lack of AraC gene
Two biobricks (Bba_I13458/AraC and Bba_I0500/pBad_AraC) were successfully transformed
The parts that contain AraC gene were successfully digested, producing ligation-ready gel extraction samples
Using the old protocol, I tried to induce the 3 fluorescent proteins under the pBad promoter. But this time, I added 2mM and 5mM into the 2 liquid culture from each fluorescent protein color group, while keeping 1 culture for control. It turned out that the induction still did not work. With additional research on the pBad operon and talking to Chris Anderson, I found out that AraC gene is important in allowing the DNA to form a specific conformation that can be induced with arabinose. I looked up the Parts Registry website and found 2 interesting parts: Bba_I13458 and Bba_I0500. The first one only contains the AraC gene, so I can combine it with the existing pBad devices. The second one contains both pBad and AraC, so it has to be ligated with fluorescent protein composite part. I decided to utilize both parts because I didn't know which method works the best.
I conducted the typical set of protocols to isolate the biobricks from the iGEM plate. While both biobricks yielded colonies on the plate, their numbers differed by a huge margin. The plate for Bba_I0500 only contained a single colonies while the plate for Bba_I13458 was almost covered by colonies. Because there were other similar problems, in which kanamycin plate simply did not yield enough colonies, the new kanamycin plates were made with"

It should be noted that when a ligation has been done, it does not mean that it was successful. We will not know until we see growth on the plates and a cPCR of the colonies has been done. Even then, it would be useful to have it sequenced.

Worked with Jacob on steps 3 and 4 listed above. I made the gel, practiced loading samples into wells (with Ruichen), and learned that the machine used to see the results is finnicky. Unfortunately, the 1 kb reference ladder did not work (unexpectedly and for unknown reasons).
(Step 3) Transformation and plating of the biobrick PCR products were the last things we did today. Of the 5, only TrpB sparked during electroporation. 1 uL of PCR product was used to transform cells.

As our project involves the use of dcas9 and sgrna, safety considerations needed to be made while designing our project.
Safety Report
Abstract
Endonucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, though known for their potential in synthetic biology to result in double-stranded breaks in the DNA, allowing for efficient insertions of target mutations, harbour the danger of creating a gene drive which can affect and propagate in the wild-type strain species. We, uOttawa iGEM team, will demonstrate that despite using dCas9, our project does not consist of a gene drive.
Project description:
The goal of this project is to overcome the lack of transcription factors when designing genetic networks in yeast. We use dCas9 machinery (including gRNA) to assess the possibility of designing a NOR gate.
Guarantee of no release:
All project parts remain strictly in the laboratory. No substances are produced by our network. The successful construction of our network is be assessed by measuring fluorescence due to GFP using a flow cytometer. Undesired yeast strains are sterilized.
Safety of project:
The project is safe. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is modified through basic transformations.
Unlike Cas9, dCas9, which is used in this project, has deficient endonuclease activity, because the protein domain conferring endonuclease activity is deleted from the full Cas9 protein. Thus, dCas9, cannot break double-stranded DNA, an otherwise essential step in the synthesis of a gene drive. In this experiment, dCas9 is used in combination with guide RNA to bind to a promoter site to regulate the expression of gene via steric hindrance.
Below are proofs from literature:
""We have shown recently in bacterial and human cells that the endonuclease domains of the Cas9 protein can be mutated to create a programmable RNA-dependent DNA binding protein (Qi et al., 2013). Targeting of catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) to the coding region of a gene can sterically block RNA polymerase binding or elongation, leading to dramatic suppression of transcription in bacteria.""
“Here, we show that dCas9 can be used as a modular RNA-guided platform to recruit different protein effectors to DNA in a highly specific manner in human cells and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both repressive and activating effectors can be"

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  Yesterday, Nithin performed a PCR amplication of our PCquad optimized for iGEM 2.0 with the primers to add the his-tag-stop, designed by Tyler.  The reaction was also done on a gradient of temperatures, in order to determine an optimal annealing temperature.  Upon visualization of the gel, it appears that there is a much stronger band around 250bp, though the predicted size around 1.4kb was visible.
An attempt was made at determining what the non-specific band was.  Since a self-dimer/hetero-dimer was unlikely, due the size, the non-specific band was speculated to be somewhere in the middle of the gene. Using clustal omega, a sequence alignment was done using the following: 1.  PCquad Optimized for iGEM 2.0 2. PCquad primer iGEM prefix 3. PCquad primer iGEM suffix #1 It was shown that only the ends, as intended, annealed to the primers.  The source of the non-specific band is currently undetermined.
Procedures:
PCR amplification of construct attempt #2 Melting temperature for the reaction was determined by the NEB Tm calculator, and the part of our primer that annealed to the template.   Nithin prepared the reaction samples for 62C, 66C, and 70C.  0.5ng was loaded instead of 0.25ng.
Protocol for Q5 from NEB:
1. Please note that protocols with Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may differ from protocols with other polymerases. Conditions recommended below should be used for optimal performance.
Reaction Setup:
We recommend assembling all reaction components on ice and quickly transferring the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98°C). All components should be mixed prior to use. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may be diluted in 1X Q5"

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," the DIVERSITY and INFORMATION CONTENT of AHL- vs DNA-mediated messaging.
DIVERSITY: Stimulation of an AHL receptor can only afford receipt of one or a few different messages, corresponding to concentrations of the receptor’s cognate AHL molecule. To enable receipt of a wider variety of messages, more receptor/AHL pairs must be included. In contrast, transmission of DNA molecules would afford receipt of a range of arbitrary different messages through sequence variation, presuming the mechanism of DNA molecule transmission does not restrict the DNA sequence [6].
INFORMATION CONTENT: AHL-based messaging acts by regulating transcription of genes that are already present in the receiver cell. Thus, the information in the message is always a specification of which genes should be regulated. In contrast, a DNA molecule transmitted to a receiver cell could introduce arbitrary new genes or genetic circuits, including, but not limited to, transcription factors that regulate expression in the receiver.
The main point here is that DNA, as the master information molecule, is inherently a better-suited molecule for information exchange than AHL.
To improve in these areas, Ortiz and Endy designed and demonstrated a “DNA Messaging” communication system [6]. These “DNA messages” are carried between E. coli cells inside a hijacked M13 bacteriophage particle: through a cunning act of trickery, M13 viral proteins are deceived into packaging the DNA message inside infectious particles instead of the viral genome (keep reading for details).
Fig 2. DNA messaging would allow DNA to be exchanged between cells as a form of communication.
The Nuts and Bolts of DNA Messaging
Ortiz and Endy [6] designed a system for effective DNA messaging wherein DNA messages are packaged in M13 bacteriophage particles, dispatched from an E. coli “sender population”, and delivered to an E. coli “receiver population” via the M13 infection mechanism.
In nature, M13 proteins package the M13 genome into bacteriophage particles through recognition of the M13 packaging sequence (M13 ori). As it turns out, any circular DNA bearing the M13 packaging sequence will be recognized by the M13 proteins and packaged into a bacteriophage particle. Removing the M13 packaging sequence from the M13 genome and placing it on a plasmid, which is then called a “phagemid”, causes the phagemid DNA to be packaged instead of the M13 DNA. A version of the M13 genome that does not get packaged itself due to a missing packaging sequence is called a “helper plasmid”.
A phagemid carrying a DNA message is referred to as a “messaging phagemid”"

Mentoring the Rotterdam iGEM team
Early into the iGEM competition we were contacted by iGEM Rotterdam . At this point, they were just starting up the first Rotterdam iGEM team, which           in fact also is the first team of a Dutch university of applied sciences to ever compete in this competition. Amongst others, they were looking for pointers on how to choose their project. Of course we gladly met up with them to assist in           any way we could. This formed the foundation for our mentorship of iGEM Rotterdam during the iGEM 2018 competition.
Over the course of the competition we had several coaching sessions with iGEM Rotterdam in order to discuss their           progress and to pass on information that has been passed on to us from our predecessors. We also shared our own findings with them.
Sessions started with a general introduction concerning laboratory progress, fundraising, PR and human practices. After the introduction, the teams were divided into expert groups in order to discuss problems in more detail. This gave           both teams the opportunity to learn from the other team’s ideas on everything in the iGEM competition. We provided them with tips and tricks on ligation, social media and crowdfunding campaigns. During the second coaching session we delved           deeper into negotiations with the university and designing promotional material, notably the banner for the Jamboree. Moreover, the team managers remained in close contact throughout the competition in order to           address possible problems as           quickly and as efficiently as possible.
We consider it an honour to have gotten the chance to mentor such a nice and dedicated team of individuals and are grateful for all that we were able to learn in return. We know that they           will excel in Boston with their magnificent hardware project.
Dutch Meet-up and BBQ
After meeting the other Dutch teams for the first time at the National Institute for Public Health and Environment in April, we wanted to remain in contact. However, the next Dutch meeting - the Eindhoven mini Jamboree - was scheduled for           the end of October. Therefore, we were inspired to organise an informal meet-up opportunity during the summer. Laboratory work would be in"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Science#Inhibitor_-_-_TEXT.html," ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI which can express a lot of LacI inhibitor to repress the lac promoter completely and has a low or zero background expression levels. Thus using lacIq as inhibitor is a more efficient way to control the expression. Tac promoter is a functional hybrid promoter composed of different promoters from trp and lac operons and could only be regulated by lacI inhibitor.
CI-pR
CI inhibitor found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system. In the phage lambda, the lambda repressor is a self-assembling dimer also known as the CI protein.
The key regulator in the λ genetic switch is the CI protein, which binds to the OR and OL regions of the λ genome to repress the lytic promoters during lysogeny. Cooperative binding of a pair of CI dimers at two of the three CI operators at OR (OR1 and OR2) represses PR, and similar binding at two of the three operators at OL (OL1 and OL2) represses the PL promoter. Binding of CI to OR2 also stimulates the intrinsically weak promoter for the cI gene, PRM, so that in the lysogenic state CI positively regulates its own synthesis and the presence of CI is maintained. Switching from lysogeny to lytic development, called lysogenic induction or prophage induction, occurs on activation of the host SOS system in response to DNA damage.
TetR-pTet
Tetracycline (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance.
Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the expression of resistance to tetracycline (tc) gene is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein, call tetR. Regulation of expression of the ptet is mediated by Tet repressor, which binds to two operator (tetO) sites. TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation. In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism.
Application in our project
In order to sense the number of plasmids, we use different kinds of inhibitor as the signal. In host cells, the concentration of inhibitor increases while plasmids’ number rises. Once the number of pl"

Mathematical Model
For future tests of the project in ""Gut on a Chip"" system, it is necessary to establish the optimal concentrations of nitrates needed to find the minimum concentration of the soluble transducer (sgp130) to inhibit transignaling.
For the prediction of the secreted concentrations of sgp130, a mathematical model was developed. This model relates the expressed protein concentration, secreted protein concentration, secretion rate, nitrate concentration and the rate of cell proliferation, where the cell line used needs IL6 to grow.
Molecular approach
Simplified Model Of The Molecular Approach
Simbiology model
Using Matlab’s 2018 Simbiology tool we designed the model presented on the top; where C1 is the complex formed by (IL6/sIL6R) and C2 is the complex formed by (IL6/sIL6R/sgp130)
Differential Equations Model
A differential equations model is proposed where it is established that the proliferation of the HEPG2 cell line is a function of the concentration of nitrates, IL6, sIL6, sgp130, as well as, of the IL6 / sIL6 and IL6 / sIL6 / sgp130 complexes
Simbiology model
It is based on the hypothesis that by increasing the concentration of nitrates,                     the ammount of NsrR protein bound to DNA will decrease. This will lead to an increase in the levels of sgp130                       synthesized that will bind to IL6/IL6R complex and thus, a decrease in the proliferation of the HEPG2 cell line will occurred.                     As can be seen in the figure presented in the left input parameters were obtained from literature.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," the squid's mantle cavity and produces luminous light to deter hosts from being eaten (3). Underlying process of the light production is quorum sensing. In contrary to sporulation, regulatory circuit of the quorum sensing is much simpler. In Figure 1, essential components of the circuit are LuxI and LuxR (4). LuxI is the synthase of the quorum sensing signal AHL. LuxR is the transcriptional activator of the promoter containing Lux box which is upstream of the LuxICDABE operon. This operon encodes enzymes - AHL synthase (LuxI), subunits of luciferase (LuxAB) and fatty acid reductase complex (LuxCDE). The last two are involved in light emission reactions. AHL is diffusible across the membrane, so that its concentration rises with the increase in population density. In addition, it increases stability of LuxR through cooperative dimerization. They form a positive feedback loop that synchronizes luminosity of the population. When population density is high, the autoinduction feedback loop responds to increasing AHL in the environment by switching cells from OFF state (no light emitting) to ON state (light emitting).
These switches have capabilities to retain memories and make decisions. Such properties are increasingly interested by scientists around the globe, so that many have been trying to create systems with similar features (5, 6). Positive feedback loop is one of the basic elements in bistable switches. Multiple feedback loops are joined to enhance circuit regulation as well as robustness (7, 8). In Figure 2, positive feedback loops are joined to produce toggle switches that remember (9). The double toggle switch (bottom) displays strong bistability over a wider range of conditions (concentrations of the inducer). Other designs are also possible. Gardner TS. and colleagues constructed genetic toggle switches to determine conditions necessary for bistability in Escherichia coli (10). The circuits were made of two repressilators involving in transcription. Others designs include non-transcriptional components in the systems, and call it the hybrid bistable switches (11, 12). It is believed that they are robust and ultimately more tunable. For example, Daniel Huang and colleagues have demonstrated the usefulness of the sequestration-based bistability (6). In Figure 3 (left), the switch has σ^W which forms a positive feedback loop to itself, anti σ^W which sequestrates the sigma factor and a series of promoters for completing the feedback loop (P_(σ^W )) and for recognising the inducer (P_bad)."

The method is inspired by our repair mechanism and uses the normal Gibson proteins, but also a Recombinase and an oligonucleotide. The reason why no sequence overlap is needed is the exploitation of the recombinase and oligonucleotide to create an overlap during the reaction.
Figure 5, Mechanism for Gibson 2.0. 1) An exonuclease chews of one of the two complementary DNA strands on both of the DNA fragments. 2) One of the two DNA fragments is extended using the oligonucleotide as a reading frame. 3) The two fragments bind together due to their overlapping region 4) A DNA polymerase fills in the gaps and a ligase repair the backbone nicks. 5) The DNA fragments are fused.
Next generation marker
There is a wide range of laboratory markers available for use. Some of the most common markers confer resistance versus a specific chemical like antibiotic resistance. These markers are often very effective since the selective medium does not only kill the cells without the wanted DNA constructions, but it also kills potential contaminants. However, the use of antibiotics could potentially cause selective pressure for antibiotic resistance in pathogens if the antibiotics isn’t taken care of properly. If toxic chemicals are used, it could potential harm humans. Therefore extra safety measures need to be taken to combat these risks.
An alternative method is the use of auxotrophic markers, which is based on knocking out a protein in a pathway which synthesizes an essential biomolecule like a nucleotide or an amino acid. If the cells are grown on a complex nutrient medium, e.g. LB for E. coli or YPD for S. cerevisiae, the cells will survive.  But if they are grown in a media without that specific biomolecule the only survivors will be the cells with the knocked out gene reinserted. The problem with auxotrophic markers could be mixing or contamination by another strain without that specific knockout.
Our concept for the next generation marker is based on our repair system. The used strain should have the needed parts for the repair system but one. During transformation/transfection the last repair protein should be added and then selection is done by irradiating the sample. The transformed cells would survive while the non-transformed cells would die. The same applies for eventual contaminants.  So far it has the same effect as the chemical markers, but without the downsides of auxotrophic markers. However, since the irradiation causes no chemical waste handling it would be the"

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#XY Plane_-_-_TEXT.html," from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and are harder to integrate to our system.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-plane and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors, and therefore syringe pumps, to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it would have been harder to integrate into TERRA and it contained more functions than needed for our project.
Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for quick prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm.
Design 1
The first iteration of the XY-plane was composed of 3D printed parts and HDPE machined parts. We chose to do so in order to test the accessibility of each manufacturing method. All parts were modeled in Creo Parametric and STL files were generated for 3D-printing using a UPrint SE and ABS stock material. The machined parts were created from HDPE stock and milled using a manual NC mill.
Since the first design was part of the prototyping stage, we had chosen to use open ended timing belts in order to have the freedom of adjusting the design of the XY-plane with the least amount of dimensional constraints. We realized, however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our"

Chemotaxis
BBa_K1364000
Strong RBS - N-acetylglucosamine based chemotaxis for Bacillus subtilis - Double terminator
This part is designed to enable a N-acetylglucosamine  based chemotaxis in B. subtilis.
Design
The encoded protein is a chimera of two proteins:
- the methyl accepting Chemotaxis protein (McpA from B. subtilis which is required for taxis towards glucose.
- the N-acetylglucosamine regulated methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein from Vibrio cholerae (VCD).
The chimeric protein contains the intracellular domains of McpA from Bacillus subtilis to enable the transduction of the signal:  these domains correspond to the amino acids 1-37 and 282-610.  The extracellular domain of VCD is inserted between the intracellular regions of McpA  to sense N-acetylglucosamine and corresponds to the amino acids 31-310.

6.Survey
With the aim of helping people understand solid tumors and synthetic biology, we did a survey with related questions in August 2016.Among 179 people completing the questionnaire, about 79% of them were between 18~30 years old, and most of them have bachelor’s degrees. However, most of them knew almost nothing about solid tumors.
6.Survey
Besides, more than half of them knew nothing about the therapies to treat solid tumors and only 10% of them know something about novel therapies, such as immunotherapy or therapies with the assistance of modified microbes. To the potential application of synthetic biology in the treatment of solid tumors, people’s opinions were uncertain.
6.Survey
Because their knowledge about solid tumors and the new achievements was very limited, many people worried the behavior of the microbes inside human body. They thought that it was difficult to control the proliferation of microbes in vivo, which might cause some side effects. Many people held the belief that there were many other severe problems that remained unknown if the microbes were introduced into human bodies. Some people also thought that the efficacy of using protein drugs to cure solid tumors was limited.
In conclusion, even in the well-educated population, the knowledge of solid tumors was not widespread. About curing solid tumors by the means of synthetic biology, many people questioned the risk of the introduction of bacteria into the bodies and the efficiency of this approach. We could learn from the results that it is important to raise public awareness of the threat of solid tumors, and it will be very helpful if we could promote the public interest in curing solid tumors with the aids of synthetic biology.
7.Social Network Platforms
WeChat and Twitter
Though social network platforms, such as Wechat and Twitter, we shared our experience and enthusiasm with others. By recording the on-going events, we shared our failure or success and everybody could look at our growth. Sometimes we posted our lab-notes and our efforts in laboratory can be seen by our fans. We also promoted external communication, interacted with other iGEM Groups. Most importantly, we used these platforms for educational purposes. With our fan page, people who are interested in our project and the iGEM competition can follow us all the time. By doing that, they can learn basic information of synthetic biology, and get further knowledge in frontiers of this field.
Our fans give us support and encouragement, and they make our promotions no end at all. When operating these platforms, we saw a lot of support or accompany from our fans. Each response is the hopes, and they make us to know that there is"

Gastric Intrinsic Factor
Gastric intrinsic factor (GIF), trans-Cbl II, haptocorrin are protein that function to uptake, transport and store the vitamin B12. gif gene is located on chromosome 22. Gastric intrinsic factor consists of 399 amino acids residues in addition %15 carbohydrates content. Its molecular mass is 60-kDa according to gel filtration. (7)
Type II secretion System
Gram-negative bacteria have six types of secretion systems: type I, and type II secrete the protein in the extracellular space. Type I secretion system secretes the protein in a single-step whereas Type II secretion system uses two-step secretion. We use type II secretion system in our project. There are three different pathways in Type II secretion system: twin-arginine translocation (TAT), SecB-dependent and signal recognition particle (SRP). Different signal sequences are recognized by those pathways and helps to secretion of proteins through the periplasmic space of bacterium. Signal sequences are cleaved after the secretion. Proteins are folded while secreted extracellularly. Secretion from periplasmic space to extracellular space is unknown; however, different strategies were developed in laboratory such as co-expression of kil gene. (8)

Executive Summary
Synbiologica Ltd. is a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge who are developing a robust, modular sensor called Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR) used for the highly specific detection of hormones. Current methods of hormone detection are expensive and time consuming.  Synbiologica’s device builds upon current detection methods while incorporating new techniques from the emerging biotechnology field of synthetic biology to provide an inexpensive hormone diagnostic device.  The ability of BEAR to reduce costs and time for hormone diagnostics will further scientific knowledge and innovation for improved health and ultimately benefiting the research, agricultural and medical communities.
Today, much of the research on how hormone levels affect the behaviour of an individual is done by monitoring the concentration of a particular hormone at specific times and relating it to characteristic behaviours. BEAR is designed to detect hormone concentrations with high accuracy in a fraction of the time taken by conventional detection methods, such as ELISA kits. BEAR will mediate the trade-off between a rapid and accurate test. BEAR is designed to be a modular system, meaning the user will be able to use the system to detect different hormones as they desire.
Synbiologica’s current competition includes companies who produce and sell hormone detection kits and devices that use monoclonal antibodies, as this is the primary method of hormone detection. In 2008, the four-year market projection for both therapeutic and diagnostic monoclonal antibodies was valued at $56 billion. Research-oriented hormone detection kits make up a portion of this market. BEAR is more advantageous to monoclonal antibodies because it will provide a fast, real-time test at a fraction of the cost.
Synbiologica’s initial research and development will begin in research labs at the University of Lethbridge. The company plans to use resources at the University, such as the Technology Transfer Office and the Industry Liaison Office to assist the company in market analysis,"

Tissue targeting
Context
The non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, is a cancer, which develops in the organ lumen. This tumor localization is essentially due to factors triggering the tumorogenesis (example: tobacco). A logic route of administration for the treatment would be the aerosol route, though a nebulization of the bacteria. But, this route is not the one that we chose for our treatment. The DVS treatment applied to the lungs cancer is administrated by intravenous.
Objective
We decided to check and quantify the Mycobacterium avium presence, the tissue vector, inside lungs, during the intraveinous administration. Thus, we realized an in vivo study in several murine models.
Back to top
Experimental method
To realize the in vivo study, we designed a bioluminescence protocol, which allows the real-time monitoring, of our tissue vector propagation in mice. The bioluminescence is a good reporter system to analyze the mycobacterial implantation and the clearance in vivo.  We used a tool kindly provided by Dr Brian D. Robertson (Imperial College London researcher). This tool is a plasmid, once electroporated in M. avium can produce the firefly luciferase, a reporter gene, allowing the monitoring. Indeed, the luciferase catalysis the luciferin oxidation into oxiluciferin, involving photons emission, which can be caught by a CCD camera photosensitive (IVIS, Imaging System 50, Xenogen).
Unfortunately, the growth of electroporated mycobacteria with the monitoring plasmid, was so slow, it was not possible to realize this study within the given time (generation time of M. avium: nearly 20 hours. That is why we decided to change our protocol.
Following this lack of time, we used another protocol ("
UC_San_Diego,2015,Team:UC San Diego#Modeling#Constraint_-_-_TEXT.html," we were concerned when we discovered many reactions and metabolites missing from the native fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is crucial to the Lux system, because luxD interacts with myristic-ACP, also known as tetradecanoyl-ACP4,5. With the v7 model terminating fatty acid biosynthesis at octanoyl-ACP, we were forced to add the necessary reactions with the assistance of the KEGG database4,5.
Metabolic Control Analysis and Flux Balance Analysis
The term metabolic flux is used to describe the rate of turnover of metabolites in these large-scale networks. Flux for an individual reaction is the difference between the rates of the forward reaction and the reverse reaction6.
The main objective of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is to find a solution for a system of linear equations, (S*v = b). Using the coefficients -1,0, and 1, we can identify which metabolites actively participate in each reaction and form the stoichiometric matrix, S. b is assumed to be a zero matrix, because at steady-state, the rate of consumption is equal to the rate of production. Hence, flux balance analysis returns v, the column vector of the flux of each reaction solved at steady state7.
Figure 1. Converting a set of reactions to a mathematical model.
However, FBA has many limitations. FBA cannot predict metabolic concentrations, because it does not utilize kinetic parameters. Also, it cannot account for regulatory agents such as those involved in transcription or translation of the genome7,8.
Constraint-Based Modeling
We used the COBRA Toolbox plugin in MATLAB to edit and analyze our SBML model9. The steady-state assumption that is employed in FBA is one example of a constraint. Constraints define the allowable solution space in FBA and accounts for many reaction properties that cannot be encoded by simple stoichiometry. Metabolic constraints, such as flux coefficients, define the physico-chemical boundaries of a reaction. The lower bound of the flux coefficient also tells us if the reaction is reversible or irreversible10.
Space constraints, such as the use of compartments, define the physical boundaries on which metabolites can react with one another. There are many other types of constraints that can be embedded into a genome-scale model such as regulatory constraints, thermodynamic constraints, and temporal constraints. All parameters seek to eliminate infeasible solutions and define the solution space as closely as possible1,10.
The most important constraint is the objective function. The COBRA Toolbox allows us to maximize or minimize the flux through certain reactions of interest1. For instance,"
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"osis which has been known for more than a century. And you also have, for example, infections originating from sheep that can also affect humans. And in this work on chlamydia we also had to develop new diagnostic methods. My laboratory was the reference laboratory of the OIE, which is the counterpart of the WHO in veterinary medicine and in this function we had to provide always improved methods for laboratory diagnosis. And we had to implement also the latest state of the art in molecular diagnosis in order to be able to give advice to other laboratories and also to fulfill our role as a reference laboratory. So during these 20 years we became involved in several international frameworks, like the COST Action, which was a Pan European network of 18 countries where we coordinated the research activities of Chlamydia laboratories in virtually all european countries and some overseas countries as well. And we also got involved in a few research networks, or coordinated some of them. And these networks focused on pathogen-host interactions.
    So that was really a research into the mechanisms of disease. So in order to understand why the eradication or control is so difficult. And in these projects we managed to explain a few aspects, for instance the inability of controlling by use of classical antibiotics. And we also understood why it is so difficult to develop vaccines against chlamydia infections. The idea to develop a vaccine is very welcome and in the end it can provide a solution. But again it is not the same approach that might be working with classical bacterial infections. Because chlamydia are different.
Kai:
Could you talk about why it is so difficult to design vaccines against chlamydia?
Prof. Sachse:
The first point is that when investigating a course of infection in any way, in a human patient or an animal, you will notice that the humoral antibody response is not emerging in a straightforward way as it is in classical bacterial infections. There are even cases, depending on a certain bacterial level of the infection, when the patient or the infected animal will not develop a humoral response at all. So you can not achieve a protection or a protective level of antibody production. The second factor that I mentioned is that it is not well known how humoral antibody response is typically like. That is because there a many protein antigens contributing to the antibody response so the cocktail of these antigens is very different with different organisms. And we still donˋt understand why that is the case. And because of the complex difficulties we donˋt know how to generate with great certainty an antibody response that is 100 % emerging. There are,"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Inhibitor_-_-_TEXT.html," Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI which can express a lot of LacI inhibitor to repress the lac promoter completely and has a low or zero background expression levels. Thus using lacIq as inhibitor is a more efficient way to control the expression. Tac promoter is a functional hybrid promoter composed of different promoters from trp and lac operons and could only be regulated by lacI inhibitor.
CI-pR
CI inhibitor found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system. In the phage lambda, the lambda repressor is a self-assembling dimer also known as the CI protein.
The key regulator in the λ genetic switch is the CI protein, which binds to the OR and OL regions of the λ genome to repress the lytic promoters during lysogeny. Cooperative binding of a pair of CI dimers at two of the three CI operators at OR (OR1 and OR2) represses PR, and similar binding at two of the three operators at OL (OL1 and OL2) represses the PL promoter. Binding of CI to OR2 also stimulates the intrinsically weak promoter for the cI gene, PRM, so that in the lysogenic state CI positively regulates its own synthesis and the presence of CI is maintained. Switching from lysogeny to lytic development, called lysogenic induction or prophage induction, occurs on activation of the host SOS system in response to DNA damage.
TetR-pTet
Tetracycline (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance.
Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the expression of resistance to tetracycline (tc) gene is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein, call tetR. Regulation of expression of the ptet is mediated by Tet repressor, which binds to two operator (tetO) sites. TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation. In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism.
Application in our project
In order to sense the number of plasmids, we use different kinds of inhibitor as the signal. In host cells, the concentration of inhibitor increases while plasmids’ number rises. Once the number of plasmids"

In conclusion, from modelling this system we know that the concentration of CheZ and intracellular theophylline increase with increasing theophylline transport rate. Also, the expression of CheZ can be tuned by this transport rate. Therefore, it is believed that the CheZ level and the level of directed movement of bacteria can be increased by expressing more theophylline transporters in the cell membrane.

Stability analysis
Although we have done sensitivity analyses on some predominant parameters and acquired fabulous results, these analyses were all based on unary composites, holding only a single subject. We are not content with only doing sensitivity analyses, which merely care about single-in-single-out outcomes but not considering binary relation in systematic concept. So we made a bifurcation analysis on binary parameter (u,m) adopting the same method as what we have done in part 2.
Table 3 critical points (u,m) for oscillation
Depicting those points into an axis, we got the bifurcation line, which indicates the parameters’ value range when our system can oscillate stably is in the area marked by ‘bistable’ as follows.

Feedback analysis
By changing parameters a and b, which is equivalent to varying types of feedback introduced, we got simulation results as follows (In order to manifest more clearly, the parameter v was set larger, thus each cell’s feedback effect would put greater influence on the whole system).
Figure 15 System with feedback
The analysis shows that only with a negative feedback mechanism could the overall system be working as an oscillator. When a=b=0, the system contains no artificial negative feedback, but there may be some inherent negative feedback within the system.

Isothermal Assembly of Pos Con 77, Zif 268, and OZs
Today we checked the PCR products of the ultramer reaction from yesterday.  They did not look good.  We repeated the reaction using a touchdown PCR beginning with an annealing temperature of 70 degrees and decreasing 2 degrees every other cycle until hitting a minimum of 58 degrees, and we brought the total number of cycles to 25.  Extension time was 30 seconds.  This looked great.  The pictures for the two reactions can be seen below:
Our first PCR was extremely streaky, so we decided to redo it.
We did a touchdown PCR, and our product looks better, although it's still streaky.
Before the isothermal assembly, we did a PCR purification and measured the concentrations of the ultramer reaction products:

Overview
In order to prevent cells permanently shifting their metabolism towards one that favours light production, we decided to repress the bioluminescence genes (our optimised lux operon) in the presence of sunlight. The chosen system recognises unidirectional UV-A light and comes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The system has not yet been characterized by an iGEM team for the Parts Registry. Three components are required to produce a response to UV-A: uirS (UV intensity response Sensor), uirR (UV intensity response Regulator), and PlsiR (Promoter of the light and stress integrating response Regulator) (Song et al., 2011). Expression of a chromophore molecule, phycocyanobillin (PCB), is also required for functional light sensing. Phycocyanobillin is synthesised in a two step pathway from Heme within cyanobacterium. Several biobricks encoding the two phycocyanobillin synthesis pathway enzymes already existed within the Registry of Parts due to utilisation of PCB in other previously characterised Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 light sensors such as the ccaS green-light sensor system. We obtained uirS and uirR from Synechocystis genomic DNA via PCR. The forward primer used was flanked with the BioBrick prefix as well as the medium strength ribosome-binding site B0032, with the biobrick suffix flanking the reverse. We also utilised the reverse primer for uirS to modify the stop codon from TAG (suboptimal in E. coli) to TAA. A G-Block was ordered from IDT of the 535bp genomic region identified in Song et al. between the stop codon of uirR and start of lsiR, which was demonstrated to contain the uirR transcriptional activator binding region for the promoter of l"

    During World War II, France was badly attacked by Germany. French placed its main military force on the east, but Germans attacked from the North. From this famous event, we can see how important strategies are.
     (2) In this case, side A owns 5 farmers and 5 warriors, while side B owns 8 farmers. B loses the war because of insufficient warriors.In the following movie, if one sides increase the ratio of warriors, he can easily win.
Discovery
The strength of military force is important
    The number of warriors is obviously important .It can be seen that the winning of a war relies a lot on the number of our our warriors. Even though the farmers from A side is fewer, the warriors from side A can help “robbing” the nutrients from side B.
    In human society, remember the military force is always the first place a ruler should consider. The Song Dynasty of China was a comparatively wealthy country. However, because the military force of the Song Dynasty was relatively weak, it was turned over by nomads whose military force was stronger. Although the nomads were not wealthy or even had not enough food to eat, they could get all of these from the Song Dynasty.
    Anyway, military force should always be put in the first place.
III Establish Lots of Bases
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria, but side A has two bases while side B has only one. The following movie shows that side A wins because of one more bacteria base.
Discovery
Don’t put all the eggs in one basket
    In this case, it is smarter to establish distributed bases rather than concentrated bases. More bases are needed as they can bring more space for the growth of bacteria.
    Many people feel that the best strategy is to concentrate the military force and rout the enemy forces one by one. However, this is not always the case. Contrary to our intuition, sometimes it works better if we scatter the military forces wisely. Chairman Mao, the founding father of China, knows this very well and used it a lot in many guerilla warfares.
IV  Plant Undercover
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria. But side A sets some warriors and farmers as “undercover agents” around B’s bacteria. The following movie shows this process. A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria.

The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within

High school students in an iGEM environment
A Social Experiment
This year, for the first time, we carried out a bit of a social experiment: we invited a substantial number of local high school students to join the team. In the end, the team is composed of five high school students, in grades ranging from 10 to 12, and four undergraduates, one from each academic year and none with previous iGEM experience. The idea is two-fold: firstly, to extend the reach of the iGEM experience to a different audience of students, effectively expanding the outreach of synthetic biology; and secondly, to see if the different background and perspectives of younger students would have an impact on the nature of the science done.
Although we expected that the HS students would have formal coursework background, there were several unanticipated obstacles. One was school schedules. High school classes run until nearly the end of June, limiting the participation of the HS students during the initial phase of the project. Another was logistics and transportation. Generally the HS students neither lived on campus nor drove a vehicle, complicating their availability especially for after-hours lab sessions. However there were also unanticipated benefits. The younger students brought a level of enthusiasm which readily overcame any differences in background. Moreover, the undergraduates and HS students bonded during lab hours and discussions of topics ranging from religion (adherents of most of the world’s major groups were present) to card games and beyond.
Overall, the effort was demanding but positive, and something we will recommend U of A iGEM teams consider in future years.

The ligated pTac:Chat was transformed into competent cells and left in sterile desk at room temperature in a dark environment.
Week 10 (17thAug – 23rd Aug)
Monday 17st
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We transformed competent Nissle with TPH1 expression cassette plasmid for submission for our art project with talented bio-artmaker Anna Dumitru
Tuesday 18nd
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We had transformed Nissle with different time periods for heat shock and successfully obtained colonies. As from our experiment, heat shock for 180 seconds works better than for 40 seconds.
We cloned our effectors KAT and GAD in both Ptac and pSB1C3 vectors but antiTNAs only in pSB1C3. We digested, dephosphorylated and ligated the constructs into the designated vectors.
Wednesday 19rd
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We transformed the effectors with concentrated sample and left them for overnight incubation.
Thursday 20th
Mind the Gut: Effectors
Our patience and hard work had paid off. We finally had some colonies from the transformation. KAT pSB1C3 was disappointing without any colonies and antiTNA1 had merely one colony
We inoculated the picked colonies in LB media. We picked 4 colonies where possible and left them in shaking incubator for 16 hours.
Friday 21st
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We made mini preps and obtained the DNA concentration from nano drop.
We used 100ng of DNA for diagnostic digestion of each effector. We then ran 2% agarose gel for all the antiTNAs and 1% for the rest.
The gel confirmed the ligation had worked for Pyear TPH and GAD into pSB1C3 and  showed slightly unclear results for pTAC-KAT.
AntiTNAs were sadly not visible yet again. However, there was a potential band for antiTNA2 and pSB1C3 plasmid.
We decided to repeat the gel for pTAC-KAT, and antiTNA2 again as they were hopeful but not conclusive.
Week 11 (24th Aug – 30th August)
Monday 24th
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We prepared two separate gels for pTAC-KAT and antiTNA and ran the gel.
The results from the gel were still inconclusive. Only one of the three KAT pSB1C3 digest had double band. The second band had double bands however"
