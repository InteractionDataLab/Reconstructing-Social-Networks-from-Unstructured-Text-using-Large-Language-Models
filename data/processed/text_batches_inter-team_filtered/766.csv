Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the factors that are predictive of overexpression toxicity [16]. The authors found that transcription factors tend to be toxic when overexpressed and suggested that their binding to non-native DNA sites and saturation of the transcription machinery could cause toxicity. Hence, AimR is at risk of causing toxicity in E. coli. However, an alternative explanation that we propose is that spurious binding of the transcription factor to the genome can interfere with the expression of native genes. In order to get an idea of how much spurious AimR binding sites are available in the E. coli genome, we attempted to dock AimR to its cognate DNA, but didn’t have success. We did determine that the size of the binding site of one AimR monomer is roughly 11 nucleotides. Hence, we determined how many times one of these binding sites occurred in the genome to get an idea of the risk of AimR binding to the E. coli genome. For this end, we searched the predicted binding site of the spAimR docked with its experimental sequence and searched for it in the E. coli genome. The results are found in Table 2.

These results show that binding sites that have a size corresponding to the real AimR binding site, may occur readily in the E. coli genome and inside genes. This analysis can thus reveal whether important processes in the host cell may be perturbed by overexpression of AimR.
In summary, despite not having the exact binding site of AimR, we estimated that a binding site of the size of AimR may readily occur in the E. coli genome and more importantly inside native genes. We have developed a protocol to qualitatively assess where the protein can bind and what processes it may perturb. This, combined with the observation by [16] that transcription factors tend to"
RHIT,2014,Team:RHIT#Project#Wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," reading frame of this yeast construct includes constitutive promotion of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). LDH allows for the yeast to produce lactate. The lactate produced by the yeast will induce E. coli's lactate promoter, which serves to activate a His3 gene that will enable the E. coli to survive without supplemental histidine in the media (See above).
To test our transformed E. coli strain for the surface expression of alpha-mating factor and the ability to induce the MPRP, Team RHIT designed a positive feedback mechanism that expresses blue fluorescent protein within yeast. We again use the FUS1 promoter because it is activated by the mating pheromone response pathway. Upon FUS1 promoter activation, the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) expression begins. To further positive feedback, the LexA binding domain binds to the LexA regulatory element and, in conjunction with the VP64 (viral protein 64) transcriptional activator domain, facilitates further production. The presence of two BFP domains, along with the glysine-serine linkers (GSLs) that link the two domains, ensure a good output of fluorescent protein. In addition, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), whish is a short amino acid sequence, was included to ""tag"" the protein for import into the nucleus by nuclear transport. A bright blue dot in the yeast nucleus will show a positive test result.
Hypothesis
Team RHIT hypothesizes that the synthetic unity system will induce a symbiotic relationship between yeast and E. coli. This symbiosis will develop a novel design chassis that will spur innovation within synthetic biology.

Imperial College London
Thanks to our presence in the Young Synthetic Biologist 2.0 meeting held in London we were able to create contacts with other teams from the UK.  Both the Imperial College London team’s project (link to their wiki https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial) and ours had as goal water filtration and we both had focused our efforts in using phytochelatins as mechanism for metal ion chelation.
Although in early stages of the development of ECOCadmus we considered using synthetic phytochelatins we had to discard this idea because of the difficulties synthesising parts of high repetitive sequence.
The Imperial College London team however was able to obtain synthetic phytochelatins and they also created phytochelatins with cellulose binding domains at the N- or C- terminus.  The University of York iGEM team will help to characterise their parts using Cadmium since they had no access to it.
List of parts provided by Imperial College London in psB1C3 plasmid:
Phytochelatin EC20 (PC)
PC +C2 cellulose binding protein
PC+C4
PC+C7
PC+C10
C4+PC
C7+PC

At the time of the freeze of this wiki we lacked relevant data to present but we will carry on characterising phenotypic effects of expression of the synthetic phytochelatins upon different Cadmium chloride concentrations similar to the structure followed in the PYoda characterisation.

Stretcher is up and running
gave it a few test runs
Some problems with it:
the godet has too much friction/attraction to the thread. As a result, the thread is unable to pass from the 1st godet to the 2nd. The 1st godet drags the thread along with it, so I am unable to advance it to the 2nd.
it is extremely difficult to wind the thread around the 1st godet and then guide it to the 2nd by hand.
it is extremely difficult to unwind the thread after removing it from the ethanol. It comes out as a soggy, clumped mess.
It might be best to have the collection spool out in dry air
Some observations
It is very easy to catch the fiber onto the 1st godet and just let it wind around it.
We may just switch to a 1-godet design, where 1 godet both stretches AND captures the thread
However, here there is the problem of recollecting the thread after it has been spooled and withdrawn from the ethanol.
A godet speed of 150 seems to be close to the speed at which the thread is coming out of the tubing.
to reduce friction of the godet, we tried polishing them with acetone (they are made of ABS plastic, and acetone dissolves it).
Sri gave a great suggestion:
Wind the thread around the 1st godet.
Once all of the thread has been extruded, reverse the 1st godet, and feed the thread to the 2nd godet.
update:I tried this, it didn't work. The godet still tugged the thead back, even when it was running in reverse. This doesn't make sense to me, but it did it.
I think I got it!

“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more” - Henry V
We used an arsenal of self-written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to execute the vast amount of laboratory work. Each was written in collaboration with a person with experience in the field of the procedure and then approved by a second competent person. As such, it was strictly forbidden to change the SOPs without consulting the rest of the team, and any changes were then implemented in agreement. It was hereby secured that everyone in the lab were following the same procedures each time.

Overview
Synthetic biology requires reliable and repeatable measurement. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult for different units or different ways may be used in various groups. The InterLab Study is part of the Measurement Committee’s continuing effort to develop a standard measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP). In order to improve reproducibility, we used plate readers to take measurements of fluorescence and absorbance this year.

In the worst-case scenario, feet or legs must be amputated. In that case, five-year survival rates are even worse than for many cancer patients. Sometimes, heart patients experience similar problems as diabetic patients.
Another group of patients that may benefit from our treatment are burn wound patients. Burn wounds are also often infected.
It may be helpful to stimulate blood flow while applying our plaster, as blood flow has been demonstrated to be crucial in wound healing
We should aim to kill the major bacterial strains contributing to wound-infections rather than one strain only. Lim did not know which strains are most problematic.
We learned about the long and winding trajectory of (clinical) testing required before market launch of medical devices.
Follow-up
We integrated the insights in our applied design.
We contacted the Maasstad Hospital burn wound center to learn more about burn wounds.
We researched the main bacterial strains contributing to wound infections and possible bacteriocins we could use to extinguish them.  Maasstad Hospital and Dr. Edgar Peters gave us more insight in which bacterial strains cause the most problems in wounds.
To make it user friendly, we take the wishes and needs of home care employees and patients into account while designing our patch.

For instance, iGEM Düsseldorf warned us for the risk of overcrowding of the hydrogel upon long-term use. This resulted in a potential collaboration with them; we may be able to use their quorum sensing Biobrick to prevent overcrowding, or perhaps even to prevent infiltration of the material by foreign bacteria. We also received useful feedback from Julia Müller, a PhD candidate at TU München who is attempting to print hydrogels. We would like to thank iGEM Munich for the perfect organization and all the participants for their feedback and ideas.

Sequence from plasmid
For verification of Tn5-lin insertion in pACYC, primers 029 and 030 was used for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the -20 bp position of fragment Tn5-lin, flanking the promoter of T7 and terminator from T7 of the vector. Sequencing sample was prepared in 1.5 mL tubes for each primer as indicated my Macrogen for specific concentration of plasmid DNA.
Within 2 days, the sequence was retrievable online and alignment with the in silico designed molecule showed 100% match of the insert lin-Tn5, by aligning both primer sequences obtained.

Our testing of 3 restriction digests worked fine, but we ran into a 'Out of Resources Exception' when we tried to test with 9 restriction digests. We then spent 40 mins trying to debug this error and finally managed to fix the problem. We next used the same method to test 1 ligation and it worked fine, we then tested 5 ligations in a row and its pipetting pattern also matched what we expected. What we need to do now is to connect the restriction digests and ligations so the ligations will use samples created from the restriction digest as its input samples.

5. “Plate” allocation
6. Puppeteer DB -> schema
I now have my work cut out for me for the next few weeks. Me, Swapnil, and Viktor had a juicy discussion about how to deal with the plate allocation issue. How does Puppeteer/ResourceManager figure out what plates are least needed and make room on the deck when the deck clutter's up with plates. We agreed to execute a 3 pass method to do this, the first pass calculates resource requirements and initializes the deck, the second pass figures out what plates are accessed at what time, and during the third pass we actually passes instructions to the robot. By this point, the resource manager knows how to make room on the deck and put what plates in the hotel depending on the access time for each plate.

Chang and Winnans (1992) revealed in their studies the parts of the VirA receptor which are essential for the signal transduction ( Chang CH and Winans SC., 1992 ). A structured model for different inducing conditions are shown in figure 4.

Phenolic Compounds
The ligand receptor interaction between acetosyringone and VirA is based on the interaction of several chemical groups. First of all the hydroxylated aromat is essential. Methoxy groups in the ortho position of the phenol play a crucial role in the signaling as well. It should be mentioned that dimethoxy compounds have a higher activity than monomethoxy compounds. The acetyl and alkyl groups in para position enhance the binding affinity. VirA activating compounds must have two methoxy groups in ortho position and an additional carbonyl group on the R3 chain. The potential capacity of the group para to the phenolic hydroxyl group is associated with higher activities. Moreover the chirality at this carbon center is critical for the inducing activity ( Winans SC, 1992 ). Regarding to the proton transfer model of Hess et al. (1996) the VirA activator transfers a proton to the basic area receptor binding site. The allosteric change leads to the phosphotransfer and the signaltransduction ( Hess KM et al., 1991 ).

Inducing enhancers
The sensitivity of this system is highly enhanced when additional aldose monosacchardic suggars occur in the environment of Agrobacterium. The sugar binding protein ChvE interacts with the VirA receptor, leading to a much stronger vir gene expression ( Banta LM, et al., 1994 ).

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," (AA 246-305) to a red fluorescent protein, to further elucidate the Pex3 /Pex19-dependent import. mRuby is generally used as a marker in combination with a fluorescent microscope to visualize the localization of the fusion protein. The C-terminus of PEX26 contains a helical signal-anchor, which serves as both, a mPTS and transmembrane domain. We designed our construct with mRuby2 fused to the N-terminal side of the PEX26 -C-terminus, this way the mRuby should face the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane.    Quite similar to our mRuby- PEX26 approach, we designed a construct for the ER-dependent import. Therefore, we fused the mRuby2 fluorescent protein to the N-terminus of Pex3 (AA 1-39). This construct should be N-terminally anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, with mRuby2 again facing the cellular lumen.
Our main goal is to introduce a rather complex membrane protein to the peroxisome that can alter specific traits. For that we fused the Pex3 N-terminus (AA 1-39) to a Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin protein (AA 16-262), replacing the first 16 amino acids ( Pex3 -BacR). The original archaeal bacteriorhodopsin acts as a proton pump by capturing light energy to move protons across the membrane out of the cell. The resulting proton gradient is subsequently converted into chemical energy.  Our assumption is that the first transmembrane segment determines the orientation of the following protein and that therefore due to the N-terminal anchoring signal the bacteriorhodopsin will be inserted in reverse orientation, pumping the protons into the peroxisome. This way the pH of the peroxisomal lumen could actively be controlled and adjusted.
Finally, our project involved combining the work of other subteams to verify the localization of our constructs in the peroxisome and analyze the effects they have on the import. Therefore, we are using the superfolded-GFP protein, another fluorescent marker, which is in our case fused to the peroxisomal import sequence PT1, and a version of Pex11 that is fused to the fluorescent marker Venus. Both markers emit light in the green light spectrum, were as mRuby2 emits light in the red part of the spectrum, giving us a strong contrast and an easy way of differentiating between the two under the fluorescent microscope.

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Practices#Industry_-_-_TEXT.html," decomposition byproducts are formed depending on temperature, time of exposure and gas mixture components. The other treatment option is scrubber decomposition, in which MeBr is reacted with ethanolamine to produce safe products [1]. Unfortunately, despite the health and environmental advantages, this method is not employed in all the manufacturing processes yet, due to economic and infrastructure problems.
Figure 12 Scrubber decomposition
In 2006 the World Meteorological Organization and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration published research that showed that methyl bromide significantly depletes the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer [6]. Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer allows UV-C and UV-B light to reach the planet’s surface, increasing risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, eye cataracts and weakened immune systems as well as damaging plastics, ocean ecosystems as well as the health of plants and animals [7]. The half-life of the photochemical lysis of MeBr is between 4 and 20 months, making it a molecule that poses significant threat to the recovery of ozone layer [8].
Death from dangerous chemicals was among the global top ten leading causes of death in 2004, and continue to remain a significant problem. The World Health Organisation reported that 4.9 million deaths and 86 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) (8.3% of the global total of deaths and 5.7% of the global total of DALYs in 2004, respectively) were attributable to environmental exposure and management of selected dangerous chemicals in 2004. The annual deaths due to occupational particulates were 375,000, acute poisonings by chemicals were 240,000 and self-poisonings by pesticides were 186,000 - totalling 964,000 deaths and 20,986,153 DALYs, corresponding to 1.6% of the total deaths and 1.4% of the total burden of disease globally. The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) on the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) has set an aim to use and produce chemicals by 2020 in “ways that do not lead to significant adverse effects on human health and the environment” [9]. The deaths caused by dangerous chemicals and processes can be curbed by eliminating processes in the chemical industry that contribute to these statistics, exchanging total syntheses for biotechnological approaches.

Members of the wet lab undergraduate team, Wilson Lam, Dylan Siriwardena, Lloyd Mai, and Yara Abou-Hamde, built all network constructs along with the submitted BioBrick parts. Martin Hanzel built constructs designed to test an ethanol-inducible promoter and a copper-inducible promoter. Richard Beard built constructs to test functionality of chromoproteins. Dylan, Lloyd, Wilson and Yara handled yeast and E. coli transformations. Wilson and Yara ran flow cytometry.
Wilson Lam accomplished the overall network design with advice provided by team advisors Afnan Azizi and Ian Roney. The lab advisors also contributed to the day-to-day troubleshooting and helped in the training of the undergraduate team. Our lab technician, Mila Tepliakova, assisted in the safety training of the undergraduate team and provided advice throughout the progression of the project. Dr. Mads Kaern provided the team with lab resources and extensive advice and support.
The differential equations model for the system and implementation in MATLAB were done by Paul Reginato from the University of Waterloo iGEM team. This was only possible as a result of the great collaboration between the University of Waterloo iGEM team and the uOttawa iGEM teams learn more . Parameterization and analysis of the model to show pulse and fold change detection were done by Nicolas Tremblay from the University of Ottawa iGEM team with extensive guidance of Daniel Charlebois advisor for the uOttawa iGEM team. Martin Hanzel did the bulk of the work on the team Wiki with some assistance from the design team.
Bricklayer was built by Kevin Rutkay, Peter Doan, Martin Hanzel, and Mohammed Chamma. Mohammed designed the architecture and wrote the search feature using Parts Registry's API. Peter implemented the RFCs, the primer generation code, and the melting temperature calculations. Kevin created the Brick Bin, adding the ability to select and save bricks that will make up the user's final construct. Martin designed the look and feel of the app's search, results, bin, and construction interfaces. Many thanks to the wet lab team, especially Dylan and Wilson, for sitting with the dry lab and explaining the biology to us.

The cultures should be prepared for storage at -80°C tomorrow.
Friday 27/6
Freezing stocks were made out of the ON from yesterday. The samples were then stored at -80°C.
Saturday 28/6
The non-successful transformation from Wednesday 25/6 was repeated.
Sunday 29/6
The transformation was partially successful. There were some, but very few, visible colonies on the agar plates. Two overnight cultures were prepared from one colony respectively.
Week 27 (30/6 - 6/7)
Monday 30/6
The overnight culture was not red, as expected, which means that something was wrong with the plasmid. Therefore a new overnight culture was prepared, so that a Colony PCR can be performed on the cultures. Furthermore an overnight culture was prepared of the wild type E. coli strain, so that it can be used for transformation tomorrow.
Tuesday 1/7
Today a Colony PCR was performed on the E. coli MG1655 strains with the plasmids: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and J04450 (also known as aza). The results showed that the constructs all had approximately the same weight, just below 1500 bp. This corresponds to the theoretical weight of the constructs, which is 1382 bp.
The development of the construct used to produce lacI was commenced. This was done by first running Phusion PCR on lacI (BBa_I732100, Template 8A, Plate 3). The PCR product was then analysed on gel-electrophoresis and purified.
Transformation was performed on the plasmids pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 as the former transformation was unsuccessful. Furthermore transformation was also performed on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.). The transformed E. coli were put on agar plates with antibiotic according to their respective resistance. The plates were placed in the heating cabinet and should be examined for colonies tomorrow.
Wednesday 2/7
Because the PCR on lacI from yesterday yielded a low concentration, Phusion PCR was repeated today, where both the PCR product from yesterday and BBa_I732100 from iGEM were used as template. The results showed that the PCR product from yesterday was too short and still yielded a low concentration. While the PCR reaction with BBa_I732100 as template produced a higher concentration of lac"

When we looked at specific words from our project, we also got some interesting results. The word “aggregate” was slightly faster in the mix incompatible than in the mix compatible, suggesting a possible bias against the word aggregate (i.e. associated faster with “unpleasant” than with “pleasant”). However, the difference in the response times could also suggest that there is some confusion around the word itself. It is possible participants do not have a preconceived bias towards or against the word aggregate, thus allowing for some inconsistencies. We should be very careful to clearly explain this term in all future communication. As well, the word yeast was slightly slower in the mix compatible block. This could suggest a slight bias against yeast, but it could also suggest some confusion around yeast’s involvement in synthetic biology. Yeast is commonly associated with things such as beer and bread, and we think there is a possibility that participants were discovering yeast is used in synthetic biology. We should continue to educate people about the use of yeast as a model organism in synthetic biology and lessen potential confusion.
Interestingly, the word “prion”, one of the most integral terms related to our project, was actually faster in the mix compatible block, and was associated more quickly with pleasant words. This is exciting, because it suggests we have been doing a good job with engaging and educating the public about our project. Other words related to our project, including amyloid, FRET, and enzymes, had no statistical difference in response times between the mix compatible and mix incompatible blocks. This suggests no bias towards or against these words, and it provides a good place to continue our communication about the benefits of our project, as we may be able to elicit a positive initial feeling towards these terms and our project.
Of course, we noticed some trends with words associated with the field of synthetic biology as a whole, as opposed to our project specific terms. The word bacteria was sorted particularly slowly in both mix blocks, and was even slow enough to be an outlier in the mix compatible block. This suggests that participants have an implicit bias against bacteria, as they associate bacteria with pleasant words very slowly. Bacteria are such an important tool in synthetic biology, and, although bacteria can be harmful, we and others in the field of synthetic biology must really stress the benefits and safety of this system to elicit more positive associations with this term.
BioBricks was sorted slightly faster in the mix compatible, and we think this could be due to the fact that it had “bio” in its name, and this was easier to sort with the category that shared part"

mNARK lycopene probiotic
We wanted to create novel synthetic biology therapies that can be effectively integrated into society. In order to do so, we wanted to talk to the experts , to fully understand the problem and how our synthetic biology solutions can be optimised. Initially, we spoke to our main project inspiration, Aubrey de Grey (the full skype video can be seen here ). Aubrey mentioned that our lycopene idea was promising if the data we obtained showed that Lycopene can survive in the gut and if our genetically modified bacteria can survive under low pH of the digestive tract. As a result of talking to Aubrey, we designed further characterisation tests for our lycopene BioBrick, where we have stressed our cells through different inducers of oxidative stress.
Consequently, we decided to send our mNARK – Lycopene containing bacteria to Dundee iGEM to test how well our bacteria survive in their stomach simulating device, which can be seen here . We were able to successfully see that our probiotic idea is feasible as it is able to pass through the acidic environment of the stomach to the gut. Click on our lycopene page to find out more about the results of our collaboration. After talking to more researchers such as Filipe , we gained more confidence that there is significant proof of concept that is required for our therapies to be successfully integrated into society.
Superoxide dismutase 3: The evolution of a novel therapy
Julie from the Dementia care home mentioned that she feels like she is being forced to take pills required for her to maintain her quality of life. The negative feeling from the elderly with taking the pills, then inspired the team to think of new ways of delivering our therapies. Hence why we wanted to create an alternative therapy from our lycopene device that would be approved by our end users. We then asked the experts whether we should focus on alternative routes of therapy, such as gene therapy and if this is more effective than a probiotic. As a result, we came to the conclusion of that the overexpression of Superoxide Dismutase 3 would be a good strategy for healthy ageing.
We then fed this back into our interactions with the experts with William Bains who said that this was a good idea and can form an interesting and rapid approach. William Bains helped us improve the safety of our SOD3 idea by, titrating the lycopene system to only express the gene when high levels of oxidative stress are"

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Project overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"obenzoic acid, natural occuring UV light absorbing molecule used in sunscreens
For our sunscreen we chose E. coli as our primer chassis, with a later idea to transfer a working system to a natural bacterial flora of the skin or alginate beads . As a UV-B light absorbing substance, 4-para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, Fig. 2) was chosen for the following reasons: i) PABA is already used in sunscreens for UV-B protection [Sambandan2011]; ii) PABA is a natural occurring compound as an intermediate in folate synthesis pathway. Furthermore, overproduction of PABA requires overexpression of just three key enzymes: pabA, pabB, pabC, and several attempts were made to overproduce PABA in E.coli by other iGEM teams [Wegkamp2007]. Thus we used pabC enzyme from the biobrick partregistry and also cloned both, pabA and pabB, into one operon under the constitutive promoter aiming to increase the PABA concentration in the cells. Furthermore, we are not limited to PABA and other natural light absorbance molecules, such as mycosporine-like amino acids, might be used for our final system [Gao2011].
Direct UV detection: a novel UV-B light receptor in E.coli
To couple PABA synthesis to UV light we investigated E.coli response to UV radiation. However, in prokaryotes such response is activated indirectly by sensing DNA damage [Goosen2008]. Such protection strategy would be erroneous to pursue, because induction of protection is initiated after DNA damage is already happened. Thus we used plant UV-B responsive protein UVR8 to design a novel UV-B receptor in E. coli.
In the dark state, UVR8 forms a dimer, which monomerizes upon UV-B irradiation and induces transcriptional changes necessary for plant UV response [Heijde2012]. However, UVR8 is not able to bind DNA, thus we fused it with a DNA binding domain of tetracycline repressor protein ( TetRDBD ). TetRDBD does not contain dimerization domain required for efficient binding and repression of TetR responsive promoter Ptet. However, external dimerization would in principle restore TetRDBD ability to repress Ptet. Thus, our chimeric protein UVR8-TetRDBD acts as an light inducible transcription repressor – at dark state, UVR8 dimer brings TetRDBD"

Overview
We want to build a device which can kill the engineered bacteria when it escapes from the fermenter and a device which can kill the therapeutic bacteria after it releases the drug. We used Thermal Sensitive Regulator and Quorum Sensing device to achieve the sensing and using ccdB and Colicin to achieve the killing. Furthermore, we used the capacity monitor to assess the resource occupied by our device, and optimized our device.
Lethal Gene
As we mentioned in the project description, the major problem of biosafety leakage is the spread of recombinant DNA to the environment, so this project we are mainly focused on Nuclease. From the parts registry, we found NucA/B, Colicin E9, and miniColicin E2. We found that miniColicin E2 is well documented by TU Darmstadt 2016, so we chose it as our lethal gene. Also, we found a nuclease from Bacteriophage which is reported as high efficiency at 65 degree Celsius. Moreover, we considered EndoG, derived from mammalian Caspase-independent apoptosis pathway, which we believe it is far in homology may lead to a reduced possibility of evolution of inhibitor.
For Fermenter
1 Thermal Sensitive Regulator
When constructing a “fail-safe” device for a known condition but unknown timing incident, any chemical inducer that needed to be added manually should not be considered. Then, as the temperature is usually being set to a certain level in a fermenter, as the engineered bacteria escaped from the fermenter, changes in temperature can be detected. So, the thermal regulator came to our site. From part registry, we found thermal sensitive transcriptional factors which can initiate the transcription when the temperature reaches above a certain level. Bacteriophage’s cl repressor are commonly used, and the tlpA system came out in 2017. ETH Zurich was using tlpA’s original version, and NUS Singapore was using the modified version, TlpA36, which ought to be initiated at 36 degree Celsius. We choose TlpA36 since the original version showed bit intensive leakage at the temperature"
Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," the control of the T7 promoter which is both constitutive and leads to very strong expression. In turn, this sequence is flanked by a set of three strong, naturally occurring terminators from a library characterized by Chen and colleagues (12).
The first of these, ECK120033737, is upstream and serves to prevent any read-through by a polymerase starting before the T7 when the sequence is inserted into a plasmid. Downstream, another pair of terminators, ECK120029600, and ECK120033736, serve to terminate transcription of the merRNA and prevent read-through by a polymerase moving along the reverse strand, and generating reverse-complementary RNA that would base pair with the merRNA and cancel out its effects, respectively. It should be noted that this last, reverse-oriented terminator may be superfluous in most cases, but was necessary for our application as we chose to place the fragment into LITMUS28i which has opposing T7 promoters. It is also likely that the merRNA is self-terminating due to the presence of a poly-U intrinsic terminator. Sites for PstI and BamHI were added to each end of this design in order to facilitate insertion into a plasmid. The resulting 686 base pair sequence was then synthesized by GenScript.
Our initial goal was to express this fragment in bacteria and spread it using M13 bacteriophage. As such, we chose LITMUS28i-I716104 as our vector. This plasmid contains the original NEB LITMUS28i phagemid backbone and a GTG-starting T7 polymerase which itself is under the control of a T7 promoter. Leaky transcription at this T7 promoter starts expression of the T7 RNA polymerase. The plasmid was generated by Dr. Monica Ortiz of the Endy group who shared it with us for use in our project.
Our synthetic DNA and the plasmid were digested with PstI and BamHI and ligated together to form the construct with which all of our biofilm experiments were run. The plasmid was then transformed into TSS competent E. coli JM109 and maintained via ampicillin selection. The plasmid was also transformed into E. coli ZK1056 provided to us by the Kolter group at Harvard Medical School. ZK1056 is a known biofilm-forming strain and its characteristics have been widely studied. In addition to these modifications, we also transformed the two strains with LITMUS28i-I716104.

Upon illumination with red light, Phytochrome binds to the tetR-PIF6 complex. VP16 is now located in close proximity to the minimal promoter, which enables the RNA-polymerase-2 to start transcription of the gene of interest.
We designed a promoter part for the Dueber toolbox which consists of tetO and the minimal promoter region. This can be used as a promoter in a level 1 ligation for any desired gene of interest (a GFP-tagged Pex11 in our example).

Design Rules For Genome Engineering Regarding Customization of Peroxisome Properties
In order to reach the ultimate goal of creating a fully controllable artificial compartment, genome engineering can be utilized for customizing the compartment's properties,.These include aspects such as membrane permeability, size/number, or decoupling of peroxisomes from the cytoskeleton, the peroxisomal proteome or metabolome. In our project we used the Crispr Cas9 system for knocking out several genes (Pex9, Pex31&Pex32, INP1, POT1) at the same time in order to engineer the previously mentioned properties. Furthermore, we designed a yeast strain  with a completely replaced protein-import machinery for controlling the entire peroxisomal lumen.
For the future one could think of much more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering with a final goal of a “minimal peroxisome” by redirecting metabolic pathways through changing the protein-localization-signal in the yeast genome. Additionally, endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment for establishing a customized metabolism specifically tailored for the user's application.
Introduction
In order to achieve a fully controllable artificial compartment, the first step was to design a completely orthogonal import system. Next was the knockout of endogenous import systems. However, a few proteins are imported neither by the P"

For the engineering of a Cry toxin specific for V. destructor, we used the Cry3Aa toxin as a starting point. This Cry toxin consists of three domains, off which one is responsible for binding. Rajamohan et al. (1996) demonstrated that mutations in the binding sites of Cry toxins can both decrease and enhance the specificity of a toxin towards its target organism 3 . Three putative binding sites have been identified after analysing the 3D structure of the binding domain of Cry3Aa. These putative sites were changed with random mutagenesis, and the adapted proteins were cloned into Escherichia coli. 144 Cry proteins were produced and tested for activity on BBMV's from V. destructor as described previously. After initial testing, 24 candidates were selected for further testing. The results are shown in Figure 2.  It can be concluded that the third binding site, consisting of amino acids 410-416, is a good candidate for future engineering and specificity adaptation of this particular Cry toxin. Toxins Cry3.3.3 and Cry3.3.7 should not be taken into account due to their highly deviating reaction speeds.This leaves us with one proper candidate – the toxin mutant Cry3.3.5.

Phage display was performed in order to find specific motifs for binding to Varroa gut-membrane receptors. Phages (filamentous bacteriophage M13) with a binding motif (The Ph.D.™-12 Phage Display Peptide Library) on their exterior were exposed to the gut membrane of V. destructor by feeding the phages to Varroa mites. Subsequently, we isolated and sequenced the recovered phages. The consensus sequence of the binding motif of the 12-mer is shown in Figure 3.

Collaboration with ZJU
This year, we cooperated with Zhejiang University in microbial suicide regulation. The project of ZTU this year will use microbial toxins in termite control and prevention, though how to improve strain safety become a important subject. However, one important part of our project is delayed suicide of  microorganisms, so, in the hope of improving safety of their experiments, we provide them a complete regulatory suicide circuit, along which we also provide the detailed data of promotor's inducing expression intensity.
Collaboration with SJTU
This year, SJTU_Software build a biobrick selection assist system based on empirical algorithm. This system can generalize the heat map of different splicing pattern, based on the history record of its splicing sequence in the database, and provide a experiential score to the user. Experiential score is a score that not associated to certain experiment, so a specific situation is needed, which means it grades the results under different experiment condition.
We cooperate with SJTU_Software on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would set up multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components. These groups are comparable between their designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of our project, and the data extracted from which would meet SJTU_Software’s needs.
Through our cooperation, they can grade our experiment results, then the scores would be compared to our evaluation. To SJTU_Software, the comparison of our experiment results and the design of our plasmids' construction is a case which can directly evaluate their software. And it is also meaningful for us to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve our future experiments.

SYSU-MEDICINE
We hypothesized that the EGF (epidermal growth factor) produced by our engineered bacteria can be a therapeutic molecule for IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). To test this in an animal model, we collaborated with another iGEM team, SYSU-MEDICINE, who decided to apply mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy to cure IBD. We therefore purified human EGF proteins from bacteria and sent them to SYSU-MEDICINE team, who can evaluate whether our hEGF can be effective in treating IBD in their mice model. Both teams were excited to find that hEGF can significantly alleviate several IBD symptoms. Reference can be seen in wiki of SYSU-MEDICINE .
The detailed procedures are described in the following:
Purification of hEGF
To facilitate protein purification, we engineered a His-tag in the C-terminal of hEGF (Fig. 1A). A string of the string of histidine residues (6x His-tag) binds to several types of immobilized metal ions, such as nickel, under specific buffer conditions. In addition, anti-His-tag antibodies are commercially available for detection of target protein by western blot. In either case, the tag provides a means of specifically purifying or detecting the recombinant protein without a protein-specific antibody.

As mentioned above, SBML uses ASTNode(binary tree) to store the formulas, we still need to find a solution for connecting between the binary tree and calculation, considering of the rename part of WriteSBMLFile. in-order traversing binary tree seems the best way to measure this problem. The function ""getformula""; ""judge_opreator"" and ""output"" are used to accomplish the traversal work. The output of the function ""getformula"" is the value of the formula based on the initial amounts of all the variables.
Assitant Input Plug-ins
In order to simplify the input procedure of the data file describing time course which sometimes gets really redundant, we also program a small .exe file to help convert *.bmp file to *.dat file based on following assumptions.
The x-axis and y-axis are already unified to the range [0,1], while any other range could be realized by multiple additional factors on the unified range.
The program will only identify black pixels on the picture, and for any given x value, the y value is decided by the average of all existing points corresponding to that same x value.
Color depth sould be no less than 8 bits.
Sampling step length is determined by 1 divided by the horizontal pixel numbers.
Following is a small demo of this tool.
Arbitrarily draw a curve in painting tools under windows xp
There are definitely quite a lot to improve, including
1.Rescale-able range of x-axis and y-axis
2.User designated step length
3.Function of ‘smoothing’
4.Identify the curve based on contrast rather than requiring the effective pixel to be black.

Medal Criteria
Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
To complete for the gold medal criterion #3, please describe your work on this page and fill out the description on your judging form . To achieve this medal criterion, you must convince the judges that your team has gained insight into your project from modeling. You may not convince the judges if your model does not have an effect on your project design or implementation.
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
Best Model Special Prize
To compete for the Best Model prize , please describe your work on this page  and also fill out the description on the judging form . Please note you can compete for both the gold medal criterion #3 and the best model prize with this page.

Zinc finger nuclease enters clinical trials
Sangamo and University of Pennsylvania begin clinical trials with a zinc finger nuclease designed to target the CCR5 gene and inhibit HIV. Success of this therapeutic could prove a significant advance for gene therapy.
Context-dependency improves open-source zinc finger engineering
Keith Joung publishes tables of zinc finger binding sites that account for context-dependent effects and can be rearranged to form custom zinc finger proteins that bind to a variety of DNA sequences. This greatly increases the ease of engineering novel zinc fingers based on the structures of previously characterized zinc fingers.
Harvard iGEM develops a novel method to engineer custom zinc fingers
Using novel integration of existing technologies, we have developed a rapid, comparatively low-cost, open source method for making thousands of custom zinc fingers by integrating MAGE, lambda red, and chip-based synthesis technologies. Our work greatly increases the ease of access to zinc finger technology for researchers worldwide.

The sources of the raw materials are registered by the federal agency of agriculture and nutrition, please read the according report.
Certifications are required by law. 100% of the raw material is certified. These requirements have existed in the EU since 2011.
What is your opinion on RSPO?
For biofuels the standard RSPO certification is not enough. Only certifications that are approved by the EU commission are allowed. There is a RSPO EU system with different requirements than the standard RSPO system. This can be used, as it fulfils the requirements by the EU. In this system, the criteria are not determined by stakeholders but by European law.
How will the use of palm oil in the production of biofuel change in the future in your opinion?
The EU orders that the use of palm oil will be capped by 2019 to 2023 and then phased out. In this respect, my personal opinion is irrelevant, as everything is regulated by law.
Do you have any concerns regarding the use of palm oil?
Not within biofuel production, as 100% of the palm oil is certified and isn’t sourced from rainforest or other areas deserving protection. For other applications there aren’t certifications required by law - in my opinion, this gap needs to be closed in order to be sustainable.
What is your opinion on genetic engineering?
The VDB has no position on this topic. Personally, I think that genetic engineering is demonized in the public and thereby a lot of opportunities get missed. Similar to the debate about biofuels, many NGOs unfortunately antagonize genetic engineering, even if it could help solving many problems.
Interview with Jürgen Marchart from FFoQSI (shortened version)
Would you introduce yourself and your organization, please?
My name is Jürgen Marchart, I’m managing director of FFoQSI (Feed and Food Quality Safety and Innovation), which is a so called “comet-centre”, partly financed by private corporations of the feed and food sector. We carry out cooperative research projects between companies and academic institutions in all sectors of the food a feed value creation chain. We’ve existed for 1,5 years and have 40 employees, so we are on full extension and have approached our scientific research.
How does your project investigate the matter of palm (kernel) oil?
Actually, there is no running research project to this topic, but everybody’s talking about it. We haven’t got any requests by our partners, so we focus on other projects, but economically and ecologically it’s an important part of discussion.

CRISPRi technology is based on interference of sequence-specific repression of gene. dCas9 and sgRNA are two components of this technique. Integration of dCas9 and sgRNA binds to RNA polymerase binding site and blocks the transcription.
First step of AND gate is based on inhibition of  llac promoter. pllac/ara1 is inhibited, unless arabinose is present in the environment. When arabinose is present, promoter  pllac/ara1  is cleared and transcription factor 1 [TF 1]  and transcription factor 2 [TF 2] can be expressed. Secondly, if first volatile organic compound [VOC1] is present in the environment, TF 1 and VOC1 activates  target promoter [P1] to produce sgRNA. The produced TF 2 can activate the other target promoter [P2] if and only if second volatile organic compound  [VOC2]   is present in the environment. When present, they activate P2  and dCas9 production.  CRISPRi technology is used in the final step. Since lacI is produced under the constitutively active promoter, promoter pllaco is always inhibited, unless IPTG is added into the environment. To inhibit the expression of lacI, produced sgRNA and dCas9 now come together and block  lacI gene expression  that activates the sequence of pllaco, thus enable sfGFP production, which is the output. There are 3 different VOC types in lung, breast and colorectal cancer. Two of them are going to be chosen by comparing their efficiency. Best two VOCs are going to be integrated into AND gate, according to  VOC induxtion experiment results. Since prostate cancer is indicated by 2 VOC types, toluene and formaldehyde, transcription factors  which recognize these VOCs are going to be directly integrated AND gate.

AlkR
Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 is bacterium that can utilize alkane chains from dodecane to octadecane as a carbon source. This degradation depends at least in five genes. It has been found that AlkR, a AraC-XylS like transcription factor regulator regulates the transcription of AlkM, gene coding for alkane hydroxylase. AlkR, when coupled with an appropriate alkane, activates transcription"

""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
This year, Team Fudan-CHINA is participating in the fifth iGEM interlab study to determine correlation between fluorescence protein expression, cell absorbance and cell density.
Materials:
-iGEM Measurement Kit
-test plasmids delivered in Part Distribution Kit Plates
-self-made competent E.coli DH5α strain
-Bio-Tek Cystation plate reader
-Commonly used laboratory consumables
Calibration #1 – OD600 reference
LUDOX sample was prepared according to the interlab protocol of which OD600 and Abs600 was read through plate reader to establish a transformation of absorbance raw data into OD600 measurements. Path length fixation was turned off during this and every following test.
Figure 1.1: OD600 reference
Calibration #2 – Absorbance standard curve
Serial dilution of silica beads was prepared on a 96 well plate according to the interlab protocol and Abs600 of each well was tested. An absorbance curve was generated using those data collected which seemed to partly deviate from a strict linear relationship. This should result from pipetting errors.
Figure 1.2: absorbance standard curve
Calibration#3 – fluorescence standard curve
Serial dilution of standard fluorescein was prepared according to the interlab protocol and fluorescence of each well was tested under the condition of 485nm excitation and 528nm emission. Measurement gain was tuned to 50 to keep readings under OVERFLOW and was maintained during following tests.
Figure 1.3: fluorescence standard curve
Cell measurement
Each test plasmid was transformed into E.coli DH5α and single colony obtained on the plate. 2 colonies was picked and cultivated in 5mL LB medium + Chl overnight. Samples of 0hr and 6hr of incubation was prepared according to interlab protocol. Please be noted that cultures were diluted to Abs600 0."

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Human Practices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," the students favoured a research institution to be built.
UCL iGEM x Sutton Trust summer school - biosciences stream
This summer school is based at UCL and formed part of our outreach activities since it is aimed at students from widening participation backgrounds. Abbie worked closely with the students and lead a group of 5, year 12 students.
This involved demonstrating various lab activities from basic pipetting to performing restriction digests and running gel electrophoresis. We also performed an activity which looked at the bacteria on skin before and after washing hands, the effectiveness of chemicals on killing bacteria and even gram stained these, looking under them at a microscope. A lot of the experiments were new to the students so it was essential to explain the techniques and assist throughout.
It was also an opportunity to give advice about university and share our own personal experiences.
Amandeep and Abbie also gave a lecture on iGEM, synthetic biology and ageing. Afterwards we ran a workshop and debate with regards to synthetic biology and ageing research as before to the 30 students on the stream. We really enjoy this activity due to the consideration of ethics, economics and personal experiences.
Some highlights have been collated in the video.
""Get your hands dirty with synthbio"" workshop for PhD students
London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme (LIDo) funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) is a PhD programme with a particular focus on interdisciplinary research. It is currently attended by about a hundred students studying at UCL, King's College London, Royal Veterinary College, Birkbeck, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary.
During LIDo retreat, we run a synthetic biology workshop for both students and staff involved in the programme. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the programme, we prepared a wide range of activities for researchers from all backgrounds. For those unfamiliar with synthetic biology, we prepared mini-posters describing ways in which it can be used to solve some of the world's biggest problems. We talked about the Braunschweig 2014 team's E. cowli, which help to reduce the amount of methane produced by cows and thus prevent the global warming, about plastic-degrading bacteria designed by Imperial College 2013 team, biofuel-producing bacteria created by the University of Washington 2011 team and about University of Colorado Boulder 2014 team's idea on how to use phages to fight antibiotic resistance. The attendants were also encouraged to propose their own ideas and discuss related scientific and ethical issues, business viability of the idea and its impact on the society.

Project Overview
Motivation
Biosensors have a wide range of applications, but for many of those applications there already exists a machine that can do a better job than our engineered bacteria. One of the biggest liabilities in using a biological system is the time associated with getting the desired information. Cells have to metabolize the desired chemical, alter gene expression, and accumulate enough protein in order to produce a measurable output.

In the graph to the left, it takes on the order of 2-3 hours before a LuxR based GFP reporter reaches maximum signal. We designed our system based on the prediction that waiting for dimerization is a lot faster than waiting for transcription, translation, and protein accumulation.
An added benefit to designing our system with TraR to fluoresce independent of TraR's ability to regulate genes is that TraR does not activate transcription in E. coli. In a paper published in 2009 by Qin et. al. they show that TraR is unable to recruit E. coli's native RNA polymerase. It has been shown in another paper , however, that TraR does fold properly into monomers and will dimerize in the presence of its autoinducer in E. coli. So this system, as we've designed it, will be the first to use TraR in a fluorescence based biosensor in E. coli since it does not require TraR to active transcription but only to fold correctly and dimerize.
Design Considerations
Plasmids provided by Dr. Regan from Yale
We decided to first make the fusions in the plasmids provided by Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale. By choosing this method, we were able to use the provided controls in testing our part. Here is a paper detailing the plasmids.
The pET11a plasmid is under control of T7 polymerase, so we used Bl21(DE3) E. coli cells which have an IPTG-inducible copy of the polymerase on their chromosome.
The designed fusion into pET11a was compatible with the TraR sequence, but the pMRBAD fusion was not. The pMRBAD fusion was designed to use NcoI and AatII, but TraR had two AatII sites in the coding sequence. We instead cloned TraR in-between the NcoI and Sph1 sites. This added two amino acids to the linker"

Introduction
We establish two RFC (Request for Comments) documents this year. They are the basis of the Circuit+ database. We tried our best to make the definition of a genetic circuit, especially for those that contain some logical regulatory modules like genetic AND gate. As a result, a genetic circuit is well defined and the relations of individual part in circuit can be definitely clear.
RFC 101: Logic Gene Module Standard
Browse RFC 101
The first technique standard, RFC 101: Logic Gene Module Standard, gives the definition of a logic gene module. This is a very important part of genetic circuit in Synthetic Biology fields. And the logical relations in genes and electric circuit can be seen as the original idea of synthetic biology. We’ve noticed that many gene circuits that were mentioned in previous iGEM projects lacked of a logic module description. They didn’t pay attention to the concept of a logical device and simply constructed their circuits. We built up the standard for promoting the concept of logic functional modules in genetic circuits that are corresponding to the concept in electronics.
RFC 97: Genetic Circuit Standard (version_2.0)
Browse RFC 97
The second technical standard, RFC97: Genetic Circuit Standard (version 2.0), gives a more detailed and normative definition of a genetic circuit. A logic genetic circuit has a higher level than a gene device. In order to make this definition, we firstly define coding-frame. A coding-frame is a DNA sequence which has at least one RBS, at least one promoter, at least one protein domain, at least one terminator. A genetic circuit contains one or more than one coding-frames and can consist one or more than one plasmids. It can be regulated in many different pathways. It can accept various input signals followed by giving various output signals. Most importantly. In this RFC, we also give a standard format to record"
Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," their wiki page that they did not test whether their INPNC-HA parts can be detected through HA tag if passenger proteins are placed downstream. We tested whether our His tag can be used for the full length detection of fusion proteins with passenger proteins. We used whole cell Western blotting using anti-His tag antibody for this purpose.
Fig8 Whole cell Western blotting using anti-His tag antibody.
Marker, Negative Control( BBa_K165002 ), BclA-His-scFv(33 kDa), INPNC-His-scFv(63 kDa), BclA-His-CBDcex(17 kDa), INPNC-His-CBDcex(47 kDa), Positive Control( BBa_K875004 )(43 kDa)
Whole cell lysates were prepared from E. coli DH5alpha strain carrying various plasmids shown in the figure. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. His tag proteins were visualized by anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (clone #OGHis, MBL, Japan).
Bands corresponding to INPNC-His-scFv (63 kDa) and INPNC-His-CBDcex (47 kDa) in their respective lanes were observed, which confirms expression of the fusion proteins. We also observed that BclA-His-scFv band (lane 3) was much smaller than the expected size (33 kDa). This may suggest that the protein coded by this plasmid may be prone to intracellular cleavage. From these results, we concluded our INPNC-His-(passenger protein) and BclA-His-(passenger protein) can be detected with anti-His tag antibody, and we eliminated the need to use individual antibodies for passenger proteins when using our INPNC-His or BclA-His surface expression modules.
4) INPNC-His and BclA-His can be purified using nickel columns that specifically bind to His tag, regardless of the passenger proteins placed downstream
We then examined if the proteins' His tag can be used for pulldown under denaturing conditions by nickel beads. We tested this property by purifying INPNC-His-(passenger protein) and BclA-His-(passenger protein) from the membrane fraction of the cell, using Nickel Sepharose beads (GE) affinity purification. We prepared the membrane fraction from the E. coli lysate by ultracentrifugation, and solubilized them using 7M guan"
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Regulatory sytems_-_-_TEXT.html," transcription through termination signals located downstream of the early genes.
The nut-site plays an important role in anti-termination as it promotes the formation of an anti-termination complex on the nascent mRNA, consisting of the lambda N protein and four E. coli proteins, NusA, NusB, NusE and NusG. The nut-site is made up of regions, the conserved boxA region and the variable boxB region.   NusA and the N protein is necessary for anti-termination effect. NusA native to e-coli binds to the spacer region, between boxA and boxB, and the N protein binds to boxB. NusA has a 50% greater affinity for nutL, found downstream of the pL promoter, compared to nutR, found downstream of the pR promoter. This mode of anti-termination is also found in other lambda-related phages such as P21 and P22. Under normal conditions, these N analog proteins show specificity for nut-sites of the respective phages, but this specificity is lost when the N proteins are overexpressed.
Figure 3: The anti-termination complex is illustrated. The anti-termination complex consists of RNA-polymerase, the hosts proteins, NusA, NusB, NusE and NusG and (Burmann et.al. 2010).
Expression of the Q protein is observed as a result of the anti-termination by the N protein during transcription from the pR promoter. Q is another protein that is capable of causing anti-termination. However, unlike the N-protein, it prevents termination of transcription by the binding to DNA sequences just upstream of the late pR' promoter, resulting in transcription of the late genes.
Few papers describe and test the distance between the nut-site and the termination steam loop. NusA and N have been found to be sufficient for anti-termination under in vitro conditions, however, N is unable of singularly inducing anti-termination. In the tested construct, nutL was placed 200nt upstream of the lambda right terminator (Whalen et.al.1988). The required distance between boxB, within the nut-site, to the terminator stem loop has yet to be determined but it was placed 26 bp from the beginning of the terminator stem loop.

SAFETY
Our lab at TAS is classified as Biosafety Level 1, which means the lab uses microbes that pose little to no risk to healthy individuals. Hazardous chemicals and solutions are used at a minimal level and in well ventilated areas such as fume hoods in the TAS research lab. For instance, we do not use EtBr for gel electrophoresis. Instead, we use a safer nucleic acid stain called Seeing Safe DNA Dye. Nevertheless, all chemicals and solutions are still treated with all due respect, care, and caution. MSDS are stored on our lab computers and in a folder on the lab technician's desk.
We work with a safe and common lab strain, E. coli K-12 (DH5alpha), and follow safety rules set by our lab instructor. We have our own biosafety committee, which consists of three research teachers Dr. Teresa Chiang, Mr. Jude Clapper, and Mr. Alex Dezieck. They oversee proper work area conditions by checking on disposal of Petri dishes and liquid wastes, sanitation, and teaching proper laboratory techniques. Our guidelines, taken from National Yang-Ming University's Center of Environmental Protection and Safety, cover many safety rules and procedures ranging from lab specific rules to behaviour. For example, we prohibit food, open-toed shoes and drinks in the lab. We also have a thorough clean up procedure. For example, we have waste bins for used tips, which are autoclaved before disposal, and liquid wastes are bleached. Nanoparticle (NP) waste is carefully packaged and then sent to a disposal facility to ensure no hazardous materials are mismanaged.
In Taiwan, there are many laws and regulations regarding biosafety in research labs. These can be found in the National Yang-Ming University's Center of Environmental Protection and Safety and Health page linked here .  Guidelines can be found here .

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," in a controlled space.
In light of these ideas, we spent much of the first half of the Easter term reading around reversed electron flow. However, although Shewy is a biochemically challenging and interesting project, further research showed that it might need a lot of work if we were to render it into synthetic biology. It seemed that at least a hundred enzymes were involved in the reduction of oxygen, we needed to know inputs and outputs of various complexes, and should develop a way to specifically relate the project with engineering aspect crucial to synthetic biology. While these discussions were ongoing, Leon found a research group that had been working on a similar project and whose funding has been reduced to zero. Having done lots of research without making a lot of progress, we decided that it could take longer than this summer to narrow down the project, let alone do the lab work required.
Our Shewy space travel nose-dived in a meeting we had at the start of March, during which we realised we needed to take a step back and reassess our original ideas. George had previously worked in a clinic treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) and drew everyone's attention to how significant a problem they are. UTIs are caused by uropathogenic bacteria that invade the cells lining the bladder and form biofilms. It was here that our focus turned, particularly as this was in accordance with our survey results and linked in well with the microbiome topic that had been popular previously. This meeting marked a change of direction for our project, meaning we had to return straight back to the drawing board. We were then faced with the question:
How could synthetic biology be used to better solve a problem that science and medicine is currently failing to address?
A BACKSTORY
Bacteria do mean business; however, before there was any notion of what business this may be and how we could incorporate it into our project, we first had to establish a team. Last year, the Oxford iGEM team had to set up everything from scratch as the University had never entered the competition before. Their project did very well, winning them a gold medal in Boston. It was last year's team which began the process of starting iGEM 2015. Once they had sparked interest, they set up some preliminary meetings so that we could start to finalise a team, and come up with a strategy for what we would do over the Christmas vacation.
During the vacation, we surveyed the general public so that we could find out their opinions on synthetic biology, what we could do to improve its profile, and how they wanted synthetic biology to help them. The responses we"

Calgary riboregulator page
Abstract: Calgary 2007 wanted to design and build a biomechanical printer. The printer composed of a two dimensional plotter equipped with a red laser. The plotter would receive instruction from a software that can translate computer images into instructions. E. coli would respond to the laser light. The red laser light would trigger the expression of beta-agarase enzyme which can degrade the agar polymer that cell rest on. This would produce “bacterial lithography”, where the E. coli exposed to red laser light would dissolved that agar and form a picture.
For Calgary 2007’s project to work, they needed a precise control of the gene of interest. To have such control, they decided to use the riboregulator system to prevent accidental expression of gene of interest.

Schematic representation of Caltech 2007’s project design regulation
Abstract: Caltech 2007 wanted to engineer viruses to selectively kill or modify specific subpopulation of target cells, based on their RNA or protein expression profiles. To prove the concept, they decided to use bacteriophage λ and E. coli. Caltech 2007 tried to engineer a bacteriophage λ to target and lyse specific subpopulations of E. coli. In their design, the developmental genes of the virus essential for virus infection and survival are regulated by cis-repressing RNA (lock). Only the target E.coli contain the trans-activating RNA (key) to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes. Once the genes are activated, the target cells will go through the lysis process. Meanwhile, non-target cells won’t be affected by the virus because the non-target cells lack the key to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes.

Secondly, we underwent various steps towards the utilization of different media including the EnPresso medium system with gradual and continuous glucose supply. Interestingly, and in contrary to the known behavior of V. natriegens under anaerobic condition, the pH levels showed a steep increase with the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen. The pH became increasingly alkaline until the value went out of the measurement range of the employed chemosensors.
Figure 2: Normal growth conditions
Observed changes in dissolved oxygen and pH levels in normal growth medium without baffled flasks.
Concerns arose that the chemosensor might be incompatible with the secreted products of the organism. However, after normalization of oxygen in the test tube, the pH downregulated itself diminishing such fears.
Considering the continued although slower growth of V.natriegens under alkaline conditions, its resilience across a broad pH range might render the organism suitable to develop pH resistant strain. Such an engineered organism would be useable for metabolic engineering processes in laboratories unable to constantly regulate the pH-levels in medium. We deduced that the high pH-level might stem from the production of ammonia and other amine products.
To countermeasure the depletion of oxygen we investigated the effect of a baffled flask and the in vitro controlled medium conditions created by of EnPresso B tabs. We also switched to this medium to investigate the eligibility of V. natriegens for even higher growth density which is crucial for higher product yield, especially for proteins as targets in the pharma industry.
The results in figure XY clearly show that we could efficiently stabilize the growth conditions for V. natriegens with EnPresso and baffled flasks are sufficient enough to maintain the needed high oxygen levels.
More importantly, the optical density increased to 25 which is an outstanding sixty percent boost compared to our measured top OD with 14 further proving the potential scale-up possibilities when adapting V. natriegens as a production host. The increased cell densities of V. natriegens in combination with EnPresso support suggestions we obtained from Karsten Shürrle (DECHEMA) to consider the emphasize of yield over time when profitably running a white bioreactor.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html,"ologist. That way, I shared with the team my own system of  references, they were able to know through what “regard” I appreciated their words and reflexions.
After that talks, and in keeping with the IGEM' spirit, I decided to fill the ethical part of our wiki with an abstract of the discussion blended with my analysis on them. These posts had the form of blog's posts, as a individual, local and situated analysis. This report is more formal, but I propose it to be read in parallel with those informal posts. Both of these types of writing were important to the process of creating a dynamic reflexion of the ethics of synthetic biology. While formal essays are still valuable as a way to express our analysis of any topic, social studies sometimes miss the advantages of informal reflexion (fluidity, experimentation in the writing process, different kind of discourses, vocabulary or lexicon). Both styles were a good exercise, permitting me to scour, to search different ways to explore and uncover the stakes of synthetic biology.
Introduction
Synthetic biology is a young branch of contemporary biology, which aims to design functional modules in an organism, taking the advantages of different methods to develop the capacity of that organism to “do” and to “be” something new, something that isn't naturally in its own capacity. Synthetic biology  embodies the meeting of two assembled elements : the manipulation of  organisms modified by man (technologies already developed by molecular biology) and an engineering approach through the aim of standardization.
By using an engineering approach, synthetic biologists hope to discover underlying design principles in genetic networks and to develop new standards for how biologists manipulate genes. Tim Gardner and Jim Collins' biological toggle switch is a good example of this engineering approach. Using simple, standardizable genetic modules, they were able to build a switch in E coli  that controls its behavior. Thus, knowledge from genetics is transformed to work for engineering purposes. Through standardization, it is hoped that discoveries and progress in synthetic biology will be usable at a large scale, will be included in a common reference and could create a harmonious and protocolar ensemble.
The emergence of a new discipline, of new forms of knowledge, new sets of practices and handling is “socially” accompanied by new discourses, tales, hopes, anguishes, etc. That new “whole” will have built-in stakes, references and paradigms that affect our regard of the world. Our reflexion is about ethics in synthetic biology. Thus, we will poll, question those hopes, anguishes and promises linked to that new discipline in that ethical"

Investigation
Interview of fishery retailer
Interviewer: iGEM team member
Interviewee: a fishery retailer
Q: Have you heard of artificial reefs?
A: Yes, there are some of them in the neighbor sea! They are some rocks sank into the water to attract fish and plants and restore the ecology system.
Q: We are planning to build artificial reefs with synthetic biology technology now. It means using microorganisms to gather the sand and make it looks like reefs. What’s your opinion on this method?
A: Let me tell you the truth. Fishermen always focus on economic benefits! If you can’t show them the effect within short time, they may not cooperate. They are not familiar with the idea of artificial reefs or synthetic biology, so it’s hard to talk them into long-term maintenance!
Q: Yes, we understand. We also found that fishermen have very limited knowledge about artificial reef. What do you think the reason might be?
A: Actually the fishermen are not very well educated. And the former knowledge popularizations can’t cover all of them. So it’s important to convince them that this technology is useful and will bring more benefits to them!
Interviewing a fishery retailer.
We also randomly interviewed some fishermen, practitioner and local residents.
Fishermen
Willing to have a try with synthetic biology technology; hope to see the effect within short time.
Practitioner
Understand the importance of artificial reefs, willing to try synthetic biology methods; suggest conducting knowledge popularizations and reinforcing the management.
Local residents
Have learnt about the technology before, willing to offer help in the building of artificial reefs.
What we found in our investigation is the determination of Chinese government in marine ecological restoration and the public’s wishes to improve the living environment. But due to economical pressure and lack of scientific knowledge, some fishermen and practitioners still have doubts about the new technologies. In our field trip, we introduced some basic knowledge and its potential ecological and economical effect to local people and fishermen. It reduced some fishermen’s doubts and they began to hold positive attitude to the application of new technologies.
Discussion
Coming back from the field practice, our team members had thought a lot about the development of synthetic biology. In China, synthetic biology is still a novel technology that is not familiar to people. The public knows little about its use in environment protection, medicine, and engineering. And even in interdisciplinary studies, scientists generally focus on filtering dominant species and improving the conditions of strains domestication and little of their research involves integrating favorable properties of different species by means of synthetic biology. Thus, it’s meaningful to spread"

Yeast expression: Pelletizing 18 h after expression induction and cell lysis
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to pellet the 1.67 l cell suspension 18 h after expression induction and to wash the pellet with breaking buffer. Then the cells were lysed using glass beads.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 of the suspensions was determined:
CaXMT1: 0.424
CaMXMT1: 0.384
CaDXMT1: 0.516
The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 25 minutes at 4°C. Afterwards the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml breaking buffer without PMSF. The cells were centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 25 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 13-14 ml breaking buffer with PMSF for the cell lysis. An equal amount of glass beads solved in breaking buffer were added and the cell supsensions were votexed and stored on ice each for 30 seconds. This two steps were repeated 30 times. Then the suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored and the beads were washed again in 5 ml breaking buffer with PMSF and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. 1 ml was stored at - 80 °C for enzymatic analysis. And the rest was used for dialysis and purification for detection of all three enzymes via LCMS.
