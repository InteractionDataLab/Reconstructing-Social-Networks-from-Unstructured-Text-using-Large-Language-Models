Results
In none of the cells with either the K568000 or the K322127 lacZ could be detected.
possible improvements for further experiments:
make sure, the cells are in log phase, diluting down earlier, e.g. at a OD600 of about 0.7, however cells shouldn't be in lag phase after 210 min, so at least the last values represent lacZ expression in log phase

Steps for Usage:
Step 1: Take your own urine (a drop) and drop it onto a glass slide and leave it at room                         temperature for 40 minutes.
Step 2: Rinse the glass slide with water and blow dry with a fan or blower.
Step 3: The glass slide is placed on the liquid crystal cell to complete the assembly of the test                         chip.
Step 4: Insert the test chip into the middle of the kit.
Step 5: Use ordinary light (the light of the mobile phone) to illuminate the polarizer above the                         kit. If you can see the color of the light indicating that there is excessive β2-MG                         in the                         urine, the patient should go to the hospital for further physical examination. Only black images                         or sporadic bright spots can be seen, indicating that the patient is in good health.
Step 6: After taking the observed image with a mobile phone, use our own software to process the                         image, and you can get the grayscale analysis result of the image and the current β2-MG                         content                         in the urine.
Step 7: Just replace the disposable piece of glass when you need to use it again.
Precautions:
After the urine is added, the glass slide should be placed for at least 40 minutes;
When using a hair dryer to dry the glass slide, use a cold wind file, and pay attention that                             the wind cannot be too large.
The Second Generation of Dr. Familict
Structure:
In order to further improve the user-friendliness of the products and enable patients to obtain a                         more convenient product experience, we proposed an improved version of the product design based                         on the first-generation product design. The operation of the second generation of Dr. Familict                         kit is semi-automated and its size is 20 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm. It consists mainly of a                         slide slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste collector, a liquid crystal cell, a polarizer and an                         analyzer. The antigen-antibody reaction is still carried out on the slide, and the slide is                         moved to the slide position by sliding positioning. Different reaction chambers are used to                         complete the operations of dropping antibody, dropping liquid crystal, rinsing, and image                         observation, etc.
Steps for Usage:
Step 1: Insert the antigen-coated glass slide into the slide slot, and the kit system                         automatically drops a drop of the antibody solution.
Step 2: The user drops a drop of urine in"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," we will shortly discuss the potential of our detection method in the equestrian sports, motivated by the topics above. The threat of gene doping is real in equestrian sports ( Chesser, 2018 ) and no detection method is currently in place ( Wilkin et al, 2017 ). A continued ban of gene doping is highly probable based on the anti-doping values in equestrian sports. Adapting ADOPE to fit within the equestrian anti-doping policies is fairly uncomplicated. The current model gene EPO will need to be changed to a gene more relevant in horse physiology, which is what our versatile detection method was developed to do. The detection window analysis will need to be adapted to the new target genes. Our method is a good match to the equestrian anti-doping policies due to our fast result, stemming from our targeted sequencing approach. The distinction we make in an inexpensive and fast pre-screen and more expensive, highly precise screen fits well within the A-B sample method in equestrian testing. Our approach of complete transparency fits with the core values of the sport, ensuring that the dream of horseracing remains intact.
Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin
We initially visited Dutch National Bloodbank Saunquin to learn more about our sample preparation method, and there met Ms Aïcha Ait Soussan, who’s main research interest is fetal DNA in maternal plasma. When discussing our detection method with her and her colleagues Onno Verhagen and Professor Ellen (C. E.) van der Schoot from the experimental immunohematology department, it became apparent that they are struggling with many of the same problems in isolating fetal DNA from the mother blood as were are with isolating gene doping DNA from an athletes blood. They are both present in only little amounts compared to an enormous background of genomic DNA. A targeted sequencing approach as we are developing would be precisely what they need.
Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT)
The Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) reached out to our supervisory group because of their real interest in the application of our gene detection method, with a specific focus on our targeted or selective sequencing based on the fusion protein we have developed. They see many applications for this technology, and have invited us to discuss with us and our supervisory group after the jamboree.
Improvement
One recommendation from the doping authority is to expand our research to urine. While blood samples are also taken for doping tests, these are not implemented"

In the second construct, the cI repressor thermolabile (cI(Ts)) from biobrick BBa_K098995 will be used instead of the wild-type repressor. In this case, the repression is lost for temperatures above 42°C (T2) and the bacterial cells should be red.
In the third construct, the cI open reading frame will be under control of the RNA thermometer of biobrick BBa_K115017 (Pthermo). With this construct, the cI translation will not occur for temperatures below 32°C (T1) and bacterial cells will be red. However, if the bacteria are grown at temperatures above 32°C, the cI repressor is synthesized and active, repressing the lycopene biosynthesis, bacteria will be white.
Finally, the fourth construct is a combination of biobrick BBa_K115017 and BBa_K098995. The expression of the cI repressor thermolabile cI repressor is dependant of  RNA thermometer; with this construct, the repressor is expressed above 32°C but inactivated at 42°C. The cI-controlled lycopene biosynthesis genes will generate red bacteria when grown below 32°C or above 42°C and colorless bacteria between 32°C and 42°C (Fig. 5)
The repressor activity is of the fourth constructs is summarized below:

So, we’ll be homing in on only one approached: direct removal of the biofilm. Dr. Grose answered a question that had come up as I researched. I learned that two serogroups of Cholera are pathogenic to humans: O1 and O139. I wondered if it were important that the species of cholera that we were to work with be of those two serotypes. Dr. Grose explained that bacteria are grouped serotyped based upon how our immune system reacts to them. It isn’t important what serotype cholera is, because any type will make a biofilm. Also, if the biofilm is removed, any type can be destroyed by stomach acid. Questions to Research: What is the composition of the biofilm in Cholera? Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are a principal building block. EPS in most species has a negative charge and is (thus not surprisingly) chlorine resistant. What other components are there? Has anything successfully degraded its biofilm? We know of multiple papers that document biofilm reduction in seemingly every species BUT cholera, but we have failed to find any that is cholera-specific.

The lanes with the amplicon were expected to come from bacteria with multiple tandem integrants. Expected amplicon for multiple integrants: 572 bp.
PCR results with primers P1/P2 and P3/P4 showed that each clone had the correct integrant in the correct genomic position (see Materials and Methods for a list of the expected amplicon lengths). Negative controls showed no amplicons with primers P1/P2 as expected, but showed an unexpected band with P3/P4. The reason of the presence of this band was not further investigated and the results with this primer pair cannot be a useful tool for future analysis. Anyway, the P1/P2 primer pair can be sufficient to successfully validate the presence of the DNA of interest in the Phi80 genomic locus.
PCR results with primers P2/P3 showed that two clones (MC-GFP-B and MC-GFP-C) were single integrants, while all the other clones were multiple tandem integrants (i.e. the Phi80 locus contained more than one copy of the DNA of interest). Negative controls showed no amplicons, as expected.
Validation of the integrants phenotype: all the 11 clones were assayed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Unfortunately, the green fluorescent clones (MC-GFP-A,B,C and MG-GFP-B,C) did not show appreciable differences when compared to negative controls, most probably because the autofluorescence of the cells was too high and hid the GFP signal. For this reason, GFP clones were not considered for further analysis. Other instruments should be used to detect the GFP signal.
On the other hand, RFP clones (MC-RFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C) all showed a higher fluorescence than the negative controls (see Fig.5). As Fig.5 show, the fluorescence of the three MG-RFP had a higher variability between clones when compared to the three MC-RFP. However, the clones were not necessarily expected to behave in the same way because all of them were multiple tandem integrants and the copy number of the PconRFP construct could be arbitrary.
Figure 5: relative RFP synthesis rate for all the RFP expressing clones. Note: as a reference, typical values of the relative RFP synthesis rate measured for PconRFP in a low copy vector (~5 plasmids per cell) are about 6-7 fold higher (data not shown).

Color Model
Description
Approach
Assumptions
RGB components
Protein expression
Description
The eye's ability to separate two distinct colors depends of the hue, saturation and brightness of the observed color.
In this model, we want to design a procedures that take the desired image as input and the image needed to be project on the bacteria as output.
Approach
RGB is a convenient color model for computer graphics because the human visual system works in a way that is similar — though not quite identical — to an RGB color space.
First, we find the image coordinates in RGB color space and extract three matrices for primary color red, green and blue. secondly, simply assume the RGB value is linearly related to fluorescent protein quantity. Gene expression output is closely related to light intensity input.Then, Hill function was used to describe this relationship. finally, three transfered matrices were compound to one picuture as output.
Assumptions
Emission peaks of fluorescent proteins are close to primary wavelengths which form the three axes for RGB color space respectively.
In the CcaS-CcaR system, red light competitively inhibits activation by green light. So growing under red light reduce the sensitivity of CcaS-CcaR to green light while preserving the full output range.
The Cph8-OmpR and YF1-Fixj system are both light–intensity sensors.
Steady-state response with respect to light intensity of these light sensors can be described by Hill function.         Fluorescent protein quantity is perceptually uniform thus can be obtained from the RGB coordinates through linear transformation.         H=b+(aI^n)/(I^n+k^n )
RGB components
Here we works with The CIE 1931 color space standard which consisted of monochromatic primaries red, green and blue.
The tristimulus value extracted from sample image can be associated with a RGB color space where axes range for 0 to 255.

Week 20
We have then decided to explore a different approach - instead of looking at the DNA molecule modifications, we have started to look at separate modified nucleotides. By using the recommendations from Vilnius University professors, we have met with Rūta Stanislauskienė.

She specializes in modified nucleotide molecular biology. During the meeting she has told us about her research concerning modified nucleotide and DNA polymerase interactions. One of the most amazing thing she told us is that there are modified nucleotide and DNA polymerase combinations, wherein the polymerase cannot incorporate the nucleotide because of its modification.

Week 23
After the last meeting we have done another round of literature analysis on modified nucleotides and their interactions with different DNA polymerases. It appeared that phi29 DNA polymerase, in many cases, refuses to incorporate nucleotides with modifications. We have then figured out the solution on how we can link the DNA sequence and the catalytic biomolecule activity - connecting the substrate for catalytic biomolecule to a nucleotide
.
Week 23
With the help of scientists from Life Sciences Center we have successfully have chosen a specific substrate and attached it to cytidine. Then, using standard screening methods we have selected an esterase that can remove said modification.

Audrius Laurynėnas suggested that we should first produce a single pair of well-working substrate nucleotide and enzyme pair before starting to build activity recording system. This was an amazing suggestion as it gave us a way to test the performance of the system we are building, while we were building it.
At that design stage, the performance of catalytic biomolecule was measured by the sequence length and number of amplicons. The amplicons had to be fragmented, because standard sequencing methods are not performing well with long read. Also, amplicons had to be barcoded in order to know that those amplicons came from the same droplet, as the amount of amplified DNA was crucial to us.

In order to search for possible pitfalls in our current design we have met with Greta Stonytė from Microtechnologies Sector in Vilnius University.

Therefore, the main goal of the forger is to make diamonds that are indistinguishable from the real ones, and the goal of the jewelery store is to try and tell them apart as accurately as possible.
This back and forth competition is the main idea behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
Using this analogy, we can come up with the architecture of a GAN.
There are two main components of GANs: the Generator and the Discriminator.
The diamond forger in the example is more formally known as the Generator Network. Such network randomly generates an output (fake diamond) from some initial values. As the Generator gets better after each round, it learns how to better shape the output so that the discriminator would have a harder time differentiating the generated output from the real one (or, in our example case, fake diamonds from the real diamonds).
On another hand, the jewelery store is known as the Discriminator Network.Just as the generative network tries to produce an output that is more similar to real output, the discriminator is trying to determine the differences between real and fake output as best as it can and learns from its mistakes.
Just like the forger‘s main goal is to create seamingly real diamonds, the ultimate goal of a Generative Adversarial network is to have a generative network that can produce outputs which are indistinguishable from the real ones.
Formal Introduction
Let us now explore GANs‘ architecture in terms of image generation. In this case, the Generator is used to generate real-looking images and the Discriminator‘s job is to identify if the image is fake or not. In turn, these two networks,  pitted against each other, are in a constant battle as one (Generator) is trying to fool the other (Discriminator).
The system input can frequently be a random noise, for example a Guassian distribution, and values can be sampled from this disribution and fed into the generator network. Consequently, from those values some kind of image is generated. Following the output of a generator, the discriminator network receives that image and compares it to the real images from a provided dataset.
If the discriminator network performs well, it will swiftly decide that the initially generated image is fake and so, the game will continue. Yet, this time the generator will adjust its parameters just a little bit and try again. Just like that, the two networks will compete and try to improve and outperform each other with each round. Eventually, the Generator will reach a level of sophistication in which the generated images will not be"

We hope to produce an affordable and accessible cell sorter. Our ideal cell sorter possesses two qualities: 1)                 can be manufactured by small scale laboratories without extensive machinery; 2) can be produced at a low                 cost.
This is a challenging goal, as we need to account for both precision and the cost of the cell sorter. Here is                 our story of our endeavour:
To achieve quality 1, we utilised two technologies: 3D printing and microfluidics. 3D printing is a popular                 technology. Objects of any shape can be “printed” by 3D printing. Using 3D printing increases accessibility,                 because the parts do not have to be produced through manufacturers, which may not serve single users. Instead                 the users can produce the parts. On the other hand, we also looked to microfluidics. Microfluidic technology                 can be viewed as the use of small amounts of liquid to control precise movements [6]. The production of microfluidic                 device (fabrication) is increasingly commonplace. For example, fabrication using a desktop cutter has been                 reported as early as 2009 [7]. This is an indication that microfluidics may become increasingly accessible                 in the near future. The use of 3D printing and microfluidic device also addresses quality 2. As these technologies                 become more commonplace, we expect them to be less expensive.
Our cell sorter is composed of two components: the syringe pump and the microfluidic chip. The syringe pumps                 control the liquid pressure in the microfluidic chip, where the movement of cells are controlled.
We have successfully assembled our syringe pumps using 3D printed parts and simple electronic components, with                 a reference to the pneumatic control syringe pump on the open-source repository Metafluidics [8]. However, we realized this pump was not as accessible as we thought it would be, due to the lack of a readily available software to control it. Therefore, in collaboration with Team Glasgow, we devised a software to control the syringe pump. We have also written an easy-to-follow protocol to aid the user, further improving the accessibility of SMORE.
With the help from the Scottish Microelectronics Centre, we have successfully decided on the design of a microfluidic                 cell sorter, which was confirmed to be viable by experts. We based our device on the designs in pre-existing studies on droplet-based                 microfluidic cell sorters and referred to their calculations [6, 9-10]. The"

A therapeutic system needs to be characterized by two crucial features; safety and effectiveness. By giving both features extreme attention, we managed to develop a novel modus operandi, where both the delivery system efficiently targets only cancer cells and the therapeutic RNAi-based logic circuit only affects the specific cancer cell types.
Delivery System
When it comes to colorectal cancer, what better delivery system can one use than the bacteria, that already naturally dwell in the colon? E.coli transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing the part BBa_K1850011 adhere only to colorectal cancer cells and not onto healthy cells, according to iGEM Harvard 2015.
But, in order to improve the system Harvard worked on, we recreated it without the need to control the entire fim operon expression or burden the bacteria with an extra 8kb-plasmid. Finally, going one step further again, we tested the delivery system in a co-culture of bacteria and colorectal cancer cells and succeeded in optimizing the conditions needed for the system to work.
Agglutination Assay
In order to test our colorectal cancer-targeting delivery system, we tested two different strains of E.coli; fimE KO (JW4276-1) and fimH KO (JW4283-3), which were obtained from the Keio collection. The fimE KO is overproducing the type-1 pili, thus we expect them to show extensive adhesion to mannose residues on glycoproteins found on human epithelial cells. Type-1 pili adhesion relies on the fimH lectin which binds to mannosylated glycoproteins, therefore a fimH KO strain is expected to be unable to adhere to epithelial cells. In order to elicit bacterial binding to cancer cells, we transformed them with a plasmid containing the rhamnose inducible fimH 49 KO +RPMrel gene (BBa_K1850011). We then tested our bacteria for their ability to bind to yeast S. cerevisiae, which according to van Asbeck et al.  shows a high affinity to mannose binding lectins. The results demonstrated that, when mixed together with yeast, the fimE KO strains appeared to form clumps which precipitated to the bottom of the eppendorf tubes, whilst fimH"

Reagents
In order to provide a user-friendly product, the reagents required for use of Darwin Toolbox must be supplied in a ready-to-use format, and be easily accessible to the non-institutional user. On top of these desirable attributes, costs must be kept to a minimum in order to allow the widest possible market to be reached. Therefore, arranging for users to order their reagents as pre-made mastermixes or pre-set kits directly from the Darwin Toolbox website may be the optimal solution to this problem.
An example market for Darwin Toolbox would be iGEM teams, and so quantities and costs have been calculated for such a team. iGEM projects run for approximately 6 months, and a large part of that time is devoted to Biobrick-based cloning. A project kit can be envisaged that encompasses all the enzymes and reagents required (Table 1) and the various clean-up kits required (Table 2).
Table 1. Cloning reagent costs
In addition to this, plasmid miniprep, PCR clean-up, and gel-extraction kits would be required, these are costed in Table 2.
Table 2. DNA Clean-up kit costs
The total cost of one project kit, buying at retail value would be $1150. However, as many of these items are purchased from the same supplier, and would be ordered in bulk for redistribution to Darwin Toolbox users, the total cost of one project kit could be reduced by as much as 40%. Additionally, users that carry out less intensive cloning and DNA manipulation may be able to extend their kit to last over multiple iGEM projects.
Other markets, such as educational institutes and hobbyists would likely use very similar kits, but most probably require fewer reagents as their usage may not be as frequent as an iGEM team. Therefore, these kits should constantly be reviewed and discussed with the customer community in order to provide the most useful product.
More experienced users, such as field researchers, mould growth investigators, and medical professionals may have very different demands for the Darwin Toolbox. However, these users are less price-sensitive than hobbyists and potential iGEM teams, and so bespoke kit design may be a possibility. For instance, providing pre-coated"

   The third finding goes against an often-heard stereotype ""women are more interested by applied research"". In order to investigate this subject, tracks were reported for each project. In iGEM tracks correspond to general theme of  the project : medicine, fundationnal research…Tracks were then looked at in terms of sex ratios. There is no significant difference between tracks. (ANOVA > 0,1).
Figure 7: Sex ratios and tracks in iGEM. The proportion of gender in teams grouped by the track that the team is entered in during collegiate iGEM competitions. There is no statistical significant difference between the gender balance between tracks.
High School Division is more balanced
When we looked at the High School Divison, we found that it had a higher percentage of women than the university iGEM teams.  Additionally, The number of female advisors and instructors in the High School division is much higher than that of the Collegiate division and is approximately the same as the proportion of students.  This indicates that there is a problem at the Collegiate level and that iGEM can be an important bridge for women to access new opportunities to lead in higher education
Figure 8: Sex ratios in High School iGEM by year and role. On the left, the proportion of students in the High School Competition that are women for each year.  On the right, the proportion of women in each role for all years.  Bars represent 95% Confidence Interval.
To conclude, studying the iGEM competition gives a unique quantitative insight on existing questions in the field of gender studies. It also constitutes an amazing argument to convince scientists of the existence of a gender issue in science. As explained by Rascun et al in a recent paper published in PNAS, scientists believe that those type of bias only exist in some labs, not their own, therefore very objective studies need to be conducted to clearly show the reality of the numbers. More over , Jo Handelsman a microbiologist involved in that paper underlined in a recent interview, that people often think that there is still an issue in physics or maths but that there are no more women issues in biology, which is not true. This study supports strongly the view that this general thinking is untrue.
In iGEM, is diversity a factor of success ?
   Several studies led by consulting groups (McKinsey and Company Women Matter, 2007) have shown that mixity in a team increases performance. The big question of what leads to success in iGEM was therefore investigated using the database with a special focus on gender"

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," is partially set up by TU Delft, Erasmus Medical Centre, the University of Leiden and the regional development agency. With these we hope to obtain a capital of €500.000 with an average interest rate of 8%. Furthermore, we hope to receive in total €150.000 of grants from for example the governmental “Demonstratie energie-innovatie” fund that gives grands to companies that do research into green energy innovation. Finally, we are searching investors that are prepared to invest for a total of €550.000 in our company. The TU Delft will be an investor and could also be a contribute in kind. Furthermore, also Shift Invest is a potential investor. We estimate that with these funds we can come to a stage where regular commercial financing becomes a possibility, or that we reach a point where a large solar panel manufacturer is willing to take over our business.
Profitability
Based on the market size analysis, the potential market size is estimated to be equal to 187,5 MW. Currently the average power of a solar panel is equal to 0,0000137 MW/m2. Based on these data there is an estimated market of almost 1.500.000 m2 in the next 4 years. As described in the customer analysis, the total added valued of the microlens arrays is equal to at least 897 euro/m2. We estimate to sell the microlens arrays for 30% of this profit. This means that the selling price is equal to €270.
Figure 8: Profitability of BioLens
Based on this conservative estimate it appears that the costs are already covered at a much lower sales volume than the estimated potential market in the first four years. We are well aware of the many uncertainties in these calculations. However, since there is still a large margin between the breakeven point and the expected sales, we dare to say that the BioLens microlens array is profitable.

The amplification of IABCT is not very strong due to competition from the IT that is also present in the mixture.
BUT we show that post-elution amplification is possible. At this point, we will bind the IABCT and IT onto the streptavidin beads.

Triple Helix
The Triple Helix is a global forum for science in society run by students at over 25 of the world's leading universities. Their journal 'Science in Society' is printed termly and Cambridge iGEM was asked to provide a short article for the Michaelmas 2012 (autumn) edition. Below is a copy of the article submitted:
The iGEM (international genetically engineered machines) competition began at MIT in 2003 and the Cambridge team has competed every year since 2005 when it first became international, winning the globally in 2009. Students work in teams over the summer and then present their research at international conferences; the university team will be going to Amsterdam for this purpose in early October. Though the competition is primarily for undergraduates, many teams benefit from graduate mentors who are often themselves previous iGEMers, who provide invaluable advice and guidance over the course of the project.
Central to the competition is the teams’ production and use of biobricks (standard biological parts) though synthetic biology. When put together the biobricks can be constructed into ‘devices’ within bacterial systems which can do anything from making E.coli smell of bananas  to glow bright red in the presence of arsenic.
The team’s project this year has been focussed on producing a standardised output with instrumentation for biosensor experiments, such as are often used in within the iGEM competition. To do this we have created ratiometric light emitting constructs using fluorescent proteins and luciferases - bioluminescent proteins found in fireflies and some bacteria.
Many people are familiar with the idea of coupling light emmitance to the production of a substance within cells to estimate its concentration, but this system has inherent problems. Does a low reading indicate low production in a lot of cells or that most of the cells are dead and very high production exists among the survivors?
The ratiometric construct helps by using two colours. One colour is produced constantly while the cell is undergoing protein synthesis, the other induced under set circumstances. Taking the ratio of these outputs allows for calculations of production per cell. Through quantification experiments, plotting output per cell against known concentrations, it is possible to"
BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". We then engaged all of these students in a discussion about synbio and engineering ethics in a forum on whether or not the proposed solution of terraforming Mars was reasonable and ethical. Each student first read a short article explaining more context and highlighting various options as possible paths of action. All of these options encouraged students to consider and discuss biologists’ responsibilities to human civilization, other life forms, and the environment.
We had an opportunity to show these young women our research and the microfluidic devices and control infrastructure we build for the devices. Again, most students had never heard of these devices, but we were able to show that these devices had practical uses in the lab.
Industry and Lab Visits
Our educational and public outreach allowed us to teach younger generations and members of the public about synthetic biology, and about microfluidics. Much to our surprise, microfluidic devices were not well known by most people we spoke too.
To gather more information about how synthetic biologists use microfluidics, we staged several visits to biotech companies that use synthetic biology, and we even spoke to a microfluidic fabrication company.
Ginkgo BioWorks | 28 JUNE 2016
The first company we visited was Ginkgo Bioworks. In this short visit, we toured their Boston based facility and had the opportunity to learn both about their research, and about the tools they use to do synthetic biology. The detail that stood out to us the most was: Whoa, they sure do have a lot of hardware! As a hardware team, we strive to enable synthetic biologists by creating software and hardware that accelerates research and discovery: Ginkgo Bioworks had no shortage of tools to enable rapid discovery and characterization. They had tools to automate as much of the synthetic biology workflow as possible: PCR tools, pipetting machines and software to keep track of all device characterization.
As it would turn out, we learned that some hardware that Ginkgo used did incorporate microfluidic technology. Some devices that are used to measure expression of certain proteins in a sample do so using microliters of a sample, and these devices have built-in microfluidics. Needless to say, this equipment was very specialized and incredibly high cost.
Aside from very specialized machines that incorporated microfluidics, we found that Ginkgo did not use these devices in their regular workflow.
Lab Central & Sembler | 23 JUNE 2016
At this point we were very curious: our investigations led us to conclude that microfluidics were not widely known about by the public, and in industry and research these devices"

NEU_China_B & DLUT_China & DLUT_China_B 【Hosting Seminar and Meetup】
The NEU_China_A is proud to be able to host the first meetup of all of the iGEM Teams of Dalian University of Technology and Northeastern University this year at August, 27th 2018. By this great opportunity, we also collaborated with DLUT_China, DLUT_China_B, and NEU_China_B to hold a seminar. During this seminar, we had the chance to share each of team’s project, and discuss the specific schemes of the experiments. The seminar greatly promoted the smooth development of these four iGEM teams. At the end of the seminar, we had a discussion regarding the opportunity for collaboration in the next future and reached an experimental cooperation intention with the DLUT_China in kill switch section.

During the online communication with AHUT_China, we learned that they were distressed by the optimization of CSCA protein expression conditions. It happens that our team was also optimizing the expression conditions of the Myrosinase, which has contributed to our cooperation in the optimization of CSCA protein expression conditions and product purification for AHUT_China.

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project#detailed_-_-_TEXT.html," the cytoplasmic operon activity. The set of genes in the cytoplasmic operon depends on the desired functionality of bacterial strain. In case of antitumor therapy could be the p53 protein with mitochondrial leader sequence. In the strain capable of conjugation with mitochondria cytoplasmic operon will control genes responsible for the conjugation process.
The mechanism of proposed regulatory system.
In the growth medium (at 37 °C) the expression of all genetic circuits is inactive. After temperature increases to 42°C the system is activated by thermal degradation of cIts. Genes from invasion operon are transcribed. They maintain their own expression, initiate internalisation of E. coli by mammalian cells and enable escape from endosome. When bacterial cell is inside the endosome the endosome detection module is activated by PhoP/PhoQ system . In trans expression of regulatory genes cI and tetR deactivates invasion operon and activates cytoplasmic operon. However its genes are not expressed as long as bacterial cell is inside endosome due to cro protein activity. When bacterium escapes from the endosome, the transcription from endosome detection operon is repressed and cytoplasmic operon genes are expressed.
Conjugation with mitochondria.
To locate the copy of the mitochondrial genome into bacterial cell the pBACrNESd plasmid will be used. It is built basing the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome. Replication origin (ori R6K), kanamycin resistance gen (kanR) and replication complex genes (repE, parA, parC) from pBACrNESd plasmid will be fused with origin of transfer (oriTF) from natural conjugative F plasmid. Unique restriction site will be introduced into the mitochondrial genome by PCR reaction and the described construct will be inserted into mitochondrion. To enable conjugation proteins encoded on RP4 plasmid (Tc, MuKm, Tn7) will be placed in the cytoplasmic operon. These genes are responsible for pillus formation and transport of single stranded DNA. The cell with this system will conjugate with any structure surround by lipid bilayer. We will prepare mitochondrial DNA deficient cells using a previously described procedure [2]. The occurrence of conjugation will be confirmed by PCR reaction specific for sequences added to mitochondrial DNA. The origin of the DNA will be determined by analysis of restriction patterns. The expression of mitochondrial genes will be confirmed by semi-quantitative PCR [2].

Conclusion:
The transformation of qrnS1 (ciprofloxacin resistance cassette) in BBa_K823023 to E. coli Top10 was successful.
Validation
Experiment:
To test if the construct would make B. subtilis resistant to    ciprofloxacin, the construct qrnS1 in BBa_K823023 was transformed into the B.    subtilis 168 tpr+.
Experiments
Experiment:
13/10/16: The transformation to B. subtilis was performed according to the following protocol . Colonies were selected on LB agar    with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol.
Figure 5. B. subtilis after transformation with     ciprofloxacin resistance cassette.
14/10/16: Colonies were streaked out on agar with starch to perform the    starch test, which verifies the integration in the amyE locus in the    genome of B. subtilis. Integration check: Starch test
Figure 6. Starch test. Colonies without a clear halo     are positive for integration.
Conclusion:
The integration of the ciprofloxacin resistance cassette was    successful.
As a first check on the functionality of the ciprofloxacin    resistance cassette, we grew B. subtilis colonies from the starch test    with ciprofloxacin. As a control they were also grown with    chloramphenicol, the resistance on the backbone of the integration    vector. Figure 7 shows the result for 3 different colonies (tubes    indicated with 1 - 3). The tubes marked with Cm is the control with    chloramphenicol, which shows growth for all three colonies. The tubes    marked with Cipro were grown with ciprofloxacin. Colonies 2 and 3 showed    growth, whereas colony 1 did not grow. Seems like the resistance    cassette is working. To further explore if the ciprofloxacin cassette    is functional in B. subtilis, a MIC value test was performed. See link .

Experiments
We have done 4 assays, which are Assay A, Assay B, Assay C and Assay D on the cultured cells to test whether part BBa_K2197300, BBa_K2197400, BBa_K2197500 and BBa_K2197502 are valid. Protocols are documented on the protocol page. The design and results will be discussed in detail below.
Assay A
Design
Assay A is an experiment designed to prove the validity of BBa_K2197300. By incubating engineered cells with different concentrations of uric acid and measuring the green fluorescence level in a plate reader, it is expected a positively proportional trend be shown. As theoretically, the higher the concentration is, the more the GFP will be expressed. It is because the strong repressor KRAB-HucR will stop the expression of GFP when there is no uric acid, or in very low concentration.
Steps and Result
We first pipette the cells into different concentrations of uric acid and incubate them in 96 well plate for 30 minutes. After that, we put it into the plate reader to measure the green fluorescence level.
The result is shown as below (Click me for raw data).
There is no significant trend shown. When higher concentrations of uric acid are added, the levels of green fluorescence measured are similar to that in lower concentrations. Therefore, we carry out another experiment, Assay B, after receiving the advice from 2017 team Hong Kong-CUHK.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in the absence of inducer. LacI-Pr* and TetR-Pr* were our first attempt at this strategy. It was discovered after sequence analysis that the promoter primer contained a 2-bp addition that shifted the transcriptional start site 2-bp to the right. These errors were corrected with LacI-Pr and TetR-Pr.
Our first test of copy # control
After constructing our plasmids we had little idea what inducer concentration would be required to transform and propagate them. Too little inducer would mean plasmid loss and colonies that might be false positive. Too much inducer might result in “runaway” replication leading to the same results. We therefore divided each transformation recovery mix between culture tubes ranging in inducer concentration from zero to higher concentrations as described below for Fig 9. Growth was seen in all tubes but only non-zero concentrations resulted in plasmid of the predicted size. We selected minipreps from overnights with IPTG concentrations two-times the lower threshold, retransformed and selected individual colonies. Minipreps that contained the NsiI site that comes with the regulated promoter showed that we did not have a false-positives.
We then tried to examine plasmid loss semi-quantitatively, by examining miniprep yields of the plasmid grown with and without the inducer, see Fig 9 below. For both the LacO and TetO plasmids, inducer allows greater plasmid replication, especially for the middle strength promoter. Also, the amount of plasmid increases with the strength of the promoter. While this is almost enough to quantitatively measure copy number, a loading control would reduce variation from miniprep procedure.
            
Fig 9. Shown is the plasmid content of cells containing various repressor controlled plasmid origins. 5 mLs of LB broth was inoculated with a single freshly plated colony  and grown at 37oC overnight under selective conditions that favoured plasmid maintenance [chloramphenicol (0.3 uL/mL) and either IPTG (0.05 mM) or ATC (1.07 nM)]. Fresh cultures were made next day with ~104 cells and grown under selective and non-selective conditions (+/- IPTG) and in the absence of chloramphenicol. Note that this experiment could have been improved by adding an internal DNA standard to each sample before miniprepping.
While the reduction in plasmid level above shows that control of copy number is possible, more exciting is the possibility of"

Since Africanized bees appeared, he claims, it is better to have interior feeding to avoid foragers. This method would also avoid product loss from environmental conditions such as the wind or sun.
He reassured us that peptides would get to the brood, regardless of the application and only the time it takes might change. Peptides cannot arrive directly since larvae do not feed on their own: on their first 3 days, larvae are fed jelly, and with bee bread the following three. He also gave us a first draft of the path the peptides follow: from the digestive system to the hemolymph and finally to the hypopharyngeal glands in the head where they produce royal jelly.
Adult bees are not affected by P. larvae. In fact, in their digestive system, there is an anatomical structure called proventriculus and can close when the time comes to purify the food. He shared with us a new fact about hygienic behavior. As brood infected with AFB begin metamorphosis, proteolytic enzymes from P. larvae degrade fibers and reduce them to pure viscose biomass. Bees organs in their antennas can sense this decomposition; cleaner bees then break through the capped cell, remove the corpse, and clean the cell. All colonies of beehives exhibit this behavior being in some more marked than in others.
We mentioned the possibility of adding the solution cell by cell, but he said we must think of the beekeeper. This just isn’t scalable for 3,000 or 4,000 boxes. We realized here that the easier the application, the more attractive the product. This made us think of secondary factors that influence our products viability, other than its antimicrobial ability. This is further discussed in our business model . He noted that if the product is applied to cure it is susceptible to apply directly in the cells as mentioned above since in an apiary of 20 to 30 hives, this disease can be initiated in 2 or 3 of them, however, it should be applied as a preventive measure throughout the apiary.
He mentioned that we should consider the effect our product would have on the bee's usual microbiome. He asked us whether our product was a remedy or a preventive measure. We answered that the design wasn't enough to pick one or the other, and it might be both.
Finally, he recommended articles and contacts for further information. He put us in contact with MSc Alejandro Romo, MSc Juan Diego Perez de"

But we can keep our plasmid from gene conjugation. For example maybe we can use Imperial College’s 2011 project: Gene Guard. Another solutions may be too.   4)TAT-Apoptin is able to enter healthy cells as well as cancer cells. Will this cause any harm as TAT-Apoptin may accumulate in the healthy cells?
It can be assumed that if any type of protein accumulates within a cells cytoplasm then it may cause harm as they are normally assigned to be digested. This may be a problem with TAT-Apoptin too. However if we encounter such an issue then we can solve it using degradable tag proteins as this will allow its digestion.

Our another partner was NEU-China,whose teammates had a leisure talk about projects with us in our laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence detection tests.They used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the hyphae of T.atroviride. Erenow we only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence microscope, the data they provided us were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that we have succeed in expressing heterogenous gene in our aiming chassis.
At the same time, We helped NEU-China to make a luminescence detection by stimulation of forskolin. Forskolin is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator widely used in improving the cAMP level in the cell.We found the fluorescence intensity of the sample added this substance was higher than control group, demonstrating that the reporter gene is available to respond to the activation of the cAMP pathway.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," of safety mechanisms on the biological devices developed. As synthetic biology is based on engineering principles applied to biology, the safety engineering applied in the usual technologies will be able to be applied to synthetic biology. This gives a base to develop a system to identify and eliminate hazards that will reduce the risks associated with synthetic biology. An example of a tool from safety engineering that can be applied to synthetic biology is the Fault Analysis Trees, which will be explained further below.
Biocontainment
In current industrial applications such as fermenters, the use of closed settings that are easily controlled and proper waste management allows for the safe use of genetically modified microorganisms. However, taking these organisms for use in external situations increases the chances of an accidental release. Therefore, the existence of efficient containment mechanisms that avoid the spread of the modified bacteria will be needed in order to exploit the full potential of synthetic biology [3].
For a biocontainment mechanism to be effective, it needs to prevent the proliferation of the organisms. These situations are the mutagenic drift, the environmental supplementation and the horizontal gene transfer [4]. An analysis of the chosen biocontainment mechanism can be found below, as well as two other alternatives:
Auxotrophy
The aim is to engineer organisms so that they need an essential compound for their survival. There are two ways of doing so [3]:
Removing an essential metabolic pathway that will make the bacteria dependent on one or several biomolecules. For example, deleting the gene thyA makes the bacteria dependent on thymidine and removing the gene asd makes the bacteria need diaminopimelic acid, methionine, lysine, and threonine to survive.
Introducing a lethal gene, such as gef or nucA. This gene will be under control of a compound in such a way that the depletion of said compound will activate the lethal gene and result in consequent cell death. For example, a xylS-gef switch was developed in such a way that the bacteria was dependent on benzoate [5].
Introducing two copies or combining the two methods will help the biocontainment method to be resistant to mutagenic drift and horizontal gene transfer. However, the main limitation of this method is the environmental supplementation, as this method will only be effective as long as the natural environment does not have sources of the necessary compounds for the survival of the bacteria.
Induced lethality
Also known as ""killswitch"" mechanisms. It could be considered the opposite to auxotrophy, as in this case, a compound will induce the death of the modified bacteria, while it will not affect natural organisms. Among the"

Start learning SBML and LibSBML. Well~~ download, unzip, install, OMG!! Quite a lot of codes, my teammates advise me to read the tutorial first. Yes, after reading, I realize the structure of SBML file and working process of LibSBML approximately. In terms of our software, some basic information of the SBML file is needed, such as amount of spceies and parameters, their names, information of each reaction, including the mathematical expressions of each kineticlaw. All these data need to extract from given SBML file. So it looks learning to use LibSBML is inevitable.
Jun. 6, 2009
Go on working with LibSBML, Successfully output the species names, parameters and other informations.
Need to face some problems when deal with the mathematical expressions, SBML uses ASTNode to store the formula, although it is not difficult to manage the ""tree"" data structure, I still need to make clear the functions in ""class ASTNode"". My teammates need me to supply the information orderly, which means :
1. The information of one reaction should be stored by categories.
2. The terms(the formula related to one certain species) should be put together.
3. The whole information need to be packaged for next step.
Aug. 15, 2009
The readSBMLFile part finished, in this part, I pick each species list in the file orderly, and search all reactions, if the species appeared in ""ListOfReactants""; ""ListOfProducts"" or ""ListOfModifiers"", i'll push the informations of the reaction into the vertor<term>, the data structure of vector<term> has been decided as ""class val_func"". After the traversing, i'll package these vectors<term>, and sent to the next step.

The writeSBMLFile part finished, the experience of making read part facilitates me to assemble this part. Besides some normal steps, I use ""traversing binary tree"" to make the mathematical expression fit each certain reaction. But there also some problems with open files from database part, I still need to work on this~~

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

After the emergency operation, the doctor came in and took a DNA sample. First, I couldn’t believe it, but they are printing a new kidney for you right now. In less than 30 days, it will be ready for transplantation.”
A grey-haired doctor enters:
“Hi Chris, I’m Dr. Müller. Nice to meet you. Be assured that your new kidney is growing and there won’t be any rejection reaction at all since the kidney is printed for you individually.”
On his way out, Dr. Müller chokes back his tears, remembering all the patients he saw dying while they were waiting for donor organs before SynBio provided him and his colleagues with the live-saving new technology of organ printing.
Tech moral scenario 2:
Luke is born on a cloudy Monday outside of Seattle, Washington. His parents are ecstatic and the family cannot wait to bring him home. However, there is a complication as Luke was born with a defective liver. Although otherwise healthy, his life is already in dire jeopardy. His parents are heart-broken that their beautiful child is facing such risk.
In situations like these, it is possible to find a donor for Luke. However, this depends on finding the right donor with similar biological make-up to Luke, as well as a lot of luck that the transplant will be successful.
Today, there is a new possibility. Luke's parents have heard about 3D printing for organs, and ask the doctors if this is possible. The doctors explain that this new technology is making organ transplants more accessible for people such as Luke. With 3D printing, Luke could have a new, healthy liver printed from his very own DNA, highly reducing risk and improving his chance of complete recovery.
Suddenly, there is a thread of hope for Luke's parents and their newborn son. Luke may need help, but this technology opens many opportunities for his well-being. With any luck, 3D organ printing can provide a full and healthy life to Luke and other people in need of organ transplants.

A donor organ not only helps the patient but is a relief also for family and friends
How these tech-moral scenarios influenced our project
During the project we often discussed the new possibilities that successful organ printing would have. The situation in Germany is especially pressing since only very few people are organ donors which results in a huge shortage of available organs.
Of course we hope to reduce or even solve this problem with our organ printing technology in the future. In fact the real world impact that our technology might have"

The main objective of the realization of this visit was to get to know and evaluate the ideal conditions with which M. plutonius and P. larvae grow and how are they handled in vitro. On another hand, we looked forward to knowing the practices of in vitro bee breeding.
Four members of the team had the opportunity to travel to Cuauhtémoc and attend this visit where we invested approximately four hours, first in the  laboratory  and  then  in  the  field.  M.  S. Alejandro  Romo  Chacón  (who  has
participated in more than 20 scientific dissemination articles related to bees or agriculture) welcomed us to the facilities and once we entered the laboratory he began to explain us about the bees’ life cycle and about some of the products and instruments beekeepers use to handle hives.  Later,  we  were  able  to  meet  M.S.  Adrián  Ponce  de  León,  who  is
researching about foulbrood bacteria, and along with M.S. Romo, he explained us about procedures and safety considerations in order to manage the in vitro growth of P. larvae and M. plutonius.
The day of our visit, M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León planned to go to the bee field and carry out bee larvae transferences, for its following in vitro breeding. This activity is one of the parts that implies our project once we reach the experimentation stage with the insects and M.S. Romo and M.S.

Value proposition
Antibiotic resistance among pathogens causing life threatening infections is rapidly increasing. Ineffective antibiotic treatments are in the worst case detrimental. The rapid detection of, for example, MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in hospitals is essential to guide crucial decision-making. For the patient this means a safe treatment and healthy hospital environment. Hospitals have to be enabled to fight the challenges MRSA poses. Even in the case of a more innocent bladder infection, on-site disclosure of viral or bacterial pathogens can be very beneficial to avoid the frustration of patients, that typically comes with missing treatment success. By rapidly and simply detecting genetic material of pathogens, such generic problems can be solved.  However, current detection methods for viral infections require highly specialized equipment and trained personnel and cannot be used in case of emergencies. In addition, these methods are time consuming and often indirect via antigens. An indirect detection is the distinguishment between for example viral infections caused by the Zika and Dengue virus ( Trafton 2017 ; Grandien 1996 ). CINDY Seq is the direct RNA-based detection tool that offers a solution for rapid, cheap and direct detection of genetic material. This allows to detect potential pathogens which have not caused an immune response yet. Patient treatment can thus begin already during the incubation period of the pathogen. CINDY Seq saves time and enables users such as doctors to provide rapid and specific service. It facilitates ad-hoc decision-making and reduces costs on ineffective treatments and complicated protocols for detection. Therefore we aim to develop CINDY Seq as a versatile detection tool for relevant genetic material and expanding the impact beyond the scope of this iGEM project.
Market analysis
The worldwide market of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) is predicted to grow 5,3% annually until 2021 ( Mordor intelligence ). This amounts to a net increase in market value of more than 22 billion dollars ( Mordor intelligence ). The specific market segments we are addressing are molecular tests for infectious diseases as well as microbial and viral tests. These market segments are expected to grow above average compared to the overall IVD market growth, where molecular test for infectious diseases experience vastest growth of up to 9% annually ( Kalorama information ). Generally the profitability of players in the molecular diagnostics field lies between 15 and 20% ( Roche Half Year report 2017 ). The key factors to successfully enter the IVD market are the integration of our unique technique within other techniques, and its capability for rapid and versatile diagnosis at the molecular level, especially for detection"

I joined iGem because I am a science fiction enthusiast and the idea of creating life from scratch immediately triggered my preconceived ideas of mad scientists and dystopia. While my perspectives on Synthetic biology have broadened and I am convinced of the positive effect this approach may have, I am sure many individuals across the globe share my previous ideas on biotechnology. Participating in the iGEM ethics project has given me a wealth of knowledge about a field I was practically unaware of and inspired me to share what I have learned and engage in active discussions with individuals that may be unaware of the direction of the field and the impact it could have on society and the environment.

Tasks: it is important that people know what they have to do, so tasks that are clear and structured will make the work easier. Also communicating about what has been done is an important skill, so all team members can understand                 the result.
Project achievement goals: what we discovered during the project is that everyone has personal goals within the project besides the main project goals. In case you are working with a group of persons with a different background, it                 might also be the case that everyone understands the project achievement goals differently. It will ease the teamwork if you know what goals the team wants to achieve and what personal goals each team member wants to achieve.
All the different elements will be counted according to relative weighting factors. In the Figure, the biggest arrow means a relative weighting factor of 3, the somewhat smaller one represents a factor of 2 and the smallest one a factor of 1.             These weighting factors are a first estimation of relative importance. In the future, one of the team members is going to improve this tool.

As the results show there are some significant differences in how people evaluate the different topics. The students who participated agreed on the fact that if we would have done this earlier, some problems they have with the team could be discussed           in a better way. A difference in perception could already be interesting to discuss.
Application
Two people tested the application part of the tool. According to both of them, the statements, which indicates the risks for each aspect, were clear. We talked with both participants about the aspect that scored the lowest; ‘the acceptance’. From this talk, we learned that some of the information on the wiki is not stated clearly and that things like ‘unnaturalness’ are indeed concerns they have.

2. Biosecurity
3. Ethics
4. Project achievement goals
5. Acceptance
6. Functionality
Based on these results, we could think about how to change our communication strategy or wiki representation, to make the safety aspect more involved and also more acceptance for our technology.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Synergene#applicationscenario_-_-_TEXT.html," could be used to collect herbicides, harmful chemicals, and could be used in consort with other iGEM projects such as the 2013 project of Nanjing or Dundee. As we expand this model to collect other resources the risks will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and modifications to our system should be undertaken to mitigate as many risks as possible.
“Playing God”: As with most iGEM projects, we will surely be accused of “playing God” in our desire to implement a system and assuming we have foreseen and planned for all the outcomes. Obviously this isn’t true, there are serious concerns with a project of this scale, and therefore we propose several questions to further critical examination of our system.  There is the concern that our system will work too well. That it could possibly strip the ecosystem of phosphorus. We apply phosphorus in the form of fertilizer because it can be the limiting nutrient for crop growth. However, if our system overperforms, we may strip enough from the aqueous environment that it may cause detrimental effects to the plants that rely on that environment.
Why our product?
Due to the wide variety of applications and our flexible three leveled business model our system is able to be implemented across a wide range of environments and levels of need. By capturing and concentrating a valuable compound out of the environment we at once provide an environmental service and monetary incentive for its widespread implementation. Our system will allow anyone to capture and monetize the resource around them, taking control of their own waste and environmental impact.
Future use and application
The core of our system was designed and engineered to capture, store, and extract a valuable compound from the environment. Besides an expansion in the number of locations and scale of implementation of our phosphorus system; the true benefit is the ability to easily change out the xerogel beads and embedded bacteria in order to capture other resources. We could easily see this being implemented with other projects such as Nanjing’s 2013 project which attempted to capture and breakdown pharmaceuticals in water. Or Dundee’s 2013 project which captured the toxins produced by algae to remediate the surrounding water. As humanity's needs expand, our system is ready to adapt, collecting and concentrating useful, harmful, or valuable compounds out of water systems. This will hopefully encourage and promote an economy surrounding reclaiming resources from waste streams.
In Summary
Our phosphorus reclamation module (PRM) has the flexibility required to operate in the myriad of environments identified as major contributors of phosphorus contamination in water. Our business plan facilitates use of our product over the widest range of clients from"

Worldwide Connections - A UCSC Tradition
The iGEM Competition challenges teams to improve quality of life using synthetic biology. Creating change requires an understanding of what the world is asking for, and as the 6th UCSC iGEM team, we uphold the reputation of UCSC investing heavily in worldwide outreach to not only spread the word about our project, but to understand the impact of our project on a personal level. Through these personal connections, we evaluated and continue to evaluate potential issues related to our project, including stigma, price, ethics, safety, security, and sustainability. We created a brochure as a means to address common rumors and spread proper knowledge about contraception.
Our interactive map below details all countries we've contacted for input. Our questionnaire we used to gather information was approved by the Institutional Review Board and we changed names to assure anonymity.
Inspiration
Before choosing a project, our team emailed over 50 World Health Organization representatives around the globe to determine the most pressing issues. With the women’s rights movement on the rise again, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team wanted to prompt the discussion of women’s health at this year’s competition. We determined that many resource-constrained countries struggle with access to contraception because of stigma, location, and cost. Our goal was to focus on those countries to determine if they’d be interested in our new contraception method and willing to speak with us about their personal experiences.
Execution
Our outreach team contacted several big organizations, associations, and foundations for help on finding locals willing to speak to us. Not many of them got back to us, so we went an alternative route. We searched GoFundMe and found a group of women in Uganda called the Joy Women’s Group asking for money to help buy condoms for their community. They were funded through the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI), and we quickly contacted the BBI who put us into contact with three local women’s groups in Uganda.

Life is like a mirror - we get the best results when we smile at it
Library
We implement a basic diversity of initial binding proteins by creating a high-quality library consisting of over one hundred thousand Monobodies and over onehundredsixty thousand Nanobodies , respectively. Construction of our part collection was a foundation for our project and a cornerstone for utilizing libraries in iGEM.
We verified our binding protein libraries with Phagemid display and high-throughput sequencing techniques.

Mutation
In the Evobody generating process, we want to obtain a high affinity binding protein by directed evolution. To further evolve binding proteins with an innate ability to interact with our target, we want to mutagenize them and thereby enable an ongoing adaptation to the target.  We successfully cloned two different approaches for in vivo mutagenesis, demonstrated and quantified mutagenesis by reversion assays (figure 2) and determined the mutation spectrum by high-throughput sequencing.  Furthermore, we determined the mutation rate of our error prone polymerase I as well as of"

Project Riboregulator Abstract
Regulatory RNAs are RNAs that regulate biological processes on genetic and metabolic levels, and their importance has been established through the discoveries including those of RNA interference (RNAi) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). The elucidation of their mechanism has enabled their reverse engineering, transforming them into versatile tools in synthetic biology.
Riboregulators belong to a class of regulatory RNAs that controls translation by pairing of cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) RNAs. They have received attention from at least 7 teams during the early years of iGEM. For example, Farren Isaacs in 2005, iGEM 2006 UC Berkeley team and iGEM 2007 Caltech team contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry. Though there are more than > 100 riboregulator BioBrick records, comprehensive characterization information is missing. This hinders the iGEM community to compare and contrast different riboregulator pairs and evaluate their performance. For example, if we want to use the CR and TA devices that Berkeley 2006 made, we would not know which one to use and whether the device would work, because documentations were not put down in the Registry or wiki page and were therefore no longer accessible.
In light of this situation, iGEM 2014 HKUST team decided to embark on ""Project Riboregulator"", and we aim to:
Provide Characterization information on riboregulator BioBricks so that teams and labs will be confident in using these devices.
Summarize available information of existing riboregulators into a Feature Page and promote their uses.
Create a Catalog Page for all identifiable regulatory RNAs;
Update the choice of “Categories” when documenting “hard information” of"
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#lucylabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"ocols Used: Protein Expression Test Note: 150ml of fresh LB was innoculated with 7.5ml of the overnight cultures. Only an uninduced control and an 1mM IPTG induced culture was set up. The samples were not blotted, they were only ran on an SDS gel.
Results: SBP: Nothing was observable on the SDS gel. PotD: Figure 8
Next Steps: Since PotD has now been successful purified, the next step is to attach a fluorescent nanobead to the protein. Hopefully, this will be attempted in the coming weeks. Even though SBP was not visible on the SDS gel, 3L cultures will be set up this week to try and harvest the protein since the culture size may be too small.
29/7: Overnight Cultures for 3L Culture
Aim of experiment: To set up overnight cultures containing pQE80-L-SBP for the 3L day cultures that will be grown tomorrow.
Protocols Used: Overnight Cultures Note: One 150ml overnight culture was set up using 150µl of each antibiotic.
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The 3L culture will be set up tomorrow allowed to grow to OD600 of 0.6-1 and then SBP expression induced with 1mM IPTG and grown for 6 hours.

Shaheer harvested the colonies from his transformed plates, as described by the Deep Well Miniprep procedure.
We got back the results of the pRECs Ben sent for sequencing yesterday and have yet to cross examine them with their expected sequences. All of the pRECs chosen, with the exception of pREC 206 (3), yeilded at least one “Good” sequence.
Ben analyzed the results and hypothesized that our pS-9”12 backbones were digested incorrectly.
We are going to test cut the backbones to verify their sequences by digesting each backbone with the opposite enzyme with which we are going to ligate it.
Because of all of the vectors looked exactly as expected, we suspect the switch up Ben identified from the sequencing occurred at some later point.
Jeff and Kate digested the backbones
Kate did the digestion with two mastermixes, 240 microliters water, 40 microliters buffer, 12 microliters enzyme 1 and 12 microliters enzyme 2. Then she loaded 38 microliters mastermix into the corresponding cryotubes, then added 12 microliters DNA to the corresponding cryotubes.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM"

T7 Promoter Variants
Introduction
Our goal is to make two families of T7 promoter variants. One family has mutations on the T7 promoter consensus sequence while the other has the same set of mutations on the consensus sequence but also has a lac operator downstream of the T7 promoter. In each family, we produce six designed variants with different predicted promoter strengths compared to the wildtype as well as three sets of randomer variants which we want to use to check the overall range of promoter strengths.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter2_-_-_TEXT.html," PhD student advisors and      having decided it was critical to tackle a real world problem, we asked      the general public what sort of problems they faced on a regular basis.      Many replies were made by people stating that they often had problems      with pipe blockages, and from there our project began.
We are the third team from Sheffield to enter the iGEM competition, and      the first since 2010. We are aiming for victory in the manufacturing track!
OUR PROJECT
The accumulation of fat and hair deposits in sewer systems is     increasingly problematic in urban areas, causing disruption to     the public and costing water companies a lot of money.
FOG (fats, oils and greases) pollutants mainly originate from     homes and restaurants, who dispose of used cooking oil down the     sink rather than in the bin. Our idea is to engineer E. coli to secrete     lipase and keratinase enzymes to break down these deposits     before the blockages have the chance to form.
Plan for future steps: We are working on methods of inserting the bacteria into the pipe     in a way that is both cost-effective and practical. We also intend to     research where the responsibility for dealing with damage from     environmental pollutants lies.

In the next few graphs, the concentration of SinR is varied to see how it affects the system.
Figure 1.1
Figure 1.2
From Figure 1.1 and 1.2, which are essentially the same graphs, but at different time durations, it is observed that when the concentration of SinR is set at 1nM, the SinI concentration reaches a maximum of approximately 60nM.
Figure 2.1
Figure 2.2
Referring to Figure 2.1 and 2.2, when the concentration of SinR is increased to 1.5, the concentration of SinI drops to approximately 50nM.
Figure 3.1
Figure 3.2
When the concentration of SinR is set to 2nM, as seen in Figure 3.1 and 3.2, the concentration of SinI reaches a maximum of approximately 15nM. Comparing the previous results obtained, it seems like the concentration of SinI is most affected when the concentration of SinR is set at 2nM.
Figure 4.1
Figure 4.2
The concentration of SinI further drops to 5nM when the concentration of SinR is increased to 2.5nM.
The results from figures 1 to 4 shows that SinR does repress SinI. The greater the concentration of SinR, the lower the concentration of SinI. Also, the concentration of the SinR tetramers (R4) increases as well.
As seen in Diagram 1, k3 is a rate constant of P3. Therefore, at a low k3 value, a high concentration of SinI would be expected. This theory is explored and the results are as follows:
Figure 5.1
Figure 5.2
Figure 5.3
Figure 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 justifies the theory, as it can be observed that the greater the k3 rate constant, the lower the SinI concentration.
The following graphs will investigate the effect on the system when the Spo0A protein concentration, [S2] is varied. The rate constants k3 will be kept constant. The suggested range for [S2] is 1 to 10 000nM.[9]

A report from 2016 made by the World Economic Forum predicts that, if we continue this way, by 2050 the oceans will contain more weight in plastic than in fish (WEC, 2016).
90% of plastics are made from virgin fossil stocks, taking up a whole 6% of the global oil consumption. Also, whole 32% of plastic packaging escapes collection systems, having economic costs by reducing productivity of vital natural cycles and systems and clogging urban infrastructures. Plastic also contain a blend of chemicals that makes some researchers raise concerns about potential adverse effects on human health and the environment (WEC, 2016).
Unfortunately… not all countries have as a priority the legalization of norms for plastic treatment, disposal and limiting of the production, as well as adopting and implementing norms for plastic disposal in the household. Actually, some governments are dealing with other problematics such as starvation, corruption, lack of education and unemployment, while other governments are just not interest enough to do so, as well as people might not be demanding it enough for it to happen. For one reason or another, it is not being done enough by all. As the World Economic Forum reports in 2016, only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling and at least 8 million tons of plastics leak into the ocean annually (WEF, 2016).
Demonstrate that our work is safe, responsible and good for the world:
Our work takes advantage on the composition of the bagasse to create a bioplastic that is of easy degradation and biocompatible. As mentioned, it  will take bagasse from the community to create bioplastic for the community, meaning that our supply will be for local and following a circular economy model in which a residue will serve us as primary matter without the carbon footprint of transport of other sources of glucose.
The value of the proposal is not only taking up a residue and eliminating the fact of consuming another source of glucose or sugars (whose transport and other activities produce carbon footprints) to produce bioplastic, but the fact that our proposal can be adapted for different vegetal residues to achieve a bioplastic production, in order to take advantage  of “useless” fibers and make a circular supply.
We know there is no single solution to the plastic problem but, unfortunately, correct waste management and recycling is not done everywhere, and consequences are for everyone. Context is key in determining how long it will take"

D What does the game tell us?
     After we further explored the game we created by ourselves, we find something more than just having fun. In fact, our game E.coli War has many deep meanings for us to explore. We have found it really interesting when we compare our game theories with typical historical events, which expands our games’ meaning to a historical and strategic level. Our smart team member Li Siting did such innovative work, which makes it possible for us broaden the usage of synthetic biology to social science and history research in the future. It is a brand new way for science advocating as it strengthens the story-telling ability of science and makes the public more interested in science. Therefore, it is very likely that we have made a huge step forward in the efforts to create science culture in our community. Click here for more details .

We will also be biobricking a promoter + RBS part; a brick we think will be of major use for future iGEM teams. Hard to believe the parts catalog doesn't already offer one. Anyway, having this part will enable teams to test genes as soon as they the can successfully amplify them and add the biobrick prefix and suffix. Using the promoter + RBS plasmid as the screening plasmid will mean that transformants will be expressing the gene of interest right away.

They possess, like other eukaryotic viruses, easiness to integer genetic information of therapeutic interest inside their capsid and an easiness to target a marker. Nevertheless, they enter badly in eukaryotic cells and their immunogenicity is very strong as well.
To finish, last vector of the biological class, bacteria. This vector type, one of the most original, is not very studied and only developed in laboratories. Principally used for protein secretion in vivo, this vector cannot transfect cell of interest. Trials were tested on inflammation secretion factor, or another immunostimulating agent, in tumors. In addition to its inability to transduce genetic information in cell of interest, bacterial vectors are immunogene and potentially dangerous for humans. This vector type still exists because it brings some particular possibilities. The bacterial vector can target a tissue and deliver a therapeutic protein, it is easy to produce as well and in some cases, depending of the strain, it resists to the immune system.
In the second vector class, we find lipidic and polymeric nanoparticle vectors.
Nanoparticle vectors are colloidal systems; their structure is composed of lipids or polymers, biodegradable if possible. Nanoparticles can be matricial; in this case, active principle can be dispersed or dissolved in the matrix and be released only by a simple diffusion or after biodegradation in the organism. Nanoparticles can be a type of reservoir, in this case, they are constituted by a central nucleus usually liquid and surrounded by a thin wall of lipids or polymers which the thickness is not over some nanometers.
Lipidic nanoparticles have the advantage to be biomimetic and biodegrable, moreover, they are not stable, their DNA compaction capacity is 40 to 50 less important than a virus of the same size and they are highly immunogene, even if they have “stealth” molecules (e.g. PEG).
Polymeric nanoparticles are more stable than there lipidic homologous, but their entry in cells is weaker. They have a potential toxicity and are immunogene as well, even if they have “stealth” molecules.
Each vector type has its own properties, but they have some issues as well. Vectorization technologies have several recurrent issues, specific or not to a type of vector.

Similarly, in low-cell density solutions of V. cholerae, the RFP should become activated. If our E.coli activates the same gene in both the HCD and LCD environments, then something in the construct is not working correctly. One of the problems that we might have is whether or not the sRNA genes will clone in successfully. We will be able to determine whether or not they do when we place the E coli in a site with HCD and LCD of cholera. If the rfp is activated in both then we will know that the sRNA’s weren’t transferred in succesfully and we will need to  figure out a different approach.
In analyzing the plasmids from last year’s work, we found that last year they only cloned in genes 2-7. Gene 1 still needs to be cloned into our plasmids prior to our inserting the plasmid into our E. coli. We are also going to finish the plasmid sequence of the plasmids from last year so that we can sequence them to ensure that they were successful in cloning in the genes that they wanted. In all, we have a cloning site of around 1,000 bp that we are going to check. Clarise started working on the primer details to make sure we have enough primers to cover the entire gene during sequencing. So far it looks like the only gene that we need to insert another primer in is the first one, which is LuxPQ. We need to finish this by Wednesday so that we can submit the cloning site to the sequencing center by Thursday.
We also requested a strain of V. cholerae from Dr. Robison’s lab. They will have it ready for us on Wednesday so that we can begin working on calibrating our growth conditions to get the best biofilm growth possible. Last year’s team had trouble getting good cholera biofilm growth, so we are going hit this issue immediately to solve the problem.
Research:
Whitney also researched the following articles pertaining to biofilm degradation in preparation for our attempts to degrade the cholerae biofilm using the quorum sensing system of cholera to trigger a response from our E. coli:

Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations."" (cite from the website)
Why PSO?
In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Compared to GA, the advantages of PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that this algorithm is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Basic Formulas of PSO
First we must be clear with several concepts:
particle:have a position and a velocity, fly through parameter space
velocity: velocity of a particle in the parameter space
pbest: The best solution a particle has achieved so far
lbest: Best solution obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle
gbest: The best solution achieved by all particles so far
Parameters used in PSO algorithm:
Number of Particles:
learning factors <math>c_{1}</math>, <math>c_{2}</math>
inertial factor <math>w</math>
range of parameter and velocity on each dimension
optimization threshold
The particles update their positions and velocities with following equation:
<math>v[] = w*v[] + c_{1}*rand()*(pbest[]-postion[]) + c_{2}*rand()*(gbest[] - position[])</math>
<math>position[] = position[] + v[]</math>
where <math>c_{1}</math> and <math>c_{2}</math> are two learning factors, we choose <math>c_{1}=c_{2}=2</math>. Particles' velocities on each dimension are clamped to a maximum velocity <math>V_{\max }</math>. If the sum of accelerations would cause the velocity on that dimension to exceed <math>V_{\max }</math>. Then the velocity on that dimension is limited to <math>V_{\max }</math>. If a particle's position go beyond the range of parameter, we will set"

St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we decided to forget about it (at least for now).  We ligated Δ12, Δ15 and Δ6 into our duet vectors. These were transformed into BL21 cells, which were induced with IPTG, fed with 18:1 fatty acid, and grown at 16C. These cells were used for analysis of protein expression and to obtain their lipid profile. We are also getting ready our duet vector containing Δ12 by digesting it with the appropriate restriction enzymes for ligation of Δ15 into the second cloning site, and in this way obtain the first two desaturases in our pathway in the same vector. After a lot of hard work this week, we are all looking forward to week 10 and obtaining results that will determine if our lab work these past 9 weeks was worth it or not!
Week 10
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
Bl21 cells containing Ni 1 were induced and cell with Ni 2 insert were lysed and Ni 2 protein was extracted using   Ni and GST beads. Impurities were removed using spin columns and washed with PBS. Trial run was done to optimize UV/Visible spectrum experiments.Ni1 and Ni2 protein solutions were mixed with NiCl2 solution for UV/Visible spectrum experiments.   Colony PCR was done for Pt and Pd samples. 4 colonies with positive results were grown up in liquid medium and miniprep was done. Mininipreps were used for DH5α transformation. More expression cells were grown up and proteins were extracted for UV/Visible spectrum experiments. Precious and toxic gBlockTM were transform into BL21 expression cells.BL21 cell were induced.
""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
A few words describing our final week of iGEM, by the Omega Squad: excitement, stress, happiness, frustration, impatience, back to happiness… So it seems like, except for Elongase 6, we were able to successfully ligate our genes into our duet vectors, and we have one duet vector both with Δ12 and Δ15. All of our minipreps were transformed into BL21 cells, proteins expressed, and the lipid extracts of cells in addition to extracts of membrane assays subjected to FAME analysis through GC-MS. We were really happy and satisfied with our results: (1) Cells expressing Δ12 desaturase showed 18:2 fatty acids when fed with 18:1. (2) Cells expressing Δ12 desaturase and Δ15 desaturase showed 18:3 fatty acids (our Omega-3!). (3)"

The results of the surveys are mentioned below.
The Human Body
Our next station, the human body was dedicated to anatomy and the various functions of our organs. Here we demonstrated a breathing machine. Our audience were able to get involved with the breathing machine where they were able to control the expansion and expulsion of the lungs and physically see how the diaphragm and the lungs work together in order for us to respire. We also created some puzzles of different organs in the human body, allowing the children to identify what organs belong in the body. Once the puzzle was completed we then explained how each organ functioned and why it is essential to the human body for survival.
Light Source
Our final station was supervised by our physicist. We allowed the children to look through a prism to split the light to get an idea of light reflection and absorption. The refraction of the light allowed them to see the different colours of the light spectrum. In conjunction with our project, we explained to the older audience the basics of a Green Fluorescent Protein component and how it is integrated in with our project.
Open Day
During the two open days at the University of Kent that occurred on the 7 th and 21 st October, we engaged aspiring potential undergraduate students by explaining our experience with STEM and iGEM. We did this by presenting our project to them and then holding a Q&A session afterwards.
Social Media
Our social media is based on platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. This allowed us to engage with a wider range of the community, not just locally but nationally as well. On these platforms we engaged with other participants in iGEM within the UK where a meetup was organised at the University of Westminster, UCL and Warwick. At this convention each team had the opportunity to present their current process, receive feedback from other teams and help each other with any difficulties, e.g. with modelling. Also, after the Jamboree we will be producing a vlog that overviews our summer with iGEM including our work at the Jamboree. Please feel free to visit our links to the social media which are available at the bottom of our page.

Content
Here is the detailed explain for our project.
Overall project summary
Recent years, there were some researches aiming to solve specific mathematical problems using synthetic biology, one of which even shed lights on the possibility of solving Hamilton Problem in engineered bacteria. Inspired by them, we are trying to design and construct gene circuits to deal with other problem in graph theory. What we want to prove is that the organism have potential for computation as long as they are designed appropriately.
Project Details
SPP-for-short problem asks the shortest pathway between two given points in a directed graph. We came up with an idea to translate this shortest of space into quickest of time with the help of transcriptional cascades in Escherichia coli. That is to say that we build gene circuits to encode a directed graph where each nodes and edges within are represented by certain promoters and TFs respectively. Then a proof-of-concept experiment in vivo was carried to confirm the validation of this design.
Materials and Methods
We used several parts from iGEM registry and constructed five new parts and devices. The experiments involved are basic ones in gene engineering including gene amplification and expression; polymerase chain reaction; electrophoresis etc.
The Experiments
Results
We designed a series of genetic circuits in Escherichia coli forming a regulatory network in order to translate the form of mathematical problem from geometrical graph into biological structure. The nodes and arrows are marked by well-assigned promoters and transcription factors (TFs) respectively. The promoter of destination node in SPP is followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. In this way, the connections among nodes in a directed graph are simulated by transcriptional regulation network. The temporal ordering of the fluorescent protein expression in bacteria reflects distance differences among varied paths, in which an individual bacteria clone containing the shortest pathway encoded gene would show fluorescent earlier than the others. In the following one bit knock-out process, we verified the phenotype which showed fluorescent earlier resulted from the genotype that represented the shortest pathway solution, shedding lights on that our encoding system functioned as expected with linear computation complexity and this approach is theoretically proved feasible.
Data analysis
Conclusions
The bio-computing method we have come up with is a brand-new way to solve the SPP problem effectively."

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#The Problem#Current Agriculture Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Golden rice, a variety of rice that had the benefit of producing beta-carotene (the precursor to Vitamin A), had been in development for years (it was on the cover of Time in 2000) but finally was going through experimental field trials last year until protest groups broke into the fields and tore up the plants (Harmon). Furthermore a cultural perspective was not taken into consideration during its initial development, wherein when scientist presented this  Golden Rice to villages in Africa, people claimed they wouldn't eat it because “yellow” rice was only for cattle. Another recent event was the destruction of €1.2 million worth of GM vines in Colmar, France by more than 50 activists, who were later cleared of all charges because “the open-air crop trial was illegal because authorities did not properly assess the risk to the local environment.”, even though the trial itself was for assessment and posed no risk (Gross). In order to sustain food security for the future, we need a new paradigm in Agriculture, one that is safe for consumers, sustainable, and can earn the trust of the public in a way GMOs to date have failed.
However, it is not just raw food production that is the problem. Global malnutrition, the issue arising from people eating food but not getting sufficient amounts of nutrients, is much more widespread than global hunger, the problem of people not eating enough food. Given these two trends, agriculture today faces two main challenges: how to increase food production without increasing land area used for farming without depending on chemical fertilizers and how to increase the nutritional value of food so that what is produced still provides the proper nutrients for a balanced diet.
