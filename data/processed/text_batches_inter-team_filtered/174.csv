We found these activities to be an excellent starting points for the many dialogs we had with parents and some students about genomes and how we now have the capability to change those genomes, and what the implications of that would be. In these dialogs, we strived to get across the point that they, as much as scientists and policy makers and regulators can be and need to be participants in shaping the genetic engineering technology developed.
With regards to mathematical modeling, John Marken from the William and Mary iGEM has helped us greatly with Matlab, which we were using for our mathematical model. We were having difficulty writing Matlab code to extract model parameters. Through many emails, John gave us invaluable advice on how to approach the optimization, constraints, and gave us code segments to write the iterative routine for the optimization. We are very grateful to John for his assistance.
University of Virginia iGEM
We contacted UVA iGEM in June and had a phone call meeting. At that meeting with Madeline Stone, we talked of ways we could help each other out. UVA iGEM was creating an E.coli  kill switch for their project and we were doing our own research for a yeast kill switch. Even though the two designs were going to be very different, they gave us some very useful tips and feedback on how to approach a kill switch design. We completed a survey on biocontainment that University of Virginia sent out to iGEM teams.
LMU-TUM Munich iGEM
We encountered Munich iGEM’s 2013 survey when we were researching how to write a survey. Liking their approach, we contacted them and got their permission to base some of our survey questions off their survey. We created our own survey with theirs as a guide,  and distributed the survey during public outreach events.We participated in their team’s outreach by completing the 2016 Munich iGEM survey on “entrepreneurship in iGEM”. We supported their further by meeting via Skype to further discuss entrepreneurship in iGEM.

Our collaboration with Armstrong has continued since 2015 iGEM. However, continuation of this relationship was not automatic, our team had to prove to iGEM VPs and senior staff that that our past year’s work and intent for future work had merit worthy of continued collaboration.

To quantify the amount of copper in the samples that were collected, we used Phen Green SK dye, which is proportionally quenched in the presence of copper [22]. Phen Green SK dye was prepared in a stock solution in PBS (28 µM final concentration). Two hundred  µL of this stock solution was added to each well in a 96-well plate to which 25 µL of sample was added. All experiments were done in triplicate, and a standard curve was generated for Cu and PGSK to determine the amount of Cu in the tested solutions.
Mission Architecture
On another planet, mycelia will grow and expand to provide structural integrity for the house, inside which the astronauts will live. However, the mycelia requires a substrate (food) and oxygen to grow. Where will these supplies come from? Cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria are self-replicating, photosynthetic organisms that can convert the abundant carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into oxygen. This oxygen can be used to grow the mycelia, as well as to keep astronauts healthy and alive inside the habitat. Moreover, it has been shown that mycelia can use cyanobacteria as a substrate (food) to grow (at normal Earth gas concentrations). Our goal in this experiment is to demonstrate and quantify the oxygen production capabilities of a specific strain of cyanobacteria, known as Anabaena variabilis. Achieving Earth-like percentages of oxygen (~20%) solely from the Anabaena, in combination with existing knowledge, would demonstrate the feasibility of cyano-based mycelial growth and Astronaut sustenance.
All experimentation was conducted inside an airtight, Nasco Whirl-Pak bag (total volume: 1627 mL). Two BD Gaspak Anaerobe Sachets were used to help establish an anoxic environment (down to .8% O2); Dry ice was used to establish a 90% + CO2 atmosphere, mimicking the Martian atmosphere. Wireless CO2 and O2 sensors measured the gas compositions over time, for the respective gases.

BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0 Specifications
Design Philosophy
BioBrick-A-Bot is designed as an easily extensible, plug-and-play system, that is made up of LegoRoboBricks.  Each LegoRoboBrick is a self-contained unit that consist of a single NXT brick connected to 1-3 motors. Currently, the ALPHA NXT brick is the Master Brick and the rest of the bricks are Slave brick that are connected to the Master. All Physical Constants are to be externalized and specified in terms of “Lego Units”. The Lego Unit is defined as the distance between 2 Lego Pins. In Version 1.0, we have 2 bricks, ALPHA and PHI that are mounted on a frame BETA. Version 2.0 will add another brick called MU (Movement Utility). MU will be used to automatically move Petri Dishes and 96-Well Plates. We will also allow user-defined LegoRoboBricks in version 2.0. The vision is that more iGEM teams can replicate our prototype and extend the functionallity by building their own user defined LegoRoboBricks.

Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

RiboSense Design Process
Having decided that we wanted our project to be centred around biosensing, we realised that what we did would need to be compatible with what was already in the registry, as well as any subsequent sensors that people might develop. We therefore went through the registry, and the wikis of the last three years, scouting for sensing parts made by other teams. We found a wide variety of inducible promoters, but very few riboswitch-based sensors. Through our own research, we have found that, whilst there may only be a dozen or so well characterised riboswitches at present, they hold a great deal of potential. We draw this conclusion from the wide availability, and high degree of specificity of the nucleic acid aptamers already on the market. Given that riboswitches are effectively aptamers whose alternative conformations either affect access to regulatory cis sequences, or which add or remove hairpins and other terminator constructs, we believe there is potential for these"

Rate of toxin production.>Diagram explaining antisense RNA
Our project aims to create a phage which will suppress toxin production in C. difficile once integrated into its genome. To do this we will genetically modify a phage known to infect strains of C. difficile named phiSBRC. The phage will be modified to include constructs to suppress toxin production either via a CRISPRi (dead-Cas9) approach or via asRNA. There were several design considerations when approaching this problem. Firstly the construct should be capable of significantly suppressing toxin production, it was not known whether dead-Cas9 or asRNA would be superior in this respect. Secondly, the eventual genetic construct we choose should be sufficiently small that we can alter the phage genome without adversely affecting its normal function. One potential limitation was thought to be the total amount of DNA which the phage could package into its head. In this respect asRNA could have a significant advantage over a dead-Cas9 approach since the total size of the genetic construct can be much smaller. Antisense RNA constructs can simply consist of a promoter and a short asRNA region of less than 100bp while the cas9 gene alone is more than 4kb long. However, since it was not known which approach would produce more effective toxin suppression both approaches were pursued.
C. difficile has two well characterised toxins which cause epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis these are TcdA and TcdB. It was thought that each construct we create should aim to supress both of these toxins simultaneously since research has concluded that each can operate independently from the other (Kuehne et al., 2010). The general form of our constructs therefore is to have asRNA parts downstream of promoters with a transcriptional terminator between these promoter-asRNA pairs. It was thought to use two different promoters to as to avoid unwanted recombination events within our constructs. As discussed previously, the optimal promoter for expressing the asRNA parts was thought to be the strongest promoter possible. We were therefore looking for the two strongest promoters in C. difficile we could find. Our results from the promoter assays we performed indicate that PCsp_fdx¬ is the strongest promoter assayed in C. difficile. Unfortunately we were unable to clone the GusA reporter plasmid for PCac_thl which was the other Clostridial promoter expected to give strong expression. However, the PCac_thl GFP reporter plasmid was created and assayed in E. coli where it gave the highest expression of any promoter tested including the positive control used in"

Safety and ethics
Prof. LAM Hon Ming is a faculty of School of Life Sciences in Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He is also a director of molecular biotechnology program and Center for Soybean Research in CUHK. His research field involves genomic and functional genomic studies of soybean and identification and characterization of functional genes to improve abiotic stress tolerance and disease resistance in plants. Prof. Lam helped us reflect upon the real life application of our project and led us to some new potential ideas regarding future application. He also talked extensively about safety and ethical issues that were relevant to synthetic biology and our project in general. The interview has greatly helped us to explore the non-technical aspects of our iGEM project that we have not yet examined in depth.
Interview with Professor LAM Hon Ming
Fig 1. Interview with Prof. Lam Hon Ming from Chinese University of Hong Kong
On the 26th of August 2014, the HKUST iGEM team recruited a group of members to interview Prof. Lam, director of the molecular biotechnology program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). We aimed to consult Prof. Lam about our main project- “Pneumosensor: Finding Pneumo”, in particular the safety and ethical aspects.
We have asked him for the general outlook of synthetic biology in the context of Hong Kong and of the world. He kindly replied by describing synthetic biology as a “promising way to make new things.” He agreed that synthetic biology is no longer confined in the field of biology but has since become an interdisciplinary field. He mentioned that synthetic biology has been “especially successful in bacteria” and proposes synthetic biology as a prospective area of science because it has the potential to provide  “new ways to handle environmental problems for which the later generation will try hard to further work on.”
On the question of ethical questionability of synthetic biology, Prof."

The pre-4bp sequences contain the information of identification point, the mid-4bp sequences contain the information of the specified line, and the post-4bp contain the information of the path length. Through DNA Gel electrophoresis and Sequencing analysis, <2-6-8> proved to be the shortest pathway. The calculated actual length of <2-6-8>  is 28 mile in the reality.
Improved part BBa_K1341020
Solution24578 is the shortest pathway in the project of 2014 of AHUT-China, which Node NO.5 is a necessary node to be passed in order to get to Node NO.8. However, in our project of this year, we don’t have to pass Site NO.5 while taking Site NO.2 as the start point and Site NO.8 as the terminal, which provides us with more diverse pathway choices and more conforms to the real situation. In our project of 2016, the DNA single strands of the sites and lines are connected by bridging-PCR. 12 information bits are added to the DNA single strand of the lines, which the pre-4bp sequences contain the information of identification point, the mid-4bp sequences contain the information of the specified line, and the post-4bp contain the information of the path length. In order to obtain Solution24578, it needs to construct recombinant plasmid in every possible pathway. And then the recombinant plasmid was inserted in E.coli, where the fluorescent protein gene in Node NO.5 get expressed. Thus, all the pathways passing Node NO.5 screened out. By contrast, we don’t have to go through a series of complex process like what have been depicted above in order to obtain the shortest pathway <2-6-8> in this year.

Thereby the yield of the strains increases. When high-yielding bacterium gain growth advantages, in the process of continuous selection, the degraded strains will gradually lose the competitive advantage. Thereby we can achieve the purpose of controlling the degradation of strains. The advantage of our module is that it can be used to select strains without antibiotics thereby reducing the use of antibiotics, and can be applied to a wide range of industrial production such as food and medicine.

The combination of the Cas9 system with DNA repair sequences enables not only knockouts of peroxisomal proteins, but also allows redirecting protein localization by changing protein targeting signals or integration of linear DNA into yeast chromosomes. Genome engineering facilitates yeast strain development for customized peroxisomes.

Repair DNA sequences can be used to increase the efficiency for Cas9 guided knocking out of specific genes, but would also allow genomic integration of targeting signals or complete genes.  Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
The peroxisomal proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
The peroxisomal proteome is studied extensively for saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains exactly 67 proteins ( Kohlwein et al. 2013 ). The function is characterized for the most of those proteins and it is known, that yeast peroxisomes are expendable under optimal growth conditions. Nevertheless, some knockouts are lethal under oleate or stress conditions.

Proteorhodopsin
The proteorhodopsin (PR) plasmid originated from  UNTN-Trento’s 2015 design. The Blh gene and PR protein were placed under the J23100 T7 constitutive promoter in the high copy pSB1C3 backbone, which confers negative selection through chloramphenicol resistance. We chose constitutive expression to attain maximum power production in the shortest amount of time, while also minimizing the cost and amount of feed components necessary. This combination will ultimately make a cell that can run off of minimally treated wastewater. Proteorhodopsin is post-transcriptionally controlled through light dependency and pH-dependent conformational changes which make its activity negatively correlated with H+ ion concentration. The Blh gene upstream of proteorhodopsin cleaves beta-carotene into two molecules of retinal, which is a cofactor required by proteorhodopsin. A second plasmid containing the beta-carotene synthesis pathway, also from UNITN-Trento, was designed to allow the cell to operate without manually inducing  beta carotene addition after initial tests with the simpler design.  
NADH Oxidase
An NADH oxidase circuit was designed using the H2O-forming Nox from Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 (sequence from NCBI). A his-tagged part under the constitutive J23100 promoter  was constructed to characterize protein concentration and oxygen scavenging.  Nox converts electron-rich NADH into NAD+. This increases the energy needs of the cell and could cause imbalances that harm growth. We planned on placing Nox under the oxygen-activated Pndh promoter (Paris Saclay 2013) to quickly restore anoxia after oxygen sparging in the MEC without giving the facultative anaerobe E coli a competitive advantage. Both plasmids tested were placed under the high-copy pSB1C3 plasmid backbone incorporated chloramphenicol resistance. The Pndh-controlled nox plasmid was designed with the pSB1A3 am"

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction. What can science bring to the public and what science gets in return is an interesting topic that we would like to explore.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pneumosensor#module one_-_-_TEXT.html," competence.      Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific. Our team aims to adopt the specific CSP sensing mechanism of S. pneumoniae to detect its populations.
The mechanism we adopted is controlled by a two-component regulatory system (TCS), which consists of the histidine kinase (HK) ComD and its      cognate response regulator (RR) ComE ( BBa_K1379051 ).  When CSP binds to it, ComD autophosphorylates to become phospho-ComD, ComD~P; at the expenditure of ATP.      The cytosolic protein ComE is then phosphorylated by ComD~P through transphosphorylation reactions, producing ComE~P. Genes coding for ComD and ComE are constitutively      expressed in our Pneumosensor.
ComE~P binds to repeat sites adjacent to the comCDE and comAB operons (Ween et al., 1999), creating a positive      feedback loop, producing both pre-CSP and its required machinery for maturation and transport. The signal is thus amplified and competence is      coordinated throughout the population.
As part of our detection circuit design, we make use of the inducible promoter from the comCDE operon, PcomCDE. We obtain the sequence by oligos,      and will characterize it using green fluorescence protein (GFP) that we constructed the downstream of the promoter by BioBrick RFC10. Rather than using ComE~P that has to     be phosphorylated by ComD~P, which involves a chain of reactions, we use a phosphorylmimetic ComE mutant, ComED58E, kindly     shared with us by Bernard Martin et al. After characterization of PcomCDE, we hope to put PcomCDE together with the S. pneumoniae σx promoters module, for the ultimate goal of creating a tightly regulated automatic detection of S. pneumoniae.
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module Description
σx - Com-Box mechanism
Figure 1. σx-Com-Box promoter mechanism
The reporter system contains a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for Com-Box promoter induction. σx will then bind to Com-Box promoter and express green fluorescence protein. The whole construct was built in E. coli DH10B strain.

I am a second-year Biochemistry and Genetics student and spend most of my time in the lab. You can’t imagine how happy I am to be a part of Nottingham iGEM team – you get to carry out actual experiments, work on realistic problems and present your work in Boston! This does seem to me like a start of great “how I spent my summer” essay, doesn’t it? When I don’t need to run gels or pray for good results, I enjoy watching horror movies, doing Wing Chun and reading. An interesting fact about me is that I can play 4 instruments, skate and convincingly lie. I hope that I can help our team to make it to the top 3 and show the world anyone can do science that changes the world!

I wanted to join iGEM team not only to broaden my knowledge and experience on synthetic biology but also to get involved in various human practices in science. In my spare time, I go to training for taekwondo, a martial art which contains different kicks and punches. Sometimes, I am beaten by serious fighters, but it is really great to win a sparring- and I have won a silver medal last year! An interesting fact about me is that I can distinguish origins of coffee beans by tasting the coffee. I can tell the differences of their tastes (by degree of bitterness, sweetness, sourness, and smokiness) thanks to my dad who is enthusiastic about learning different types of coffee!

The second mutation we introduced was meant to weaken the ferritin cage so it can be disassembled more easily. By shortening the C-terminus of the ferritin subunit removing two structural parts the E-helix and the DE turn (see Figure 2) the resulting part BBa_K2638602 should disassemble at a less destructive pH of below 4 instead of being below 2 for wild type human ferritin (Chen H. 2016).
Figure 2: Wild type ferritin with the E-helix and DE turn colored in green.
We then combined both mutations into one part BBa_K2638603 . We had the hope to end up with a ferritin version that combines booth strengths being easily assembled and filled with a payload of interest and made stable again by adding copper ions afterwards.
To test if the different mutant ferritin variants show the desired properties we planned to disassemble the different ferritin mutants into single subunits first by changing the pH as described in the literature (Chen H. 2016). After the disassembly step we would mix two different ferritin subunits for example one with a mTagBFP tag BBa_K2638610 and one with a His Tag.
The His Tag carring ferritin BBa_K2638614 could bind to the his purification column while the mTagBFP tagged subunit could not bind to the column on its own. Only if the his and mTagBFP tagged ferritin subunits successfully disassembled and after mixing them and bringing the pH back to normal reassembled, would we expect to see his purification columns that fluorescent.  All the mutations to the ferritin were introduced by primers binding to the synthetized HuHF sequence and the resulting PCR products were combined via Gippson Assembly.  We used primers either binding to the synthesized HuFH, the mTagBfp or the ends of the vector to introduce overhangs for adding the linker, the his tag and the mTagBFP to the ferritin heavy chain. The linker was introduced to keep the mTagBFP from being too close to the ferritin subunit possibly resulting in steric hindrance. Steric hindrance could influence the assembly process of our mutant ferritin. mTagBFP and linker where attached to the N-terminus of the ferritin since the N-terminus is positioned on the outside of the ferritin cage.
For protein purification we choose a commercial intein tag which cleaves itself of"

As our chassis for UV-A testing we chose the E. coli strain DS941, which exhibited increased survivability under UV illumination when compared to both TOP10 and DH5α in our UVA illumination survival study. DS941 cells carrying K1725430.pSB1C3 plasmid were made chemically competent (Protocols) and transformed with the K1725445.pSB3K3 plasmid. Resulting transformants were cultured, miniprepped, and checked with a diagnostic digest to check presence of both plasmids. Three of the transformants checked appeared correct under diagnostic restriction digest. We then designed an experiment to determine whether sunlight UVA illumination would result in expression of GFP from our assembled uirS two plasmid system.
Six E. coli strains were tested:
3 different DS941 transformants expressing both sensor and response plasmids
DS941 with K1725430 Response plasmid alone
DS941 with K1725445 Sensor plasmid alone
DS941 cells only
Cells were cultured overnight then 1 ml of o/n was added to 20 ml of fresh broth in a 100 ml conical flask, and incubated with shaking @ 37c for 2 hours. Then 10 ml of each cell culture was added to two empty Petri Dishes, one for sunlight illumination and one to be kept in darkness. Sunlight plates were placed on a tray by a window, and darkness plates were wrapped in tinfoil. After 5 hours 1ml of cells from each plate was pippetted into fresh eppendorf tubes, spun down to a pellet in a microfuge, and then resuspended in Phosphate binding solution (PBS: see interlab study protocol for full methodology). 200 µl of each cell type was placed in a microwell plate along with blank PBS as a control, and  scanned with a Typhoon fluorescence reader (see interlab study protocol for full methodology).
No fluorescence above that exhibited by the cells-only control wells was observed, indicating that our assembly of the uirS two component system did not function. At this point there was not sufficient time remaining prior to the jamboree"

Brief Description:
The human practice in India happened at Orchard School in K.K.Nagar, Trichy, India. The interaction session with the students was supposed to be an hour long but ended being around 2 hours and a half. During the session with the students, topics such as studying abroad for STEM, numerous ways to get involved outside of academics and possible career pathways were discussed. Since Trichy is a small city, not many students were aware of opportunities to study abroad or about the different fields of education they could pursue. Students tended to limit themselves to a selected few majors like Law, Engineering, Medicine or Accountancy. While there were a few interested in sciences, that interest was also limited to the mainstream science courses like physics, biology and chemistry.Hence in this session, the iGEM member spoke to the students about different university options in and outside of India and also about different academic paths they could choose.
The discussion about career paths ranging from game design, cyber security to forensic science and chartered accountancy was interesting to both the students and the teachers, as the school management was not aware of the students’ interest in these fields. The focus was mainly on STEM"

The impact of catalyzing innovation within such a new field, a field where there is potentially lives to be saved. Suffering to be alleviated.
We are aware that we are wandering into new frontiers. And that with it comes exploring the  “new”, and that it with that comes the “unknown” and with the “unknown” is the the fear of it, of the unexpected. We argue that there is both a will and a way before us, and we know what they say about that.
The will is to alleviate suffering, to save lives the way; one way, is through the application of technology: If it was not for the application of we would have life expectancy significant below and mortalities significant higher than it is today. We create solutions for ourselves and others and that is one factor to what makes us great. We should keep that in mind when looking to future challenges, and to new frontiers. We have solutions and we should apply them accordingly, be it through synthetic biology or not.
In furtherance to that point, we address the issue regarding  applying synthetic biology.
Technology, Synthetic biology and Safety
Taking our project into account, the application does not raise alarms. We are working with closed contained products without any living organisms. The parts we are using are safe. We are applying genetic modified organisms (GMOs) to produce the recombinant proteins going into the device, thereby preventing any exposure and release of dangerous unfavorable organisms.
However, even though our project is not utilising the most controversial tools of synthetic biology, there are still some important ethical aspects that have to be considered, and we are continuously aware of the power of technology and the responsibility that"

Collaboration with iGEM Team Bielefeld
Team Bielefeld sent us  a plasmid based on BBa_I746909 having a translation enhancing sequence (5’-UTR). We, the iGEM team Freiburg, sent a plasmid containing coding sequences for turboYFP, a His- and a Halo-Tag. We aimed to analyze if these parts will work in different cell-free protein synthesis environments.
To test the plasmid BBa_I746909 containing a translation enhancing sequence (5'-UTR) we performed a cell-free expression with our own mix and compared it to a sample containing no DNA (negative control).
Both samples were treated alike and compared. All reactions were performed in duplicates.  The samples were expressed for 4 hours at 37°C in a 384-well plate using our DiaMIX. After expression, the graph clearly indicates successful expression of GFP. This underlines the ability of the DiaMIX to express vectors from various sources and the effectiveness of a 5'UTR.
Figure 1: Expression of BBa_I746909. The expression was conducted for 4 h and relative fluorescence measured in one minute steps. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from duplicates.
Collaboration with iGEM Team Stockholm
Stockholm sent us the lysate of a HER2 domain binding affibody with a His-tag as well as a glycerol stock of the E. coli Top10 strain they used for expression and organized the sponsoring of the HER2-antigen from R&D-systems.
Freiburg tried to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the His-affibody lysate in iRIf.

Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot, by developing new Modules. Currently, we have developed only 2 Modules, called ALPHA and PHI. We planned to build a third Module called MU as described in V2.0 of the specification. Other teams are also encouraged to build and share additional BioBrick-a-Bot Modules as well. In the next version of BioBrick-A-Bot, we will implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves Synchronization, to support three or more Modules, with ALPHA as the master.
Collaboration with other iGEM Team
Raik's Barcelona Team
One of our external team advisors, Raik Gruenberg , is interested to start a new team in Barcelona next year and replicate the existing ‘bot’ that we have. This is a good first step. Raik has also written some procedures for performing fusion assemblies . We will attempt to collaborate with his team and get our ‘bot’ to automate the procedure above too.
University of Washington Wet-Lab Team
We have also presented BioBrick-A-Bot to the University of Washington Wet-Lab Team (See Picture Gallery ).  Next year we could look into using one of our ‘bots’ to automate some of the mundane tasks in BioBrick assemblies.
The Vision of Future Collaboration
We built BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 as a prototype and provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it worked. V1.0 will however, not have the full range of functionalities of a commercial liquid handling robot. V1.0 will be made up of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a chassis called BETA. We will provide construction details and software so that other iGEM team can replicate and customize their own 'bot's.
In our next version, BioBrick-A-Bot V2.0, we will provide 3 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also support user-defined LegoRoboBrick modules too. We provide the mechanism where other iGEM teams can collaborate together to replicate, interchange and extend LegoRoboBricks. Many iGEM teams can contribute and share both Hardware Construction and Software Programs for LegoRoboBrick modules in a Registry, much like the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"". Our vision will be to make the technologies of creating and sharing 'bots' easily available, replacing labour"

    Additionally, we noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domain (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering may be applicable to other cases. We then expanded our reverse engineering strategy to cope with another common toxic heavy metal, lead (Borremans et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009; Mergeay et al., 2003). We primarily took lead resistance operon apart, followed by description of function, structure and operation of PbrR, a lead responsive regulator. Then modeling was conducted to analyze the characteristics of PbrR and topology of its regulation behavior. Information collected confirmed the possibility to design a genetic circuit whick can make lead sensor and regulator components more efficient and robust. Our engineered E.coli bioreporters is capable of discriminating different concentrations of lead ranging from 10^-8 to 10^-6, similar to mercury bioreporter mentioned above. We also engineered PbrR into single-chain coiled coil (MBP) via the same method as MerR. Exhilaratingly, the following inductive expression of PbrR MBP on the surface, in periplasm and in cytosol along with the lead (II) absorption test showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 95% of 10^-7M Pb (II) in 5 minutes, which is comparable to mercury MBP expression in E.coli, proving validness of our engineering strategy.

3.2 Fusion Protein Plasmid Construction
Aim: Design and construct the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ) into pACYCDuet-1 seen in figure 7.
Figure 7. Schematic overview of our fusion construct. The coding sequence was delivered in three parts: dxCas9 (blue), Tn5 (green) and Linker (red). The pACYCDuet-1 vector is also annotated.
Approach:
We cloned the fusion protein (dxCas9-linker-Tn5) coding sequence in front of the T7 promoter site of the pACYCDuet-1 vector in frame with the HIS purification tag. We used two separate restriction ligation cloning steps to assemble the construct. First, we PCR amplified the Tn5 coding sequence from Plasmid #60240 from Addgene containing pTXB1-Tn5 ( Picelli et al. 2014 ), simultaneously integrating the linker with extended primers. The Linker-Tn5 PCR amplicon was cloned into the isolated pACYCDuet-1 plasmid with restriction ligation using KpnI and FseI sites. Next, we PCR amplified the dxCas9 coding sequence from Plasmid #108383 from Addgene containing dxCas9 (3.7) from ( Miller et al. 2018 ). We cloned the dxCas9 amplicon into the isolated pACYCDuet-1-Lin-Tn5 plasmid with restriction ligation using NotI and FseI sites, resulting in a plasmid with  dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 coding sequence with a T7 promoter and terminator and a His-tag. As the protein production might cause undesired cell burden, we used the low copy P15A replication origin to propagate the plasmid in the cells.
3.3 Protein Expression and Purification
Aim: Express and purify the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ), as well as the individual proteins that comprise the fusion: Tn5 transposase ( BBa_K2643002 ) and dxCas9 ( BBa_K2643001 ) for in vitro functionality evaluation.
Approach: We followed existing expression and purification protocols for both Tn5 ( BBa_K2643002 ) ( Hennig et al. 2017 ) and dxCas9 ( BBa_K264"

1 construction of Device 1.0 and 2.0
1.1 Extract part (Table. 1)
1.2 Synthesis of microRNA Ji'nan biosune Biotechnology Co. Ltd. has synthesized has-miR-34c microRNA for our team.
1.3 design and synthesis of anti-microRNA Ji'nan biosune Biotechnology Co. Ltd. has designed the anti-microRNA of has-miR-34c for our team. And Nanjing GeneScript biological science and Technology Co., Ltd. has synthesized segment sequence (Fig. 1). The anti-microRNA we synthesized includes 4 linkers which can Exact complemented with matured microRNA. Prefix and suffix at the end of segment are applied to the construction of our circuit.
1.4 construction of the plasmid Using the property of the prefix and suffix, we did the 2A assembly to construct our Device 1.0. and 2.0 step by step（Fig. 2）.
2 Test Device 1.0
Device 1.0 microRNA would have a direct impact on GFP’s expression. Determining GFP’s fluorescence intensity differences will justify the content amount of microRNA (Fig. 3).
Transform the constructed plasmid in to E. coil Competent Cell.     Transform microRNA into our system, continuous observation on fluorescence intensity’s change (Fig. 4).
According to the figure, between the time intervals of 12-19 Hours, subject device(transforming microRNA) result in significant lower fluorescence intensity than Negative Control (NC).
Therefore, we start to test the impact of different concentration microRNA . We separately add 10uM unrelated microRNA, 10uM target microRNA and 20uM target microRNA in to our device. Afterword, use Flow Cytometry to collect data at 10 Hours (Fig. 5).
Needless to say, average expression rate shows a fine deceasing Gradient graphic, indicated that our system could not only determine the existence"

Second Blood Experiment
We did a second experiment that included the pig’s blood. The point of this experiment was to see the effect that our viper construct cells had on the blood as compared to our control cells (which contained PRNA cells) and also compared to just the blood that had the heparin mixed into it previously (filtered and nonfiltered).  For this experiment, we used another container of blood that had 70 mg of heparin already mixed into it. We added 10 mL of blood into 9 standard petri dishes. For one of our  petri dishes we just had the blood inside the dish as unfiltered, meaning that we just pipetted the blood with a volumetric pipette from the blood container into the petri dish.For the second dish we filtered the blood with kimwipes to see if there was any small clots that were in the blood still. For these two dishes we did not add anything else to them--these were strictly to see how the blood clotted by itself. For our control protein we used PRNA to determine if it would have any effect on clotting the blood or not. The PRNA was chosen for our control because it was just cells that did not have our construct in them. We added this PRNA to 3 of our dishes for our negative control dishes. Again we expected to see that the addition of the PRNA cells would have no effect on the blood in terms of clotting.For the first control dish, 1.0 mL of the PRNA cells to the blood. For the second dish, 2.0 mL of the cells was added and for the third control dish 2.0 mL of the cells was added along with 1.0 mg of heparin. We added 1.0 mL of our viper construct to another petri dish with just the 10 mL of blood mixed in. The second dish contained 1.0 mL of our construct, the blood and an additional 1 mg of heparin.  We also had another dish that had 2.0 mL of our construct in it as well. All of these dishes were timed over the span of 80 minutes to see at what point in time when half of the blood that was inside of the petri dish had coagulated.

Transformation of competent E.coli cells
by Fabio, Maher and Romain
We transformed in DH5α the following Biobrick:
BBa_J23119
Samples:
Concentrated
Undiluted
Diluted 10-1
Control
Results:
Concentrated: 99 colonies
Undiluted: 5 colonies
Diluted: 0
Control: 0
Conclusion: Since the first transformations experiments with the iGEM's Biobricks, none of the diluted samples have grown. The undiluted ones have grown in some cases. We conclude that for future experiments and mainly for the project, we must use concentrated cultures.

Analysis:
A clear band was seen in all lanes, so we have succesfully isolated DNA.
All bands appeared to be about 1000 kb smaller than the expected size. This could be due to the supercoiling of the plasmids. To verify this, the plasmids were cut with PstI: Digestion of plasmids

Bootcamp
At bootcamp, we have learned tons of biology in a matter of days.  As someone who hasn't taken biology in six years, I've had a hard time getting back into the mindset of learning biology as a subject, but I also remember much more than I expected to from my high school days.  The central dogma was a huge part of my high school experience.  I'm still adjusting to the idea that we can break into the central dogma—that we can alter DNA and change the DNA that will be created when the cell replicates, making more of the cells that were created by us.  It's a step beyond what I've thought about before, and I still feel overwhelmed by what I don't understand.

Surface Training
This week, I've been learning the basics of the programming that I'll be doing this summer.  I've never worked on the Microsoft Surface before, so I'll need a lot of practice before I can do any programming on my own.  It helps that I'll likely be pair programming all summer; between two of us who have relatively little C# experience, we can probably figure"

HZAU-China,2016,Team:HZAU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," their project and ideas . In tea break time, we communicated actively with other teams about our project, and received many good advice and suggestions.
By the way, the CCiC means “Central China iGEMers Consortium”. It’s origin from the 1st Central China iGEMers' meet up hosted by our team in 2014.
Mini talks with ZJU-iGEM
During the summer vacation ,6 members of our team went to Zhejiang University for a minitype communication.In the meeting we discussed the project and teams of each other. We got some useful feedback for our project ideas , and also some valuable advice about how to successfully plan and execute an iGEM project in general. It was a really inspiring communication that properly kicked off our thinking into human practices.
Enterprise and society
Combining with our program this year(bio-pattern formation in augmented reality),we are looking for a relevant and influential enterprise for further development. In the research and observation of our program, we are planning to bring in the monitoring function of computer in order to get a real time monitoring and adjustment of the bio-pattern which means connect the virtual world with the real cultivate, that’s the AR part of our program. So we decided to collaborate with Baofeng company which was a video player technology company in China to provide us the equipment we need. And using the impact of the company to present the public the vast amount of possibilities that synthetic biology has to offer to not only the scientific community, but also the public community.
Law and regulation
We are hammer at applying for a patent for our program this year (bio-pattern formation in augmented reality), the relevant data and information have been handed in to the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C."

Control coefficients of each parameter on the response time, calculated for different concentrations of V. cholerae. Enlarge
Red: parameters favouring a long response time
Green: parameters favouring a short response time
Black: parameters with no significant influence on the response time
Important conclusions can be reached from this analysis. First, we notice that the initial concentration in Vibrio harveyi as well as most of its parameters have a weak influence on the response time (coefficients close to 0, white). This implies that V. harveyi works as a simple inducer: a small number of cells is sufficient to sense CAI-1 and produce enough diacetyl to activate Pichia pastoris. On the contrary, Pichia pastoris concentration and other parameters related to AMP efficiency (IC50, k kill Vc) exert a significant control on the response time, because a high antimicrobial peptides (AMP) concentration is required to kill V. cholerae. Efforts to optimize the system and speed up its response should thus focus in engineering the expression system (P. pastoris) to increase the rate of AMPs production, or to improve the efficiency of AMPs (e.g. by using a different AMP), rather than improving the sensor and transmission parts. Interestingly, the device volume also appears to be a key parameters for our system. For further developments, we should consider carefully AMP properties (death rate, IC50 regarding Vibrio cholerae), as well as the AMP expression system Pichia pastoris and its concentration in the device.
Conclusion
Our model analysis gave us promising results about the efficiency and robustness of the system.  We demonstrated it shows a robust behavior under fluctuating conditions, and identified the most controlling parameters that should be tuned to improve its response, hence guiding the design of an improved system. Pichia pastoris initial concentration ([Pichia pastoris]0) appeared to be the more relevant parameter to optimize, because its value can be directly changed without any molecular or microbial engineering approach. To evaluate further its impact, we thus simulated the response time for a wide range of P. pastoris concentrations (from 106 to 1012 cells), and under a wide range of contamination levels (V. cholerae concentration from 4.104 to 4.108).
Response time as function of two major parameters: Vibrio cholerae and Pichia pastoris concentrations
Under all the situations tested here, the response time remains below 120 minutes, even at low Pichia"

The scientists at Fraunhofer described the current state of the microfluidics field, raising concerns of the lack of documentation and standardization of microfluidic devices.
When we explored these concerns further, our team realized that if we were to build an application-agnostic system, we would have to account for the lack of standardization of microfluidic chips. In order to ensure TERRA is compatible with chips of all sizes and designs, we needed a method of standardizing the input to our system. Our team created the idea of a scalable, standardized microfluidic chip that would act as an adapter to our system: the TERRA Adapter.

Phenomyx is a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts which works with circulating tumor cells and building a system for the phenotypic screening of the metastatic potential of CTCs. They incorporate microfluidic devices with biology in many of their products and workflows.
On July 3rd, 2018, our team met with Salil from Phenomyx and presented information about our system TERRA and our motivations and goals of our project. We discussed the potential applications of TERRA and how our system would fit into the workflow of microbiologists and the microfluidic industry.
Salil suggested that our system should be able to operate with various designs of microfluidic devices, not only chips fabricated using the Boston University CIDAR Lab protocol. This would increase the accessibility of TERRA to the greater microfluidic and synthetic biology community. To incorporate Salil’s feedback, we developed the TERRA Adapter. This microfluidic device allows our system to be compatible with any microfluidic chip by taking the output of a chip and controlling the dispensal of the output. This allows our system to be compatible with a variety of microfluidic devices and standardizes the control element of our system.

Do-it-yourself Biology Labs
Do-it-yourself biology labs are community labs that aim to democratize biotechnology by hosting public workshops and community projects, supporting aspiring scientists in the community, and making lab equipment more accessible. A unique aspect of DIY bio labs is their push for open-source lab equipment because acquiring lab equipment, even secondhand, is difficult. Due to the DIY and open-sourced nature of TERRA, we believed that TERRA could be adopted by DIY"

This might have been a better option, as the efficiency of non-CRISPR-Cas9 induced HR is lower for a non-marker gene. This would have allowed us to more easily distinguish between CRISPR-Cas9-mediated and non-CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene integration.
2. PEX10 knock-out
In order to disrupt PEX10, we used the same pCRISPRyl-derived plasmid (pIW357) as described above. However, instead of using the Y. lipolytica PO1fΔKu70 strain, we used the Y. lipolytica PO1f strain, as we were aiming for PEX10 disruption through error-prone NHEJ (Figure 9). We thus transformed pIW357 into our selected strain and screened transformants for the inability to grow on a medium that contained solely long-chain fatty acids as a carbon source (SC-oleic acid). In turn, the same transformants were screened on a rich YPD medium which would allow ample growth. However, although we have confirmed that pIW357 functions appropriately (Figure 13), we could not yet identify transformants that were unable to grow on SC-oleic acid (data not shown). Nonetheless, following several rounds of restreaking, transformants were observed that had a distinct morphology (Figure 16). As PEX10 disruption can also be the cause of this morphology change (C.M. Schwartz, personal communication, October 18, 2016), transformants with an extraordinary morphology were selected for further analysis by colony PCR. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of the PCR product confirmed that PEX10 had been succesfully disrupted (Figure 17).
Figure 16: Restreaked pIW357 transformants in the Y. lipolytica PO1f strain. Overview (A) and detailed view (B), plated on YPD. The irregular, rough morphology is typical for normal Y. lipolytica transformants. In contrast, the smooth transformants are associated with a knock-out of PEX10.

In an ELISA assay, we tested for the presence of insulin in whole cell lysate from E. coli expressing cytoplasmic and Ecotin insulin, whole cell lysate from B. subtilis expressing YncM insulin, as well as the presence of insulin secreted by B. subtilis in His-tag purified media. Prior to the ELISA assay, all lysates and media were treated with proteases to remove expression tags, His-tags, and in the case of proinsulin the C-peptide was removed to form active insulin.
Figure 4: ELISA confirms expression of constructs, and the correct folding of Insulin and Winsulin constructs.
Cytoplasmic proinsulin and Cytoplasmic Winsulin were found in E. coli whole cell lysate, demonstrating that induction of E. coli to produce insulin in the cytoplasm was successful.  Ecotin proinsulin was also detected in whole cell lysate of E. coli cells. Whole cell lysate was used for this assay rather than the periplasmic fraction, as SDS-PAGE could not determine that insulin had been induced in the periplasmic fraction. As a result, we were unable to test whether the Ecotin tag had directed insulin expression to the periplasm.  YncM Winsulin was detected in the His-tag purified B. subtilis medium. The presence of YncM-tagged insulin in purified media demonstrates that our YncM tag did successfully target proteins for section, and that our purification step retained at least some Winsulin.
Since antibodies have a high binding specificity, the binding of our insulins to anti-insulin antibodies is a strong indication that our insulins were folded correctly and thus have a very high structural similarity to native insulin. Positive ELISA results for both Cytoplasmic Winsulin and YncM Winsulin were particularly exciting, as they demonstrate that our novel, previously untested Winsulins are able to bind to anti-insulin antibodies and are thus highly structurally similar to native insulin.

For the RD, we should see two bands for the “cut”: a band at ~3kb for the psB1AC3 vector, and a band at ~1.4kb for luxO D47A. However, the “cut” lanes show that NotI was unable to cut out any insert, suggesting the absence of luxO D47A. However, if we look to the PCR for colony 1 and 2, we do see the expected band size of ~1.4kb for the luxO D47A gene. The band size lines up nicely with the positive control, Lux O D47A in TOPO T/A. However, the negative control lane shows contamination.

Invisibility
One set back to this method is that any object or texture that the original avatar is wearing that does not have the alpha value set to the float value 1.0 will not be concealed by the invisible primitive. It may be easier to place the original avatar underground (might just be a fluke, more experimentation would be required so it might be returned to if we are not impressed with the use of the sculpted primitives alone for transforming avatars).
I will be gone for four days, but I will send the few notecards I have started to make to the rest of the group so they can be critiqued/criticized and improved further early next week and continue to add to the weekly progress reports to keep track of group activities and conversations.

Overview
    In the last 4 years, the Measurement Committee has been developing a robust measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) though the Interlab study, aiming to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. And this year, we are delighted to join the study to know if we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.

    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.

Utah_State,2009,Team:Utah State#ETHICS_-_-_TEXT.html," is strong enough and decent enough to teach and model impeccably honest moral science citizenship in the as yet small academic field of synthetic biology… Ethics education cannot be done with websites or software—there is a need for individual moral agency, and for this task, serious questions about the complexities of good and evil, difficult moral choices, the nature of the love of country, the nature of obligation to the other and the limits of the search for knowledge, all must be read about and studied with the same seriousness that young scientists give to understanding siRNA or nanobiobarcodes.
As the current and future leaders of the field of synthetic biology participate in these conferences, time before the conference and during the conference should be devoted to establishing appropriate human practices and ensuring that these practices are taught and implemented.  The nature of iGEM and its multidisciplinary approach to a successful team is conducive to researching and establishing appropriate human practices.  In order to qualify for a gold medal, teams are encouraged to address appropriate human practices as part of their project.  Due to the difficult nature of the questions concerning human practices, we propose more could be done by iGEM participants.  Possible additional measures include:
A new track focused solely on researching proper human practices, performing risk assessment, or researching public perception.
A portion of the conference set aside to relaying current best practices, or bringing before the community options for current best practices for discussion and acceptance.
As ensuring that proper policy is implemented and followed is important for the development of this or any field, these increased measures could help to ensure that policy becomes international and observed.  Again, iGEM participants largely represent the future of the field.  As policy is accepted within the iGEM community, enforcing the policy is simplified because it would be regularly taught and more widely accepted.
Public Education
Hart Researchers learned in a U.S. survey in 2009 that about 80% of the population had heard little or nothing about synthetic biology.  Given the young age of the field, and based on a report about media coverage in the U.S. and Europe (Pauwels & Ifrim, 2008) we assume that there has been similar public exposure around the world.  Some fields of study with great potential have been hindered as a result of not having adequate democratic involvement with the public for example genetically modified foods (Parens et al., 2009) or stem cell research (Marchant & Pope, 2009).  The Hart researchers also found that there is a broad consensus that “more should be done to inform the American public.”  "

In theory, if you could manipulate the rate of plasmid loss, you could control how long your bacteria remained modified, and also revert them to their non-transformed state, hence preventing the risk of colonisation after their function has been fulfilled. While this remains theoretical, it could represent an effective control on the use of synthetic organisms in the real world.

THE FIRST GM HUMAN EMBRYO: HAS A LINE BEEN CROSSED?
In April 2015, Junjiu Huang and his research team in Guangzhou, China, released a report confirming that they had genetically modified the DNA within 86 human embryos. This has prompted furious ethical debate amongst scientists across the globe, and raises serious questions about the course of gene editing research in the years to come.
Human Embryos?
Yes, human embryos, but not the type we would normally think of. It turns out that 2-5% of embryos formed by IVF consist of an egg fertilised by two sperm, instead of the usual single sperm cell. This event makes the embryos non-viable, such that they cannot result in a live birth. Huang's research team collected 86 of these non-viable human embryos from a fertility clinic, and these were the cells which were used in the experiment.
Treating the disease: beta-thalassaemia
Huang and his colleagues were looking for ways to cure a hereditary disease called beta-thalassaemia, which is a blood disorder that can prove fatal for some individuals. This disease is caused by the mutation in the HBB gene, which contains coding information for building the oxygen carrier haemoglobin, found in the blood. A mutation in this gene, a mistake in the genetic instruction manual for building haemoglobin, means than an individual with beta-thalassaemia had a reduced capacity to carry oxygen in their blood. As a result, sufferers of the disease described above experience tiredness, shortness of breath and other symptoms associated with a lack of oxygen supply to the organs.
Repairing the instruction manual: CRISPR/Cas9
Huang's research group used an effective, low-cost gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9, which was first put to use in 2013. In this experiment, the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, and other molecules designed to replace the faulty DNA of the HBB gene, were injected into the cell of interest, and subsequently travelled to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, CRISPR/Cas9 was intended to cut and replace the faulty region of the H"

-names <names dict> -protocols <protocols dict>
These parameters and all following ones are optional and do not have to be added to the call of the script, if not needed.     The order of the parameters is not important. For preview purpose or easier copying into the wiki it is often very useful to     add some HTML code before and after the generated HTML code. You can achieve this by specifying a top and a bottom HTML file with the parameters
-top <html top insert>
-bottom <html bottom insert>
Next to the HTML output you get also a JavaScript file for expanding and collapsing the notes. A default CSS is also created and linked    to final HTML file. To suppress the generation of these files, use the parameters
-nojs -nocss
Both parameters do not require additional attributes. They are especially useful, if you already added the function to your own     JavaScript file or use another styling sheet. In the latter case, you have to keep the four class names. Anything else is up to     you and should not affect the functionality. The last parameter is

Figure 10. Intensity of fluorescence of several mites after the fluorescein feeding experiment. Only 3/18 of mites do take up fluorescein overnight.
Figure 11. Results of the mealworm feeding assay. The mealworms take up notable amounts of food containing fluorescein overnight.
After seeing that the mites and mealworms could take up fluorescein, the phage libraries were fed to T. molitor and V. destructor and the bound phages recovered for further use. Due to a lack of mites, only two rounds of mite in vivo display could be performed. For the mealworms, the titer (the amount of plaque forming phages per mL) decreased drastically per round Figure 12. Thus, a second run with propagation of phages between the round has been performed.
Figure 12. Phage titre over three rounds of phage display.
During this second round, an unexpected incident caused us to stop the in vivo phage display. While tittering a phage library obtained from a mealworm, no plaques with the expected morphology (blue, lysogenic) showed up on the plate. Instead of M13 plaques, several lytic virus were recovered. The experiments have thus been stopped due to a risk of contamination in the samples. To investigate the source of the contamination, all possible sources have been looked at: Used buffer, used top-agar, and the plates. The source of the unexpected plaques turned out to be the mealworm gut. Kelly et al. found that phages can be found in mealworms naturally 3 . When using guts of mealworms that have not been fed any phages prior to the process, still a lot of plaques of different kinds could be seen on the titer plates. From this, we could conclude that there are naturally some bacteriophages that E. coli can be a host for in the gut of T. molitor. While those phages could be of interest for general bacteriophage studies, or further specific binding studies, they do interfere with our phage display experiments in two ways:
Knowing that phages are already inside of the gut (in relatively high amounts) they might block the receptors for our phage libraries.
As the phages and their properties are not known, working with them might not be safe As there was a shortage of living mites for the"

Education and Public Engagement
Within iGEM Wageningen, we attach great value to involving the public in our project. This is why we involved in several educational projects, and presented our project at several conferences, meetings, and in multiple websites and magazines. In this way, we informed all the different target audiences, from children and citizins to students and scientists, about our project and synthetic biology in general. Moreover, we organised a Benelux iGEM meetup to connect all iGEM teams in the Netherlands and Belgium in a meaningful way. Information about this meetup can be found

We attach a great value to educating the public about genetic modification, in particular synthetic biology. This relatively new field in science raises many concerns when people are, for example, not educated properly about the opportunities, but also the risks, it raises.
During our other public engagement projects (see below) we engaged with the general public, informing them about our project and synthetic biology in general. However, in the activities listed below, we took it a step further, from informing to education and real personal engagement.

Grenoble,2012,Team:Grenoble#Human Practice#BSS_-_-_TEXT.html," information about the risk assessment. Last but not least biological systems are more and more complicated and need even more BioBricks. The number of BioBricks used would probably exceed the expected value. For all these reasons, it is time to rationalize way to assess the risk. And in this purpose the first thing to do is to store the useful information in the clearest way. Our idea is then to link the BSS with the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Improvement of the project and of the BSS
What was underlined during the presentation of this BSS is that the main sheet is turned to the experiment aspect, whereas it is also important to focus on the theoretical aspect. Therefore we added a part in which it is asked to think about what possible interactions between BioBricks could occur. If this is correctly done, the perspective would probably lead the project to the creation of a software that would collect every possible interaction. for example, it is interesting to explain risks due to proteins, as:
its own toxicity (e.g. toxins)
toxicity associated to a substrate (oxygenase) or product(peroxydase)
its selectivity (adelylade cyclase)
It is also interesting to explain risks associated to transcription factors , as:
DNA biding specificity (activation or inhibition)(e.g. ompR)
risk associated to promoters as:
transcriptional factors specificity

ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Switch Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," in red. B IPTG bound to the inducer binding site of the lac repressor, residues R197 and T276 are shown in green. Molecular graphics was generated from coordinate set 1lbh (27) using UCSF Chimera .
We are not aware of quantitative studies that detail the strength of repression with respect to different mutations (in one genetic study (8) a repressor strength of >200 has been determined for numerous IS mutants including mutations of R197 and T276) or with respect to the combination between different mutations and we therefore set out to replace either residue with alanine or phenylalanine and in addition we constructed double mutants with all combinations of the two mutations. Our set of lacI IS mutations therefore comprises eight different mutants: R197A; R197F; T276A;  T276F; R197A T276A; R197A T276F; R197F T276A; R197F T276F. In order to get an impression of the efficiency of repression by the LacI IS mutants generated, we performed a genetic experiment linking the viability of cells to the repressor strength of the LacI IS mutants in question.
Estimate of LacI IS Repressor Strength
In order to characterize the lacI IS mutants generated – especially with respect to the double mutants – we performed a series of simple genetic experiments, which would allow us to identify promising mutations and reject mutations that allow significant induction at IPTG concentrations regularly used for induction (usually between 0.1mM and 1mM). Ideally, the experiment would link repression of a lac inducible gene to a marked change in cell growth or morphology. We decided to use ribosome modulation factor (RMF) in one series of experiments and fluorescent proteins in another series as an indicator of lac repressor activity.
Genetic Experiments using Ribosome Modulation Factor (RMF)
Ribosome modulation factor (RMF, Uniprot P0AFW2 ) is a small protein, which is found in many bacteria. RMF is expressed when bacterial cultures reach the stationary phase (28, 29) and terminates protein synthesis efficiently by binding to ribosomes. Biochemical studies have shown that expression of RMF leads to dimerization of ribosomes (the bacterial 70S ribosomes form a complex with a sedimentation velocity of 100S) and chemical crosslinking studies elucidated that RMF binds to the peptidyl transferase center (30, 31). Since expression of RMF reversibly terminates protein expression and thereby stops bacterial growth we used RMF"

How to gain more protein? In the process of the KDR purification, we still could not obtain a higher concentration of protein after several attempts. Tang has devoted herself to the study of protein structure for many years and gathered rich experience. He proposed it was inappropriate to simply follow the old protocol, and suggested us to screen out the best conditions for protein expressions by changing the formula of the medium, such as adding glycerin or NaHPO4. His input was integrated in our practice. We successfully obtained more target proteins after changing the temperature of culture, the formulation of culture medium and the concentration of induction.

How to make our model promising enough? During the process of considering reengineering vegf-scfv to obtain better protein binding capacity, Prof. Huang offered us great help. Based on his knowledge of medical genetics and structural bioinformatics, he guided us in the molecular design of cancer drugs and used computers to carry out theoretical and simulation of biological molecular structure and interaction. At first, we intended to simulate the receptor movement on the cell membrane to directly study the output level of the STEP system. Afterwards, Prof. Huang pointed that the movement of the receptor on the cell membrane was not completely random, and the differences in different regions on the membrane were not convincing enough. So we turned to the probabilistic model and study the relationship between the parameters of the wet experiment and the model by simulating the motion of the membrane receptor.
Dr. Yi Shi Associate Professor, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Ministry of Education    Shanghai Jiaotong University
How to build up STEP system within the computational power? To figure out whether the protein ligand we have designed posseses a better combination ability, we came to Shanghai Jiaotong University， where is located the Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine established by the Ministry of Education. Expert in Computational Biology and Tumor Genetics ，Shi was strongly interested in our platform. After listening our program introduction, he emphasized the importance of the math modeling in the whole system. “Only the framework with rich logic will possess a better sense of instruction to the wet lab”.

Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"lysis of phytate, or phytic acid, releasing six phosphate groups from phytate. The dephosphorylation of phytate and the consequent release of phosphate groups from the inositol ring reduces phytate’s mineral binding strength. Consequently, the hydrolysis of phytate increases the bioavailability of iron in the human body.
Harnessing phytase to enhance iron bioavailability has some precedence in biotechnology. In animal feed, Jan Pen, et al. [7] engineered transgenic seeds as a novel feed additive for improved phosphorous utilization. They engineered phytase from Aspergillus niger in tobacco seeds, providing a stable and convenient packaging of the enzyme. The phytase enzyme helped release phosphorous from phytate. Taewan Kim, et al. [8] also attempted to shift the pH-dependent activity profile of the Aspergillus niger phytase in order to enhance its effectiveness inside the stomach as an animal feed additive. They were successful in shifting the pH optimum of one mutant to pH 3.8, demonstrating that it is feasible to improve the function of phytase under stomach pH conditions by protein engineering. Each of these examples highlights the utility and potential of harnessing phytases to improve nutrition, but these approaches do not directly enable preventing iron deficiency in humans.

Due to the time restrictions at the time of the wiki freeze we haven not optimised the characterisation of PYoda to the standards that we expected. However, we are already working on an alternative chassis, the E. coli bw25113 strain, in which we will assess the response of Cadmium.
Third Test: Try inducing pYodA with other metals to test its efficiency as a cadmium biosensor.
As a collaboration and because we are helping to the synthetic phytochelatin characterisation we have asked the Imperial College team to characterise the pYodA inducibility to metal ions other than Cadmium. We are hoping to get some results before going Boston in order to address the question on how specific pYodA is to Cadmium.

Check PCR for K1319008
The length of the PCR product matches the length of the control plasmid.
This PCR also positively identified K1319008. Additionally both parts were sequenced. The sequencing data for K1319008 and K1319013 can be found in the parts registry.
Characterization of K1319001 with the iGEM Team Aachen 2D Biosensor
K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 non-induced (top) and induced (bottom) in sensor cells
The induced double plasmid systems K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 exhibit a clear fluorescence response in our sensor cells which in response to induction with 2 µl IPTG.
To further characterize the REACh construct, they were introduced into the sensor cells which were then induced with 2 µL IPTG with a concentration of 100 mM. Subsequently, we took fluorescence measurement read-outs (GFP, excitation 496 ± 9 nm, emission 516 ± 9 nm) roughly every 10 min in the plate reader. The results were plotted in the heatmap shown on the left.
The heatmap shows an increase of fluorescence from blue (no fluorescence) to red (high fluorescence). It is clearly visible that the induced chips are exhibiting a significantly higher fluorescence than the non-induced chips. This again shows that the constructs work as intended: The TEV protease cuts the linker so that the fusion protein is separated into GFP and a dark quencher, disabling the quenching. GFP has a clear fluorescence emission after the fusion protein has been successfully cut into two pieces by the TEV protease.

Summary
Relevance
Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt gave insights on the political agenda concerning antibiotic resistance. This way, we were able to make an overview of the most important European and Dutch institutes and agencies. Besides new vaccines and new prevention strategies to tackle the infectious diseases, and besides the need for new antibiotics and new therapeutics, the increased use (including overuse and misuse) of the available antibiotics (ref. The Netherlands Center for One Health (NCOH)) should be stopped. The detection method could be used as frontline diagnostics and could be the key for new treatment strategies.
Safety and public acceptance
Besides designing in a relevant for the field, the acceptance of our detection method was considered. We aimed to design a detection method that could be broadly implemented to detect resistance on the spot. The public should be comfortable to use our method. Our idea was based on detection with GMOs with a kill-switch on a paper-chip. However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe as possible to make the public comfortable when using our detection method.

We got great feedback from many participants and when looking at the amount and the content of the  open-answers, most people find this subject very interesting and seemed to appreciate the survey. Although no consensus will be formed on questions like whether life can be explained materialistically, the ongoing research in synthetic biology and specifically on the principles of life makes us obliged to keep the debate going and possibly prepare ourselves for whatever science will bring us next.

UNC-Asheville,2017,Team:UNC-Asheville#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Carolina is home to seven trichloroethylene spill sites, including Camp Lejeune US Marine Base - which some consider the largest contamination site in the country - and the CTS Superfund site in Asheville. This year, the UNC-Asheville iGEM team will focus on the biodegradation of the TCE found in the CTS Superfund site in south Asheville.
The pollution at the CTS site was only discovered after a family, who lived next door, noticed an oily substance in their drinking well. In 1999 a member of that family contracted brain cancer, and shortly thereafter another was diagnosed with skin cancer and two thyroid tumors.6 Initially, this was thought to be genetic, but one year later their granddaughter, who also lived on the property was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The maximum level of safe human consumption for TCE is 5 ppb. The EPA tested TCE levels of 830,000 ppb underneath the CTS site, and up to 34,000 ppb in nearby streams.7
The EAWAG Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database was started by the University of Minnesota started in 1995 and includes information on 1200 compounds, 800 enzymes, 1500 reactions and 500 microorganism entries. 8 This database consists of a biochemical periodic table and rule-based Pathway Prediction System. Here it was discovered that several potential pathways exist for the degradation of TCE. Environmental biologists have long proposed methanophiles as potential biodegraders. Relying on methane as a carbon source requires a strong oxidizing bond which can break the C-H bond of methane and convert it to methanol. These proteins, called methane monooxygenases, are some of the strongest oxidizing proteins on the planet. When placed under copper limited environments, many methanophiles produce an alternative to the usual particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) to produce a soluble version (sMMO).9  Other proteins that are able to degrade TCE include toluene 2- monooxygenase, toluene dioxygenase, and trichloroethene reductive dehalogenase. Further background research revealed sMMO to be the fastest degrader of TCE and given that this protein had already been characterized as a biobrick by the Braunschweig 2014 team, we decided to focus on pathways that started with sMMO.
sMMO has been shown to degrade TCE both chloral hydrate, and an intermediate epoxide, which is"

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Cooperations_-_-_TEXT.html,"Delft & Aalto Helsinki
Hence our first collaboration, with iGEM Delft would have started way to late in the current competition. We developed further ideas as how to combine projects most of which did not work out, this specific example however is something that we want to share because it would have been amazing and did fail due to one reason alone: The lack of time.
So how did it start? Delft informed us, that they were working on tardigrade proteins in a side project, which can help folding and unfolding proteins during and after states of cryptobiosis. Which essentially means damage through repeated freezing and thawing, clumping and the like are prevented by the proteins.
Aalto Helsinki, who worked on antimicrobial peptides as well informed us earlier, that they didn’t have access to security level 2 labs to test their peptide on real causative agents, so we offered them to test their peptides on some clinical strains that we could work with in our security level 2 lab. Aalto Helsinki told us that they would have problems to send us their peptides due to activity loss and too little time.
Which led to our conclusion to bring both teams together which was the start of a wild ride. After proposing our idea to Delft, they told us that one of their team members would travel to Helsinki in the next couple of weeks in October, which would allow the transportation of the tardigrade proteins to Helsinki. So that Aalto Helsinki could freeze their peptides send them to us so that we could test them on strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
In the end it did not work out, as mentioned above due to a lack of time, but we are still positive that the attempt was totally worth it and want to encourage future iGEM teams to think big, even if it might not work out in the end.
Heidelberg
Since the beginning of our project we experienced difficulties performing gene amplifications. After tedious trial and error using different gradient-PCRs, experimenting with GC-enhancer solutions and DMSO concentrations we figured out a way to amplify eleven out of our twelve genes and gene fragments. The only one that did not function despite our efforts was the AraC family transcriptional regulator. Luckily the iGEM Team Heidelberg offered a PCR First Aid – Service this year which we gratefully accepted. After a skype call in which we described our problem and attempts at solving it in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M"

CHINA_CD_UESTC,2015,Team:CHINA CD UESTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"3] , and the largest shift of shares give us an insight into the most likely shape of the future energy landscape! (Figure 2)
Figure 2. The shifts in fuel shares in power generation.There have been some rapid shifts in fuel shares in power generation in the past: oil gaining in the 1960s and losing in the 1970s; nuclear picking up in the 1970s/80s and falling in the 2000s; gas rising through the 1990s and 2000s. In the Outlook, the largest shifts are the increase in the renewables share and the decline in the coal share [3] .
Among numerous renewable energy, bioenergy is a kind of clean renewable energy and a potential excellent substitute for fossil fuel. With the advantages of biotechnology biofuel cell (EBFC) previously mentioned, many researches has been done widely.
Previous iGEM teams had done some studies about microbial fuel cell (MFC). iGEM13_Bielefeld-Germany made an Escherichia coli Fuel Cell platform to provide an efficient electron transfer from the bacteria to the electrode. iGEM14_LZU-China cloned a NO3-sensor sequence and riboflavin producing genes into Escherichia coli for anode and a gene coding chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli for cathode. iGEM14_SCAU-China boosted up the level of intracellular NAD+ for higher electron transfer rate.
Biofuel cell is divided into microbial fuel cell (MFC) and enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC).The three teams paid attention on microbial fuel cell (MFC). But we chose EBFC in our project. EBFC, a special kind of fuel cell which uses organics as fuels and enzymes as catalysts, is generally separated into anode region and cathode region by proton exchange membrane. Fuels are oxidized under the action of enzyme in the anode region. Oxygen is reduced in the cathode region.
EBFC has broad application prospect, so we want to create a new type of device to develop the bioenergy.
Biocatalyst: laccase, a kind of oxidoreductase
The main configurations of enzymatic fuel cells involve bioanodes based on glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase or lactate oxidase and biocathodes based on copper oxidases such as laccase, tyrosinase or bilirubin oxidase. This concept was initiated by Mano et al. who implanted microbioelectrodes"

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html," each salt concentration (0 to 500 mM NaCl in 50 mM steps) were then ran on an SDS PAGE gel to confirm presence of the catechol 1,2 dioxygenase enzyme. The  results, shown in Figure 4, confirmed that the protein is being successfully expressed in large quantities and is of the expected size. The peak of the protein was spread between the 300 mM and 350 mM step. Each fraction was then measured for protein concentration and the results for 300 and 350 fractions were 879 µg/ml, and 1161 µg/ml respectively.
Figure 5: Initial velocity versus substrate concentration plot. Vmax = 32,64 µM/min, and Km = 16,85 µM-1. Individual data points not shown.
Figure 6: Enzymatic activity depending on temperature. Catechol exhibits highest activity at 40 °C, making 50,625 µM of product in 1 minute, and very low amounts of product at temperatures above 55 °C or below 15 °C.
Results of the enzymatic assay measurements are shown on Figure 5. Determined values were Vmax=32.64 µM.min-1, and KM=16.85 µM. The enzyme showed highest velocity at 150 µM concentration of catechol, but for the rest of the tests, 100 µM was used instead. The enzyme exhibits strong substrate inhibition above 400 µM substrate concentration, with 10mM completely inhibiting enzyme activity (data not shown in Figure 5). Graphical representation of the results from the measurement of activity depending on temperature is shown in Figure 6. Results obtained from the assay of enzyme activity at different pH are presented on Figure 7.
Figure 7: pH optimum of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase. The enzyme shows a pH optimum in the neutral range, with slight bias towards alkaline pH.
Maximum velocity of 34,7875 µM/min was obtained at pH 8,16 and 22°C, with very similar results for neutral pH as well (33,9 µM/min at pH 7,17). pH lower than 5 completely inhibits enzyme activity, as well as pH>9.
