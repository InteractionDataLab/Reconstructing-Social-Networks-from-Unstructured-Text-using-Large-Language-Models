UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Co Culture_-_-_TEXT.html," without 30 mM sucrose. From this we conclude that bacillus grows in sucrose-supplemented ATCC medium, and furthermore, undergo sporulation when sucrose is absent (experiment 2).
 
A detail worth noticing is the fact, that Ducat. et al. 2012 (REF 2). Used 150 mM NaCl to induce sucrose accumulation in synechococcus. To investigate whether such osmotic stress would be harmful to bacillus in our co-culture, growth assays with 50, 100, 150, 200, and 500 mM supplemented NaCl were made to investigate whether the environment necessary for sucrose accumulation would inhibit bacillus growth. This suggested minor growth inhibition at 500 mM NaCl, but without major consequences at 200 mM and below (experiment 4). A similar growth experiment with synechococcus at different concentrations of NaCl was also undertaken, which indicated a lower growth rate at 200 mM and above (experiment 5).
 
Because BG-11 media, which synechococcus is dependent on, could not be used for cultivating bacillus and given the positive results from ATCC grow measurements, we hypothesize that a mixture of ATCC and BG-11 in a 1:1 ratio could enable cultivation of both in a co-culture setting. To test this, bacillus and synechococcus growth on mixed media was investigated. The results suggested that bacillus could survive and grow in mixed media, however, the grow rate was slower compared to pure ATCC  (experiment 3), which is to be expected taking into account the negative results from experiments 1. Synechococcus was able to survive and grow as well, however, when IPTG was included to induce expression of cscB, a consistent and ponderous(HELP JOSEPH! I want to say significant, but I didn’t use statistics!)  drop in growth rate was observed across the cscB-transformed group, suggesting that sucrose export is growth limiting (which makes sense, if you take into account that cscB is rerouting carbon flux to the extracellular matrix) (experiment 6). For future research, it would be important to design a synechococcus strain that can sustainably export a carbon source and sustain its own population simultanously.  
 
Device validation - Using spend media to simulate the co-culture environment
Finally, to make a convincing device validation we had to not only characterize our media, but also test whether it could work as a co-culture"
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Time against EamI, Complex, Intracellular and Extracellular AHL concentrations (Wild).
Graph 10. Time against EamI, Complex, Intracellular and Extracellular AHL concentrations (Modified).
CONCLUSIONS
After analyzing the contrast between the wild and modified cell we concluded that under the same conditions (time and cell density) the modified cell will have a significant inhibition in reaching the critical value for the QS activation and therefore the virulence expression, due to the aiiA capacity to delay the growing behavior of all variables (EamI, AHL-EamR complex, intracellular and extracellular AHL). Nevertheless, if the horizon of time and the range of cell density are expanded strategically (as did in graph 11), the modified cell, in fact, can reach the QS. In this particular scenario, the QS was not completely eradicated but remarkably delayed. The modified cell needs around four times the time and cell density of the wild cell to be able to reach the critical value that triggers the QS.
Noticing that a basal state value of the EamI protein was taken under consideration which influenced in the synthesis of EamI, it did not matter that this value was as small as we wanted, the concentration of EamI in the media always existed. This is the reason why a predisposition of reaching QS inevitably remains, but always depending on the intrinsic characteristics of Erwinia amylovora.
Apart from the numerical results, our experimental results concluded the same thing, the aiiA enzyme partially inhibits, or more properly said, delays the QS gene expression and therefore the virulence expression too. In the Demonstrate section, an experiment was carried out on apple tree leaves, where they were inoculated with a modified Erwinia amylovora and with wild-type cells. Differences in disease development (both the severity and onset time) were seen between the wild-type E. amylovora and the one transformed with the aiiA BioBrick (BBa_K2471000). When incorporating the aiiA BioBrick into E. amylovora, leaf necrosis was inhibited in comparison with the wild-type one.
It is important to conclude that the activity of only one enzyme will not inhibit the virulence by itself, reason why the project revolves around the interaction of the three enzymes: aiiA, epsE, yhjH, to counteract the virulence in an integral way.

As both of our teams were working within the same institution, our team was able to work extensively under the guidance of the uAlberta iGEM team. Their team was very helpful in a number of portions of our project, most notably in the InterLab study. We gave the uAlberta team our InterLab parts from our kit plate, as they had a few unsuccessful transformations for a select number of the InterLab parts. In turn, after successfully transforming the remaining parts, the uAlberta team gave us purified plasmids of the InterLab parts, giving our team an easier time in doing our own transformations. As well, they gave us access to their plate reader, which was integral to completing our InterLab study. All throughout the season, the uAlberta team has also provided us general mentorship in the form of lab training, help with troubleshooting our transformations, running diagnostic gels with us, and being open for discussion whenever we needed them.

Tips and Tricks
Our experience shows that you should use tubefront-IDs for almost any sample/container that is stored for more than two days. This includes for example cryos of different clones, purified plasmids, purified PCR products etc.
Tubes that are too small to be labeled, such as PCR tubes can be stored together with their siblings in 15-50 ml tubes.
Storage of PCR tubes
PCR tubes are best kept inside a falcon tube that has its own ID.
Survey
Short box names are better, because then you can easily write ID, box and slot (eg. XE3D P':B7) on a post-it before going to the freezer.
We use tubefront IDs for the primers in our cloning software and for ordering. Upon arrival the 100 μM stocks go into our boxes P or Q, while the 10/20 μM dilutions go into the same positions in boxes P' or Q'.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour34_-_-_TEXT.html,", both basic parts and devices, are all taken from  risk group 1 organisms and therefore do not contain nor mimic any virulence factors. This would be indicative of a  very low hazardousness of our system. On the other hand, we have a self-designed protein and the safety of this  brick might need to be considered. To avoid toxicity, we have shuffled the amino acids until the obtained sequence  didn’t resemble any known toxin or other disease causing protein. We have also assayed the toxicity by feeding C. elegans bacteria producing OneProt (For more information, see our results page ).
Probability
When analyzing the probability it is important to consider that there always will be an element of uncertainty in the results. The completion of our project implies the release of GMO to the environment. Even though our GMO will be weakened in   several ways, the environmental effect of this release cannot be completely foreseen.
Risk
Our final product would include a group of cellulases, this could mean that there would be a remote risk that, in case of leakage, our bacteria could start to uncontrollably degrade cellulose into glucose for satisfying its own metabolic requirements. In this sense these bacteria could potentially become a threat for crops and other  plants. To manage this, our idea is to have the cellulases regulated by an inducible promoter, which will  prevent the production of cellulase in the absence of the inducer. In a worst-case scenario this promoter could  mutate to become constitutive active and thereby produce cellulase. Even if this was the case, other safety  mechanisms would still be active, such as the kill switch and the general low environmental stability of E.coli K12. The  probability of all these factors randomly mutating/failing at the same time is almost negligible. We can analyze the  risk of this event by using a risk matrix:
Risk matrix: This describes relation between the probability and the hazard of our project. According to this analysis is this risk “yellow”, which means that it is acceptable to work with this project, but some considerations, such as a kill switch, may be considered.
As for the risk for the safety and health of the general public, it is of great concern to avoid the spread of antibiotic resistance. All our constructs are made on antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could, potentially, transfer resistance  genes to other bacteria, in case of leakage. This would contribute to the increasing difficulty in fighting so far  controlled infections. To avoid this, we think that in the future these genes could be transferred into a plasmid  developed in our university, which contains the proteins needed"

He compared resistance and defensin proteins, noted the benefits and drawbacks, and discussed how both are being studied as methods of providing durable resistance to pathogen infection. In contrast to resistance proteins, defensin proteins actively attack the fungal pathogen. For instance, some target and damage the plasma membrane of the fungus. Also, one defensin gene can provide broad spectrum resistance to a variety of pathogens and strains, unlike resistance genes, which are typically pathogen-specific, and in some cases, strain-specific. However, in order to provide durable resistance, one or more defensin genes are often combined with resistance genes to reduce the possibility that a pathogen can develop resistance. Defensin proteins have been shown to protect against leaf rust, but have not yet been tested with stem rust.
Prior to our meeting with Dr. Shah, our team had intended to use a polystyrene membrane for our spore trap based on what we had previously read in literature. However, Dr. Shah informed us that any hydrophobic material could be used as a spore trap, so we decided to change the material of our membrane to polyethylene with a lower environmental impact."

iGEM UK MeetUp
The 2015 Westminster iGEM team made a decision to host the official UK meet-up when it was noted that UCL, who have organized it in the past, were not arranging it this year. However, we did not fully appreciate the work involved in organizing such an event. There were people to invite, venues to secure, guest speakers to find, and finally our own results to finish and compile before the meet-up. Paulina, one member of our team, contacted iGEM to enquire about the potential of Westminster arranging such a meet-up. Once we had agreed on the dates, iGEM was notified, and the 2015 UK iGEM meet-up event planning commenced.
The Westminster iGEM ELECTROCOLI friendly neighbourhood hosts!
The UK meet-up was a fantastic platform for all the UK teams to network, familiarise themselves with other iGEM projects and build professional relationships. It also provided an opportunity for all the UK teams to gauge the standard of work that is expected of each team attending the iGEM Jamboree
The team had also invited some exciting guest speakers to present over the course of the two days.
On Friday, we had Dr. Paul James from University of Exeter and Dr. Paul Freemont from Imperial College London.
On Saturday, we had three guest speakers- James Phillips from Synbiota, Edward Perello from Desktop Genetics and finally Sean Ward from Synthace.
Each speaker was inspiring, memorable and enthusiastic. A range of topics were covered by the guests speakers that raised a lot of questions during and after the presentations. Teams were informed of the current developments in statistical and laboratory technologies, and were able to seek advice from the guest speakers regarding their own projects.
We provided everyone with food and refreshments throughout the event. Being a very culturally diverse team, we decided to bring a bit of spice to the UK meet up with an array of home cooked dishes such as samosas and pkoras. Coscto proved to be a beacon of light for our team who were on a strict budget. At the end this dining experience was our very own iGEM inspired cake. All in all, the catering was a success.

The intensity of green-TCS grows 3 times while the red-TCS grows one time in four hours and in five hours the multiples have become 10 and 4 in the two systems. We can easily tell that compared with red-TCS, the green one can be activated faster and better which indicates green one can be more steady and reliable.     Conclusion: After a series of experiment, we are able to prove the feasibility of the light-induced system. While there is a possibility of leak, the differences between the two groups can be measured by devices. Ayle=""""lso, after our measurement of the response time about 3 hours, it falls within the oscillation’s regulating range, which is consistent with our modeling results. So far, we can prove that the concept of the second generation of cipher machine is correct.

Oscillation
    In order to realize the single-period oscillation, we design a circuit based on negative feedback mechanism (fig1),  which is composed of gene luxI，aiiA and sfGFP.

    To prove the effect of this circuit, we implanted it in E.coli MG1655 and raised them in test tubes. Meanwhile, we monitored the change of GFP fluorescence intensity. Although we could observe oscillation, amplitude rose higher and higher. After analysis, we think this happened due to the increased bacteria population and thus, the resulting increased AHL accumulated in the medium.     To get a stable oscillation, we designed a microfluidics device based on our project. In practice, we add bacteria solution to microfluidics chips, so each chamber is distributed with bacteria. Then, we add fresh medium with an appropriate velocity continuously, to provide adequate nutrition and take away the excessive bacteria due to proliferation and the accumulated AHL. By now, we ensure the system’s stability. We use fluorescence microscope to take pictures every 5 minutes and observe the stable oscillation. (Shown in the figures below:)

1.1 Transcriptional modularity
1.2 Genomic integration
1.3 Eukaryotic expression
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Yeast is a well-characterized and relatively simple eukaryotic model organism, and it provides a number of advantages as a chassis for synthetic biology and our project in particular.
Transcriptional modularity
Many transcriptional regulation pathways have been characterized in yeast, and some have been shown to work in a modular fashion.  The Sin3 repression domain and VP64 activation domain used in our transcription factors, for instance, have been shown to function when recombined with a variety of DNA-binding domains.  Thus, we can utilize a library of recombinant factors that each utilize the same control mechanism while binding specifically to different operator sites.  In this way, each element of our system can operate in a similar fashion while having a distinct role
Genomic integration
In yeast, it is a straightforward procedure to integrate assembled constructs directly into the genome via homologous recombination.  In contrast to transformation with plasmid DNA, this approach affords precise control over the copy number of introduced fragments.  Exactly one copy of an integrated construct recombines into a specific locus in the genome.  In this way, we have exact control over the relative presence of different elements of our introduced network, giving its operation greater predictability and reliability.  Additionally, genomic integration is more stable than plasmid transformation.
Eukaryotic expression
Due to the extensive compartmentalization seen in eukaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur within different locations of the cell.  Transcription of precursor mRNA molecules takes places inside the nucleus.  Additional modifications are made to the precursor mRNA before it leaves the nucleus, one of the most noteworthy being the splicing of introns or non-coding regions from the mRNA.  It is the absence of a comparable system of modifications in prokaryotes that provides the first barrier to cloning many mammalian proteins in E. coli.

Introduction
The Problem
The World Health Organization estimates that up to five million people are bitten every year by snakes. Out of these 5 million people, about 2.4 million are estimated to be envenomed, resulting in 94,000-125,000 deaths annually. Additionally, it is estimated that about 400,000 of the envenomed patients suffer from either amputation of limbs, or display other severe health consequences, such as renal failure, necrosis, spontaneous bleeding, panhypopituitarism, diabetes, chronic neurological deficits, deformity and amputation of limbs.
The majority of snake bites occurs in South- and South-East Asia, Africa and South America. They are more common in rural areas, inhabited by people that depend on farming and other field working occupations for subsistence. Moreover, the socioeconomic impact on families and communities is adding to the burden of these injuries.
The current solution
Antivenom remains the most effective antidote for snake envenoming, but is expensive and in short supply.  Furthermore, the decision about which is the proper antidote to apply is not straight forward, as the snake responsible for the envenoming is long gone and identification of such snake species is not the specialty of the medical personnel at the clinics.
In addition to that, administration of antivenom comes with a high risk of side effects. Acute reactions to the treatment cause problems of equal clinical importance as the envenomings themselves. Up to 40% of the victims exhibit severe systemic anaphylaxis, including hypotension and cyanosis. Short term sickness of pyrogenic endotoxin nature and serum sickness in the long term are common adverse reactions [1].
Methods of Detection
Numerous venom detection methods have been developed, or modified from already existing molecular biology techniques, such as ELISA and immunoassays, to suit the needs of the problem throughout the years. However, these techniques share disadvantages that prevent them from being used in field clinics for detection of the specific venom in the victim. These are the cost of these assays, the use of expensive and elaborate equipment, the need for trained personnel, and most importantly, the assaying time.
Our goal was to create a diagnostic tool that would make possible to quickly determine, in the case of envenomation, which antivenom is necessary, or if it is necessary at all.

Now let's play with some of the other basic tools in the Sequence View.  First, let's find an open reading frame - place your cursor  anywhere in the sequence, go to the ""ORFs"" menu and select ""Find  Next ORF"".  Alternatively, you can  use the shortcut and press [Ctrl + .].   This will place line a light green line underneath the next open reading  frame found in the sequence after the cursor (if other alternate start codons  are enabled in the preferences, their reading frames will be shown using yellow  or red lines).  Highlight this sequence  with the mouse and select the ""Translate"" option from the ""Tools"" menu (or press [Ctrl + T]).   The protein translation of this reading frame will be printed to the  'Output Data' window.  Similiarly, if  you select ""Reverse Complement"" [Ctrl + /], the reverse complement of  the sequence will be printed. ""Find Reverse ORF"" and ""Reverse Translate"" operate  in the same fashion, but they look at the reverse complement of the  sequence. ""UPPER CASE"", ""Switch Case"", and ""lower case"" all operate on any portion  of the sequence you care to highlight (case has no effect on sequence analysis  and is treated as aesthetic).  Highlighting a string of nucleotides also displays information like G-C content and melting temperature.  Additionally, you can open up a tools menu under ""Tools"" [Ctrl + F] to peform find and  replace operations on the sequence.

But Vitamin C is less effective and had no obvious antioxidant effect in this assay. We thought                         this result may had two reasons. First, the Vitamin C shows a low direct-antioxidant activity,                         especially at low concentration (10 µM) compared to another two. Or the Vitamin C main                         principle of anti-oxidation is its indirect-antioxidant activity, like activation of cell's                         natural anti-oxidative enzymes, which is hard to reflect in fluorescence ratio level just in 30                         mins.
In a word, our system gave a similar result to CAA assay in three selected antioxidant tests.                         This proves our system can detect the antioxidant in living cell. But we need more antioxidant                         test to verify our system's function and limitation, especially indirect-antioxidative                         antioxidant, for finding ""Who can get an A?""

UP-element design
UP-elements are known to significantly increase the RNA polymerase-recruiting power of promoters by interacting with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. Work has been done to identify a consensus sequence for this transcriptional enhancer based on 31 natural E. coli promoters  (Estrem ST, Gaal T, Ross W, Gourse RL, Identification of an UP element consensus sequence for bacterial promoters, PNAS, (1998), 95, 9761-9766 PubMed ).
Figure 1: Tabulation of UP-elements in E. coli and nucleotide frequency at each position (adapted from Estrem ST, Gaal T, Ross W, Gourse RL, Identification of an UP element consensus sequence for bacterial promoters, PNAS, (1998), 95, 9761-9766 PubMed )
We have designed novel UP-element sequences as modular BioBrick parts by modifying a naturally-occurring UP element.  The primary design goal in developing these new parts was to vary the strength of transcription initiation enhancement by rationally modifying the nucleotide sequence of the variable regions (i.e., non consensus regions). This approach was guided by the hypothesis that natural sequences resulting in stronger promoter enhancement have been selected for over evolutionary time by E. coli and therefore occur more frequently than weaker UP-elements.
Tabulation of UP-element sequences in order of observed strengths and correlation with nucleotide frequency
Data showed direct correlation between the strength of naturally occurring UP-elements and the frequency of each nucleotide at each respective position.  Thirty one UP-element sequences were analyzed for nucleotide frequency and the relative activity was tabulated for each sequence (Estrem, et. al).  From this a consensus UP-element sequence was identified which was composed of the most frequently occurring nucleotide at each position.
UP-element consensus sequence and observed variable regions for selected sequences (that most closely matched the consensus sequence)
We separated the UP-element sequence into regions of highly conserved and highly variable nucleotide frequency.  We hypothesized that variation of strength of the UP-element is attributed to the variable regions within the sequence.  Upon further analysis of the nucleotide frequency in the variable regions we determined that changing a single base to the second most frequent nucleotide would allow us to quantify the relationship between nucleotide frequency and UP-element"
British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.
Desired Impact on the World:
I live and breathe science, ask mike, and I see myself having a long enjoyable life pondering synthetic systems in microbes, or probing the pathophysiology and treatments of human diseases.
Hobbies:
Outside from lab work and reading ""binders full of journal articles"", I enjoy watching hockey and maintaining my vegetable garden. Occasionally, I enjoy swimming and hiking.

Joel Kumlin
Major and Year:
Chemical Engineering w. Minor in Honours Mathematics
Why iGEM:
2013 - I wanted to learn some biological engineering practices as well as create some worthwhile biological models.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I joined iGEM last year to get more experience with creating models to describe real-world phenomena, this year I am hoping to transfer some skills in modeling and numerical methods to the newer members so that UBC can continue to build award winning models.
What inspires you:
There are so many unfinished. untried, non-optimized systems that can be improved on in this world. The more I learn the more inefficiencies I see.  I get inspired by people thinking of new ways to deal with these inefficiencies and get excited coming up with elegant solutions to these problems. There is so much work to do on this world, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to retire!
Desired impact on the world:
I'm interested in advancing technology, various technologies can be better understood when implementing the language of mathematics. As much as we'd like to think differently, most engineering is still done with ""opinion-based"" decision making. There are chemical and biological fields where the mathematics has not been reduced to a low enough form to become useful for most engineers - moving to ""science-based"" or ""math-based"" decision making can reduce inefficiencies that cost time, money and energy. And I would like to be a part of applying practical mathematics to real world problems.
Hobbies:
When not in labs, or staring at excited liquid crystals - I like hitting the ball long on golf courses and running down shots on the tennis court.

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," the positively charged regions show an over-expresion of FG, GF, RG, and GR motifs. Temperature, ionic strength, arginine methylation and splicing are influencing the patterned electrostatic interactions which are stabilizing the droplets. As already mentioned membraneless organelles, such as the Ddx4 droplets, are providing a different environment compared to the rest of the aqueous cellular interior, which is resulting in the increased concentration of certain biomolecules.
The liquid-like structures formed by these processes would be distinct from traditional macromolecular assemblies in at least two important ways: In contrast to approved multicomponent complexes (e.g. the ribosome) the stereochemical definition of a granule formed by LLPS would not be possible. The elements would be randomly organized and dynamically rearranging. Because the phase-separated droplets are >90% water by mass (based on protein concentrations of ~300 mM), macromolecules could enter, diffuse within, and exit easily. These two properties allow biomolecules to be concentrated inside of granules but still be able to diffuse freely and rapidly.
Figure 5: Formation and Maturation of phase-separated liquid droplets by RNA-binding proteins. Intrinsically disordered regions of RNA-binding proteins (e.g. Ddx4) can phase separate. Phase-separated droplets stabilize over time by formation of amyloid-like fibers (red regions in lower droplet). RRM: RNA recognition motif.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"stridium has received a large level of funding, including an expected $125m over the next five years from US Department of Energy.  Additionally, the DoE is investing $385m in six commercial scale cellulosic ethanol biorefineries, working alongside private companies including Cargill, Dow, DuPont, Shell, Iogen.  Universities play a large part of course in this area, such as the $500m ‘alliance’ between BP and UC Berkeley.  (ETC Group, 2008) and subsequently ‘As huge amounts of money are being invested in synthetic biology groups it is clear that there are high expectations of a significant commercial return.’  (Balmer, 2008).   Indeed the potential of the market is certainly deemed to be lucrative, ‘Bio-Economic Research Associates (Cambridge, MA) predicts that bio-based chemical processes could capture more than $70 billion in revenues by 2010 – more than 10% of the global chemical industry total. (One analyst predicts that the market for bio-plastics will expand from $1 billion in 2007 to over $10 billion by 2020.6) The biofuels sector could reach $40 billion by 2010 and $110-150 billion by 2020. Revenues from vaccines developed with next gen¬eration DNA technologies could reach $20 billion by 2010’ (ETC Group, 2008).
This has led to accusations of some major players trying to form an early monopoly of the field through wide ranging patents. (ETC Group, 2007)  Such claims are perhaps exacerbated by comments such as Dr Venter claiming in The Sunday Times in 2007, ‘Obviously, if we made an organism that produced fuel, that could be the first billion or trillion-dollar organism’ (Balmer, 2008).
In this context, Dr Venter’s patent applications on minimal living cells or on the making of synthetic genomes (UPSTO no. 20070264688) (Balmer, 2008) appear to be little more than an updated version of an overly broad patent forming a cartel, such as that by George Baldwin Selden and his patent granted in 1895 for a four-wheeled self-propelled vehicle.  Perhaps luckily for the automotive industry, Henry Ford managed to overturn the patent in an appeal to an already lost case, in 1911.  Such a comparison to the current situation is made even more fitting by the common use of the term ‘chassis’ to describe the minimal genome.

Summer and Science
Our team presented Fruitforce at the jGBM Summer Symposium in Marburg.
From the 20th - 22nd of May we went to Marburg to participate at ‘Summer and Science’ organized from jGBM, an organization of students from life science study fields.
Yana Parfyonova and Milena Krach are enjoying giving their talk.
iGEM is not only about educating others about the advantages and disadvantages of Synthetic biology, but it is also about learning about new developments in science and technology. The jGBM symposium provided an excellent opportunity to combine both. In interesting presentations, we have learned how research with the Marburg Virus is done and how Design Thinking influences the modern sciences and research. Also, a visit to venues of research in Marburg like the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology or the Center for Immunology in Marburg gave fascinating insights into new fields of research. On Saturday iGEM Teams got the chance to present their topics. We also got the opportunity to present this year’s project of our group and to introduce iGEM many interested participants of the symposium. People got an insight into the synthetic biology and their significant role in future. After the presentation, the audience got the chance to ask critical questions about our project and iGEM.
The audience is listening intensely to our team presentation.
Networking is part of iGEM.
In the evening it was time for the social part of the meeting. During an entertaining guided tour through Marburg we got to know historical stories about the University of Marburg, and in the following pub crawl, we talked about future collaborations with other iGEM teams. In general, Marburg was a successful trip where we both shared our knowledge with other iGEM Teams and got in contact with many interested people."
Nagahama,2017,Team:Nagahama#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. This was useful information for our project. We advised team Gifu about the selection marker of S. cerevisiae. Since Gifu seemed to be suffering from S. cerevisiae selection marker to be used, we suggested that we used genetic markers.
Furthermore, we discussed the matter regarding the safety and law concerning experiments and GMO. We taught mutually regulations on the handling of genetically recombined organisms. Gifu presentated about bio-safety.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo was founded last year and It is an iGEM team of Tokyo University of Science, a private university in Japan that participated in this year's first iGEM. Team Nagahama is one of the few private university teams in Japanese iGEM team. We helped each other. At iGEM Japan Kansai Forum , we were the only private university iGEM team, so we advised on how to set up funds at the time of group establishment, acquisition of funds, operation method etc. as the team of the same private university. We also taught how to write a wiki.In addition, We responded to the questionnaire that Botchan_Lab_Tokyo performed. This questionnaire was necessary as an appeal for Botchan_Lab_Tokyo to be allowed to participate in iGEM. There was a question such as whether I think it is a good experience to participate in iGEM .
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo has earned funds through Crowd Funding before us and has been collecting support beyond the target amount and making it succeed. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8JKakFLY7TYsYukTtGmsDGoeiY1lvAFV5h1YIyR2ipn-MiA/viewform
We got advice on how to support Bobchan Lab, for cloudfunding. In addition, there are many sites that can do cloud funding, it is important which site to use. We were at a loss what site we are going to do with cloud funding. Botchan_Lab_Tokyo taught us the feeling of use of the site ""campfire"" they used. This was useful information for us. And in fact Nagahama also used campfire. This advice is one factor in the success of our cloud funding. Botchan_Lab_Tokyo Collaborations

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#HEARTBEAT database_-_-_TEXT.html," the second SREBP binding site or the Sp1 binding site. Sequences having another type of putative SREBP response element are not functional. We thus showed that the sequences which most closely reflect the expected distribution also work best! These results point out that promoters can be predicted by HEARTBEAT. It also becomes clear that from the study of synthetic promoters, very useful information about gene regulation can be deduced. In order to obtain the information it requires elaborate models , which we started to develop. In the combination with RA-PCR , we provide two very powerful tools for the generation of synthetic promoters. We believe that especially by combining the two methods (see discussion M-RA-PCR ), we are able to create any promoter desired in the foreseeable future, thereby accelerating the progress of virotherapy development and fundamental research alike.
Automatization of promoter sequence generation
In this work, the design of promoter sequences was an ad-hoc process which took an entire day. We therefore developed a GUI which assists users  with sequence design and automates certain step. Tools such as this will make promoter design a very easy task in the future.

Transfer 0.2 mL aliquots into labelled Eppendorf reaction tubes and freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen. Store the cells at -80°C. The volume of the pre-culture strongly depends on the E. coli strain. Using DH5α, it is recommended to use 4 mL pre-culture and inoculate at 8 a.m. Nex day around 10 a.m. this strain should have reached an OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6. If you use the strain XL1-Blue, you will need less cells and it is sufficient to inoculate the SOB medium around lunchtime.

Looked through our fridge and freezer. Put all relevant microfuge tubes into the ""2010 Parts Kit 2"" green box.
Could not find 006, nor 007 but did find 008 and 009 and so,inoculated 3 tubes for each.
Digested parts 003, 006, 007, 008, 009 and pSB1C3 with E + P. Purified these digests and then left them over night in part + pSB1C3 ligations. Also, made 3 inoculations of pSB1C3 and 2 inoculations each of 009/008 (total of 7). These are all on the shaker.
Tuesday, October 19
Miniprepped pSB1C3/008/009 (9 tubes in total) from the incubator.This is required in the case that the transformations are unsuccessful,so that we can start over.

Secretory invertase
I. Background
RafD, which is primitively from the raffinose operon of E. coli, can express a β-fructofuranosidase. It can hydrolyze raffinose into fructose and meliose, and sucrose into glucose and fructose. HlyA is a secretory protein in bacteria, which can be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence at the C terminal by a transporter constructed by HlyB, HlyD and TolC. This part is designed to produce a secretory invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose in media to feed the bacteria without invertase.
II. Experimental design
Figure 0. The genetic circuits of the secretory invertase
As is demonstrated in the genetic circuit, RafD is ligated to the signal peptide of HlyA. The plasmid can also express HlyB and HlyD, but the expression is controlled by PBAD. Besides, TolC originally exists in the genome of E.coli. Thus, the RafD enzyme is able to be transported to the media and hydrolyze the sucrose outside the cells.
Because the promoter of HlyB and HlyD requires arabinose to work while arabinose is a carbon source, an experiment to test whether this part or the arabinose added to activate the PBAD is what bacteria live on becomes necessary. We used two test parts, Secretory invertase and Pcon_mRFP_TT. Each of them are transformed into E. coli MG1655"

（7） Put the lid onto the electrophoresis chamber and connect it to the power supply, making sure to put it in the right direction since the DNA runs from the negative electrode (black) towards the positive electrode (red).
（8） Run the gel at 120V for about 15~30 min, stop the electrophoresis when the loading gel dyes move to about 2/3 of the gel.
（9） Move the gel from the gel tray to a UV table to visualize the gel bands and take a picture of the gel.
※ Use protective glasses.
※ If sufficient separation was not achieved, put the gel back into the buffer chamber and run it for a longer time.
2. DNA Gel Extraction
（1） Carefully excise the target DNA fragment using a clean scalpel and put it into a clean 1.5-mL microfuge tube.
（2） Weigh the gel slice to determine the volume of gel dissolution buffer to be added. For each 0.1 g of gel, add 100 μL gel-dissolution buffer. Incubate the mixture at 50 °C for a few minutes until the gel has completely dissolved. Mix by shaking or inverting the tube every 2~3 min.
（3） Put the adsorption column into a collection tube, add 500 μL of equilibration buffer into it, centrifuge in the tabletop centrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 1 min, and discard the waste liquid.
（4） Cool down the gel solution to room temperature and transfer it to the adsorption column, incubate at room temperature for 2 min, centrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 30~60 s, and discard the waste liquid.
※ For gel solution volumes greater than the maximum volume of the adsorption column, load the same column and centrifuge multiple times.
（5）Add 600 μL of wash buffer diluted with absolute ethanol , centrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 30~60 s, discard the waste liquid; do the procedure a total of 2 times.
（6） Reusing the collection tube, centrifuge the empty column at 12 000 rpm for 2 min to dry the column matrix.
（7） Place the column into a clean 1.5-mL microfuge tube, add 50~100 μL ddH2O (sterilized，pre-heated to 50"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," it to a insolvent question.
E. What “real question”? : Practices and alienability of the living.
We can find two set of “solvable” questions which could answer to the reliance of the ethical perspective we are trying to get. These questions will lead us, at first, to the field of practices in synthetic biology. Then, we will wonder about the status of the living, not about its “essence”, but as a “social object” : an object of exchange.
The work of Vivagora enlighten the question of practices. If there is an operative question about naturality and artificiality, practice could be an indicator of it and we can follow our survey by wondering if and how scientific practices are affected by that dualism.
The question of naturality and artificiality makes sense in the challenge of interdisciplinarity the field of synthetic biology implies. Thus, if we leave the literal analysis to wonder about the practices hidden by the term “natural” and “artificial”, we will find a set of stakes, maybe more disciplinarian than ethical. That new entry on practices will also take us to a different goal : we won't notice the trying to oppose naturality and artificiality (by trying to get to the tension between these terms), but, on the contrary, to make them coexist, reconcile, and so, to give up that tension.
As Vivagora show it, the question of the natural and artificial could be reached by the hard attempt of an “engineering will”, used to work with controllable devices and the living, which is aleatory and unpredictable. Without succeeding in defining either concept, we will try to attribute some “quality” to artificiality and naturality. Those qualities are called up to progress in our inquiry, we are neither trying to “fix” what could be natural and artificial, nor to juxtapose it rigorously to the scientific practices we will describe.
We are less wondering about the artificial organism than about practices which, trying to create it, are taking a part in the question of this type. We have to evaluate the canons, the models of engineering : what is an engineer looking for? By roughly relating them, we will discover that they are clashing with some quality we can attribute to the living. Through these canons of the engineering method, we will find the formulation of technical needs, the abstraction of a process in order to replicate it easily, the homogenization and constitution of norms and standards of production and uses of the technology. That brief list, non exhaustive, of the objectives of the engineer's practical"

Sharing Biobricks with Paris Bettencourt
We are honered to have been asked by the iGEM team Paris Bettencourt 2012 to provide them two Biobricks: BBa_K175027 and BBa_K175041. Those biobricks were synthesized by the iGEM team TUDelft 2009 , project of which was Alkanivore. Alkanivore enables hydrocarbon degradation in aqueous environments.    This year's project of Paris' team is Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), a method for large-scale programming and evolution of cells.
Crash Course with Amsterdam iGEM team 2012
Right after the new team formation, we invited the Amsterdam team to our University and we together snatched an initial idea of what iGEM project stands for. The crash courses were given by the instructors of both teams and helped us a lot to shape the idea of iGEM project and gave us a direction to walk to.  The lectures given were with respect to:
Synthetic biology, iGEM, Biobricks and Registry
Modeling
Societal valorization
Genetic circuit design
Network motifs
Is worth to be mentioned that this first meeting with the Amsterdam team helped a lot in our interpersonal relations. After this meeting we came closer with members of the Amsterdam team and that was only the beginning for information exchange.

Preparation for electrically-competent E.coli cell
1. Materials needed
Two shake tubes, a triangular flask, a centrifugal cup (50 ml), fifty EP tubes                                     (1.5 ml).
Two YT culture medium(1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract and 0.5% sodium                                         chloride)
2. Preparation
2.1 Shake tube, triangular flask, centrifuge cup, rinse with H2O repeatedly without any cleaning agents. If cleaning agent is used, a lot of water  should be used to rinse cleaners.                                     It is really important that the cleaning agent will seriously devastate the transformation efficiency  of the cell. Finally, rinse with ddH2O twice.
2.2 All the devices dried in an oven at 50~100 ℃  after sterilization for  15  min at 121℃ (0.1 MPa).
2.3 Prepare two YT medium 150 mL, packed separately, two shake tubes                                         each 5mL and a triangular flask of 100 mL, sterilized in autoclave at  121℃ (0.1MPa) for 15 min.
2.4 Prepare 200 ml 10% glycerol, sterilized in autoclave at 121℃ (0.1 MPa)  for 15                                         min.
2.5 Prepare 200 ml ddH2O, sterilized in autoclave at 121℃ (0.1 MPa) for 15 min.
3. Process
3.1 Inoculate a loop of DH5 alpha onto LB broth culture. Incubate at 37℃ in   shaker overnight.
3.2 Inoculate single-colony on plate into shake tubes. Incubate at 37℃ in                                         shaker overnight.
3.3 Inoculate 1% seed culture solution into shake bottle. Incubate 200 r/min, 37 ℃ in                                         shaker. 2.5 h after Inoculation,  start to measure the figure of  OD600.
3.4 Put the shake bottle on ice for 10 min when OD600 reach to 0.4~0.5. At  the same time. Pre-cool the ddH2O, 10% glycerol and the centrifugal  cup ("

Started a new flask cultivation of E. coli KRX with BBa_K863000 , BBa_K863005 , BBa_K863010 , BBa_K863015 or BBa_K863020 with positive ( BBa_K525710 ) and negative control (E. coli KRX without plasmid).
Settings: 300 mL flasks without baffles, final volume: 60 mL, autoinduction medium, 0,35 mM CuCl2, 37 °C, 120 rpm, durance: 12 hours
Cells from today's cultivation were disrupted via sonication and laccase was purified by using the HisTrap column. This time the column was better cleaned by using the twofold volume of 500 mM imidazol.
Team Activity Tests:
Today we received even more samples from Team Cultivation. The interesting fact about those samples is that the cells that produced those laccases have been cultivated with CuCl2. We compared different measurements setup to see what the influences of different environments on the laccase can cause regarding enzyme activity. Figure 1 shows the activity of ECOL , XCCL , TTHL , BHAL and BPUL in H2O and with previous incubation of 0.4 mM CuCl2. Figure 2 shows the laccase activity in H2O without previous CuCl2 incubation. In both cases the enzyme activity is comparable. This let´s us conclude that their is no distinct difference between adding CuCl2 during cultivation of before activity measurements. Figure 3 and 4 show the results of the same laccase that have not been rebuffered in H2O but measured in an imidazole buffer that is used during purification. Only the BPUL laccase shows activity in the imidazole buffer.
Figure 1: Activity measurements via oxidized ABTS and OD420 of ECOL , XCCL , TTHL , BHAL and BPUL in H2O. The enzymes were incubated in 0.4 mM  CuCl2 before measurements.

After tuning parameters, such as the distance between the LED, the sensor, and the cuvette, and the diameter of the pinhole through which the light has to pass, we achieve results that are virtually identical to our most reliable laboratory spectrophotometer.

Workshops
We keep in mind the importance of interacting with the public and getting feedback from them, at at the same time communicate about science, synthetic biology and citizen science.  We collaborated with several institutions and teams to organize events and workshops where participants could test spectrophotometer units… or even build their own units!
Figure 7: DI-lambda Luna. It is a version designed specifically for our workshop at the ​NightScience 2015 conference held at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity in Paris. Largely based on the test rig model, with some added elegance. It is easy to build, and can be used for Do-It-yourself workshops. Search on github to get the complete design! External links are not permitted on wiki.
NightScience conference at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity in Paris was an opportunity in early July to meet 10 testers that built a simplified 1-channel version called DI-lambda Luna (Fig. 6). They had a high interest in electronics and synbio but low knowledge.
We took some time to cross the English channel and visit our friends at UCL. We spent a few days in London in the iGEM bootcamp organized by the students of UCL with the participation of synbio enthusiastics, high school students from UCL academy, and UCL, Birkbeck and London Hackerspace iGEM teams (Fig. 7). The pictures are just beautiful!
Figure 8: DI-lambda spectrophotometers built in a workshop with UCL, Birkbeck and London Hackerspace iGEM teams organized by UCL.
What is next?
We are planning to make this tool available to more people and be able to mass produce it, keeping a cheap price and simple design. The interesting features of this tool are the low price and the ease to hack it, tune it to a specific need.
In order to do this tool and many more, this tool will continue integrated in the project Open Science School, at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity of Paris.

Experiments
Experiments:
See integration of the key sequence in B. subtilis via the BioBrick BBa_K823023 integration plasmid in Proof of concept experiment.
Key sequence in BBa_K823023
BBa_K823023 is an available BioBrick from iGEM Munich 2012. It is an   integration plasmid for Bacillus subtilis, which can be used for   cloning in E. coli as well. An RFP is inserted in BBa_K823023 for more   efficient screening after transformation. It was chosen to   construct the Bacillus subtilis key strain. Construction was   performed as described in the following.

The Mad Scientist.
There are claims that genetic engineering is a dangerous technology and humans should not meddle with nature. While nature is sometimes depicted as serene motherly figure, in fact it is an everlasting fight for survival in which anything goes and gene transfer between non-related organisms is actually not that rare.
Though GMOs are a fairly new phenomenon, humans have been adapting other species for their own use for centuries through selective breeding. Increasing crop yields, enriching ordinary food with beneficial components through usage of GMOs might be just the next step in solving famine, malnutrition and other problems.

Define and initialize v
Let ei be the column vector that has 1 in the row for node i and 0’s elsewhere, i.e.           $$e_{ij}=\delta_{ij}=           \begin{cases}           1, & \text{if $i=j$} \\           0, & \text{if $i\neq j$}            \end{cases}$$
And ei is the column vector such that each item reflects the probability the walker stays at each node of the graph and the initial v is set to be ei.
Update v by
$$v'=\beta M v+(1-\beta)e_N$$
update code{v} until the terminal condition is satisfied, i.e.           $$|v^{(t)}-v^{(t-1)}|<\epsilon,\,\,\text{for sometime $t$}$$
Modify v
Since the first n components of v are the affiliation between key word i and the other key words which we are not interested , therefore we only keep the last m components of v, which reflects the affiliation between key word i and all the parts.
Build KD Tree of Keywords
Once the user enter a new word to our system, we need to search for similar key words efficiently , thus we build a KD Tree of key words to implement this function.
Here is our Algorithm
Train word vector model
We feed our word vector model with Wikimedia corpus . After the training process is done, we have a model that can convert words into numerical vectors, i.e.           $$f:\Gamma\rightarrow R^n$$
where Γ denoted the corpus space
Convert keywords into normalized vectors
let T denotes the set of word vectors
for keyword i in 1 to N:
T.append \( \frac{f(i)}{|f(i)|_2} \)
Build KD Tree
We use the standard construction procedure to build KD Tree of set T. Details will be ignored here. For the people who are interested , we offered a link to wikipedia in section2.
Collaborative Filtering
This is the final step to construct our Recommendation System , overall we use collaborative filtering strategy to make prediction.
Here is the algorithm
Transform users input
We get users input word k, we then convert it into normalized word vector v, i.e. $$v=\frac{f(k)}{|f(k)|}$$

Collaboration
We did a few things to collaborate with other teams. Through our collaboration, we both helped each other and developed good relationships.
Help HZAU build relationship with UT-Tokyo
First, the team from Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU) found us and asked us to help them contact UT-Tokyo. With the help of our software, they successfully established communication and talked about some academic issues. Second, several teams helped us test our software, did our questionnaires and provided us with feedbacks.
Receive feedbacks from other teams
Thanks to many other teams’ feedback, we could improve our software and offer our users better experience. It is not convenient to show all the feedback below, so we will only show the content of feedback from XMU and NEFU.
Feedback from NEFU:
1.Could not load the page of Map.
2.Hope to use customized stickers in Chat page.
3.Could not turn to Material page from Chat page.
4.It would be better show the type of files and the preview of images. For example, image files can be shown in thumbnails, pdf and doc can be shown in corresponding icons. Then it is more convenient to browse files.
5.End Time must be late than Start Time.
6.It would be better to explain these abbreviation forms in the guide book.
7.Sign-up function in Chat was not available.
Feedback from XMU:
About Map：    1. I can’t find the filter toolbar below.
2. I think some teams have not been listed here.
3. Error codes showed up when I clicked the “TEAM” button at the bottom.
4. After I entered Track, I can’t find the Back Button.
5. The background color of iGEM’s logo is very similar to the color of the website. If change another one, it will be better.
6. The word is not aligned here.
7. Some mosaics are misplaced.
8. To my understanding, the toolbar of setting up position information here may be misunderstood as a search button.
About ME:
As I see it, the typesetting is a little bit disordered. Probably that’s because the input box is far from the title.
About Homepage:
The speed of loading is not fast enough.
We felt a sense of achievement when we helped other teams by our own software. And we really appreciated all the help from other teams. Through"

Automatic Modeling Database Language
We use a database to store all the information we need in modeling. In order to realize automatic modeling, we construct the database in unified format and make it machine-readable. Every component of database has its specified attributes and values, which makes the format of the database a unique yet standard database language. We call it MoDeL : Modeling Database Language by picking out characters from three words. MoDeL is based on XML language, which makes it flexible and extensible.

Introduction of MoDeL based Automatic Modeling Algorithm
Development of Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) aims to provide a platform that enables separation of work between modeling and data constructing. Users could obtain dynamic behaviors of various quantities and other properties of a biological system as the output of iGame while they know nothing about details of modeling and the reaction network. Previous modeling and simulation tools require users to construct the network themselves, which is very hard even for professional researchers. iGame has no such requirements and users are only required to input data about the initial environmental condition of system. Hence, modeling is a task that is performed to find all reactions and species in the system.
To complete the final network from initial environment conditions, we first break up the task to several parts:
(1) Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file.
(2) Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species.
(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this"
Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#expe_-_-_TEXT.html," plan competitions.
The entrepreneurial stream of iGEM has given us the opportunity to explore the economic impact of synthetic biology. In previous iGEM projects with which the group has been involved, we were not required to consider how our project would fit into a specific market or effect the economy. For entrepreneurial iGEM, we had to learn how to do market research and adapt our financial projections based on the market. We had to develop a whole new skill set, learning how to integrate business and science.
Many first time iGEM students are faced with tackling the steep learning curve of understanding synthetic biology while learning new lab skills and usually balancing classes at the same time.  In order for this to be undertaken appropriately a few key skills are required, practiced and built upon.  These include organization and time management, these are a unique experience for each student, and are required in the end to sync with those of their team mates. As a team we have learned that available time to contribute to the project might now always line up and that the work will still need to be completed.  This has led us to develop skills in project management, where a global overview of the project is required.  From this perspective we are able to work on setting goals and understanding outside commitments so that we can align a work schedule with available time.
Dr. Ute Kothe, Associate Professor of Biochemistry, has seen first-hand how the Synbiologica team has grown and learned from High School, Collegiate and Entrepreneurial iGEM in these ways. She states, “The entrepreneurial iGEM opportunity offers students the richest learning environment I have ever seen. The four students in the Lethbridge team, whom I all know personally, have grown significantly while working on this project. They all have acquired a range of professional skills that are far beyond what is offered in a regular science program. Obviously, they have gained deep insight into management, budgeting, patenting, creating business plans and other topics associated with forming a start-up company. But in my eyes even more valuable is what they learned about themselves: these students have experienced that with motivation and determination anything is possible. They have learned that they can learn anything if they want to. They have developed an incredible independence. They have learned to communicate with any type of person to promote their cause. All this not only helps them in their entrepreneurial iGEM project, but it will be a catalyst for their future careers in any type of field whether it will be scientific, entrepreneurial or even something entirely unrelated.”
The Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team and Synbiologica would like"

Differences in the first base can be accommodated by anticodon 'wobble'. At least one tRNA was included for each amino acid.

Selection of the individual modeling genes can be seen under the Modeling tab of the Bioinformatics section.  From the lists determined by the model there are 116 genes where were determined to be essential.  The model only contains metabolic genes of the MG1655 ''E. coli'' genome therefore all other types of genes were solely determined using literature sources.  Many of the genes that were determined to be essential are due to the complex nature of metabolic pathways.  It is not sufficient to simply delete a single gene and determine if the organism is viable.  Often genes act in complexes, or become essential if other genes become deleted (for example in redundant processes where 2 genes fulfill the same essential function) allowing the modeling work to fill the gaps of numerous genes which are required for life.  The function of many genes which were added include transport of small metabolic compounds.  Although there are some new pathways"

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China#test32_-_-_TEXT.html," our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.
rNorheastern University
    In August 2018, we came to Shenyang, China, and exchanged ideas with two iGEM teams at Northeastern University, and further explored the next step of cooperation.
    First, we introduced the iGEM project and provided comments on each other's projects. Since our team currently lacks a lethal system, in this exchange, we worked with NEU_China_A to jointly verify and optimize the cold shock system, improve the project, and meet the iGEM safety requirements.(To be continued)
rIgem Xuzhou Communication Meeting
    At the beginning of the meeting, the four universities (Dalian university of technology, Lanzhou university, Jiangnan university, Zhejiang university of technology) publicized the igem related situation to the students present and answered everyone's questions. Since the meeting was in the third quarter of the National Undergraduate Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, it achieved good publicity. Next, the four universities introduced their projects in turn, accepted questions from everyone, and explained the bottlenecks of the project, hoping to get inspiration through discussion.
    Our team's project has aroused great interest from the teachers and students present. Everyone said that the project is novel, practical, and cleverly designed, but at the same time it also put forward many opinions. First of all, because our products have to enter the human body, the lethal system is essential, and how to maintain it in the body is controllable and effective is also an extremely important problem; secondly, how do we penetrate the intestinal wall to act on the blood; finally, respond in vivo What is the threshold value of uric acid and can be sensed before the minimum value. We answered the above questions one by one.
    This exchange will be very rewarding, not only learning the advantages of other teams, but also discovering their own shortcomings. And with the help of some teams, Jiangnan University expressed its willingness to provide E. coli exocrine system. Zhejiang University of Technology expressed its willingness to exchange experience in mathematical modeling and learned that Beijing University of Technology has a signal amplification system.

Violacein pathway
Introduction
We use some parts which are from iGem 2009 Cambridge and iGEM 2010 Slovenia, called the Vio operon.
This is a spontaneous cascade pathway. The initial compound, L-tryptophane is catalyzed by VioA to indole-3-pyruvic acid imine (IPA imine) which then is converted into dimer by VioB. Later, VioE transforms the dimer to protodeoxyviolaceinic acid (PVA). The product, PVA, could be further converted into different compounds, such as deoxyviolacein catalyzed by VioC or protoviolaceinic acid catalyzed by VioD. The product, protoviolaceinic acid, can be converted into violacein by VioC (Figure 1). The branched pathway is made by enzymes’ reactions in different order. For instance, L-tryptophane has to be converted into deoxyviolacein by VioABEC, and into Violacein by VioABEDC.  (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Violacein pathway
Design
We design three circuits (Figure 2, 3, 4) to obtain the chain mechanism. With the help of different RNA thermometers, we can decide the final product by placing the E.coli in different temperatures. And we can also stop the pathway in intermediate states.
Following is the three circuits:
Circuit A
Figure 2. Circuit A: Expression of
vioA, vioB ,and vioE
In circuit A, we used the constitutive promoter, Ptet ( BBa_R0010) to initiate the expression of
vioA, vioB ,and vioE
, which convert L-tryptophane into PVA.

So we can say that devices for developed countries are not needed for worldwide. We should consider about their environments, areas and so on…
Q4. What image of synthetic biology do you have?
Many of Japanese people are interested in synthetic biology but some people think that synthetic biology is difficult.
Talking about Indonesia, most common answer is “difficult”, but as many as people think “fun”!  Both countries, their main 2 answers are completely opposite.
These results show that if there are some opportunities to know about synthetic biology, people who think difficult will change their images from difficult to fun or interesting!
Q5. How do you think about iGEM after the questionnaire?
Both in Japan and Indonesia, people more generally considered each team join to iGEM are “fighting”, “interesting” and “they curious about projects” after answering the questionnaire. But in Indonesia, 22% think that iGEM is difficult. Probably Japanese have great deal of curiosities than Indonesian.
Q6. At last, how did your images for E.coli change?
Compared with Q2, the number of Japanese people who consider E.coli available got increase from 20% to 25%. And also the number of Japanese people who got interested in E.coli became increase. Our questionnaire gave Japanese who answer the questionnaire good images for E.coli. And in Japan, through the questionnaires, negative images were dramatically decreased.
On the other hand, in Indonesia, some people think that E.coli can be used as a machine. Our questionnaire gave Indonesian many ideas of using E.coli.
Japanese could know about E.coli and they tried to learn about E.coli and synthetic biology.
So we could make them to have interested in E.coli.
Moreover, we took a questionnaire to 50 female high school students. We asked them a image of E.coli and an interesting iGEM project.
Q1. What kind of images do you have of E.coli?
The most common answer is “dirty” and the second one is “cause for catching disease.”  From this result we were aware that many female high school students feel E.coli as bad thing because they don’t have opportunities to learn about E.coli.
The reason why the TV programs only introduce its’ bad images, so young people who like to watch TV have negative images for E.coli.
Q2. How do you want to use E.coli in your lifestyle?
They want to use as devices for practical use, for example removal of the fungi (18 %)and small"
St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#debate_-_-_TEXT.html," the overall cell.  They began their discussion of the benefits of synthetic biology by introducing the role particular biobrick sequences could play in the treatment of disease.  Dundee mentioned examples of ongoing scientific projects such as the effect of using various biobricks to synthesize pharmaceuticals treat malaria and diabetes. But the use of biobrick sequences extend further than simply medical applications.  Synthetic biology can also help to produce greener fuels, such as bio-alcohol or photosynthetic algae, which are becoming increasingly popular due to the changes in the world’s climate and increasing dependence on fossil fuels.  Dundee introduced the idea that synthetic biology could be used in controlling and reducing the spread of oil spills, by creating bacteria that are able to metabolize oil, enabling them to be utilized in the cleanup effort.  Novel ideas like this open the door for synthetic biology to play an important role in environmental protection. Other applications of synthetic biology include material production, such as cellular production of fertilizers and pesticides that could help to boost agricultural growth, or chemicals that require non-cost-effective human effort to synthesize. It seemed as though synthetic biology could solve some of the most prominent problems of our time.
Following the Dundee iGEM presentation was the St Andrews iGEM Team, who discussed the negative aspects of synthetic biology.  St Andrews chose to highlight three main practical dangers of synthetic biology, including how best to prevent these disasters from occurring in the future.
St Andrews introduced the concept of bio-terrorism within a synthetic biology context. Whilst one of the best things about the synthetic biology community is its largely open-source approach, this also means that anyone with the appropriate equipment and skills (which are widely available) could assemble a virulent strain of bacteria/virus - we highlighted for example the assembly of Polio from mail order oligonucleotides [Cello et al. 2007]. Another practical danger is the prospect of an organism escaping the lab and being released into the surrounding environment.  The danger here is two-fold, with the bacteria either colonizing an individual or individuals, potentially causing serious bodily harm and even death, or the bacteria colonizing the environment, causing damage to the environmental niche, or out-competing other natural flora into extinction.  The last practical danger is the need for scientists to test synthetic bacteria in an open environment.  Whilst some applications such as creation of pharmaceuticals could be done entirely in the laboratory, other projects such as the Arsenic sensor that was produced by another iGEM team would inherently need to be released into the field to realize their application.  The fear here is that the potential"

The direct determination of the component functions of RS-HDMR at different values in the unit hypercube by Monte Carlo integration can require a large number of random samples. To reduce the sampling effort, the RS-HDMR component functions may be approximated to any desired level of accuracy by either analytical approximation or numerical approximation. In our code, we implement the former approximation, which approximate the RS-HDMR component function by expansion in terms of a suitable set of functions. Specifically, orthogonal polynomials \cite{paper7} are used as a basis to approximate <math>f_{i}(x_{i})</math> , <math>f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})</math> as follows:

Columbia-Cooper-NYC,2012,Team:Columbia-Cooper-NYC#Columbia notebook 1_-_-_TEXT.html," data does not seem very reasonable since the solid media with no bacteria ended with a higher % decrease in copper mass than the solid media with bacteria. This may have occurred because of basal oxidation or perhaps bacteria accelerated the etching at around Day 7 and died at around Day 9. Thus, etching leveled off while basal oxidation continued almost linearly for the no bacteria case. Another possibility is that the data points do not make sense to actually make an interpolated plot for them. Either way, we need new data and new experiments.

170 pieces of 2 x 2 cm copper pieces were cut using scissors. The samples were then rinsed with 70% ethanol and dried with KimWipes. We made 1L AFM for later use. Labeled 12 petri dishes that had solid media(6 for bacteria and 6 for no bacteria, in which each dish has 4 pieces of copper). The masses of each copper sample were measured and recorded. Refer to the Summary of Tables for the masses of the copper samples. We could not finish set up because we do not have bacteria ready. Instead, we took a 1.2 mL OD 25.7 bacteria and diluted it to 10 mL of OD 3.08 bacteria. We placed 100 mL of the fresh AFM we made into each of our 9 flasks, and inoculated 1 mL of OD 3.08 bacteria into each flask for them to grow. We then placed the flasks in the shaker. It will only take one day for the bacteria to deplete the media because of the high starting OD.
July 19
Preparing Liquid and Solid Media:
At the start of the lab session, 1 L of liquid AFM and 150 mL of solid AFM were created. Using the radius of the petri dish (5 cm), it was determined that in order to create a layer of solid media of about 1 mL high, 8 mL of solid media would be placed in each Petri dish. The solid media was pipetted into pre-labeled dishes containing copper pieces. The temperature of the solid media dropped too quickly upon pipetting, however, and the media solidified before it could be spread evenly on the dish. In order to submerge the copper pieces in media, the solid media was pipetted onto the copper pieces, then the dish was tilted to promote spreading. The parts of some of the copper pieces that were not submerged (specifically 2.3, 2.4, 4"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. The ssDNAp concentration is decreased to avoid to much stabilization of d-AuNPs by the ssDNAp. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA, 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (100nM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we attended a workshop based on general molecular biology techniques.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. Also, the team members were assigned in different parts of the project such as the detector TALEs, the reporter Ferritin, Linker, Human Practices, Modelling, and Business.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We did our literature search for optimization of TALE binding affinity. There were conflicting results for the optimal truncation of the N and C terminus. On N terminus, 152 (Miller et al., 2011), 147 (Mussolini et al., 2011), 186 (Slovenia’s TALEs), and 158 or 186 (Mercer et al., 2012) residues were retained. On the C terminus, 28 or 63 (Miller et al., 2011), and 76 (Slovenia’s TALEs) residues were retained.
We learned about three very important TALE characteristics:  Firstly, TALEs demonstrate polarity. In other words, they interact more strongly with DNA at the N terminus compared to the C terminus (Meckler et al., 2013). Secondly, the thymidine nucleotide at the zero repeat is"

Aachen (2014)
For controlling the efficiency of the newly developed methane biosensor, it was necessary to have an equipment as reference. Therefore, we looked for former iGEM teams who dealt with methane and might have a basic gadget which is able to determine the concentration of methane. The iGEM Braunschweig ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Braunschweig ) modified  E. coli in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. They intended to place these bacteria in cow’s rumen, which is a serious source of methane emission, where the bacteria would have transformed methane into non-greenhouse gases. They wanted to know how much their bacteria can reduce the methane emission, therefore, they created collaboration with iGEM Aachen ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen) , and thanks to this collaboration, they was given a low-cost DIY methane sensor ( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Collaborations/Braunschweig ).
We liked the construct very much, so we asked Team Aachen for the plans and the program of the sensor and we received valuable help, which we appreciated very much. Thank you!
UNebraska-Lincoln 2017
Since all scientific work should be carried out at the highest level human and environmental safety, we found it important to spread the priority of biosafety. Team UNL 2017 (https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln ) aimed to teach other teams to form their Safety cases. They asked us to help creating their Safety case, and we advised them some further aspects how they could  develop their well-written work ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Collaborations#hungary ). We also received useful help from UNebraska-Lincoln team so we could accomplish the Safety part of our project.
To be able to finalize our construct, it was needed to have an effective promoter, which can be used in the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. We inquired whether they know a possible promoter, and hopefully it was not an unknown question to the UNL 2017 Team. Thank you very much!

Michigan,2016,Team:Michigan#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," There are two parts, the inner part with a filter and the outer part that’s just a tube. Label both of these parts to avoid any mix ups.
10) This is a critical step. Read this whole thing very carefully or you will likely have to repeat this whole procedure. Transfer as much of the supernatant as you can (usually between 800uL and 1000uL) from the tube you just centrifuged onto the filter of the tube from the kit. TWO IMPORTANT NOTES: 1) Do not touch the gunk at the bottom of the tube you just centrifuged, try and avoid sucking any up into the pipet by placing the pipet tip on the tube’s wall a little above where the gunk is. It is better to get a little less than 800uL and no gunk, than 800 uL and gunk. 2) DO NOT touch the filter of the tube from the kit with the pipet tip. Hold the tip just above the filter and drip the contents onto the filter. Do it slowly so that the filter has time to absorb it and you don’t overflow and lose anything.
11) Centrifuge the new tube with the filter in it for 60 seconds at 13,000 rpm. BALANCE.
12) Detach the bottom/outer part of the tube, dump its contents but keep the tube itself. It’s ok if you don’t get all of it out, just get the tube as empty as possible.
13) Put the inner part with the filter back inside the now empty outer part. Drip 500uL of Buffer PB onto the filter, again taking care not to touch the filter.
14) Centrifuge for 60 seconds.
15) Detach the outer part and discard the flow-through again, then put the inner part back inside.
16) Drip 750uL of Buffer PE into the filter, again taking care not to touch the filter. Make sure the bottle’s top has a check mark in the appropriate box.
17) Centrifuge for 60 seconds. Discard the flow-through.
18) Centrifuge again for 60 seconds.
19) Discard the whole outer part of the tube, placing the inner part in a new, clean, and labeled normal tube.
20) Drip 50uL of Buffer EB onto the filter, again taking care not to touch the filter.
21) Let it stand for 1-2 minutes.
22) Centrifuge for 60 seconds.
23) Throw out the inner portion of the tube."

We didn't know iGEM until April,2015,so this is our first time to attend this famous, international competition. Because of the narrow schedule, Ruicheng and Junhao tried their best to apply fund supports from the College of Plant Protection and other administrative departments of Fujian Agriculture University (FAFU). And we are very grateful to receive the first fund support ($4000) to register the FAFU-CHINA team, which approved by FAFU vice-president, professor Wenxiong Lin. Meanwhile, we are very thankful to get help from Ms. Xiuhui Li, the vice-director of Office of Educational Administration. What’s more, our English teacher Penny offered potential help during our registration of the team. Without their help, our iGEM team would still be a plan.
After the establishment of team, Prof. Zujian Wu helped us with the experiment plan. Besides, Prof. Wu tried to help us get fund and academic help. He recommended Prof. Xiaolei Huang to be a co-instructor of the team. Prof. Huang helped to establish our team by his abundant teamwork experience. Meanwhile, he supervised the whole process of our project and helped us finish each part before deadlines. During the project, Prof. Bingfeng Zhou and Prof. Taiyun Wei offered necessary biology materials, respectively, including bees, honey, and virus. Without their help in academic and organization, we would not be able to complete our project on time.
Our team members are with different abilities and backgrounds, which is good to our project. Changlong Lu and Ruicheng Dai completed the experiments. As seniors, they often introduced advanced biological technologies to other freshmen team members. Zhili Lai joined FAFU-CHINA team because of the publicity from Junhao Lu.
Lai has strong abilities to solve kinds of problems. Besides experiments, he was mainly responsible for presentation and outreach of our work. Liangdi Chen contributed a lot in designing the logo of our team, posters and wiki. Meanwhile, Tong Tong, Mucheng Cai, Zirui Chen, Yifan Tang, Tengzhou Huang, Mengnan Li provided their contribution in several tasks, such as publicity, interview, human practice and so on.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," the dilution worked properly. The next step was taking 500 μL samples of the each diluted cultures at 0 hours and                  6 hours. Thus we measured OD600 of 32 samples and imported the data into Excel sheet. Our plate reader’s setting was 25 degrees Celsius                  at 600nm and the pathway correction was turned off.
Furthermore, we were so ambitious to finish the protocol and make it perfect. Thus, we specially tried to prevent every single                  contamination risk. We worked in a hood and close to fire. Every material we used such as pipette tips and Eppendorfs were sterilized.
After we were sure that we were working on a sterile environment and we were ready, the starting sample preparation of Colony                  Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures protocol was set. We made a 1:10 dilution of the cell cultures of positive controls and                  negative controls. Then we measured the OD600 of the cultures and used LB + Chloramphenicol as blank media. The next step was just                  calculations. The cultures were diluted to 0.1 ABS at 600 nm in 1 ml LB + Chloramphenicol for each culture of each Control device.                  At the end, we had three starting samples of each control devices’ cultures.
The math was perfect but it was just the beginning. We made a serial dilution of all the starting samples. It took us so long.                  We prepared three tubes of 1900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol and two tubes of 900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol for each serial dilutions.                  Then started from the beginning and add 100 μL starting sample into 1900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol. The serial dilution was constructed                  as suggested in the protocol. These steps were done for each starting samples. After the serial dilutions, we spread plate 100 μL on LB +                  Chloramphenicol for Dilutions 3,4,5 and incubate at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. After approximately 20 hours of incubation, we counted                  the colonies and multiplied by the final dilution factor. The results were imported into plate reader forms, and submitted to iGEM.

Sensor
Our phosphate- and nitrate-sensitive devices are responsible for detection of environmental phosphate and nitrate. Besides that they transform the input signals into ""readable information"" for decision-making devices.
much work has been done for characterization and modification of nitrate- and phosphate-sensitive promoters. A whole set of design ideas for TCS modifications are also presented for other igemers. Additionally an actuator that can remove the phosphate is recommended.

Decision-making Device
Our decision-making device aims at processing the concentration change of nitrate or phosphate into visible buoyancy increase. Comparator recognizes the difference of two inputs quantitatively ,while ratio sensor could senses a particular ratio between two inputs.
Both comparator and ratio sensor facilitate a ternary system consisted of two small RNA and GFP mRNA. The concentration change of external two inducers leads to the transcription rate change of small RNA(alpha s)in this ternary system, the interactions between three RNAs will lead to interesting behaviors of our system like sensing the difference between two inputs quantitatively(Comparator) or the ratio of two inputs(Ratio senor).

Why I Joined iGEM: There was definitely a stochastic aspect to it! By chance, I ended up working in a wetlab my freshman year. Like many of those with electrical engineering background, I was fascinated by the parallels between synthetic biological systems and circuit design. I wanted to continue to explore topics of biological modularity and control, as well as learn more about modelling non-linear systems. So when I found out about iGEM, I knew it was something worth pursuing!

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," its greatest value lies in whole-cell multiple Biocatalysts. So we try to build extracellular metabolic pathways, coordinated with intracellular metabolic pathways, to reduce the burden of bacteria. The successful construction of this system will lead to a new era in the field of fermentation engineering.
To fulfill our ambitions, we choose these following five enzymes: xylanase A, PETase (which has been mutated and displayed by TJUSLS-2016), endo-1,4-β-D-glucanohydrolase (EG), exo-1,4-β-D-glucannase (CBH), and β-1,4-glucosidase (BG).
Display module-parts design
Same as the microtubule section, here we choose the vector pYD1 to fulfill the display function. As shown in Figure 5, pYD1 vector contains AGA2 gene, which, as has been described above, codes AGA2 protein. Our target protein is fused on the C-terminus of AGA2p, which is shown as multiple cloning sites in Figure 5.
So after being induced by galactose, our target gene expression can be initiated by GAL1 promotor. Additionally, there are also several tags on the plasmid such as V5 tag and His-tag, which will be used in further analysis.
Here we also divided parts design into two parts: displaying the building block—FliC, and displaying several monomer enzymes respectively to test and compare the catalytic activities of the monomeric display enzyme and the polymeric display enzyme. There is a small difference between these two parts. If peptide is fused on the N-terminus or C-terminus of flagellin, the polymerization will be significantly affected. So we cut down the AGA2 gene from the vector pYD1, and inserted it into FliC gene to replace the central region. Research shows that the His-tag should be fused on the C-terminus of the target protein so as not to affect the polymerization.
Therefore, we designed the following parts: pYD1-FliC (BBa_K2220002) , pYD1-XynA (BBa_K2220004) , pYD1-PETase (BBa_K2220005) , pYD1-BG (BBa_K2220007) , pYD1-EG (BBa_K2220006) , and pYD1-CBH (BBa_K2220008) , which means"
Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to work with stem cells or germinative cells. This equals modifying the baby in an irreversible way.
The main purpose would be to cure severe human diseases rather than common ones, or physical defaults. But what will happen when modifying babies in order to cure them becomes common? Can we trust this amazing technology will not be used to modify babies to make them taller, stronger, or smarter? Being able to modify babies as we please could lead to eugenics.
A break in research for ethical reasons?
In less than three decades, an uncountable number of researchers have contributed to the creation of this complex system called CRISPR-Cas9, which now leads to numerous possibilities. On 18th April 2015, Chinese scientists from GuangZhou published an article in Protein&Cell [2] . They used CRISPR-Cas9 in order to make genetic modifications on human embryos. This article was first rejected by Science and Nature for ethical reasons. These ethical problems might just stop advances in research. Since February 2016, English scientists have received permission to genetically modify human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9. [3]
As it was said during the International Summit on human gene editing in December 2015, we need to stop and ask ourselves the right questions about this technique and what it will lead to. It is very important to ask ourselves these ethical questions now, during the early stages of this technique's development, before it brings up too many important issues which could force us to step back.
What about EpiCRISPR?
Our system uses a dead Cas9 which cannot cut DNA. Indeed, its two catalytic sites are inactive. We aspired to fuse this dead Cas9 to a methylase which can add a methyl group onto the DNA. This DNA methylation allows gene regulation. Moreover, it is transmissible to future generations. With this technique, DNA is not directly modified, but the expression of the target gene is: this is the principle of epigenetic. This technique modifies the expression, but not the coding sequence.
The advantages of our system are that methylations are precisely added, and modifications of genetic expression are easily reversible. Therefore, we do not modify the coding sequence of DNA. Our system is modular due to the customisable sgRNA.
As our epiCRISPR construct is transmissible to generations, it needs to be used cautiously.  Indeed even if the nucleotidic sequence is not directly modified, gene expression is. Moreover this system calls for taking a step back because of its youth.  Thus, in an ethical point of view our project"

The aim consists of reducing the possibility of meeting among moths of opposite sex. Thus, we will analyze the number of meetings in the three following cases:
When sexyplants are switched-off and males only interact with females.
When sexyplants are switched-on and have an effect of trapping males.
When sexyplants are swiched-on and males get confused when the concentration of pheromone level is higher than their saturation threshold.
It is also interesting to analyze a fourth case, what does it happen if females wouldn’t emit pheromones and males just move randomly through the field? :
Males and females move randomly. How much would our results differ from the rest of cases?
What is important is that between the first and the third case, the number of meetings should be less in the latter than in the former. Then we are closer to our objective fulfillment.

Alkaline Cellulase
BACKGROUND
      Cellulase refers to a group of enzymatic degradation of cellulose to form glucose. According to the optimum pH of valuecatalytic reaction, cellulase can be divided into acidic cellulase ( the optimal pH value is 3 ~ 5 ), neutral cellulase(the optimal pH value is 6 ~ 8) and alkaline cellulase (the optimal pH value is 8 ~ 10).
      Acidic cellulase has developed the earliest, applied widely at present. However, with the industrial application scope expanding, acidic cellulase revealed many problems. Such as in alkaline conditions, the enzyme activity is relatively low or no activity, poor stability, pH value in narrow scope, and under acidic conditions.Processing textile will produce the phenomenon of fading and so on, which greatly limits the application of cellulase in textile and detergent industry. Compared with the acidic cellulase, alkaline cellulase has to adapt to a wide range of pH value, good stability, and can withstand high temperature. As the advantages of detergent enzymes can make the clothes after being washed for many times feeling, keep bright appearance, not easy to cause textile fading.In the textile and detergent industry, alkaline cellulase has a wide application prospect.
       However, the current domestic research and application are more concentrated in the acidic cellulase.For the study of alkaline cellulase, because of many reasons of the enzyme low producing ability and the low specific activity, it has not yet reached the level of industrialization of production. Therefore,it is of great significance for seeking heat resistance, alkali resistance and specific activity of high quality alkaline cellulase. The SZU-iGEM team through the early study of alkali Bacillus III 23 screened from Inner Mongolia alkali Lake,which can produce enzyme up to 60 U /ml. On the basis of this, the SZU-iGEM team will transformed Escherichia Coli into a high yield, alkali resistance"

In addition to SDS-PAGE of the purified protein solutions, the identity of the proteins was also confirmed by mass spectrometry. To do this, a sequence unique to each TDPs’ amino acid sequence was chosen and screened for their presence in the proteome of the expression strain, BL21 (DE3). Subsequently, four cell cultures expressing a different TDP each were used to screen for all chosen sequences by mass spectrometry (MS) (see samples preparation) and an additional culture only featuring the same backbone (pSB1C3) as a control. The peak areas of the resulting mass spectrographs shown in Figure 27, reflecting the occurrence of a given sequence in the sample.
Figure 27: Bar chart graph including the peak areas of the TDP samples analysed by mass spectrometry after purification. For the control, the expression strain only contained the same backbone.
The unique peptides that were screened for were only present in each TDP expected to contain the sequence. The differences in peak height in Figure 27 can be attributed to the different lengths of the target peptides, which can influence the readout due to the variation of the mass/charge ratios. Hence, it can be concluded that the results were positive and the identity of the proteins could be verified by mass spectrometry.
Preserving lactate dehydrogenase activity with TDPs
As the production of TDPs by our cloned BioBricks had been validated by different methods, we moved on to evaluate the protective capabilities of our proteins of interest. We performed a series of preliminary activity assays with the enzyme “Lactate Dehydrogenase” (LDH) to determine whether the TDPs conferred desiccation tolerance to non-native proteins following the LDH assay protocol . In this assay, LDH was dried with and without TDPs and rehydrated before their measurement, so that the protection TDPs offer can be established as the difference between the initial and final enzyme activity. Subsequently, the feasibility of long-term storage with TDPs was studied by measuring the activity of LDH+TDP samples dried and stored at room temperature for different amounts of time, up to a maximum of 18 days. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
To the end of assessing the protective effect of the TDPs, all four proteins were tested as buffer"
