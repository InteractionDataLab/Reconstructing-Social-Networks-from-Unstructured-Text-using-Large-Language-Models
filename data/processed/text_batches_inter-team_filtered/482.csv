Procedure
The appropriate amount of EDTA-trypsin and complete DMEM in the incubator (37°C), before handling the cells.
The filter of a 1 ml pipette is broken off, and the pipette is attached to the vacuum suction maschine. The medium is removed, and the pipette is put in a 50 ml vial for later use.
1 ml 0,05% EDTA-trypsin/PBS is added to wash the cells. Tilt the flask quickly, so the EDTA-trypsin covers the cells. Remove the liquid quickly.
1 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA/PBS is added and the flask is incubated for 3 min at 37°C and 5 % CO2.
9 ml complete medium is added to inactivate the EDTA-trypsin and to wash the cells of the surface. Make sure the cells are well resuspended, before you transfer them.
2,5 ml (depends on the concentration of the cells) cell suspension is transferred to a new 75 cm2 culture flask.
The cells are kept at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until they are 80-100% confluent. This takes about 2-3 days. Then they are passed on to a new flask or plate.

Overall Project
Microorganisms use pheromones to monitor their own population density as well as to detect and interact with other microbial species in a process known as quorum sensing. For instance, bacteria can disrupt the pheromone signals of other competing bacteria, effectively preventing their proliferation. In a similar sense, we will exploit the natural communication systems involving Autoinducer-1 (AI-1) from Vibrio fischeri and Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) from Vibrio harveyi, to create a model biosensor system in Escherichia coli. We will engineer the genetic circuits necessary for the production of these pheromones into two populations of E. coli (termed Bad guy #1 and Bad guy #2, as per their respective Autoinducer). In addition, our third population of E. coli (termed Champion cell) acts as a biosensor by receiving these signal inputs and subsequently initiating transcription of specific E. coli-targeted bacteriocins (i.e. colicins). The presence of AI-1 induces the Champion to produce a colicin to which Bad guy #1 is susceptible, but to which Bad guy #2 is resistant, and vice-versa for AI-2. An additional aspect of our system is the ability of the Champion cell to report the presence of each specific Bad guy by producing a specific fluorescent protein (i.e. either green or red fluorescent protein) in tandem with the specific colicin as determined by the presence of either AI-1 or AI-2. We constructed this system using the molecular cloning methods utilized in iGEM. While the Vibrio fischeri components of our system were obtained as standardized parts from the iGEM Registry, we plan to clone and standardize all parts of Vibrio harveyi AI-2 quorum sensing system. All of the standardized parts will be flanked by the specific restriction endonuclease sites as required for iGEM BioBricks. This will allow for the simple and iterative directional cloning strategy for the construction of the necessary genetic circuits.

Packaging: The RXers learned how to design a restriction digest and created the digests for CsgA, dCBD, and pBAD samples. Later, the team performed the three digests, each with one sample, and left the samples to incubate in a heat block for several hours. In the afternoon, the whole iGEM team met with mentors to review the projects.
Week 6: July 5-6
Wednesday (07/05/17)
“Ring, ring, ring!” came from the laptop as the students huddled around to receive a Skype call from the Singapore iGem team. They were greeted by Wilbert from the Singapore team. They immediately began conversing with Wilbert and exchanged project descriptions and ideas. The team was very intrigued to learn about the Human Practices components of iGem from Wilbert. After a whole hour of video conference, the team learned a lot from the sagacious Wilbert. The conversation was very beneficial to the students as they learned about the different components of iGem. Wilbert even offered to help them with the wiki page!
Sense/Respond: Afterwards, the students arrived back to the lab and received presentation tips from mentors for the upcoming lab presentations the following week.
Packaging: The entire iGEM team convened to hold a Skype call with a representative from the Singapore National College's team. Later on Base, the RXers ran a gel on the results from the previous Friday's digests, which included pBAD, pCRBlunt-CsgA, and pCRBlunt-dCBD. Upon completion, the team members extracted DNA for each sample from the gel using a gel extraction protocol.

Sense/Respond: The next day, the group decided to do the InterLab in order to be considered for medal criteria. They sifted through the kit and found many useful parts that they could use in order to help standardize fluorescence.

Here's the result:
Here are the two opinions after the events :
Student A :
This time, the member of Mingdao iGEM 2017 hold a activity - drink sampling, which done the survey and the endorsement at the same time. I think the activity is great because the main goal of iGEM is to satisfied people's requirements after finding it, and the objective of genetic engineering is to make people's life more convenient. By the way, the drink taste better with sugar in most people's opinion.
Student B :
Although I’m not one of the members of the IGEM team, I still learn a lot from the course concerning this project. During the preparation, I saw some previous souvenir, which makes me wonder what kind of surprise they will bring us this time. First, they asked us to drink some beverages. Some were normal and some were sugar-free. This really confused me. Then, they asked us which one we preferred. I thought that they were doing some research to study the dietary habit of Mingdao students. Though didn’t participate in the game they play later on, I could surely feel the hard work they put into carrying out this project. You guys really did a good job. I sincerely hope that this activity can benefit your experiment. But, I suggest that next time the activity could be more simplified, or you can try walking instead of standing at a particular place!

The Cry protein is consisted of three functional domains. Domain I is a seven α-helices bundle. It can insert itself into a membrane by using its hydrophobic helices α4 and α5 to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The pore formation occurs on its α3 helix. Domain II and domain III are two β-sheets which are involved in the receptor interactions. Domain II contains extremely variable loops, which are the binding site of the receptor. Domain III has the function of stabilizing the toxin.
Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related. Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti..
Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the Cry stalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer as Figure5. 
 
 
Then the oligomer binds to a GPI-anchored APN or ALP. Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haemolymph rises causing paralysis of larvae and finally death.
However, there are evidences shown that there is another model of pore formation caused by Cry toxin action in L"

SOURCE: Cohen et al. (2004)
Without considering pretreatment and desalination costs, brackish water intake is much more expensive. Compare to seawater which mostly use open-water intake on costal, brackish water extracting from underground requires more energy. As Table 6.2.1 shows, pumping groundwater from 61.0m requires 0.24 kWh/m^3. This is about 20% of brackish water desalination process cost.
In the other hand, the cost of seawater intake goes to the intake design which avoiding impingement and/or entrainment. For example, some intake screens can be back-flushed with compressed air. These screens have no moving parts, operate with a very low velocity (to mitigate impingement), and are generally referred to as “passive screens.”(Zander et al, 2008).
Technical difficulty
As table 6.2.1 shows, seawater desalination requires about four times energy than brackish water and about 10 times energy than normal water treatment. This is the main reason why brackish water is more favored by desalination factory when it comes to reality. The higher salinity source water has, the more energy it needs and more processes it has to go through.
Since our project target lower energy cost, seawater desalination will provide more space to play. Our purpose is to bring this source water more competitively than brackish water. We will take this question to chapter"

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency: What is it?
A1AT deficiency is an enzymatic liver disorder that results from a genetic mutation in the SERPINA1 gene.
The SERPINA1 gene codes for the production of the protease Alpha-1 Antitrypsin in hepatocytes. A1AT is a protease inhibitor whose function is mainly to protect delicate lung tissue from damage from other enzymes active in the area. Once produced in the liver, A1AT is secreted from the cells and makes its way to the lungs via the bloodstream.
The normal version of SERPINA1 is known as the M allele and the mutation that most often results in severe A1AT deficiency creates the Z variant of SERPINA1. The SERPINA1 gene is codominant, so those with two copies of the Z allele are affected most strongly. This is the version of the gene we aimed to correct. As you can see, the mutation is only of a single base pair, and results in glutamine replacing lysine. The relative ease by which we could use CRISPR Cas9 to fix the mutation causing this disease was also a factor in selecting this disease for study.
The E342K mutation in SERPINA1 that causes A1AT Deficiency
Secretion of A1AT in cellsl
The Z mutant version of A1AT is prone to polymerization, rendering the protein unable to be secreted from the cell producing it. This causes the protein to build up within the liver. However, if not polymerized and successfully secreted, the Z type A1AT is fully functional. As a result, those with the ZZ genotype usually only have 10% of normal serum levels. As only a small fraction of needed levels of A1AT are available, the medical complications related to the disease ensue. This can include liver cirrhosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in the form of lung emphysema. These are all because A1AT cannot get to the lungs to protect the tissue and instead builds up in liver cells, causing damage. This in turn, results in recurring respiratory infections, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and rapid heart beat upon"

Coming from a bioinformatics background, we propose a trial-and-error inspection for finding the correct promoter by using a binary-logarithmic ""divide-and-conquer"" method. This will reduce the number of different promoters required to be tested.
Considerations
In future, screening the literature for candidate sequences that exhibit less leakiness in practice should be considered.
Some uncertainty comes from the fact that no parameters are known for the Cph8 photoreceptor - such that its optimal concentration range can only be guessed.

Project Description
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms. E.coli will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a Shewanella biofilm. Shewanella is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM."

Overview
In order to reach our goal , which is to introduce our project and amplify the impact, our team came out with some activities.
The efforts we made including having joined a meet-up with few universities, building up an official account, creating a questionnaire. There is a TED speech, which is provided by our members as well. If you visit our wiki, you will find a special video about our team. In this summer holiday, we completely produced a music video by every single one of our members, we filmed it, we recomposed the lines , and we gave it a name called Hey Plants,  which was based on the famous song from the Beatles.
Please find more details below.
Meet-up(SUAU)
This summer holiday, our team has participated in a Meet-up with another iGEM team , SCAU-China from South China Agriculture University, on July the 15th. In this seminar, we aimed at several brief goals and did receive a promising result.
TEAM FORMING
Having a small discussion about our project, we learned more about our process from the basic theories to the future usage of our potential products. Through  communication, we found out that there are still a few things that could be improved about our project, such as ways of experiment and methods of teamwork.
EXPERIMENTS
We visited their laboratories, where they were doing the experiments about their project at that time. The members of SCAU-China introduced us about some common equipment and some basic operations about molecular and synthetic biology.
MODELING AND WIKI
Team members of that university recommended some common software for data modeling to us , and then they gave us an accurate instruction of the software. In addition to this, the wiki group of their team and the one of our team had a simple meeting seeking better way of designing an impressive wiki. We shared our idea with each other and got the inspiration to improve our existing plan.
OTHERS
During the discussion, both of the two teams came up with some great ideas on human practice, such as activities on the Associations"

DISCOVERY DAYS: OCTOBER 16TH
Hosted by the Faculty of Medicine, Discovery Days is an event held annually for Alberta High School students.  Over three hundred students generally attend from a variety of schools in Calgary as well as outside of the city.  Focused on careers in the health and health related industries, the event includes a variety of activities including key note speakers and various small group sessions focused on.
The University of Calgary iGEM team had the opportunity to set up our posters and distribute hand outs to the students.  We also set up a laptop and gave students a chance to explore our Second Life Island.  As this event was catered towards students interested in pursuing careers in the health industry, it was a great opportunity to talk to students who may be interested in pursuing iGEM in the future.

Cornell_NY,2016,Team:Cornell NY#Integrated PracticesSomething_-_-_TEXT.html," We spoke to Bill Kilcer, the owner. He implemented robotic milking machines around 7 years ago for his farm of 130 cows. Robot farms require very little human interaction - cows step into the machine as they need to, and sensors detect the teats before latching on. We watched the process and noticed that the iodine spray was automatically sprayed after milking, unlike other farms where a person had applied it manually. Bill told us that our idea of having a temperature sensor, flow rate sensor, iodine spray, and indicator as part of the shell was already incorporated into the robots. He also said that our app would not be as helpful for him because all the data that the milk samples are tested for, such as conductivity, temperature, and amount of fat and protein, is already stored into the computer. This valuable feedback made us realize that our idea would be most helpful for bigger traditional dairy farms.

Scipio Springs Dairy
2049 Mosher Rd, Union Springs, NY 13160
We were thrilled to schedule our next farm visit to Scipio Springs Dairy in Scipio Center, NY because it was very different from the previous two farms that we had visited. Scipio Springs Dairy is a much larger farm with 800 cows and is set up like a traditional milking parlor, with 12 cows in parallel with one another. We met with Bill Morgan, who looks over the operations of the dairy farm, and the herd manager of the farm, allowing us to get a more well-rounded feedback on our wet lab, product development, and app components of our project. Bill was extremely interested in implementing bacteriocins on his farm instead of using traditional antibiotics. He was impressed by our modular idea for the shell because he believed that it was an all-encompassing prevention to mastitis. Bill believed that the UV light would be a great alternative to the traditional use of heat because heat changes the functionality of the proteins in the milk as well as the milk’s flavor. He also liked the idea of the temperature sensor because gram negative bacteria mastitis typically causes an increase in temperature. Using a temperature sensor would be better than the conventional way of finding out that the mastitis is caused by gram negative bacteria visually because by the time the cause is found, the damage to the cow and its milk is already done. Overall, Bill Morgan was supportive of our idea, and was interested in trying out our prototype and app once we finalized them.

Fig. 3 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of circuit, initial pH was set up to 3.0, when glsA was activated. pH can effect the activity of glsA, while glsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized at a suitable level.

USTC-Software,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The most intractable problem we confront is the overload on our server to complete the simulation task. After literature reviewing, we choose some factors, for example, translation rate, to which a designed gene circuit is most sensitive. We also set a range for parameter fluctuations. Some designed circuits are proven to be robust and resistant to environment perturbations, while some other plausible well-functioning gene circuits are sensitive to specific parameters. The analysis is crucial because it gives us deeper understanding of a complicated gene circuit and lays foundation for wet-lab realization of functional novel gene circuits.
5.DNA: Get the DNA sequence
Function:
After designing gene circuits, the DNA sequence and other information of the designed circuit are available for users to check and download.
Why to choose BioBLESS
Although many designs of logic gates have come into being, circuit design in a larger scale is still rare. With more inputs and more given functions, the inter-reactions among them may become too complicated for humans to analyze one by one.
BioBLESS is here to tackle the problem.
BioBLESS can offer multiple functions, and it can be of great help even if you need only single one function we provide. BioBLESS can generate optimized logic circuits and detailed gene circuits automatically, then depict most reliable ones for users after screening.
BioBLESS is far more thoughtful in analyzing and displaying interior structure as well as exterior integration, which makes the simulation more accurate and reliable.

The BL21 plate with the T7 phage showed plaques.  Unfortunately, these plaques were smeared and we were unable to differentiate the concentration.  However, the plaques showed that our purification was successful.  The W3110 plate with T4 phage showed no plaques.  It did have signs of possible contamination so we will rerun the test again.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the primary source route. Neither is the improper disposal of unused or expired pharmaceuticals, which are flashed down or poured in the drain, or residues leaking from pharmaceutical manufacturing [3],[4]. Excretion of active pharmaceutical substances after human usage is documented to be the primary source of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment [4]. From Figure 1 presented below, it becomes apparent that this route would not have been the main one if WWTPs were capable of removing pharmaceuticals adequately from sewage. As Christian Baresel noted, expert, research coordinator and project manager at IVL (Swedish Environmental Research Institute): “There are pharmaceuticals in the effluent of WWTPs. Today there is a high removal of microplastics, but not for pharmaceuticals’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
Figure 1. Entry routes of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment. (Redesign from Boxal AB 2004 [5])
One of the most significant implications of pharmaceutical pollution in the water is the development of antibiotic resistance, posing an apparent and substantial danger to human health. The presence of antibiotics in the environment promotes acquisition or independent evolution of resistance from bacteria that normally lack innate antibiotic capacity [6].
It is worth noting that resistance in bacteria can be developed even in exposure levels lower than the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) [7]. Thus, aquatic environment contaminated with antibiotics can serve as a reservoir for resistance that can be transferred to clinically vital bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms [8]. Eventually, these resistant bacteria with clinical importance disseminate and reach humans either via food or direct exposure to animal hosts [9, 10].
Another important implication of pharmaceuticals in the water is the ecotoxic effects they have on marine organisms. Pharmaceuticals are designed to intervene in biological pathways, and some of them are evolutionary conserved across different species. Hence, pharmaceuticals that were designed to have an effect on some species (including humans) may also exert significant effects on the physiological function of other organisms [11]. Due to their low but consistent concentrations, concerns arise primarily for the chronic rather than the acute ecotoxic effects, which are substantially more difficult to be defined and proved [12]. In addition, mixtures of active substances are present simultaneously in the aquatic environment and generally cause higher effects than each of their comprising components alone (synergistic effect), increasing the combined toxicity [13].
In the Baltic Sea, the effects of pharmaceutical pollution in the ecosystem are remarkably high due to the low water exchange rate, low biodiversity and the physiological stress induced by brackish water conditions. Therefore, the Baltic Sea"

Figure 1:  Aptamer-Based Fluorophore-Quencher Small Molecule Biosensing System
Data
Figure 2: ATP FQ Sensor (attached to Streptavidin-coated plate and unattached in solution). The x-axis is ATP concentration, and the y-axis is fluorescence fold-ratio. Fluorescence was measured using the SpectraMax GeminiXS Fluorescence Plate Reader and normalized against the negative control well for a fold-ratio. Variance was computed across two trials for the sensor inputs ATP, GTP, dGTP, and dGTP (all molecules within two functional groups of ATP). Because of limited NTP stocks, higher concentrations were reserved for the assay with the FQ system attached to a Streptavidin plate.
The graphs to the left are the data we collected from our test ATP sensor. We conclude from this data that this sensor worked well with high ATP concentrations, but with further research could almost certainly be optimized to work better at nanomolar concentrations. Advantages of this system include its customizability (theoretically it should work to detect any molecule for which there exists an aptamer) and its ability to retain sensory functionality while bound to a solid surface. Disadvantages include only detecting high concentrations of target ligand (at least currently, though this could theoretically be at least somewhat mitigated with further efforts at system optimization), and the fact that this system is fundamentally synthetic, limiting its ability to be easily and cheaply replicated in vivo like other bio-bricked parts. Instead, expensive new constructs have to be ordered to build each new sensor.
Biodevice Proof of Concept
Once we were able to achieve a working biosensor prototype, our next step was to utilize this in a scenario applicable to embedding in our bioballoon. We decided that cellulose sheets would serve as a satisfactory surface for proof of concept, knowing that later down the road, we could use different binding domains for latex, elastin, collagen, or p-aramid fibers. Conveniently the 2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM team had created a Cellulose Cross Linker BioBrick BBa_K1499004 that needed further characterization. We filled this need by purifying the protein (validating the presence of its HisTag), and binding our fluorophore sensor to the linker protein (with quencher). We then distributed this incubated concoction to wax-coated cellulose filter paper to measure the binding activity to the paper over a week. Initially the mixture"

iGEM Collaboration
This year, Cornell iGEM has collaborated with Yale iGEM by engaging in the team’s discussion about utilizing non-model organisms as part of projects and research.  This dialogue was to address the increasing amount of iGEM projects that have centered around these non-model organisms rather than Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Yale iGEM identified our project team as one that was using a non-model organism as part of our project, and have thus asked us to share our experiences working with our non-model organism.  We were more than happy to discuss our experiences of working with Flavobacterium psychrophilum , our bacteria of interest that we were trying to tackle with fishPHARM.
We discussed with Yale iGEM the troubles we had in terms of finding necessary information from scientific journals.  Another primary obstacle we discussed was growth rate - F. psychrophilum required a much longer incubation time (48-72 hours) before it could be usable in testing[1].  Furthermore, since F. psychrophilum is most active at 16℃ and below, both as a pathogen and in growth, it was necessary to work under these conditions for optimal activity[1].  Luckily, we were able to collaborate with a professor on Cornell campus who had worked with F. psychrophilum and was able to provide us much needed insight into the organism.  In collaborating with Yale iGEM, we share their sentiments in the hopes that future iGEM teams will be able to utilize a greater variety of non-model organisms for their projects based off of the challenges we encountered.

Besides, we estimated that today the cost production of biodegradable plastics is about 12-times higher than fossil plastics cost production [10-11] and according to Yale iGEM Team (2013) one gram of pure PLA costs around US$90. Moreover it is mostly manufactured from corn, a principal human food source [12], and it is necessary near 2,7 kilograms of corn to make 1 kilogram of PLA, requiring the use of many chemicals which are environmentally unfriendly [13].
Although several scientific studies already began to produce PLA using genetically modified bacteria [17], the main difficulty resides in finding a way to export the bioplastic chains outside the cell [18]. For example, large scale production of PHB, a type of PHA, is not wide-spread mainly due to the extraction of PHB is a difficult and expensive challenge. For this reason, some studies have achieved secretion of PHB in E. coli using a synthetic biological engineering approach to try to reduce downstream processing costs [19].
Considering all these elements, the team UChile-OpenBio wants to reach, in the long term, the implementation of a secretory biological production of PLA from a renewable resource, the brown macroalgae (kelp), which is located on the Chilean coasts. Our challenge, consists in making the biodegradable plastic production cheaper and develops an integrative way to synthesize them, using E. coli.
Main Goal
For the iGEM competition, the team aims to engineer a biological system, enabling it to degrade glucose in order to produce and export into the medium a biodegradable plastic called PLA.
Goal 1: Lactadora
   
Goal 2: PLAdora
    
Goal 3: Arabinita
Designing and implementing a self-regulated lactate production system which will allow to control the lactate production by pH-sensing: the higher lactate concentration, the lower the pH, which induces a negative control in the first population of E.coli, stopping the production of lactate and by the way, of PLA
   
Designing and implementing a PLA production and exportation system which will allow blue bacteria to send the biological PLA outside the cells, into the medium. This way, the purification of the bioplastic would be easier.
   
Designing and implementng a safety system, which will consists in making arabinose-dependent the cell survival. If the medium contains arabinose, bacteria will grow up, but if bacteria escape from their medium, the cells will produce"
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," our app. We changed the circles to ellipses. And when the ellipses consumed/ran into each other, the ellipse being consumed turned into a circle inside the other ellipse.  We then brainstormed and decided that we were going to introduce the concept of bacteria and viruses.  We decided to make the viruses, circles and the bacteria to be ellipses. And only the virus could be consumed by the bacteria, and the viruses could not consume each other and vice versa for the bacteria. One problem we ran into was the fact that the viruses were still widgets. So when the virus was consumed, it had difficulty staying inside the bacteria. However, after fiddling with Cornerstone, we figured out how to create Children, and the viruses stayed inside the bacteria and did not leave the bacteria.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Thursday was a SUPER productive day. We got a lot done! We FINALLY figured out how to set the boundaries so that the widgets won’t leave the screen. We also got them to bounce of the sides of the screen as well. The viruses and bacteria now randomly move around the screen, independent of touch. We also disabled free rotation and set the scale so that the widgets do not change size when touched. We also introduced marker action and recognition to our app. When you tap a marker on the screen, a new bacterium is created. The bacteria also grew to a certain size and divided into two smaller baby bacteria.  This was to mimic (not super accurate) mitosis and the asexual replication of bacteria. It copies the way that bacteria duplicates (increases to double its size and then divides into two at its midline),  When a virus is tapped on, more viruses were created. However, we came across an interesting problem.  When the widgets ran into each other, sometimes they bounced off of each other.

6/5/2015: Day 5
We have started programming specific actions for specific markers-- now, one marker creates a new Bacteria, one removes that specific Bacteria, and one displays the bacteria’s infection status with a simple attached textbox that states “Infected” or “Not infected”.  We explored around with the Image Widget so we can use our own images later for our project. After this week, we really found out how much flexibility we have with this project, and we can do many things with this screen.  We decided that we also wanted explore video widgets more in"
LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"R is a very special and vital transcription factor, which can bound to either of marO's two promoter sites rs1 and rs2(rs means repressor binding site). And MarR repressor is homodimer. And it can form tetramer once there is copper for its special structure(Fig 3). Copper(II) oxidizes a cysteine residue (Cys80) on MarR to generate disulfide bonds between two MarR dimers, thereby inducing tetramer formation and the dissociation of MarR from its cognate promoter DNA, two sites of marO(Fig 4)[1]. Some experiments firmed the explanation(Fig 5)[1].
So we chose promoter marO as the copper sensor. Cu2+ can oxidize Cys80 and make MarR apart from marO to derepress the MarR dimer. Than the promoter marO will start the following genes' transcription. In our part BBa_K1755301, the report gene is riboflavin. So we associated the copper concentration with the output of riboflavin.
During our experiments, it is a big surprise for us to find that the marO is able to respond to Cr6+ as well though it is not so strong as Cu2+.

3. Comparison Between Different Designs
In this part, we want to demonstrate some advantages of our design by making quantitative comparisons. These advantages include safety, energy efficiency and stability.
3.1 The post-transcriptional control ensures lower leakage
Firstly, we don't expect that our designed processing modules will alter its function by some noises of environment. So we design a coherent feedforward loop to filter noise. Here we use $x$ to represent a general input signal. As we mentioned before, the dynamics of the input module with post-transcriptional control can be described by \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{d[mRNA_{Cre}]}{dt}&=\beta_0+\beta_1\frac{[x]^n}{K^n+[x]^n}-K_{R}\cdot [mRNA_{Cre}]\\ \frac{d[taRNA]}{dt}&=\beta_0+\beta_1\frac{[x]^n}{K^n+[x]^n}-K_{R}\cdot [taRNA]\\ \frac{d[Cre]}{dt}&=K_{tl}\cdot [mRNA_{Cre}]\cdot\frac{[taRNA]}{K_m+[taRNA]}-K_{P}\cdot [Cre]. \end{aligned} \end{equation}
If there is no post-transcriptional control, this process can be described by \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{d[mRNA_{Cre}]}{dt}&=\beta_0+\beta_1\frac{[x]^n}{K^n+[x]^n}-K_{R}\cdot [mRNA"

What is iGEM?
iGEM is a synthetic biology competition and stands for Internationally Genetically Engineered Machines. It began as a friendly competition between 10 MIT teams in 2004, and has since grown to over 130 teams in 2010 from all different countries around the globe. This year even more teams are anticipated, and there will be regional competitions held before the annual international jamboree held at MIT in the fall.
iGEM revolves around two main ideas: the use of BioBricks and the registry . Biobricks are pieces of DNA that have been given a similar structure and that code for something useful. They can be big or small and may contain one or many individual pieces of useful information all packaged into one coherent piece. These biobricks all contain the same interface and thus can be copied and pasted into new DNA with ease.
Each new part, once confirmed, is sent to MIT and physically stored there in the registry. Any other iGEM team can order any Biobrick from the Registry for use in their project, and get physical copies that are easily cultured and can be quickly used, without having to be manufactured by the teams. This open source structure speeds up the research progress significantly and makes great strides in the future of synthetic biology.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#BioBricks_-_-_TEXT.html," tried to modify the receptor by different modification strategies like error prone (random mutagenesis) or specific amino acid changes ( mut1 / mut2 ). The constructs mut1 and mut2 were done by an in silico approach. Unfortunately they did not work as expected. In a short period of time we found many positive clones, but further analysis indicated that the VirA receptor was changed to constitutive activity. Thereby, due to the short time available, we did not manage to construct a receptor that was specific for other phenolic substance, e.g. capsaicin.
We tried to create a light signal that is visible to the human eye as another part of our project. So genetic amplifiers ( Cambridge, iGEM 2007, amplifier project ) were added to our luciferase BioBrick. This amplified luciferase readout was coupled with the VirA/G signaling system in order to visualize the induction behaviour. The amplifiers worked so far and gave a visible luciferase readout but the basal expression of the vir promoter was also amplified so the induced status of the VirA/G system was not discriminable properly from the uninduced status.
We entered the following BioBricks to the partsregistry:

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343007_-_-_TEXT.html," find out which. This lead us to our next experiment, which was intended for determining what happened to the tumbling frequency:
Videomicroscopy and computer analysis of bacterial motility
To get an exact idea of what is happening to the bacteria expressing the photosensor we decided on doing video microscopy of motile bacteria. The bacterial cultures were prepared according to protocol PS1.1 . Wildtype MG1655 and DH5alpha was used as controls.  The actual microscopy was done on a Nikon eclipse TE2000-S microscope with an optical magnification of 1000x.
To be able to observe an effect in the modified bacteria we had to expose the cultures to light, which was done through the microscope's integrated light source, which could switch between blue, green and ambient light. To ensure that the blue light was at the correct wavelength the same optical filter that was used for the plate experiments was inserted between the lightsource and the microscopy slide. Since microscopy is impossible without light, we had to use red light as a replacement for darkness, the source of the red light was ambient light from the microscope's light source filtered through a red optical filter (about 580nm). This should not have any effect on the phototactic bacteria according to [ 2 ]. The room where the experiment was carried out was kept as dark as possible, as to eliminate the chance of the phototactic bacteria being exposed to light. The actual experiment was carried out in the following manner:
Expose bacteria to red light for 1 minute, while recording video.
Move to another spot on the slide, repeat 1. (repeated until 5 videos were recorded)
Expose bacteria to blue light for 1 minute, while recording video.
Wait for 30 seconds, for the bacteria to reset themselves.
Move the focus to another spot on the slide, repeat 3. (x5)
This was done with all three strains of bacteria.
An example of the results:
When played at real time speed these videos seem slow and not showing any tendency, though when played at 4 times the normal speed, the photosensor containing bacteria seem to show slightly increased motility when exposed to blue light. Even though the bacteria displayed disappointing motility, we went on and did computer analysis on the videos by the help of the open source software ""CellTrack"" . The paths that were mapped showed a longer traveling distance for the bacteria expressing the photosensor compared to the rest of the samples when exposed to blue light. We picked 10 bacteria from each sample, which amounts to 60 bacteria that were tracked. This is a rather small amount, but"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"onds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.
Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.

In our project, we want to produce enterobactin. Then we focus on the 6 enzymes (EntA, EntB, EntC, EntD, EntE and EntF) of it biosynthesis started from chorismic acid. However, we want to produce enterobactin in presence of iron, in order to reduce an excess of iron.
An alternative iron chelator
At the Regional Jamboree, we discussed with Edinburgh team which also work on iron chelation but with another chelator: the ferric ion-binding protein A (FbpA)

Figure 10: Enterobactine production using the Fur-inverter system.
Our goal is to decrease the iron absorption from the intestines to the blood by using an iron chelating bacteria, Iron Coli.
We have design a system that could produce enterobactin from chorimsic acid, under the regulation of an iron sensor with an inverter . When the iron is present in the environment (ie intestine) in high concentration, our Iron Coli will produce siderophores to chelate the iron and hence reduce the amount of iron that could be absorbed by the patient.
We also model enterobactin production of our Iron Coli and the potential efficiency of our treatment to cure iron overload.

3.2 Silence the PDE5A
cGMP is catabolized to 5’GMP by specific members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) superfamily. Our goal to increase cGMP synthesis by overexpressing sGC was achieved, but this may also lead to increased cGMP catabolism through the up-regulation of PDE5A. Thus, we created novel circuit consisting U6 promoter followed by PDE5A shRNA to enhance the effects of sGC overexpression.
3.3 On-Off: Hypoxia-Inducible Promoter
Absolutely,the level of cGMP will be up regulated when we enhance cGMP synthesis and block its degradation at the same time.If the devices “overexpress sGC” and “silence PDE5A” work in myocardium cells overtime,it may lead several bad effects we don’t expect.To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also need a switch to up regulate cGMP only in ischemia or hypoxia situation.
We found that in mammalian cells, there is already a hypoxia-inducible system. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activates transcription via binding to highly variable hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) that are composite regulatory elements comprising the conserved HIF-binding site (HBS) with an A/GCGTG core sequence and a highly variable flanking sequence. Space between HBSs, distance from the core promoter, and orientation of HBSs are all connected with hypoxia-responsive activity. Following these rules, we design a HRE sequence and inserted it into the CMV promoter, ahead of the TATA box. We name the reconstructed CMV promoter as hypoxia-inducible promoter. To examine its function, we test an original CMV promoter submitted by the team Freiburg in 2012 as negative control, BBa_k747096 .Thus, we improved the characterization of a previously existing basic part.

It was an honor for me to work with many hilarious, “hard-working” fellow geniuses. Especially those weekly meetings that end at mid-night, meals time which we make fun out of each other and when the swine flu suddenly hit our lab. Many and many more memorable moments that we shared together throughout the past few months were totally awesome and enjoyable. Hope we shall get some good results this year and ROCK THEM!

I am a year 2 student from the Department of Mathematics of the University of  Hong Kong.  I joined the iGEM team of HKU-BU at the beginning of this summer, and feel great honored to join in the jamboree representing HKU.  As a mathematics students, I have never entered a Biochemistry lab before but  the experience this time has enlighten me a lot. Actually, iGEM is the first time for me to touch the concept of synthetic biology.
Working together with the whole team, under the guidance of instructors, I am able to see my progress day after day.  Those creative ideas in the brainstorm, rigorous spirit of setting controlling, and the ingenious designing of experiment have impressed me and changed my mind significantly.
During the summer, I mainly worked on controlling the speed  of our bacteria-motor, and on measuring the expressing level related to a concentration gradient of the IPTG inducer, by  the method of Western Blotting. Besides, I have tried on knocking out cheZ fragment of E.coli 2443 and spent some time in making bio-brick.
Generally, I have learned a lot in the iGEM and really enjoyed the project.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," issue we addressed this week was the assembly of gene constructs to test ferritin in our system. A tentative strategy plan has been proposed. Coordinating this plan with the TALE and linker teams is necessary to ensure compatibility among the many components of this project. Upon receiving commercially-synthesized genes, we will order primers to use the Golden Gate assembly method.
To test whether the synthesis of magnetoferritin is successful, we must first synthesize it using the method proposed in week 4, where the native ferrihydrite core is converted to apoferritin then magnetite. Using a magnet with a relatively strong pull force (about 50 lbs.), we hope to see the magnetoferritin respond in solution.
We must also confirm the applicability of using ferritin as the Prussian blue reporter system. After generating ferritin with a Prussian blue ferrihydrite core, we will manipulate the core type, pH, coloured substrate, and temperature to test the feasibility of this method. If these tests are futile, we may need to develop an enzymatic reporter that will function in parallel with our system. The necessary materials have been obtained for these experiments, and results will follow shortly.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
In order to use β-lactamase as a potential reporter system it was necessary to use designed primers to PCR out the gene from the backbone of the pSB1A3 plasmid (it is present here as it conveys ampicillin resistance). Three primers were designed in order to retrieve the β-lactamase gene just by itself as well as having it with a His-tag in order to aid with protein purification. After the PCR was performed the resulting DNA was run on a gel to confirm the gene size (Figure 2). This PCR appeared to be successful based on size (900-bp and 927-bp for the β-lactamase and β-lactamase with His-tag respectively) but after sequencing it was determined one of the primers contained a design error resulting in a truncated gene. The primers will be redesigned in order to successfully achieve the extraction of the β-lactamase gene from the pSB1A3 plasmid.
Figure 2. PCR making use of custom primers to extract β-lactamase from the psB1A3 vector. 5 out of the 8 lanes for the β-lactamase extraction display bands at approximately 900-bp which is expected as the part should be 909-bp. All of the lanes for the"

We are currently working in E. coli because it is easy to engineer, but the next step would be to move into a cyanobacteria more closely related to chloroplasts. We hope that by making these initial steps that we may be helping to pave the way for future research that may put an end to world hunger.

Simulating every single trajectory
1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ are seen as a whole in the above model. To make the simulation more convincing, we then simulate the trajectory of every single molecule. After that we synthesize all trajectories to get the final result.
Result
The concentration of Cre-Loxp :
Then we use green line to denote the number of genes which are in the original state and red line to denote the number of genes which are in the state after inversion. 1 trajectory:
10 trajectories:
100 trajectories:
1000 trajectories:
From the result, we can see the process more clearly. From the figure of one trajectory, we can see the inversion is reversible so a gene may reverse a lot when Cre-Loxp exists. And the inversion stops when Cre-Loxp is degraded to zero. From all the figures we can see the randomness decreases when the number of trajectories increases. And finally 50% of the genes become the state we want. In a Continuous markov process, when the state set is finite, there is a stationary distribution:
,and it also satisfies:
(π is the distribution of every state, S is the state set, q is the transition probability ) With this theorem, we can know that after a long time, the distribution of the four states will be stable which could also be seen in the figure of 1000 trajectories.

Southern California iGEM 2015 Meetup
On August 6, our team met with two iGEM teams - La Verne and UCLA - at the first Southern California iGEM meetup held at UCLA.  Our entire team attended along with two of our advisors, Phillip and Bart.  We discussed our projects and our attempts to make iGEM a sustainable program at our respective universities because we are all relatively new teams.  We concluded that fundraising and garnering support from our academic departments were a few obstacles with a significant impact on team establishment.  Also, we considered the possibility of starting a smaller synthetic biology conference in California.  Overall, we had a great time meeting new people over pizza and cookies!
TP_CC San Diego iGEM Team Mentorship
We ended our week by meeting up with seven members of the the Torrey Pines and Canyon Crest San Diego high school iGEM team on September 4.  The team shared with us their project goals and their progress.  We also offered input about several applications that they mentioned.  Both teams talked about our approach to Human Practices, and we informed TP_CC San Diego about how we tackled funding and gained sponsorships from on-campus laboratories and local biotechnology companies.
TP_CC San Diego presented issues they were facing: since minimal research had been done on LbCHI31-chitinase before, they had difficulty mapping the effectiveness of the encoding gene against varied concentrations of purified chitin. A few of us helped troubleshoot. Due to the limited amount of time left, they wanted to run it in silico but did not have experience with modeling.  Therefore, we gave insight on modeling and how the results should relate to laboratory work.
Before they left, one of our team members sent a guide on wiki editing to help expedite the designing process for TP_CC San Diego.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Human_-_-_TEXT.html," is difficult to determine be-cause there are many properties of the method that should be taken into account. Therefore, we also need to establish a system to evaluate the optimum propaganda method within the public eyes.
Our evaluation system
In evaluation a propaganda method, there are at least three perspectives that should be considered: the cost, the speed and the efficiency. However, these three per-spectives are too abstract to evaluate quantitatively. As a result, we established a modeling system to evaluate the propaganda effects with many child evaluation indexes that are measurable and specific, to determine the overall performance of these propagation methods. All the candidate includes: the newspaper, magazine and journal, leaflet, TV advertisement, online picture, online video, lecture, broadcast and oral communication. The system is established as shown in Figure 10.

The inner operating principles: AHP
All the data are obtained from that of questionnaire. And the relative values are transformed through comparison matrix. All the other calculation procedures are flow the previous procedure of AHP method.
Result and discussion
The overall performance grades of the nine propaganda method are listed in the following figure, with the range of grade from 0 to 10.

Cell Density Analysis
We used our analysis software to count the cells in manually-selected focal planes. All of the below images are from data taken with our own hardware and software. We then calculated the volume of the hologram in each case (accounting for magnification, step size and number of steps) and used both to find the number of cells per millilitre. We used the formula: Cells/mL = (D x C x 10-6) / (5122 x N x ((1.12/M)x10-6)3 ); wherein C is the counted number of blobs from the analysis software, D is the dilution number compared with the corroborated sample (e.g. D = 100 for a 1 part in 100 dilution, D = 1 for an undiluted sample), M is the magnification and N is the number of steps between the focal plane being analysed and the closest other plane with focused cells. In most cases N was 150, indicating the whole hologram had only one focused section. We corroborated our values' relevance by comparing to either an optical density reading or a reading from a ThermoFisher Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter.
Confirming Cell Counts
Figure 28: C. reinhardtii: C = 13, D = 10, M = 1, N = 150. The Countess II FL gave a reading of (5.19 x 106) cells/mL. Our calculated value was (2.4 x 106) cells/mL.
Figure 29: C. reinhardtii: C = 113, D = 1, M = 5, N = 150. The Countess II FL gave a reading of (2.03 x 108) cells/mL. Our calculated value was (2.6 x 108) cells/mL.
Figure 30: TAP medium only: C = 10, D = 1, M = 1, N = 150. There are no microorganisms present, the diffraction patterns here are due to dust on the slide. The Countess II FL gave a reading of (1.47 x 104) cells/mL. Our calculated value was (1.8 x 105) cells/mL.
Figure 31: E. coli: C = 10, D = 100, M = 5, N = 150. The foci were slightly misshapen (but still countable) due to misalignment"

Currently microfluidics is actively used for both routine testing and academic researches. It consists of systems that work with small volumes of fluids in the nanoliter/microliter scale, through channels ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers in diameter. Using this system, we can study the collective behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans groups as well as live neuron activities accurately. (Fig. 1)
Fig. 1 A) The whole devices used in microfluidic experiment. B) The pump and microscope used in our experiment. C)The microfluidics and pipes used in our experiment. We use pump with syringe and pipes to inject the flow and worms into microfluidics and use the stereoscopic microscope to observe worms in chips.
In order to observe whether there are any changes in worms’ behavior after incorporating exogenous genes, we need to design a microfluidic system with high throughput and guarantee the worms are in natural conditions. Thus, we design the Gaussian Plate to monitor the changes.
In addition, we want to test live worms’ neuron activities in this system. Therefore, we choose to implement a “semifixed” scheme, and design the Immobilization Chip to meet this goal. Exogenous genes can express well in worms at L4 stage. Thus, we need synchronous worms at L4 stage to get accurate experimental results, and we design the Selection Chip to screen worms.  (Fig. 2)

Interview with MSP Mr Jim Eadie
On Friday 27th September, we sent two team members, Jan and Aleksandra, to conduct an interview with our local MSP (Member of Scottish Parliament), Jim Eadie. Given the upcoming vote on Scotland’s independence from the UK, we felt it would be interesting to hear Mr Eadie’s opinions on how independence would affect Scotland’s Life Sciences industries. Below is a transcript of that interview.
J – Jan
A – Aleksandra
JE – Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) Jim Eadie
J: What is the current view in Scotland regarding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as a part of industrial processes, especially in the context of environmental applications such as waste water treatment?
JE: I don’t actually have advanced notice of that question. It’s a very technical question and I’m not qualified to say much on it.
A: It’s completely understandable.
JE: So I’m not going to just make it up, I’d have to check what the Scottish government has said on that. If we’re talking about GM food production, for example, that is something that the Scottish government has not embraced. I think there is a debate, obviously within the public sphere, about what the benefits and disadvantages of that would be. But I think it’s fair to say that Scotland is not seeking to establish an area of expertise and comparative advantage in that area. I’m sure you could research that area further.
J: Of course, thank you. That was just an introductory question.
A: I think that most people are reluctant to use GMOs as food and in food production.
JE: Yes, but I think there are key stakeholders within society, both in Scotland and the UK, that would be very much in favour of that type of technological and scientific endeavour. I suspect, though I haven’t checked it, that the Royal Society of Edinburgh would be supportive, a lot of the scientific community would be very much in favour [of such developments], but there is a political reluctance, because of the fears that they have about safety. We could possibly"

Second generation:
Pic3
After getting important suggestions during Chongqing human practice we decided to use Metarhizium anisopidae emulsifiable powder on nonwoven fabric instead of oil solution. These give us more possibilities when designing the model. This time we mix the baits with our Metarhizium anisopidae emulsifiable powder and brush them on nonwoven fabric. After that we put it on area C on Pic3. We put the lid on A in Pic3(which constructed by five magnet cubes) so it will form a crevice for the cockroaches to climb in through the gentle slope B on Pic3. You can also give or take the magnet cubes to adjust the height of the crevice according to the actual size of the cockroach in your house. You can also put two magnets each on the top and the bottom to stabilize the model as in Pic4
Pic4
Pros:
1. Also made by acrylic which makes it cheap and light.
2. Totally accord with the living habit of cockroaches makes it function better than the first generation.
3. Customers can adjust the crevice height according to the actual situation to make it function better.
Cons:
1. Not stable enough using the magnet.
2. Acrylic has its own limitations. We can only make two sides of slopes using acrylic but not 360°slope.
So we keep improving it and here comes the final model.
Final generation:
Pic5
After we found Acrylic can no longer fit our needs. We change the material into Polypropylene.         This makes us able to realize our new model.
We also mix baits with Metarhizium anisopidae emulsifiable powder on nonwoven fabric this time and         put them on area A on pic5.  Then screw the lid down as pic6 through the cylinder to form crevices which         is also adjustable. The cockroaches can climb through the slope B on pic5 and get in contact with Metarhizium anisopidae which will lead to death.
Pic6
Pros:
1. Totally accord with the living habit of cockroaches.
2. Adjustable crevice height.
3.360°slope to make the efficiency higher.
4. Much more stable than the second generation.
Cons:
A little expensive when purchase a few amount. But we will try our best to a find a Cooperative manufacturer to make this change.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," no way of making consistent, uniform droplets with the viscous sodium alginate solution. Additionally this chip, like the other
versions, is prone to clogging to due to the mixing of the calcium chloride and sodium alginate solutions, making this chip inefficient to test.
Conclusion
While the chip did not completely work with the final design, we learned about the effects of viscosity on droplet-based microfluidic systems during the four chip iterations and subsequent weeks of testing. If we were to continue this project, the next step would be to perform a more in-depth study of the effects of viscosity on the generation of droplets in microfluidic devices by experimenting with various flow rates and chip geometries.

Our team hosted the Northeastern iGEM Conference (NEGEM) with the BostonU iGEM team. On July 6, 2018, the iGEM teams from Harvard, MIT, UCONN, BostonU Wetlab, and BostonU Hardware teams met at Boston University to present their work and share advice among teams. Each team presented within time constraints of the Jamboree, with 5 minutes allocated to set-up, 20 minutes for the presentation, and 5 minutes for questions. We created feedback forms for each team in order to create a simple and organized method of collecting feedback.
NEGEM gave our teams a great method of obtaining
feedback, networking for potential collaborations and getting Jamboree-like presentation experience.
Serial Dilution
Inspired by the InterLab Study, this series of chips attempts to follow the protocol of running three consecutive 1:20 dilutions followed by a pair of consecutive 1:10 dilutions. These sequences of mixers are then paired with an valve actuated output selection mechanism such that either the third, fourth, or fifth dilutions can be selectively dispensed onto an agar plate. Since the real estate on our desktop CNC milled microfluidic chips is limited, this protocol has been divided into two chips which, when run in tandem, accomplish these specific serial dilutions. The first chip in the system consists of three consecutive mixers, design with flow rates intended to handle the three 1:20 dilutions. The other chip will run the two 1:10 dilutions and the output selection mechanism.
Version 1
This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water."

Safety
Team WorldShaper-Wuhan dedicated a great amount of emphasis on safety. This principle is carried out by our team member as well as our advisors and instructors. We, as a team, understood the potential consequences of poor safety regulations and therefore aim to operate under a thorough and comprehensive guideline.
Lab Rule:
Every member, when operating in Lab, must wear gloves and wear them in the right way to avoid cross contamination.
Proper experimenting attire such as gaggles, close toed shoes, long pants and aprons are required.
Electric equipment should be turned off when not using to avoid fire hazard
No food nor drink in allowed in the laboratory
No horseplay
Phones and laptops should be stored in a safe location to prevent contamination when dealing with bacteria.
Waste should be properly handled and materials safely stored in the corresponding conditions.
All of our team member has been trained in related lab procedure and lab safety to minimize the chance of accident and ensure the safety of the lab. The content of the training includes but not limited to molecular biology, lab procedure, lab techniques, operation of equipment, Lab regulation, personal safety and common solution to possible emergency situations. It is with these steps that we try to ensure the safety of our member and other around us.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#BioPlastic Recycling: PHB_-_-_TEXT.html," sequences were originally from Risk Group 2 (RG2) organisms. We submitted our safety information to iGEM for review. Safety forms were approved on October 2nd, 2013 by the iGEM Safety Committee.
We did not use these organisms only the parts and the final sequences were codon optimised for expression in E. coli.

1.0 P(3HB) Degradation Model▼
The P(3HB) degradation model was built and simulated in MATLAB Simbiology in the similar fashion as that seen in the modelling section of Module 1.  This model encompasses gene expression of PhaZ1 (P(3HB) depolymerase) controlled by a xylose inducible promoter [2] and the kinetics of PhaZ1 degrading the polymer P(3HB) into shorter oligomers or 3HB monomers.
1.1 Ordinary differential equations
Genetic expression and regulation of PhaZ1
Notice that the degradation terms are lacking because the cells are assumed to be in stationary growth.  Therefore, the assumed dominant process by which the mRNA and protein degrade - dilution - is absent.

Personal conversation with Christopher Hirst, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London
Taken from data for xylF in MOPS with 0.4% glucose with extra xylR on the plasmid, however the plasmid is low copy and also the presence of the xylR gene on the plasmid definitely alters the expression level.  Data fitted to Hill equation.  This value was the most accurate we managed to obtain, though a rough one as 3% glucose in LB was used in the expreiment.

Description
GAM1 promoter cloned from the mosquito genomic DNA
The DNA fragment of GAM1 promoter was amplified from gDNA of Aedes aegypti by PCR. The PCR products were cloned onto pSB1C3 vector and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing.
To test the function of GAM1 promoter, the part was assembled with GFP and polyA (Part: BBa_K2543005, GAM1-GFP-polyA/pSB1C3)
Mosquito GAM1 promoter is one of the AMP promoters driven by Toll and IMD signaling and activated by mosquito-borne pathogens
Green fluorescence observed by E. coli challenge
To test the function of the devices, C6/36 cells were transfected with the vectors. And the mosquito cells were challenged with bacteria on 2 days after transfection.
EXPERIMENT
↓ C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓ Cells were transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA vector
↓ E. coli was added on 2 days post-transfection at MOI=10
↓ GFP positive cells and intensity were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope
RESULT
The figure showed ~50% GFP positive cells were present in the existence of E. coli under fluorescence microscope.
GFP induced by both Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria
EXPERIMENT
